I\u0027m not saying how I\u0027ve changed anymore. I\u0027m not saying what I\u0027ve done and what the new me is. I\u0027m not giving no more explanation. \u0027I\u0027ve done it several times, I\u0027ve talked about it. I am just done.\u0027   Later, he said it was \u0027your problem\u0027 if his apologies, which after he stepped down from the Oscars instead of saying sorry, were not accepted. Rose McGowan will plead no contest to a reduced drug charge...Share this article\u0027I\u0027m a good person. If you don\u0027t see that, it\u0027s a problem with you.  I shouldn\u0027t have to prove who I am, I shouldn\u0027t have to prove the levels of love that I am capable of giving. \u0027If anybody out there wants to think that Kevin Hart is such a monster that he wouldn\u0027t love someone because of their choice in life, then all power to \u0027em,\u0027 he said, giving his only promise throughout the interview that he was not  homophobic as accused. \u0027I am not over-delivering it, I am not overproving it because you find yourself in a position where it still won\u0027t be received and you go, What else do you want?                              I\u0027m a good person.

You want my arms?\u0027 he went on. He would not agree to do the Oscars again, he said, because there was now not enough time left for him to prepare. The Awards are being held on February 24, six weeks from now. \u0027I am not hosting the Oscars this year... right now, from a time perspective, I don\u0027t have the time. \u0027You\u0027re talking about two weeks that I would have to prepare,\u0027 he said.  \u0027I like to call myself a perfectionist. I would want to make sure the production is a great representation of me and my talent.   \u0027I can\u0027t do it this year, it\u0027s not going to happen, in the future if it does it does but it\u0027s not the conversation of today.\u0027 Hart said that the backlash Ellen DeGeneres received for supporting him proved that there was \u0027no ending\u0027. \u0027If you keep feeding this energy, then it\u0027s going to grow,\u0027 he said.            Unamused: Hart was stern as he repeatedly told host Michael Strahan that he would not apologize again for his remarks or explain how he had changed On Tuesday, Hart said the chances of him taking the gig were \u0027very slim\u0027 as he was confronted by photographers while promoting his new film, The Upside, but teased that an announcement may be imminent. \u0027I\u0027m not gonna say anything, and I\u0027m definitely got gonna say it here, but the chances are very slim,\u0027 he said, adding: \u0027I love the Academy, I love everybody that\u0027s involved with the process of building the Oscars and making it. \u0027This year was just a tricky year, so maybe in the future it\u0027ll work out.\u0027   Hart was named as the host of the 91st Academy Awards in December. He took proudly to social media afterwards to announce it but his elation was short-lived. Within days, Twitter users had unearthed his old tweets and demanded that he be removed. Among them were posts where he labeled people \u0027f**gs\u0027 and jokes about what he would do if his son came out as gay. Despite the backlash, Hart refused to apologize and instead quit over the controversy, blindsiding the Academy and leaving them without a host. He said the Oscars gave him an ultimatum apologize or give up the gig. He chose the latter.            Harts homophobic tweets from 2009 - 2011 resurfaced last month after he was given the gig. He deleted them years ago           Hart later appeared on Ellen where she defended him and called for him to get the job back. Her comments enraged the LGBTQ community In Instagram posts afterwards, he said he had already addressed the tweets in the past and refused to e back into the discussion, saying instead that it would only seek to \u0027feed the trolls\u0027. Later, he appeared on Ellen where both he and she called for viewers to embrace growth and change. During their interview, she revealed that she had even called the Academy to ask if Hart could still host the show and said she was told he could. Ellen, who has long been an icon in the LGBTQ community, was lampooned for throwing her support behind the comedian afterwards. Hart later came to her defense, saying: \u0027When did we get to the point where we forgot that we all learn, then we all have the ability to grow and with that growth comes a wealth of knowledge.\u0027You can’t change without a understanding of what GROWTH means.\u0027 On Tuesday, he made a frustrated apology on his radio show where he said: \u0027Once again, Kevin Hart apologizes for his remarks that hurt members of the LGBTQ community.\u0027I apologize. I am now moving on from this because I\u0027m just hoping that the apology is accepted.\u0027 A replacement is yet to be named for the February 24 awards show. Among the possibilities organizers were pondering was to go \u0027SNL-style\u0027 with a rotation of presenters. Good Morning America on Twitter: \u0026quotTHIS MORNING: @KevinHart4real joins us LIVE in Times Square.¿ \u0026quot"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2019/01/10/12/053D94F3000007D0-6576589-image-a-161_1547124376027.jpg","title":"Meghan patron National Theatre","story":"    The Duchess of Sussex walks through clothes racks with Lady Juliet Hughes-Hallett, chair of Smart Works, in London today          Meghan, Duchess of Sussex looks at bags with Smart Works charity chair Lady Juliet Hughes-Hallett in West London today          The Duchess of Sussex puts on a bracelet on Patsy Wardally, during her visit to Smart Works charity in West London today      Layer up like Meghan in an oversized coat by Oscar de la RentaFind it at Farfetch!It\u0026#39s back to work for the Duchess of Sussex today, whose first engagement of 2019 is a visit to Smart Works in London.

No words can explain it! The things she chose me - I know it\u0027s me but my self-esteem just shot through the roof.\u0027She\u0027s very down-to-earth, very straightforward and has gorgeous skin! I was watching her tiny little baby bump and I thought \u0027Wow! It\u0027s so small\u0027 as when I was just three months pregnant I was out here – you could see my tummy before you saw me!\u0027She chose me some accessories and asked me if my style was \u0027simple\u0027 or statement\u0027 and I said \u0027simple\u0027.\u0027She picked a chunky black bead bracelet and some pearl and diamond earrings which were very my style.\u0027She asked me how I got involved with Smart Works and I explained that I used to be a plumber but was out of work for a long time - maybe 16 years - due to my kids.\u0027My daughter was diagnosed with autism when she was three and I had to make a decision whether to work or stay at home and look after her. So obviously I stayed at home.\u0027Now she\u0027s nearly 18 so I thought it was time for to do something different. I was referred here in February last year for getting the clothes and applying for jobs.\u0027I got my job with Menzies at Gatwick airport last April, did all the training and was made permanent after I passed all my probation last November.\u0027I feel so exhilarated now I\u0027m back at work - I look forward to going into work. What I look like is so important in my new job as I represent the company and I have to be well groomed.\u0027Smart Works taught me how to dress and gave me so much confidence.\u0027                                                    The Duchess first secretly visited Smart Works last March before the royal wedding, and has been back five times since to help in choosing clothes and coaching for women who have job interviews.Chair Juliet Hughes-Halley said: \u0027She\u0027s been to see us privately a number of times and was very hands-on, not just with the clothes but with the interviews.\u0027She has fantastic empathy and has been helping to coach some of our clients. She\u0027s a natural and has already made a big difference.\u0027It was her office which contacted the charity, which provides women with five high quality pieces of clothing for their interview, one-on-one coaching, a further follow-up session with another outfit and the opportunity to join the Smart Works Network, further developing their professional and personal development.The women are allowed to keep all the clothes, which are suggested from them by stylists and donated both from iniduals and big brands such as Burberry, Whistles, M\u0026ampS, Evans and Hobbs. After she arrived, Meghan sat down with Ms Stephens, Lady Hughes-Hallett, interview coach Marine Novis, dressing volunteer Louise Warner and two Smart Works success stories in Sarah Barrett and Ashoka Davey.Meghan told them: \u0027It\u0027s not just donating your clothes and seeing where they land but really being part of each other\u0027s success stories as women.\u0027So that\u0027s in the tools that you give, the interview prep that\u0027s happening, that every piece of it... you do an edit or decide what you\u0027re going to send to Smart Works.\u0027It\u0027s not just hand-me-downs, it\u0027s saying \u0027OK this is the blazer that I wore that helped me land that interview and I want this to be the piece that helps this woman have that part of her story\u0027 so to know as a woman coming in that you have so many other women believing in you on all the next phases, it\u0027s this piece that makes it so special.\u0027New mother Sarah Barrett, 38, from Islington, North London, told Meghan that the Monsoon coat she was given helped her get a new reception role in her old school.She said: \u0027Coming here gave me the confidence to be able to change my career.\u0027Meghan replied: \u0027It\u0027s amazingly how you feel when you\u0027re in here. It\u0027s one of those things immediately when you come in... is incredible. It turns it around in a second. You come in feeling so low but you\u0027re reminded of your value.\u0027Meghan giggled as Sarah exclaimed: \u0027You feel like royalty!\u0027Ms Barrett continued: \u0027The experience coming here saved me. I wasn\u0027t feeling so good about myself and I came out of here feeling a million dollars.\u0027She also told the Duchess she\u0027d recently had a baby, Grayson, 16 months. \u0027Congratulations\u0027 said Meghan. \u0027And congratulations back to you\u0027 laughed Ms Barrett.Meghan also highlighted how important the interview coaching was.\u0027And in the second phase of it, doing the interview prep is so key, giving all these women the tools to make eye contact, to remind this company why they would be lucky to have them. It\u0027s so key this kind of trading you do to help them feel confident.\u0027Meghan then got hands on with two ladies, Mrs Wardally and 50-year-old Dionne Johnson in the wardrobe room.She told Mrs Wardallyshe \u0027loved\u0027 her first green dress and told her the wrap style was great as \u0027you can play around with it\u0027.Meghan then chose a Hobbs cape coat to go with a different red dress for Patsy, a handbag, bracelet and earrings.Mother-of-three Mrs Wardally had trained as a plumber but had stopped work 16 years ago to look after her autistic daughter.She told the duchess how hard it had been, but Smart Works had helped her land a job at Gatwick airport as a passenger services agent.Ms Stephens said afterwards: \u0027She\u0027s a natural. She\u0027s very empathetic, relates to our clients.

I thought it was great.\u0027When it came to her own outfit revisted a tried-and-tested wardrobe formula as she made her first public appearance of 2019 today.She opted for a £2,600 coat by Oscar de la Renta and a simple £179 black dress from maternity label Hatch for the visit to the headquarters of women\u0027s charity Smart Works in London this morning.The look is strikingly similar to one sported by Meghan on an outing to South Melbourne Beach during their royal tour of Australia, New Zealand, Tonga and Fiji in October last year.                                                      A history of royal patronages dating back to George II as Meghan takes on charity roles (and how Diana ended her links with  100 charities after orce)          The Duchess of Cambridge (pictured at Sandringham on Christmas Day last month) has 17 patronages The Duchess of Sussex has become a fully paid-up member of the royal family by taking on her first patronages.Lending their name and giving their time to charities is an important duty for the Windsors, and the associations often last for decades.The royals are currently patrons or presidents of more 3,000 organisations and charities in total. Meghan\u0027s first four patronages represent a key step for the duchess, who is still in her first year as a newbie royal.According to the royal family\u0027s website: \u0027Royal patronages add status to an organisation, and visits and involvement from a royal patron can often bring much-needed publicity.\u0027Meghan will have been inundated with requests from charities asking for her support since marrying the Duke of Sussex in May. Members of the royal family each receive hundreds of pleas each year.Most royals tends to limit their patronages to a manageable number to allow them to devote enough time to each.The Duchess of Cambridge has 17 and has focused on early intervention for children.The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh have more than 1,000 patronages between them, many of which were inherited from previous monarchs.According to he royal family\u0027s website, the most influential member regarding patronages is still the Queen.\u0027The Queen\u0027s patronage carries the most weight, and Her Majesty receives the most requests for patronages of all the members of the royal family,\u0027 the site says.          Diana, Princess of Wales, made a shock announcement following her orce in 1996, when she ended her links with more than 100 charitiesIn 2016, following her 90th birthday, the Queen stepped down from 25 patronages, including the NSPCC, which was taken over by the Countess of Wessex, and the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club, which went to Kate.          The first recorded patronage was George II\u0027s involvement with the Society of Antiquaries in the 1700sNow she has handed two over to Meghan, with the duchess becoming patron of the National Theatre and the Association of Commonwealth Universities.But the monarch - the nation\u0027s longest reigning sovereign - still has 599 patronages or associations. Philip stepped down as patron or president of more than a dozen organisations when he turned 90 in 2010.He was patron, president or a member of 785 organisations at his retirement in 2017, and continues his association with them behind the scenes.Diana, Princess of Wales, made a shock announcement following her orce in 1996, when she ended her links with more than 100 charities.She resigned her position as patron or president from all but six - Centrepoint, the English National Ballet, the Leprosy Mission, the National Aids Trust, London\u0027s Great Ormond Street Hospital for Sick Children and the Royal Marsden Hospital.Those she stepped down from included Help the Aged, Barnardos, Relate and the Parkinson\u0027s Disease Society.The princess - William and Harry\u0027s mother who died in a car crash in 1997 - said she made her decision \u0027with great sadness\u0027, but wanted to concentrate her efforts on fewer causes.The first recorded patronage was George II\u0027s involvement with the Society of Antiquaries in the 1700s.The organisation was concerned with architectural and art history, conservation and heraldry.It still exists today and and the Queen\u0027s cousin, the Duke of Gloucester, is its patron.Patronages generally reflect a royal\u0027s interests, such as the Duchess of Cornwall, who is president of the National Osteoporosis Society after both her mother and grandmother died due to the brittle bone disease."},{"url":null,"title":"Britain overtakes Germany vegan capital Europe","story":"    Analysis shows  more consumers are completely ditching meat and opting for a vegan diet\u0027I\u0027m afraid of greens now!\u0027: Veganuary comes to a revolting...Battle of the hipsters: Health food café refuses to serve...Share this articleHe added: ‘For a number of years Germany led the world for launches of vegan products.

He chose the latter.            Harts homophobic tweets from 2009 - 2011 resurfaced last month after he was given the gig.

She\u0027s a natural and has already made a big difference.\u0027It was her office which contacted the charity, which provides women with five high quality pieces of clothing for their interview, one-on-one coaching, a further follow-up session with another outfit and the opportunity to join the Smart Works Network, further developing their professional and personal development.The women are allowed to keep all the clothes, which are suggested from them by stylists and donated both from iniduals and big brands such as Burberry, Whistles, M\u0026ampS, Evans and Hobbs. After she arrived, Meghan sat down with Ms Stephens, Lady Hughes-Hallett, interview coach Marine Novis, dressing volunteer Louise Warner and two Smart Works success stories in Sarah Barrett and Ashoka Davey.Meghan told them: \u0027It\u0027s not just donating your clothes and seeing where they land but really being part of each other\u0027s success stories as women.\u0027So that\u0027s in the tools that you give, the interview prep that\u0027s happening, that every piece of it... you do an edit or decide what you\u0027re going to send to Smart Works.\u0027It\u0027s not just hand-me-downs, it\u0027s saying \u0027OK this is the blazer that I wore that helped me land that interview and I want this to be the piece that helps this woman have that part of her story\u0027 so to know as a woman coming in that you have so many other women believing in you on all the next phases, it\u0027s this piece that makes it so special.\u0027New mother Sarah Barrett, 38, from Islington, North London, told Meghan that the Monsoon coat she was given helped her get a new reception role in her old school.She said: \u0027Coming here gave me the confidence to be able to change my career.\u0027Meghan replied: \u0027It\u0027s amazingly how you feel when you\u0027re in here. It\u0027s one of those things immediately when you come in... is incredible. It turns it around in a second. You come in feeling so low but you\u0027re reminded of your value.\u0027Meghan giggled as Sarah exclaimed: \u0027You feel like royalty!\u0027Ms Barrett continued: \u0027The experience coming here saved me. I wasn\u0027t feeling so good about myself and I came out of here feeling a million dollars.\u0027She also told the Duchess she\u0027d recently had a baby, Grayson, 16 months. \u0027Congratulations\u0027 said Meghan. \u0027And congratulations back to you\u0027 laughed Ms Barrett.Meghan also highlighted how important the interview coaching was.\u0027And in the second phase of it, doing the interview prep is so key, giving all these women the tools to make eye contact, to remind this company why they would be lucky to have them. It\u0027s so key this kind of trading you do to help them feel confident.\u0027Meghan then got hands on with two ladies, Mrs Wardally and 50-year-old Dionne Johnson in the wardrobe room.She told Mrs Wardallyshe \u0027loved\u0027 her first green dress and told her the wrap style was great as \u0027you can play around with it\u0027.Meghan then chose a Hobbs cape coat to go with a different red dress for Patsy, a handbag, bracelet and earrings.Mother-of-three Mrs Wardally had trained as a plumber but had stopped work 16 years ago to look after her autistic daughter.She told the duchess how hard it had been, but Smart Works had helped her land a job at Gatwick airport as a passenger services agent.Ms Stephens said afterwards: \u0027She\u0027s a natural. She\u0027s very empathetic, relates to our clients. She\u0027s very relaxed and puts everyone at ease and offers great advice as well.     Lady Juliet Hughes-Hallett (left), chair of Smart Works, and Kate Stephens (right), its chief executive, welcome Meghan today       Meghan joins a discussion at Smart Works with volunteers and women the charity has helped succeed in job interviewsThe Duchess of Sussex, who is expecting her first child, was met at her car by Smart Works chief executive Kate Stephens      Pregnant Meghan revealed that a woman had rejected a purse that she had donated to a charity that clothes vulnerable women on ThursdayAndy Murray breaks down as he announces retirementRees-Mogg says he\u0027ll be surprised if Brexit deal goes through.Uncle of fatally stabbed teen posts moving tribute videoLawyer whose firm sued MoD accused of being dishonestCorbyn demands General Election if PM loses Brexit showdownMay: \u0027The only way to avoid no-deal is to vote for the deal\u0027Missing teen Jayme Closs has been found alive in WisconsinDuchess Meghan shows off growing bump in black dressJeff Bezos\u0027 orce could affect his fortune and Amazon controlHungary\u0027s PM calls for \u0027anti-immigrant forces\u0027 to take over EUFiona Bruce asks MP James Cleverly to \u0027stop talking\u0027Andy Murray breaks down as he announces retirementRees-Mogg says he\u0027ll be surprised if Brexit deal goes through.Uncle of fatally stabbed teen posts moving tribute videoLawyer whose firm sued MoD accused of being dishonestCorbyn demands General Election if PM loses Brexit showdownMay: \u0027The only way to avoid no-deal is to vote for the deal\u0027Missing teen Jayme Closs has been found alive in WisconsinDuchess Meghan shows off growing bump in black dressJeff Bezos\u0027 orce could affect his fortune and Amazon controlHungary\u0027s PM calls for \u0027anti-immigrant forces\u0027 to take over EUFiona Bruce asks MP James Cleverly to \u0027stop talking\u0027While picking out an outfit for a visitor today Meghan said: \u0027The last time I was here I suggested a purse to someone.\u0027It was one that I donated and she didn\u0027t like and I was like \u0027oh OK\u0027.

Meghan\u0027s first four patronages represent a key step for the duchess, who is still in her first year as a newbie royal.According to the royal family\u0027s website: \u0027Royal patronages add status to an organisation, and visits and involvement from a royal patron can often bring much-needed publicity.\u0027Meghan will have been inundated with requests from charities asking for her support since marrying the Duke of Sussex in May. Members of the royal family each receive hundreds of pleas each year.Most royals tends to limit their patronages to a manageable number to allow them to devote enough time to each.The Duchess of Cambridge has 17 and has focused on early intervention for children.The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh have more than 1,000 patronages between them, many of which were inherited from previous monarchs.According to he royal family\u0027s website, the most influential member regarding patronages is still the Queen.\u0027The Queen\u0027s patronage carries the most weight, and Her Majesty receives the most requests for patronages of all the members of the royal family,\u0027 the site says.          Diana, Princess of Wales, made a shock announcement following her orce in 1996, when she ended her links with more than 100 charitiesIn 2016, following her 90th birthday, the Queen stepped down from 25 patronages, including the NSPCC, which was taken over by the Countess of Wessex, and the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club, which went to Kate.          The first recorded patronage was George II\u0027s involvement with the Society of Antiquaries in the 1700sNow she has handed two over to Meghan, with the duchess becoming patron of the National Theatre and the Association of Commonwealth Universities.But the monarch - the nation\u0027s longest reigning sovereign - still has 599 patronages or associations. Philip stepped down as patron or president of more than a dozen organisations when he turned 90 in 2010.He was patron, president or a member of 785 organisations at his retirement in 2017, and continues his association with them behind the scenes.Diana, Princess of Wales, made a shock announcement following her orce in 1996, when she ended her links with more than 100 charities.She resigned her position as patron or president from all but six - Centrepoint, the English National Ballet, the Leprosy Mission, the National Aids Trust, London\u0027s Great Ormond Street Hospital for Sick Children and the Royal Marsden Hospital.Those she stepped down from included Help the Aged, Barnardos, Relate and the Parkinson\u0027s Disease Society.The princess - William and Harry\u0027s mother who died in a car crash in 1997 - said she made her decision \u0027with great sadness\u0027, but wanted to concentrate her efforts on fewer causes.The first recorded patronage was George II\u0027s involvement with the Society of Antiquaries in the 1700s.The organisation was concerned with architectural and art history, conservation and heraldry.It still exists today and and the Queen\u0027s cousin, the Duke of Gloucester, is its patron.Patronages generally reflect a royal\u0027s interests, such as the Duchess of Cornwall, who is president of the National Osteoporosis Society after both her mother and grandmother died due to the brittle bone disease."},{"url":null,"title":"More half mothers giving birth aged 30 over","story":"    Just 20,358 mothers who gave birth in 2017 were 19 years-old or under - the lowest since records began in 1938 (pictured)          Over half of mothers who gave birth last year were aged 30 or over as women wait longer to have babies, figures out today reveal (pictured,graph of the average age of mothers in 2017)May \u0027faces biggest Commons defeat EVER on her Brexit deal\u0027:...Share this articleThe ONS said: \u0027A long-term rise has been recorded since 1975 in the average ages of mothers and fathers reflecting trends to delay childbearing to later ages.\u0027Many women are waiting to establish their careers before they choose to settle down and have babies.While others spend longer searching for \u0027Mr Right\u0027 before they want to commit to having a child with their other half.Last year, some 329 women aged 49 or over had a baby, while 1,876 women aged between 45 and 48 gave birth.The average age of fathers has also gone up, with 69 per cent of dads aged 30 or over - up from 65 per cent a decade ago and 60 per cent in 1997. Older mothers are the most likely to have a stillbirth at 6.1 per thousand - lower than the 7.7 a decade ago and the rate of 10.3 in 1997.Office for National Statistics Privacy PolicyThe ONS said: \u0027The stillbirth rate was significantly higher in the most deprived areas (based on mothers’ usual residence) compared with the least deprived areas in England in 2017.\u0027In England, the stillbirth rate in the most deprived areas was 5.5 per 1,000 total births, compared with 3.0 per 1,000 total births in the least deprived areas.\u0027The annual figures also reveal the most popular days to be born - with September the busiest month.The ONS said: \u0027A peak in births in late September shows that more babies are conceived in the weeks leading up to and the days after Christmas than at any other time of the year.\u0027Eight of the top ten dates of birth were towards the end of September, with 26 September being the most popular over the period 1995 to 2017.\u0027The least popular date of birth from 1995 to 2017 was Boxing Day, followed by Christmas Day, with, on average, 1,357 and 1,425 live births respectively. "},{"url":null,"title":"Aerial images Soho Farmhouse Cotswolds Oxfordshire piglet cabins pigsty above","story":"    The Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s favourite countryside getaway Soho Farmhouse includes \u0027piglet rooms\u0027 (pictured from above) converted from old pig sties.

He came a distant third with 23.8 percent of the vote.Runner-up and opposition rival Martin Fayulu, who was awarded 34.8 percent of the vote, immediately called foul on the result, decrying \u0027an electoral coup.\u0027  He alleges that Kabila engineered a backroom deal with the largely untested Tshisekedi to protect his power base in a country with staggering mineral wealth.   Outgoing leader Joseph Kabila (left) and opposition candidate Martin Fayulu (right) cast their ballots on December 30          Supporters of DR Congo\u0027s opposition leader Felix Tshisekedi celebrate in the capital, Kinshasa, on January 10 after he was declared the winner by the electoral commissionAn outspoken campaigner against DR Congo\u0027s widespread graft - it ranked 161th among 180 countries in Transparency International\u0027s latest index - Fayulu denounced the official results as \u0027robbery\u0027, calling on people to \u0027rise as one man to protect victory.\u0027As night fell, scores of police with automatic rifles and tear gas launchers were positioned along a road in Kinshasa leading to the Kingabwa neighborhood, a Fayulu stronghold. One vehicle was filled with military personnel in combat gear.Some protest violence was reported in Kikwit, another Fayulu stronghold, where police said three people were killed.

Long in the shadow of his father, the late opposition leader Etienne Tshisekedi, he startled DR Congo last year by breaking away from the opposition\u0027s unity candidate, Fayulu, to stand on his own.          Pierre Englebert, a fellow at the Atlantic Council\u0027s Africa Center, said Tshisekedi won because he \u0027positioned himself to bargain with the regime\u0027Fayulu, a former Exxon manager and Kinshasa lawmaker, was a vocal activist during the two-year delay in DR Congo\u0027s election, insisting it was time for Kabila to go. He was backed by two popular opposition leaders barred by the government from running.Even before the election announcement, some observers suggested that Kabila\u0027s government might make a deal with Tshisekedi as hopes faded for ruling party candidate Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary.Many Congolese objected to Shadary, suspecting that he would allow Kabila to continue to rule from behind the scenes and protect his vast assets.Several DR Congo analysts agreed that it appeared Kabila made a quiet agreement with Tshisekedi, saying Fayulu would have posed more of a threat.\u0027If Fayulu and his allies, with their own independent security and financial networks, had taken power they would have changed the power structure of DR Congo and definitively ousted Kabila and his clan,\u0027 said Patrick Smith of the newsletter Africa Confidential. \u0027Tshisekedi, with his weaker network, looks like being the junior partner in his accommodation with the Kabila establishment.\u0027          People celebrate after Felix Tshisekedi was named the provisional winner of a long-awaited presidential poll paving the way for the crisis-hit country\u0027s first transfer of power in 18 yearsPierre Englebert, a fellow at the Atlantic Council\u0027s Africa Center, said Tshisekedi would be more malleable and might allow Kabila\u0027s network to continue.\u0027One possibility for today\u0027s result is that once the regime saw the catastrophic mistake Kabila had made by nominating Shadary, it scrambled to come up with a Plan B. Enter Tshisekedi,\u0027 Englebert wrote in an analysis . Tshisekedi \u0027has wavered at times in his opposition to the regime and is far from having his late father\u0027s intransigence.\u0027By breaking away from the opposition coalition supporting Fayulu, Tshisekedi \u0027positioned himself to bargain with the regime,\u0027 Englebert wrote. \u0027But if the history of the Kabila regime and its tight control on the state and its security apparatus are any indication, the ... new president-elect is likely to end up on the losing end of this bargain.\u0027          A billboard of DR Congo\u0027s outgoing President Joseph Kabila that was burned by supporters of the opposition leader Felix Tshisekedi in Limete, Kinshasa Western powers appeared wary. Britain\u0027s foreign secretary said he was \u0027very concerned about discrepancies\u0027 in DR Congo\u0027s results, adding that the United Nations Security Council would discuss the matter on Friday. France\u0027s foreign minister bluntly cast doubt on the official results and Belgium\u0027s foreign minister expressed concern.The delayed results, 10 days after the December 30 vote, came after international pressure to announce an outcome that reflected the will of the people, with the U.S. threatening sanctions.The largely peaceful election faced numerous problems as many voting machines that DR Congo used for the first time malfunctioned. Dozens of polling centers opened hours late as materials went missing. Most alarming to many Congolese, some 1 million of the country\u0027s 40 million voters were barred from participating, with the electoral commission blaming a deadly Ebola virus outbreak.The difference between Tshisekedi and Fayulu in official results was some 684,000 votes. Some observers said the barred voters could have made the difference.DR Congo\u0027s government cut internet service the day after the vote to prevent speculation on social media. It remained off in parts of the country on Thursday.          The provisional result announced early on 10 January placed Tshisekedi ahead of the ruling party candidate Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary and his rival opposition candidate Martin Fayulu. Fayulu immediately denounced it as an \u0027electoral coup\u0027Some Congolese, weary of Kabila\u0027s 18-year rule, the two turbulent years of election delays and years of conflict that killed millions said they simply wanted peace. Some said they would be happy as long as Fayulu or Tshisekedi won, recalling the violence that followed past disputed elections.Kabila has ruled since 2001 in the troubled nation rich in the minerals key to smartphones around the world. He is barred from serving three consecutive terms, but until he announced last year that he would step aside many Congolese feared he\u0027d find a way to stay in office.Now DR Congo faces a new leader who is little known after spending many years in Belgium and standing behind his outspoken father. The 56-year-old Tshisekedi took over as head of DR Congo\u0027s most prominent opposition party in early 2018, a year after his father\u0027s death.Gleeful Tshisekedi supporters who took to the streets in Kinshasa to celebrate said they were happy to see Kabila step down.\u0027This is the coronation of a lifetime,\u0027 said the deputy secretary-general of Tshisekedi\u0027s party, Rubens Mikindo. \u0027This is the beginning of national reconciliation.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Mystery donor hands 500 000 worth designer clothes online charity shop","story":"    A mystery donor has handed £500,000 worth of designer clothes, bags and 400 pair of shoes to an online charity shop.

Not at her perkiest, was Emily. Shades of Leonid Brezhnev after a night on the marching juice. In the opening shot Bruce was standing next to the audience. We were spared further walkabouts, thank goodness. One of the good things about this new series is that they have not gone mad with innovations. The format is pretty much unchanged.Having a woman in the chair helped the gender balance. Last night’s show had four women – host Bruce, Thornberry, Lib Dem MP Jo Swinson and newspaper columnist Melanie Phillips – and two men. Some things are harder to change (or perhaps they don’t want to try). Only two members of the panel were Brexiteers. The old Establishment-Remain bias is deep-set.‘No one can replace David Dimbleby but I want her to win!’...How Fiona Bruce played hardball for her Question Time pay...EuroMillions winner who scooped £115m jackpot with her...Share this articleOne hour and just two topics: things became a bit bogged down. We had Brexit, Brexit, Brexit – much of it focusing on Thornberry – and then a quarter of an hour on knife crime. That choice was presumably down to the editors and producers but Madam Chairman Bruce should be encouraged to become a lot more brutal when it comes to telling people to shut up. That applies to members of the audience, too. A man with a hat became a frightful bore and could have been zapped at the end of his first round of applause.Dimbleby used to let panellists have their opening say pretty much uninterrupted but Bruce jumped in quickly to question Tory MP James Cleverly while he was giving the programme’s first answer (to the question ‘has the Government lost control of the Brexit process?’). Time and again she chased Cleverly and Thornberry, pinning them down when they were being slippery.Such pursuit of the truth is fine up to a point but you have to let panel members actually make their initial points. As a result of the verbosity and the interruptions it was something like 17 minutes before one of them – a stand-up comedian called Nish Kumar – actually said a word.          The hose clashed with Emily Thornberry over whether Labour should be backing a people\u0027s voteMind you, when he did start spouting forth, one rather felt he might have been better advised to remain completely schtum for the duration. A simplistic, shouty sort. He tried attacking Phillips for criticising the Macpherson report on the police.Bruce’s best decision of the night was to let Phillips have a counterblast and it produced a scintillating moment when Phillips comprehensively flattened Kumar, asking him if he had read the report. Er, he hadn’t. Oops.During one of Thornberry’s orations, Bruce pointed out that the audience was laughing at her evasions. During one of Cleverly’s flannelings, she intervened to say she was ‘still waiting’ to hear what his Brexit Plan B was.These added to the saltiness of the programme but they arguably went a little beyond what a proper BBC debate chairman should do. And her sarcasm when she commented on an audience member’s remark about Brexit’s ‘sunlit uplands’ left a faint tang, too.But on the whole this was a pretty decent first bash. She controlled the nerves she must surely have been feeling and she proved a lot more objective and charming at chairing a debate than that bloke Bercow. "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6f12698c1fa12eb9c9c1cfce82581bfcbe34092f/0_0_3000_2104/master/3000.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=347b607014acb06f833a36eab0ef3812 480w","title":"your favourite independent bookshops i want my ashes scattered in the fiction section","story":"Whether you like friendly staff or Bernard Black-types, beautiful shops or tiny treasure troves, here is a selection of your most loved bookshops around the worldOwner Albie has a prodigious memory. For that reason he sees no necessity to maintain physical order. So the shop is a towering mass of books, and being so small you can only fit two people in the shop. One of the two aisles is permanently blocked by bookfall. If you buy something he’ll give you a “I Survived Albie’s bookshop” certificate. I’ve asked him for certain publications a few times and he does memorise his catalog with excellent recall.Ben, HertfordshireI love that this bookshop prides itself on carrying radical and progressive books. I have never been in without making a wonderful discovery. If it’s quiet, the lovely staff offer you a cuppa as soon as you walk in the door, but they’re also happy to leave you to peruse. Also there are sometimes doggos in there!Bonnie, EdinburghIts become an unlikely tourist spot. Upon entry you are confronted by the smell of old books which everyone loves. In the centre is a blazing hearth and stacked up all around are twice as many books as you can imagine a place of the size to have. Shelves are overflowing, every nook and cranny is occupied. Aesthetics aside, what I truly love about it is the hidden gems, books you never would have otherwise found and are no longer sold in high street bookstores, if ever.Gareth, InvernessAn fabulously atmospheric and well-stocked shop spread over two and half floors with a huge and varied selection of used and antiquarian books. Run by the extremely knowledgeable owner Anthony Smithson and his friendly and obliging staff. Nothing is too much trouble whether buying or selling or just offering advice. Anthony’s local history section is second to none, making him an important cog in the community.David, North ShieldsAn absolute treasure trove of books. I should declare an interest here I have been a volunteer at the bookshop for a good decade. I turned up one day looking for books by HP Lovecraft and never left! I know a good thing when I see it.Charlie, NorthumberlandFabulous, heaven of a place, as beautiful as it is well-stocked. It’s full of well chosen, well displayed books of every description. Ostensibly a travel bookshop, they have two whole rooms devoted to guides, books about and books by authors from, every country in the world. The rest of the two buildings have fiction, crime, gardening, cookery, fashion, poetry, history, current events and a superb children’s section. I’m probably missing out something but the knowledgeable and helpful staff could order anything for you. It’s the bookshop booklovers dream about. When I die I want my ashes scattered in their fiction section.Anonymous, LondonIt’s a very friendly, very lively place. There’s a good selection of books on offer, a great service if they need to order something in and usually tasty treats at the till (in return for a charity donation). The shop is much valued by the local community. I recognise the fact that if you want these places to survive, you need to support them. To that end, I have dumped my Kindle and have reverted to the old fashioned ways.Jeff, KenilworthEly is our local. Beautiful store, huge range of books, very welcoming and knowledgeable staff, a real community spirit developed through relationships and massively built through their amazing author talks held in local churches, halls and sometimes the cathedral. I LOVE this shop and don’t know what Ely would be like without it. We’ve considered moving away from Ely a couple of times … but I kid ye not when I say that the fact of Topping and Company has kept us there.Ian, ElyI visit Mr B’s each time I go to Bath and find it to be the most soothing, relaxing space. The children’s section as you go into the shop is really charming. Upstairs, they have created really tranquil spaces to browse and read in and the selection of titles they have is very comprehensive. The staff are incredibly friendly without being overbearing, and I have never felt pressured into purchasing anything - though I always do because their stock is so brilliant.Daisy, LondonThe staff are what make it. My boyfriend bought me a ‘reading spa’ for Christmas one year: two hours sitting by the fire talking to a knowledgeable member of staff about my literary tastes and his favourites. Two coffees, a slice of cake and about 25 book recommendations later I went home with seven hand-picked books and a list of what to look for next.Liz, BristolThis shop is part of my life. I remember visiting all the time as a small child and loving the fact that the chairs were small, the tables low and you could read the books in the children’s section whilst your parents were in the rest of the shop. Then as I grew up, I continued to purchase books as the team were so good at recommendations and would order in specific books. I now live away from the area but every time I go home, I pay a visit to the Book House for old times’ sake. This shop is integral to the town and does so much for the community.Anonymous, TeddingtonMoored on the canal, this lovely shop plays jazz and has a seating area by the water. It’s quirky, friendly and had to fight very hard to not be driven off the waterways by local authorities and the Canal and River Trust. I remember finding the exact title I was looking for while watching a couple dance to jazz music in the sunshine with a swan attempting to join in (or maybe just bite them it wasn’t clear!)Cassi, BanburyIt always helps draw us towards Derbyshire: after a morning on the hills (or if it’s raining) this is the perfect bookshop. It sells new and secondhand books on three floors, well-ordered, always open, friendly staff, and whole rooms dedicated to music and to children. And it has the best cafe (even better than Barter Books in Northumberland!) hidden behind a moving bookcase serving generous portions and lashings of tea all day long, where you can sit and ponder how to whittle down the 10 books you’ve found to a manageable five.Michael, south LondonBooka is my happy place. The shop is light, bright and airy and the books are always beautifully displayed. I can browse for hours in there and I always find something unusual - the shop runs a lot of different book clubs and events so there’s always an eclectic selection of titles and genres, as opposed to just the usual big hitters. The staff are friendly and knowledgeable and their author events are fantastic - I’ve been to see Jodi Picoult, Matt Haig, Imogen Hermes Gower, and Eowyn Ivey and they’ve all been fabulous, insightful evenings. Plus there’s a lovely cafe with locally made cakes, and the shop sells some really unusual gifts and cards too - so it’s perfect for choosing presents!Amy, StaffordshireIt’s hidden away down an alley just 30 seconds from the city hall but absolutely worth seeking out. Five Leaves has a marvellous selection of radical and broadly less commercial books and poetry. It’s a work of love, and arouses strong loyalty among the shop’s customers.Andrew, LondonThe lady who runs the shop is deliciously sarcastic and caustic. Like a real-life female version of Bernard Black. The shop is full of charm, with books piled high across a table in the middle as well as bookshelves from floor to ceiling brimming with them too.Anonymous, DerbyshireBookmarks has been my go-to bookshop for history, political theory and politics for the last 40 years. While much of the rest of the independent (socialist and progressive) bookshop network has disappeared, the imagination and enthusiasm of the shop has been inspirational. Long may they prosper, long may they continue to persuade me to spend too much money!Richard, ExeterI found it by accident many years ago while looking for some lunch near the British Museum. I spent over an hour in there and bought several books, and completely forgot about lunch.David, HerefordIt was set up when the town’s last independent bookshop closed and is staffed by a team of people who really love books. They have a small but amazing range of titles which they have often read themselves and there are always unusual books on display. The shop has shareholders from the community and, although it is tiny, lots of community events are held there. There is also a tiny cafe in it, which has amazing homemade cake and coffee - a great place to meet friends and talk books. It has a great vibe – you don’t get that with online shopping!Karen, MalvernThe very fact that it exists and flourishes and has even expanded in past few years shows how much support and love there is locally for independent bookshops … The staff are friendly, knowledgeable and set out great displays. Books are easy to order and they also have gorgeous stationery. It’s a treasury of joy and wonders!Anonymous, PenzanceOctober Books is a bookshop with values. As well as mainstream books, it promotes books that give voice to marginalised groups and causes, and also sells fair trade and sustainable food and household products. It holds events to promote and discuss certain books, raising the profile and encouraging people to come together and discuss issues. It’s run as a cooperative, and has weathered the storm of capitalism for decades, sticking to values of equality and justice. It is firmly supported by local people, shown when OB was supported in buying premises when rents got too high - this faith in the local community is typical of OB.Jacquie, SouthhamptonIt’s the beating heart of liberal America - as metaphorically as far from Trump as you can get. It has a great range of subjects chosen by excellent subject experts (including their music section), it has a great speaker program and the cafe serves a delicious lemon drizzle cake.Nigel, WashingtonA beautiful treasure trove of secondhand, new and rare books in the heart of Fitzroy. The owner is incredibly knowledgeable about books and will always recommend something that is perfect going on your recent or favourite reads. And there is the most incredible fashion room at the back of the shop - full of rare and beautiful fashion editions - a must for any fashion  luxury lover!Anna, MelbourneThis splendorous bookshop is located in a central area of Buenos Aires. It used to be a majestic cinema I saw movies as a teenager there back in the eighties … Long since it has become a magnificent bookshop. You can find all kinds of books and music there. Buenos Aires would still be the pride of Borges: so full of beautiful little bookstores, many of which, like a speakeasy, you need to be taken to by a friend. You might have walked past a thousand times without realising on the outside, the oasis within. There won’t be a sign or window, just an ordinary door and a bell.Helen, Buenos AiresIt’s exactly what the perfect bookshop should be like. A vast selection of brilliant books sections on just about every topic you can think of the occasional chair you can relax in and read a magical “non linear” structure and the following message on the stairs: ‘I wish I could show you when you are lonely or in darkness the astonishing light of your own being’.Symon, HertfordshireThere is a formidable selection of new books on the ground floor, while the first floor is dedicated to secondhand and remaindered books. It is extremely well-organised and books are very reasonably priced. There are plenty of first editions and old paperbacks. There is a well-stocked selection of Irish authors, books ‘as gaeilge’ and a foreign languages section. There is no café, so the experience is really all about the browsing and buying.Alan, DublinIt’s small, but not too small, big enough to contain a surprising number of books that I’ve never come across before - especially books about South Africa. The staff are few but knowledgeable and do not hassle. Sometimes you will encounter friends there but also quite curious strangers!Anonymous, Johannesburg"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53adbc1a6911f1758f6b3dbe643599aec15b26b1/0_376_1581_948/master/1581.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c4a18edc76807a66a5cd728c46293f1","title":"tips links and suggestions what are you reading this week","story":"Your space to discuss the books you are reading and what you think of them Welcome to this week’s blogpost. Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from the last two weeks, just a small selection from the bumper crop of end of year lists that you’ve posted over the holiday period. The breadth and depth of reading on display has been most impressive. Plenty of wisdom has also been garnered from those books, as Rick2016 demonstrates:Of the 45 books I read this year (which most people think is a lot but pales in comparison to many of the people in this forest!), the standouts were the following (roughly in order):Vikram Seth - A Suitable BoyRichard Powers - The OverstoryDavid Park - Travelling in a Strange LandGraham Greene - The Quiet AmericanMargaret Atwood - The Handmaid’s TaleJL Carr - A Month in the CountryJohn le Carré - The Spy Who Came in from the ColdSomerset Maugham - Of Human BondageLima Barreto - The Sad End of Policarpo QuaresmaEdward St Aubyn - Never MindTatiana Salem Levy - The House at SmyrnaPenelope Lively - Moon TigerLooking at my reading this year, I learned three things:1. It’s good to make the time to read those long novels that I keep meaning to read. Some, like A Suitable Boy would have been worth it if they had been twice as long.2. Having a perception of an author’s style through hearsay, or even reading only one of their books, isn’t the same as actually reading them properly. Greene, le Carré, Atwood, Dickens and others turned out to be far richer experiences than I expected.3. TLS is an absolute goldmine for recommendations. I knew that already but there are several books that I loved this year that I would never have read if it weren’t for you folks’ advocacy. So thank you so much.Here’s another 2018 summary, from interwar:Putting together my annual list was a great reminder of so many hours well spent. My 20 ‘most rewarding reads’ of 2018 include fiction only, and I’m well aware that some of my choices directly contradict others’ judgements. Note that by ‘most rewarding’ I don’t necessarily mean most enjoyable. Mostly these were books that made me think and stretched my imagination.Four were re-reads:Wilkie Collins, The MoonstoneE M Forster, A Passage to IndiaR K Narayan, The World of NagarajOscar Wilde, The Picture of Dorian GrayTen were translations:Shusako Endo, VolcanoWolfgang Hilbig, Old Rendering PlantIsmaiil Kadare, The Traitor’s NicheWalter Kempowski, HomelandLaszlo Krasznahorkai, The World Goes OnAyiyujo Nosaka, The Cake Tree in the RuinsOrhan Pamuk, SnowAhmed Saadawi, Frankenstein in BaghdadJose Saramago, The Elephant’s JourneyMario Vargas Llosa, The StorytellerAnd the rest:Elizabeth Bowen, The Last SeptemberRoland Camberton, Rain on the PavementsGabriel Jiosipovicii, The Cemetery in BarnesPhilip Larkin, A Girl in WinterWilliam Maxwell, The Folded LeafAlex Pheby, LuciaI could have included dozens more lists of similar quality – although. it should also be said that plenty of contributors didn’t catalogue their reading or didn’t read quite such vast numbers of books. One of the great things about TLS is that it takes all sorts – and all are welcome. On that note, I also enjoyed these spy and crime recommendations from beerbart:I got the Xmas present that I wanted, the latest Ben Macintyre The Spy and The Traitor. My love for his work can only continue as this is another top class non-fiction thriller brimming with interesting facts from the late Cold War. However, being hardback, it is far too big on my commute. So I have a Maigret mystery in the bag, Maigret and the Minister which I’m rifling through. I mainly read these for the unique atmosphere Simenon invokes. I also have another part of Deighton’s Samson series on the go via Audio. Spy Hook. I’m not yet in love with this series but I’m too invested in the characters to drop out.Meanwhile, dothebathosphere has already finished their book of 2019: The Faint-hearted Bolshevik by Lorenzo Silva:It’s a “punk” book, the first sentence has the narrator describing his soul being located in his nether regions and it pretty much stays in that register. The narrator seeks revenge on a woman who he ran into the back of at a traffic light. He starts with prank calls and stalking but then sets eyes on the woman’s 15-year-old sister, revenge is off the table the narrator sets his mind to being a “child abuser”. (I use quotes only because he has second thoughts in the course of his lechery before he’s tried anything physical).Well, the book is both repellent and very funny. It’s a cult hit in Spain and astonishingly often recommended to pupils as secondary school reading.Ellie Rose has also just “devoured” Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine by Gail Honeyman:I started reading it on the train, walked around my house reading it, made dinner reading it (the meal suffered slightly, I must admit) and finally finished it about 9pm, feeling like I’d taken a punch to the gut. I found it unbearably sad, but darkly funny too, and sweet and overall very human. As a first read for 2019, it augurs good things for the year, I think!Finally, a challenge from vermontlogger following a “re-re-reading” of Charles Dickens’ Great Expectations:I thought I would just read the first chapter or two. Then of course there was no stopping. No matter how well we know the story, Dickens’ writing is irresistibly vivid and inventive – and is there any other book that can make you laugh and tear up on the same page?I can think of a few government policy documents that have made me feel that way, but that’s maybe not the same thing.

Investors were braced for bad news after a string of warnings in the run-up to Christmas, including a declaration from Mike Ashley, the chief executive of Sports Direct, that November was the worst on record for retailers. Against a backdrop of rising rents, business rates, a shift to online shopping and diminishing consumer confidence, retailers had to battle to win customers over the crucial trading period. Here are the winners and losers so far.A clear loser was HMV, which announced on 28 December it was calling in administrators for the second time in six years, putting more than 2,200 jobs at risk. The music and film retailer said firms across the sector were facing “a tsunami of challenges” and that festive trading at HMV had been “extremely weak”. The 97-year-old company has also lost out during a period of rapid change for the entertainment industry, with consumers increasingly ditching CDs and DVDs in favour of streaming sites such as Spotify and Netflix."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9cd2693bc3a5c7a552146467c42004390844e6e/0_9_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1efb89a3019c1b67b6f0cb62b698959e","title":"debenhams chairman ousted by mike ashley","story":"Retailer’s chairman Ian Cheshire steps down and CEO Sergio Bucher leaves boardThe chairman and chief executive of Debenhams have been ousted from the retailer’s boardroom after two major shareholders – including Mike Ashley’s Sports Direct – voted against them.The chairman, Ian Cheshire, stepped down immediately while the chief executive, Sergio Bucher, will stay on but not as a director.Cheshire joined Debenhams three years ago and he appointed the former Amazon executive Bucher. He told the board after the group’s shareholders’ meeting that he had concluded “it is no longer possible” to remain on the board without the backing of key shareholders.Bucher is to stay on as the board said it had “full confidence in Sergio and in the management’s plan to reshape the business”.“The board believes that it is in the best interests of Debenhams plc that the executive team remains fully focused on delivery of the plan. In the meantime, the board remains open to constructive suggestions from shareholders that are in the interests of the business as a whole.”Cheshire, a former boss of the B\u0026ampQ owner, Kingfisher, said: “In unprecedented market conditions the team has worked incredibly hard to build a format for the future and a comprehensive plan to reshape the business, which will put Debenhams on the road to recovery and future success. Whilst it is right that I step down today, I wish the team at Debenhams every success in the future”.The dramatic events came after weeks of pressure for change at Debenhams from Ashley as the debt-laden store chain struggles to turn around a slump in sales and profits.Ashley wants a closer relationship between Debenhams and his struggling House of Fraser department store chain – which Sports Direct bought out of administration in August.Debenhams said it had started talks with its bankers about refinancing. The group has put on hold its plan to raise cash by selling its Danish Magasin du Nord chain after failing to receive strong enough offers.The company said it had not ruled out any options, include an insolvency process that could be used to speed up a plan to close up to 50 stores over the next five years. It currently has 165 UK stores."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e88d31a05e9c814c28c9a4b8ef9e358af3151de/0_268_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7d110526174729277391627e9193323f","title":"street art the mosaic maker who turns potholes into pictures","story":"Jim Bachor beautifies the world’s streets with colourful designs ranging from chickens to Aretha FranklinFor the last few years the 52-year-old has been making art out of the blight on our roads.Inspired to make mosiacs after a trip to Italy in the late 90s, Bachor has become “the pothole guy”, decorating holes in streets with colourful designs ranging from chickens to Aretha Franklin’s face.He made his first pothole mosaic in 2013, just outside his home in Chicago. “The potholes in our street were particularly bad,” he says. “I put two and two together. I had this unsolvable problem outside of our house, and 100 yards away in my studio I have this passion for an art form that is so durable.”Wearing a high-vis jacket and armed with traffic cones, Bachor has so far created 79 installations around the world including in New York and Helsinki. He creates the mosaics in his studio, fixing the artwork on a cheesecloth. Bachor then prepares the concrete on site and carefully sets the mosaic in the road. It takes about two hours, and he’s back the next day when the concrete is set to scrub off the excess.His requirements are specific – he even sent a pothole scout out in New York to find the right ones. The pothole can’t be in the centre of the street, it needs to be a road in a relatively good condition, and it must be a rough size of 18 to 24 inches, and a couple of inches deep.He doesn’t know the legalities of filling in potholes without permission, and his New York installations were removed by the city’s transport department.His work seems to cause less trouble in his hometown.“There was one time on south side of Chicago. This cop gets out and walks up to me and says, ‘Are you that pothole guy?’“‘Yeah,’ I said.“He goes, ‘That is so fucking cool.’”Find more of Jim Bachor’s art on his website.

Brexit, he told the delegates, was about the vital interests of the country, not about partisan squabbles or posturing. Addressing the prime minister directly, he said: “If you deliver a deal that includes a customs union and no hard border in Ireland, if you protect jobs, people’s rights at work and environmental standards – then we will support that sensible deal.”It was a kind of Brexit olive branch from the Labour leader. At the time, however, it felt fairly meaningless because it was not likely to be put to the test and because the Labour rank and file is overwhelmingly opposed to Brexit. More importantly, for the whole of the previous two years, Mrs May had made no effort whatever to reach out to Labour with some kind of Brexit compromise. On the contrary. All her energies had been devoted to appeasing the Conservative party’s Brexit hardliners. Right up to late 2018, when Mrs May struck her deal with the EU and began the effort to win parliament’s backing, the prime minister took Labour’s leader, its MPs and its voters all for granted.Now, that has begun to change. As she stares defeat for her Brexit deal in the face next week, Mrs May has finally accepted that she will need some Labour support if she is to prevail. This week, she met an all-party group of MPs who want to stop a no-deal exit. In the past 48 hours, ministers have also made clear that they will accept a pro-workers’ rights amendment, put forward by four Labour MPs from predominantly leave constituencies, to next week’s motion. Some reaching out is taking place. But it is all eleventh-hour stuff.The amendment is also extremely thin. It endorses part of November’s EU-UK political declaration on future relations in favour of economic regulation. It says Brexit must not “result in any lowering” of existing common standards on environmental, employment and safety issues. And it says parliament must “consider” any subsequent measures from the EU that strengthen those rights.This is a soggy formulation for matters of such importance. The political declaration, at which this amendment is aimed, is merely aspirational at present. It will only become binding if the Brexit transition negotiations, which have not begun yet, succeed – which is far from certain. So the amendment secures no binding guarantees to maintain existing standards or to keep pace with future ones. Workplace rights deserve to be treated more seriously than this.Moreover, although Mrs May has sometimes talked a better game on workers’ rights than many of her predecessors, the Tory party’s post-Thatcher failure to treat trade unions as stakeholder partners means the foundations for trust are thin, too. Mrs May phoned some union leaders on Thursday. But she could have been doing that for two years and more."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a689ed0e1ad1606251194434bf83faa3fe0330d5/0_227_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=369c2b711a152ed75fbdd40f7b9cbde4","title":"my week of waking up at 430am is the ceo life really for me","story":"On the third day I run out of things to do by 4pm.

Talk to other people on Twitter who got up at 4.30am – early morning news producers, breakfast radio people, insomniacs. They say, welcome to the special CEO club, bitch! 5.15am – Feel gratitude that is overtaken by feeling of superiority. It’s still dark, and I look out at the lights at the apartment block. Only one is on. Losers! Asleep! Not achieving! Try to WhatsApp friends in the UK but no one answers.5.40am – First coffee of the day. I’m dying and starting to feel tired again. Maybe I could work from bed? Only have energy to scroll Twitter. I contemplate the awful reality: I have got up at 4.30am only to spend more time on Twitter.5.46am – The sky is a lovely pink and birds are starting to wake up, but no kookaburras … I listen out for their cries.6am – I read a review of the book Why We Sleep. 6.05am – Check news websites and weather in various cities around Australia. Scroll Instagram.6.50am – Still no kookaburras. Start working on novel. Second coffee. Four strawberries. Send three tweets. Starting to feel very tired.7am – Cave in and take a prescription stimulant. Write a to-do list of CEO things I need to accomplish that morning.7-9am – Write 1,500 words of my novel. Astonished at my focus. I can do anything! Maybe I can even do my taxes????!!!9.15am-9.17am – Tackle in-box. Doesn’t take long as it’s 3 January and no one has emailed me. Instead, focus on unsubscribing from mailing lists.9.30am – Breakfast: homemade sourdough with avocado and lemon juice, cracked pepper and some chilli flakes. Getting up at 4.30am requires some serious fuel. I clean the house.10am – Start working on a difficult travel feature that I have been putting off for months. Even though it is not yet afternoon, it feels like 6pm.11.30am – Finish 2,000 word travel story on the Yala national park in Sri Lanka. Do 30 minutes of YouTube yoga.Midday – Write a column in defence of Karl Stefanovic who has recently been retired from hosting duties on Nine’s Today Show. Most of the column is in CAPS. Walk to local cafe and buy a $11 green smoothie for lunch and try to WhatsApp friends in Asia. No one answers. At cafe journal things I am grateful for: the smoothie, the sunrise, Karl, the … the ... the??2pm – Home. Do taxes. 20 minutes of vedic meditation. Book in a 7am personal training session for later in the week. Join Fitness First. YOU GOT THIS!4pm – I have run out of things to do. Maybe CEOs are busier than me? Suddenly full of doubt about whether this lifestyle is for me.4.30pm – Hit by wave of depression. I can’t go on like this. This CEO life is horrible. Walk to Bronte beach. Swim in the ocean. It is freezing. I feel better.5pm – Walk into the city. There are drinks at the Hollywood Hotel with colleagues. When I tell everyone I got up at 4.30am and reel off my achievements, they don’t seem that impressed. They are too busy laughing about the story of the cane toad who tried to have sex with a snake. I should be hanging out with other CEOs. Start to feel weird. Out of it. Getting up so early is hell.8pm – Walk home from pub. Run into friend who later reports to group chat: “I ran into Brigid randomly earlier. She was extremely out of sorts. Like a space cadet.”9pm. Home. Why am I not tired? I have to get up in a few hours and do it all again. Set my alarm for 4.30am while also feeling sick. This CEO life, is it really for me?That weekend, I go to Berry with friends, sleep a lot and wonder whether to restart my CEO life when I return to the city on Monday.I read a collection of AA Gill’s writing and a line jumps out at me. He is talking about being in the Middle East and invited into locals’ homes.I considered joining in Ramadan for a weekend, but you can’t be a tourist in other people’s souls.And those other people include CEOs. I was trying to be a tourist in a CEO’s soul – and I’m here to tell you, there’s nothing there.I unset my brutal alarms."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98b171f19a26c5d951223262dc282c19ebacc203/0_0_941_571/master/941.jpg?width=685\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5ebcadf2f5c2464ff7367f6e523e2abf 685w","title":"id turned over 1m before i got my a levels the 21 year old online selling sensation","story":"Monty George was 12 when he first started selling on eBay. Now his company Furniture Box is turning over more than £1m and looking to expandMonty George says he was always something of an entrepreneur. “When I was 12 I’d save up my pocket money to buy small things from Poundland like sushi-makers and laptop lights and then I’d list them online and make a small profit,” he says.“From there I tried selling everything from watches to electronics. When I was 15 I bought a load of mini dirt bikes from China to sell, but I realised that if anything went wrong with them I wouldn’t know how to fix them. I’d heard that furniture was one of the biggest growing markets online, so I ordered a couple of shipping containers of coffee tables and dining tables and it all went from there.”But being a budding eBay entrepreneur set him apart from his classmates. “I’d use my lunch breaks to answer messages from customers. I remember one Christmas selling touchscreen tablets that had a really high fault rate and I came back from school to over 100 messages to reply to, which was pretty soul destroying,” he says. “And then of course it was hard seeing friends all go off to university, but I remember the night before I got my A-level results my total eBay sales ticked over £1m. It was quite poetic really.”Three years later and his company Furniture Box has outgrown his parents’ shed and moved into a warehouse and office space in Wiltshire, with a team of six and growing. In 2016 the company turned over £1.06m. “The best thing for me is the customer feedback,” says George. “I get a real buzz when someone gives a product a good review or is happy with something that I’ve put a lot of time and effort into choosing.”Of course, things don’t always go right. “I remember an elderly gentleman recently purchased a chair from us and he left negative feedback, saying it was difficult to put together because he had Parkinson’s disease,” says George. “So I decided to travel to Surrey where he lives and help him put it up.”George says that building a successful business at such a young age has come with sacrifices. “When my friends were out partying at uni, I was putting the graft into the business, often working from 7am until 9pm, seven days a week,” he says.“I did have moments where I thought: ‘Have I made the right call here?’ I remember over one Christmas and new year period, while all my mates were having fun or relaxing, me and my business partner Dan were in our freezing cold warehouse putting up industrial storage racking. But I just knew that the business wasn’t going to grow without us putting in the time and effort.”Now his friends are graduating university, George says the tables have turned. “They’re struggling to start at the bottom, and have a lot of debt,” he says. “In a way I feel ahead of the curve because I’ve spent the last few years knuckling down. I actually think that being young is a great time to start a business. I had no overheads when I was living at my parents’ house and no real outgoings. It would’ve been much harder to do this if I’d had a mortgage and a family to feed. I also think that when you’re young you’re more willing to take risks, and obviously growing up online I had a really good understanding of how the technology worked.“I’ve picked up a lot of advice from family and friends over the years,” he adds. “One thing that particularly sticks out is not to over expand and get carried away, which is easy to do when stock is selling well.” But, he says, he’s still made “every mistake under the sun”.“In 2014 I got a huge tax bill because I hadn’t realised I had to pay VAT, so I had to sell some of my belongings to raise the money.”His advice to other young people who want to start a business is to get to know the market, and not feel daunted by what’s already out there. “Find your niche and offer something unique,” says George. “And if it’s going well, don’t stay still because other people will catch up with you. See what you can do better.”George says he’d like to see Furniture Box become as big as Ikea or Furniture Village. “We’d like to not just be doing furniture, but to expand into other areas of homeware and maybe start selling packs of furniture for new-builds,” he says. “There’s a lot of untapped potential out there that I can’t wait to get my teeth into.”Millions of people are using eBay to start a side hustle, make more of a hobby or carve out a career.

He tells  Kate Wills why all it takes to start a business is a good idea and a bit of goTouker Suleyman remembers the moment he almost lost it all. Although he’s now one of the UK’s best-known retail magnates, with more than 40 years’ experience of rescuing British brands such as Hawes \u0026amp Curtis and Ghost, when he was 28 he nearly went bankrupt. “I’d been convinced to invest in a public company in the era when shares were going up on a rumour,” he recalls. “We didn’t do a proper due diligence. I distinctly remember getting the phone call on a Friday afternoon to say the company’s going bust. It had a deficit of £20m. Like a pack of cards, my businesses went down. I sold my house. I was totally out of my depth.”After that career low, Suleyman went into business with his brother – investing in property, then growing his fashion manufacturing business to become one of the biggest suppliers to the UK high street. In 2001, he decided to buy struggling Jermyn Street shirt shop Hawes \u0026amp Curtis for £1. “At the time, they were supplying shirts to Ralph Lauren in Europe and I thought: ‘If they can do it why can’t I do it?’” he says.“Hawes \u0026amp Curtis had about £700,000 of debt, so we paid everybody off, launched with a revamp and scaled up to six shops quite quickly. We’ve turned things around – we’ve now got 25 stores.”Suleyman says that saving Hawes \u0026amp Curtis, and Ghost – which he bought in 2008 – are his biggest accomplishments. “The thing I’m proudest of is all these businesses I’ve helped,” he says.These successes are hard-earned. “It takes a lot of sacrifice to build up a business,” he says. “There’s a bit of luck, as well as that passion and determination to make it happen. But it’s mainly a lot of time. People go on holiday for three weeks – I go for three days. When my daughters were small it was hard being away from the family and working all the time.”A self-confessed “workaholic”, Suleyman says he has no plans to retire. “I’m asked that question all the time and I say I’ll work until I drop dead,” he jokes. “I have a passion for problem-solving and helping people. I get so many people approaching me with business ideas and I wish the government would realise there’s a lot of people with talent, and devise more schemes to help them. We’re a country of entrepreneurs — young and old. If you’ve got a good idea that solves a problem and there’s a market for it then you can start a business at any age.”Suleyman was able to indulge that passion for helping small businesses when he joined the panel of Dragons’ Den in 2015, investing in a variety of businesses, from baby toys to brownies. “The first thing I look at when deciding to invest is: ‘Can I work with this person?’” he says. “They can have the best idea in the world, but if you can’t work with the entrepreneur then it’s not worth it. One of my favourite investments recently wasn’t on the show – she came to see me personally. She’s a mum of two who had invented a teething toy called Matchstick Money. The business is doing really well, and she was recently offered £5m for it. That’s what makes me happy – there’s this person who lives in the countryside with her kids who’s come up with a great idea and we’ve created value for her.”As for investments he wishes he’d made, Suleyman has no regrets. “There’s always another deal,” he says.‘There’s never been a better time to start your own business’Touker Suleyman was one of the judges for the eBay Doers scheme – where we asked you to share your brilliant business ideas for a chance to be part of a 10-week incubator aimed at helping budding entrepreneurs with funding and expert mentorship.“All the entries were innovative and people had clearly thought about their product, their strategy and what the market was like,” says Suleyman. For the startups that missed out, Suleyman says the future is still bright. “There’s never been a better time to start your own business,” he says.And eBay is here to help you do exactly that – just like the eBay Doers, if you’ve got an idea and a bit of go, you’re ready to become an entrepreneur. “If you’ve got a great idea for a product, and you can source it and put it online, you’ve got a business,” says Suleyman.

Here’s what the Doers have ‘done’ so farThis September, 15 budding business owners, their eight mentors and a clutch of entrepreneurial experts gathered at the  offices. They came for workshops and talks, to meet, to learn and to share ideas at the launch of the eBay Doers scheme.These 15 were selected from hundreds of entrants – each with a bright idea and the potential to build a brilliant business. Their prize: 10 weeks of expert mentorship, plus funding, photography and publicity to help launch or grow their business through eBay.A crack team of business experts, all passionate about passing on their knowledge, will help our 15 entrepreneurs to take things to the next stage. Along with support from eBay Concierge – a tailored service for eBay members that helps them with their buying and selling queries – they’ll hone their products, build up a customer base and, hopefully, create sustainable businesses – starting with our workshop day.So what did our new eBay entrepreneurs learn about turning their business ideas into success stories? They heard inspiring talks from eBay millionaires Mo Bro’s, eBay’s Concierge team and our Doers judge and Dragons’ Den entrepreneur Touker Suleyman, before growth consultant Tom Szekeres held a masterclass on advanced social media.Szekeres taught our Doers the principles on which to build a successful brand – and how to tell stories rather than simply share facts on social media. Doer Catherine White, who makes intricate headpieces for weddings, theatre and re-enactments, says that the most valuable thing she has learned so far is how to make the most of her social media presence.Since the workshop, White’s mentor, workwear designer Joanna Dai, has been pushing her in the right direction. “Joanna taught me about using hashtags on Instagram, and it’s worked brilliantly,” she says. “Seconds after posting, I’m getting lots of likes.”“Catherine’s launched a Facebook page, and tightened up her Instagram posts,” adds Dai. “I’ve advised her to focus on one of six themes for each post – for example, a standalone product, or her headpieces showcased on a model, or a woodland scene.“She’s been incredible – enthusiastic, proactive and passionate about her product. Our next steps are to try and find comparable products on eBay and look at what they’re doing well, and what formats and key words they’re using. We’ll be testing a few things out and seeing how it goes.”Product photographer Kevin Summers also offered his expertise at the workshop, delivering insider tips that provided lightbulb moments for many of our Doers. These included how to get the lighting just right for products shots, and the trick of creating an “infinity curve” as the backdrop to photographs. Placing a smooth, curved surface behind and underneath products avoids harsh lines and makes products stand out.Meanwhile David Long, who sells personalised golf head covers through his company, Babouche Golf, has thrown himself into revamping his own website, as well as launching a fresh new site on eBay.“Tom Szekeres told me I needed a better camera,” says Long, whose eventual aim is to work from home in order to spend more time with his teenage daughters. “When I started out, I didn’t want to just throw money at something that might not work. But Tom and Kevin’s masterclasses taught me that you should try to be original and work on getting these things right. If images go wrong, you can always try again.”Introductions made and expertise taken on board, our Doers headed out to apply what they’d learned, bouncing ideas off their mentors and using eBay’s services to maximise their marketplaces. Luke Damian-Grint, who is developing a range of bone-conducting sunglasses, was invited to his mentor’s head offices for some tailored advice.“Luke came down to our facility, and he had loads of questions on how to grow his business,” says mentor Walter Gleeson, co-founder of eBay behemoth Music Magpie. “I talked him through some of the pitfalls, especially dealing with problems as a focus, rather than as an afterthought. Customers who have a great experience don’t always leave feedback – but those who don’t, do.”So what’s next for our Doers? “Being pushed by Joanna has encouraged me to keep going at it, and I’m feeling really motivated,” says White. “Both Touker and Joanna encouraged me to raise my prices, and people are still buying, which is is a major leap forward.”Millions of people are using eBay to start a side hustle, make more of a hobby or carve out a career.

It is a good, if somewhat overrated performance, with Kidman playing to her queenly, statuesque qualities, but not quite tapping into the inner fire of her better performances. For some reason, she had to play the part with a silly prosthetic nose that made her look like Big Bird.Opinions are ided on this most conspicuous of Kidman’s castings-against-type (I prefer The Paperboy in this vein), but she brings a tough, stolid, plausible presence to her uglied-up role as the undercover cop, physically and psychologically scarred by her experiences embedded in a robbery crew. Years after the events that brutalised her, she becomes convinced that she can finally take down the culprit her bitterness and anguish are forcefully portrayed.Kidman had the distinction of working with Stanley Kubrick on his final film: hers is an intelligent and well-judged contribution to a minor, but interesting and overpoweringly atmospheric film, an adaptation of Arthur Schnitzler’s 1926 novella Dream Story, updated to late-20th-century New York. Kidman plays the wife of Tom Cruise’s sexually tortured high-society doctor and she is frank and open about sexuality in a way that he is not. It is she who will keep this film from sliding down the posterity rankings.No film and no performance of Kidman’s has been more misunderstood on first release. She was cast against type in this brash, uproarious Florida noir, giving a cracking performance as Charlotte Bless, the needy, dysfunctional peroxide blonde who starts up a pen-pal romance with a killer on death row. Kidman has some truly outrageous scenes, sending up her own image and getting stuck into every luridly horrible moment. Terrific stuff.Kidman’s aura of sophisticated mystery and desire is perfect for this daring experiment in filmed theatre from master auteurprankster Lars von Trier. She plays Grace, a woman apparently on the run from criminals, who is taken in by the uptight provincial folk of Dogville, Colorado, and becomes the focus of their obsessively repressed moralism and desire. Without Kidman, this would be nothing.Kidman had her breakthrough with this terrific suspense thriller that has something of Alfred Hitchcock and Roman Polanski. She and Sam Neill play a couple alone on a yacht, who encounter a disturbing young man (Billy Zane) who begs to come aboard. This is Kidman in her early, frizzy-haired incarnation, a more natural, earthy performance than any she has since been known for, but this is great stuff as her character, left all alone, has to outwit and outmanoeuvre the creepy stranger.This is Kidman in rarefied form. Director Jane Campion creates for her, or from her, a shimmering haze of mystery in this adaptation of Henry James’s novel in which she plays the beautiful American Isabel Archer who finds herself attracted to John Malkovich’s louche and cynical artist. For many, the exquisiteness of her appearance here makes it peak Kidman. She goes into her distinctive trance, which also mesmerises the audience.This was the key early role for Kidman, a barnstorming lead turn in which, interestingly, it was director Gus Van Sant who ined that her star quality lay not in ordinariness, but in something more fabricated and unearthly. She is the sinister and ruthless weather presenter on local cable TV who is desperate to become a star at all costs. Nowadays, she would be an Instagram influencer.This is a film that grows with each rewatching and no one but Kidman could have carried it off with such dignity and flair. She plays Anna, a beautiful, wealthy Manhattan widow who is astonished when a 10-year-old boy walks into her life and announces he is the reincarnation of her dead husband. And he does this, citing details that only her late husband could possibly know. The single, extended shot of Kidman’s stricken face as we and she realise that she now believes it, is incredible, and so is her scene with the boy when they discuss how they will marry, or remarry, in 10 or so years, when he comes of age.This is the perfect Kidman film, a ghost story in the style of Henry James that, more than any other, elicits her almost spiritual aura of beauty and mystery with its occult trace of sexiness. In this movie, she is part Grace Kelly, part Deborah Kerr, with a touch of Kathleen Byron. (I should also say she was once cast as Grace Kelly in the terrible Grace of Monaco, which managed to misunderstand both Kelly and Kidman). Here, she plays the statuesque chatelaine of a grand but oppressively gloomy country house. Her husband has gone off to fight in the second world war, leaving her to deal with the children and what few servants they can afford. They are terrified by what appear to be ghosts. Kidman’s beautiful face, lit by candlelight, seems in this film to have been painted by John Everett Millais. She has a sheen of tragedy, and a kind of eroticised but refined victimhood. This is classic Kidman."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f9b213a389dccf5046083bf7908788defe5044d/0_175_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=25d80c0066b944f3c69839ef1b6ac847","title":"oscars no host scenario is a nightmare","story":"The Academy Awards looks set to feature a calvacade of stars instead of a single host. What a nightmareCould it be that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has decided to imitate the BBC’s Film … in its final painful incarnation? As it shuffled towards oblivion, that TV show decided in its last series not to have a single presenter, but a rolling, changing roster of guest hosts. The result was blandness and uncertainty.Now, for Oscar night, the Academy is itself pivoting towards hostlessness.Bruised by the Kevin Hart debacle – in which that planned presenter was dropped for refusing to apologise afresh for past homophobic comments – and after what was clearly a subsequent low-morale interlude in which the poisoned chalice was then refused by every comic in town, the Academy is engaging in a radical experiment with communal compering.Out goes the grinning single MC or MC pairing, in comes a phased cavalcade of stars, a terrifyingly under-rehearsed Avengers Assemble of A-listers introducing various segments. This would be in addition to the traditional, awkward, guest-presenter pairings for awarding the actual statuettes.The 91st Academy awards take place on 24 February at the Dolby theatre in Los Angeles. It is broadcast live on ABC in the US, on Sky in the UK, and on Channel Nine in Australia. The red carpet portion of the show is broadcast live by the E! network.The Oscars are voted for by members of the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences (aka Ampas), which currently numbers just under 8,000 voting members, ided into 17 separate branches, including actors, directors, costume designers, etc. (To join, names have to be proposed and approved by inidual branches.) The Academy has received considerable criticism in recent years for the perceived whitemaleelderly bias of its voters – and a drive to create a more erse membership was instituted after the #OscarsSoWhite campaign in 2016.There are 24 categories – ranging from best picture to best sound mixing – presented on Oscar night. The Academy also gives out a bunch of Scientific and Technical awards: this year, for example, it will honour the people behind Adobe Photoshop and the Medusa Performance Capture System. Also there are the honorary Oscars: this year they are going to actor Cicely Tyson, producers Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall, Steven Spielberg\u0027s PR flack Marvin Levy and composer Lalo Schifrin (of Mission: Impossible renown).Each of the main awards has its own rules and regulations for slimming down all the eligible entries – first to a longlist, then a shortlist, then the final nomination list. In most categories, to be eligible a film must have been released for seven days in Los Angeles before 31 December, and a specialist committee makes the selection for the nomination – which is then voted on by the full membership. For the best foreign language film award, each country can submit one film (89 were put forward this year), before a committee boils them down to a final five.\u0026nbspThe Oscar statuette isn\u0027t solid gold:\u0026nbspit\u0027s gold-plated bronze on a black metal base. It is 34 cm tall and weighs 3.8 kg. While the Academy doesn\u0027t own it once it is handed over, its acceptance is conditional that recipients won\u0027t sell them unless they have offered them back to the Academy for $1.\u0026nbspWhat a nightmare it sounds: an exponential increase of audience unease and megastar self-love, slowing down the show’s momentum and pace. None of these big names will be allowed to develop audience rapport. Nor will the audience be allowed the reassurance of a single thread of continuity – what with all of these egos having to be rolled on and off stage during musical breaks, like 18-wheeler pantechnicons being negotiated in and out of a pub car park.I was in the audience at the Oscars a couple of years ago, when Warren Beatty contrived to award the best picture gong to the wrong nominee, causing dismay and consternation and creating a brand new conspiracy industry about the whole thing being deliberately cooked up to boost TV ratings. All of these segment hosts will be terrified of a similar cockup and an eternity of shame on YouTube.Of course, it could be argued that discomfort and embarrassment is part of the Oscar night tradition – cherished and amplified in the age of social media when those at home can be a snarky Joan Rivers, jeering at every limp gag and fashion fail.I myself have blogged about the tradition of the wooden award presenters, often in their weird newsreader-pairing of an older man and a younger woman. The most legendary example being Roger Moore and Liv Ullmann in 1973, exchanging stilted, scripted conversation before trying and failing to give the best actor Oscar to Marlon Brando for The Godfather.And there is also the argument that the host plummets in interest anyway after the all-important opening monologue. Once that is out of the way, the audience is sometimes irritated to see the host keep coming back, unless they have a huge stunt up their sleeves, such as Ellen DeGeneres’s famed star selfie.There’s no getting round it: group host or no group host, who’s doing the opening monologue? Who’s doing the gags about Donald Trump’s federal shutdown? About Brexit? About Putin? About Kevin Spacey’s bizarre in-character video as Frank Underwood? Or indeed the gags about Kevin Hart not doing the gags? Or is there to be no opening monologue – just an extended satirical musical spoof of this year’s movies? Either way, the hostless Oscars could be a gang show of grisliness."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c4143a9e04dfe7fd8c7cccdd46e28d2bf41c4dd/60_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3051f74e72409bcf14bfb0bd4e54fa61","title":"america cheese surplus production dairy farmers","story":"Demand for American cheese is falling behind supply – partly because of changing tastes but also because of Trump’s tariffsSay cheese, America. No, seriously, please start saying cheese at the grocery store. The country’s dairy farmers are depending on you.Americans eat an awful lot of cheese: almost 37lb per person, per year. Yet apparently that’s still not enough. Demand for American-made cheese is seriously falling behind supply. According to recent data from the Department of Agriculture, we’re currently experiencing a 1.4bn-pound cheese surplus.Lucas Fuess, director of dairy market intelligence at HighGround Dairy, a consulting firm, explains that cheese is literally sitting in cold storage facilities waiting for some aspiring pizza-maker to give it a home.“It’s normal to have some cheese in warehouses, to make sure there’s enough in the pipeline,” Fuess said. “The amount that’s in there currently is, if not a record, very close to record high.”In part this can be linked to lower dairy consumption and the growing popularity of veganism. Plant-based products such as almond-milk have experienced rapid sales growth.Producing American cheese helps farmers to use up milk they can’t sell and that would otherwise go off. At the end of November 2018, US cheese production had grown yet again for the 67th consecutive month.But the problem is Americans are eating less cheese, too.American diets are moving away from processed cheeses like Velveeta and Kraft, and many of the nation’s leading fast and casual restaurants are trying new things. Panera, like others, has replaced American cheese in their sandwiches with a four-cheese combo made up of fontina, cheddar, monteau and smoked gouda.In part, that’s because many Americans now think processed cheese is gross, but also because they’re au fait with quality cheese from around the world. It’s hard to turn back to an indestructible fluorescent orange mess once you’ve tried brie de meaux.“We’re seeing increased sales of more exotic, specialty, European-style cheeses. Some of those are made in the US a lot of them aren’t,” Andrew Novakovic, a professor of agricultural economics at Cornell University told NPR this week. Since imported cheese costs more than domestic, a few blocks of the good stuff might not leave much left in the old cheese budget for anything else.The cheese mountain is crushing farmers. “We’ve seen record numbers of dairy farms close because milk prices are so low that dairy farms aren’t profitable any more,” Feueff added. “This cheese that is hanging over the market is preventing prices from raising higher and it’s reaching a critical level.”“As long as the tariffs are still on in Mexico, it remains a challenge to move cheese out of the country and move those stocks lower,” Fuess explained.It’s not the end of the line. Analysts have noted large buyers of cheese increasing offerings or finding new ways to use it. McDonald’s recently launched a breakfast sandwich with two slices of American cheese. “Fast-food companies are taking this opportunity with low cheese prices to increase cheese on their dishes,” says Fuess.For now though, American dairy farmers are going to continue to look for ways to offload their cheese supplies. “I was just reading stories of cheese tea in China that have kind of gone viral,” Fuess said. “Maybe we need to look into that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2665540f91a887c3996ed24fd1cbf31c899e7adc/0_0_4352_2611/master/4352.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c5f677f7e88bc60055caa07808c6f91","title":"the new rules of eating al desko","story":"Is there a right and wrong way to lunch at your desk? Should you even be doing it at all? Experts and office workers weigh inAs winter finally begins to bite, the idea of the al-desko lunch seems increasingly alluring. No one wants to take their sandwich to the park when it’s snowing, and even the walk to the local cafe can seem too much when it is through wind and rain.But is there a right and a wrong way to eat at your desk? Should we be even doing it in the first place? We asked some experts and office workers.Absolutely not, says Henry Stewart, founder and “chief happiness officer” of the workplace consultancy Happy. “It’s madness. We’ve got to get people out of the hamster wheel of continual work. It’s not good for them and it’s not good for the organisation. All the research shows that people work more effectively if they take breaks.”It’s a smart career move, adds André Spicer, professor of organisational behaviour at the Cass Business School in London. “It’s good for job satisfaction, performance, promotion … Why? Because eating is a social ritual in which people swap information.”And it’s enjoyable, says PR William Matthews. “Breaking bread with your colleagues every day is far better for team spirit than the dreaded once-in-a-blue-moon ‘organised fun’ that so many companies go in for. People are social beings and eating together is a sort of primeval thing.” He has fond memories of the boss who made everyone down tools for a “proper seated lunch with proper crockery and cutlery, so everyone could clear their heads and enjoy the food”.So, everyone agrees that eating al desko is a bad thing? Hardly. “It’s absolutely OK to eat a snack at your desk,” says Myka Meier, founder of Beaumont Etiquette. “You simply want to be cautious of eating smelly food. Etiquette is all about being kind, respectful and considerate of others.”Bruce Daisley, European vice-president at Twitter and author of The Joy of Work, has a warning for anyone tempted by a ban. “For me, this is a bit like organisations that ban you from accessing email outside work hours. The intentions are good but nannying people never has the outcome that you want. You’re turning people into infants, taking away their right to self-determination.“If people sit down to lunch together,” he adds, “they do tend to collaborate better – unless you force them to do it, in which case all that benefit tends to go. You’ve just got to let people do what they want. If you have no agency, you feel unhappy, you feel demotivated, you feel estranged from your job.”And let’s not forget that scarfing down a sandwich at your desk leaves you free to spend the rest of your break exactly as you want. A run or a visit to the gym may not give you an opportunity to bond with your colleagues, but a) not all colleagues are worth bonding with, and b) it will do wonders for your physical and mental health.Again, it depends who you talk to. It’s an “abomination”, says author Helen Jones. Etiquette expert Meier, however, thinks it “adds humour to a rather dull form of dining and makes people think of dining at their desks in a way that requires thoughtfulness”. So she’s all for it.“Unacceptable,” says Stewart. “That’s another clear rule – you don’t drink within office hours.”Spicer is less dogmatic. “In most normal offices there’s a sense of when you’re able to drink and when you’re not. In my workplace, after about 4pm on Friday it’s maybe OK to have a glass or two.“In recent years,” he notes, “there’s been a kind of blurring between workspace and non-workspace, and many organisations are beginning to design their workplaces to look like bars. Some shared workplaces provide an unlimited supply of beer as well as tea and coffee.”“I think drinking’s fine, within reason,” says Daisley. “Opening a bottle of red at your desk? Probably not OK. But there’s good evidence that a bit of moderate drinking can increase people’s affinity for one another.” Normally that’s reserved for the pub, he says, but a lot of workers don’t like them, or don’t have time to go drinking after work.A rare area of consensus: everyone agrees it’s OK to have these at your desk. But should you make your own or have some sort of round?“I think it’s a very important idea,” says Spicer. “It’s a lot like buying a round in the pub but without the alcohol. It ties the group together into a kind of formal ritual. It might seem like a pain in the butt when you have to constantly get people coffee or tea, but it binds people together and gives them a reason to speak to each other.”Or, occasionally, to shirk a few minutes’ work. “I’m against them,” says journalist Sophia Furber. “I used to have them in a previous job and whenever I got to my editor to ask if she wanted a cuppa she would snipe: ‘I’d rather you brought in some news.’” That’s not the only potential conflict: everyone who has been part of a tea or coffee round will be familiar with the colleagues who are much happier drinking than making. “There are definitely givers and takers,” is how Daisley puts it.Still, there are worse abuses of the facilities. “I once worked with a guy who made hot dogs in the coffee maker,” recalls development scientist Sarah Callens.Anything too smelly, for a start. “There used to be someone at my work who cooked fish at lunchtime,” Daisley says. “It’s just not a considerate thing to do, is it? I don’t want the office to smell of kippers. I think it’s just about respect for others.”As well as “microwaved cephalopod leftovers” and “collective fish and chips in a small shared space”, Callens objects to: “Chilli con carne al desko, sandwich platters that pong and curl in the centre of the table for two hours after everyone has eaten, chicken that smells like the bus …”Even nice smells can be a problem, Daisley warns. “Are you creating desires and urges in people that they would like to be free of?”But it’s not just odours you have to worry about. Callens has an aversion to “crisp bag rustling”, while HR manager Nicky Maine hates “people who eat apples. I cannot abide that tearing and wrenching sound, followed by munching. In fact, I detest the very word ‘munching’.”“I love the fact that we’re going to ban apples,” says Daisley. “What, we’re just going soft fruit only? Pears are OK because they’re a touch more giving …” Still, this leaves plenty on the menu.Or does it? Respondent after respondent complained about workmates who hog the microwave by cooking jacket potatoes from scratch, or fail to free it for the next user the moment the timer goes ping. And if you don’t offend your colleagues’ noses, ears or sense of urgency, you still have to contend with their aesthetic judgments. “I have a colleague who puts cheddar cheese on sweet things: hot cross buns, Christmas cake, malt loaf etc,” says teacher Johanna Johnston. “It’s the not-rightness that bothers me! None of these items need adornment.” Rosie Johnson, meanwhile, even objects to white bread sarnies, on the ground that white bread “is not the bread of self-care”.It’s enough to give you indigestion.• An earlier version of this article referred to Sarah Callens as Cullen.

This includes in-play bets on the number of corners, throw-ins or yellow cards. He said he was “in debt to my eyeballs” on high-interest payday loans taken out to cover gambling losses, and his credit was “blacklisted to the max”.He said that gambling “took over my life for a while” and he has deep regrets about having neglected his baby daughter, because he would “sit on the laptop, continuous gambling for the day” when looking after her. He told McGee he had lost two friends to suicide, one directly attributed to gambling debts. Derry, like other areas of Northern Ireland, has some of the highest suicide rates in Britain.As McGee came to know the groups, he found the intensity of the online gambling culture in football has had catastrophic impacts on many of the participants. “Far from being the knowledge-based, risk-free activity it is marketed as, the profound appeal of online sports gambling has had dire consequences for many young men,” McGee has concluded, in research which is complete and due to be published academically next year.“The study documented the unfolding stories of several young men whose everyday lives are punctuated by deepening social and financial precarity, high-interest payday loans and bank debt, mortgage defaults, family breakdown, and mental health struggles.“In particular, for young men who find themselves deprived of viable routes to employment opportunities, gambling promises an alternative route to wealth, social capital and masculine affirmation, yet most end up ensnared in a cycle of indebtedness.”McGee welcomes the proposed whistle-to-whistle advertising ban as “a step in the right direction” but said: “A generation of young people already view gambling as a normalised part of sport. Turning the tide will require stronger state regulation and a genuine commitment to redistributing a greater slice of the losses incurred by British gamblers to education and treatment for problem gambling. Educating the next generation about the dangers will be key.”The betting companies have such huge “visibility” via ubiquitous sport sponsorship, marketing and advertising, and have had a free hand for so long, that the voluntary ban is unlikely to limit the amounts being gambled. The participants in his research said that once they were signed up to betting accounts and apps, the constant prompts during matches, and marketing offers, particularly offers of “free” or matched bets, were powerful encouragements to gamble.Online betting companies have targeted football in an industrialised way, paying for sponsorship and advertising, including in football-related media – the  accepts such advertising – at a time when revenues from other advertisers are diminishing. This season, nine out of the 20 Premier League clubs have a gambling company as their main shirt sponsor, and as many as 17 out of the 24 Championship clubs. SkyBet sponsors the Football League and its three isions, and is promoted by Sky during sports TV coverage.McGee’s work with younger fans has led him to conclude that the marketing has “hooked” a generation into “an accelerated sports culture in which the casual staking of money is an essential accompaniment to watching the game”. He says “a new generation of sports fans view gambling as vital to their enjoyment of sport”.One of the participants, a 27-year-old living in Derry, told him: “As much as I enjoy it, gambling has ruined sport now, because you can’t watch it without thinking: ‘I should put a fiver on first goal.’ You can’t just enjoy it for what it is. It has completely taken over. All my mates can’t watch it without having a bet any more. It has ruined sport.“When I think back to when I was younger, I couldn’t wait to get home from school to see Man United playing in the Champions League on a Tuesday. It was the highlight of your week. I’d spend all day thinking about the game, and come 7pm I’d be sat glued to the TV waiting for the Champions League music to come on.“Now, I’m sat there thinking about what I should be betting on, or asking the boys who the smart money’s on tonight. At times, I end up betting against United just to make it interesting! I can’t remember the last time I just watched the game like a real fan, without having a bet on it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09e4d30fd2eccb205475747c54d1c418b769bd84/163_195_4387_2633/master/4387.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c1c109906b00e5c59a702e90178c64df","title":"mauricio pochettino should reject manchester united history spurs","story":"Why take on a rebuilding job in Manchester when he could win Tottenham the title for the first time in almost 60 years with a little help from the board?Mauricio Pochettino knows he is the most coveted manager in football right now. I can only describe his comments this week about his future at Tottenham as a direct call for action to the club’s board following his show of loyalty. I understood Pochettino to be saying to them: “I have showed and I am showing my loyalty to you by batting away the likes of Real Madrid and Manchester United, but now if you back me financially I want to stay for the next 20 years”.Pochettino has been at Tottenham for five years, which is rare in modern football and yet has spent a lot less money than rivals clubs who challenge for the Premier League. Jürgen Klopp has turned Liverpool into real title contenders in only three years and has had to spend a lot of money to try to bridge the gap to Manchester City. But Klopp has also moulded that team in his own image, with an exciting brand of play which we have seen in abundance this season. Pochettino has done the same but how much of building a team to win the Premier League is down to having much more spending power versus a coach’s ability to change the playing style, tactical blueprint and perhaps most importantly the winning mentality of the team?Pochettino has been a revelation at Tottenham but the big challenge for him is to try and change the mentality of the club. I’ve said in other columns that Tottenham have been a nearly club for too long. Reaching eight semi-finals in as many years probably exemplifies that nearly status.Pochettino needs to try to mount the type of title push that Klopp and Liverpool are building while making sure they get over the line when it matters by starting to win trophies. However his call for action to “change the way we have done things in the last five years” is valid given the lack of spending by the board over the past few transfer windows. Tottenham need to become a winning team not just a great team with fantastic players. There are other managers who have built a winning team in less time than Pochettino.For now I think Pochettino will stay – I don’t think a manager comes out and says “I want to stay for 20 years” if he doesn’t want to and I applaud his loyalty when he would be forgiven for moving to, say, Real Madrid. But he knows he is in a more powerful position if he stays and shows his loyalty because now he has the power to ask for what he wants and do it directly. He is very smart.I’m not sure how much money will be available when Tottenham finally move into the new stadium but Arsenal struggled to compete for the Premier League for years when they moved to the Emirates.Tottenham were the first Premier League club ever not to buy anyone in the summer transfer window so to still be competing for the title is a real credit to Pochettino but I do not think Spurs can continue in this way. If the forthcoming transfer window is anything like the last one, it would be unfair to expect Tottenham to challenge while Manchester City, Liverpool and Chelsea continue to add key players to the team.Tottenham still need two world class full-backs and maybe another centre-back to make the next step. We have seen how crucial Virgil van Dijk has been to Liverpool. It is not always about signing star forwards and midfielders. Tottenham have as strong a front line in Harry Kane, Dele Alli, Son Heung-min and Lucas Moura as any other team in the league.Chelsea have changed managers a lot over the years and are spending a lot less these days but they have been fortunate to retain some of their best players at the same time, such as Eden Hazard. Maurizio Sarri is one of those managers who can get the best out of players who aren’t necessarily world class which he proved at Napoli. It goes back to managers having to work with what they have got versus those who just have a bottomless pit to spend like Pep Guardiola at Manchester City. Pochettino has now reached the stage where he is thinking: ‘I’ve brought this team such a long way but how can we go further?’ Now it’s about how the board react in the summer and whether he is given the money to strengthen the team. I hope Pochettino is supported. His loyalty deserves it.I can’t see Tottenham winning the Premier League this season because they have been dropping too many points against teams lower in the table but now he has made it clear that he wants to stay, next season could be a real chance for them.If Pochettino doesn’t get the financial backing from the board, I’m sure he will make it known and put more pressure on them. He walked away from Southampton after building a successful team, which proves if the opportunity is right he is capable of leaving. But I would be shocked if he went to Manchester United at the end of the season if he is in the perfect position now to really up it with Tottenham.I’m sure United are already thinking about who will be their permanent manager after Ole Gunnar Solskjær and if they don’t know it’s Pochettino now then I don’t think it will happen. Maybe it’s mind games but I don’t think Pochettino is that kind of person: Tottenham is his project. There is more potential to do something historic at Spurs by winning the title for the first time in almost 60 years than going to United to try to rebuild the club. Now he is so close to getting over the line it would be such a shame to walk away. Why would you go to Real Madrid, where they change their manager every other year, or to United where the rebuilding job is huge? If I was Pochettino, I would stay."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20e78d5a25c21f446b6d91122912481355c5b3ac/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cd408f180f0a120019fe4d2bae337ace","title":"premier league 10 things to look out for this weekend","story":"Liverpool have a defensive dilemma, Spurs could struggle in midfield against Paul Pogba and United, while Rafael Benítez is unlikely to go on the attack at Stamford BridgeMousa Dembélé’s impending move to Beijing Guoan is a reminder of Tottenham’s lack of depth in important areas. The Belgian midfielder was once a mandatory pick for Mauricio Pochettino but injuries have caught up with him and he has featured in only 10 league games this season. Dembélé’s decline has been a blow for Pochettino and Tottenham’s manager has also had to deal with injuries to Eric Dier and Victor Wanyama, forcing him to ask a lot from Harry Winks and Moussa Sissoko in the past month. Sissoko and Winks have responded by forming an effective partnership in central midfield, enabling Tottenham to force their way into the title race, but they looked tired against Chelsea on Tuesday. Manchester United, who visit Wembley on Sunday, will spy a weakness to exploit given that Pochettino’s only alternative in recent weeks has been the inexperienced Oliver Skipp. Paul Pogba is probably licking his lips at the thought of stamping his authority all over midfield – assuming, of course, the United showman’s resurgence under Ole Gunnar Solskjær is the real deal. JSIf you want an idea as to why some Leicester fans are frustrated with their team and Claude Puel, then observe their infuriating inconsistency of late. Their past six games in all competitions have been: defeat on penalties to Manchester City in the Carabao Cup after making a number of changes to the team victory at Chelsea victory in the league over Manchester City defeat at home to Cardiff victory at Everton defeat to Newport in the FA Cup. Puel’s decision to make wholesale changes against Newport was more defensible than against City, with their opponents 13th in League Two. But now they are out of both cups and have only that big seventh place to fight for as Puel prepares to take on his former club Southampton on Saturday. That is where they are at the moment but they may not stay there if they continue to be so erratic. NMUnai Emery has an intriguing call to make when Arsenal visit West Ham on Saturday. Mesut Özil is back in training after shaking off the knee injury that has kept him out since Boxing Day, and in previous seasons the German would have expected to walk straight back into the starting lineup. Not in the post-Wenger era, though. Özil’s importance has dwindled, even though he still has the ability to unlock any defence with an eye-of-the-needle pass. The thinking is the team’s defensive structure is not strong enough to carry brittle iniduals and, although Henrikh Mkhitaryan’s foot injury means a creative spot needs filling, Arsenal also have to think about containing Marko Arnautovic and Felipe Anderson in West Ham’s attack. With that in mind, it could be a day for Alex Iwobi or Aaron Ramsey to provide extra thrust in midfield. Iwobi is in good form and Ramsey has knuckled down despite his impending move to Juventus both will have cause to feel aggrieved if they lose out to Özil. JSThe dismissal of Gary Rowett by Stoke this week called to mind another manager who is talking a good game but not getting the results to back up his words. Marco Silva is different to Rowett in that he does have trophies to his name, most prominently the Greek title with Olympiakos, but even that is worth putting in context: Olympiakos have been champions 10 times since the Superleague was formed in 2006, so he was not exactly dragging a team to success with his managerial brilliance. Troy Deeney recently rated Silva as the best coach he has worked with but that will not be much use with the words of the majority shareholder, Farhad Moshiri, hanging in the air. “I look at the table and it is just not good enough,” said Moshiri, and while he also said the club will “stick with” Silva, things can change extremely quickly. Everton host Bournemouth on Sunday. NMHaving seen how Chelsea were frustrated by Southampton’s organisation in their previous league game, it is unlikely that Newcastle will be adventurous when they visit Stamford Bridge on Saturday evening. Rafael Benítez often uses a spoiling approach against the big sides and the Spaniard will surely tell his players to sit deep, absorb pressure and try to take advantage of Maurizio Sarri’s issues in attack. Chelsea drew another blank in their midweek defeat by Tottenham, despite dominating territory and possession, and it will not be in Newcastle’s interests to play an open game. Another game of patience will test Sarriball’s foundations. JSLiverpool could head to Brighton on Saturday with Virgil van Dijk as their only fit recognised central defender. With Joe Gomez and Joël Matip sidelined and Dejan Lovren not expected to recover from a thigh injury in time, Jürgen Klopp will likely turn to Fabinho. Chris Hughton’s side are unbeaten in four games and have proved a tough nut to crack at home – only Tottenham and Chelsea have beaten them there in the league this season. But the assured performance of the 16-year-old Ki-Jana Hoever in Liverpool’s FA Cup defeat at Molineux on Monday will have given Klopp food for thought, especially when watching him wriggle away from Hélder Costa and Rúben Neves before freeing Mohamed Salah on the counterattack. Klopp must choose whether to throw the Dutch teenager in at the deep end once more, or opt for a more experienced head. BFHuddersfield’s defeat by Bristol City in the FA Cup was the equivalent of a boxer’s shorts falling down after being beaten up for eight rounds, one last indignity after the previous pummelling. They have lost nine matches in a row, eight of those in the league, and while they have got some way to go before reaching the Premier League record (Sunderland’s 2002-03 run of 15 consecutive losses), they have definitely reached the stage where they are looking for any help they can get. In the run-up to Saturday’s away game at Cardiff, David Wagner said he has no idea whether they will be able to address their biggest problem by signing a striker, so they may have to look to another source for goals. Jason Puncheon has not scored this season but, at the very least, his arrival from Crystal Palace will add a little more dynamism to their attack. At this point, anything is worth a try. NMIt has been a tough journey to fitness for Tom Cleverley. An achilles problem kept him out of the Watford team for the best part of a year, but after a few substitute appearances he made his first start against Woking in the FA Cup last weekend. “It’s been a long hard year and a long road back,” he said. “It’s a big moment for me.” In some respects, Cleverley’s return could not be better timed, given the continuing uncertainty over Abdoulaye Doucouré, who this week offered the world’s politest “come and get me” plea to PSG. Central midfield is not an area of massive weakness for Watford, who visit Crystal Palace on Saturday, but if Doucouré does depart then Cleverley being an option again will at least mean they will not have to rush to find a replacement. NMPep Guardiola’s side have hammered in 16 goals in two matches and, regardless of opposition, those numbers are frightening. Wolves have an impressive record against the top six, appearing to raise their game when the big boys come to Molineux, having beaten Chelsea, Liverpool and Tottenham. But when Manchester City – who host them on Monday – are in the mood, especially at the Etihad, they are a different beast. Wolves should arrive with confidence and not total trepidation after upsetting Liverpool in the FA Cup but Nuno Espírito Santo’s side must again bring their A-game. Wolves, so comfortable without the ball, are solid but flexible in defence – they have conceded fewer goals than Manchester United and Arsenal – and given that City will want to dominate possession, they will have to show patience. BFIs it a coincidence that Burnley’s results have improved since Dwight McNeil broke into their first team? Maybe but the young winger has certainly added more of a spark to Sean Dyche’s side, who have won all three games he has started, two in the league and against Barnsley in the FA Cup. They host second-bottom Fulham on Saturday. “It’s not like we put him in for the sake of it, it’s because we think he can deliver performances, which he has done,” said Dyche. “I think we’ve timed our run well with that. It’s not just dropping somebody in, taking them out and you never see them again, it’s been building up slowly but surely.” As well as McNeil’s introduction, Tom Heaton has returned in goal, and praise must go to Dyche: neither decision was hasty but both are paying off nicely so far.

Time was that Lindsay featured in the news primarily as the person picking up DUI charges when Paris Hilton wasn’t, but she swiftly grew too large for the mid-00s Los Angeles party scene. There were unpaid hotel bills. There were failures to show up on film sets. There was a stolen necklace, and community service at a morgue. There was BBC3’s decision to get her to front a documentary on human trafficking in India.In overview, then, Lindsay’s has always been a story in the picaresque style – perhaps this is inevitable, given her terrible parents pushed her on stage at 11, when she made her debut in Disney’s remake of The Parent Trap.During the second decade of the millennium, however, the Mean Girls star has certainly added to the gaiety of various nations. She resided on our own shores during the EU referendum, and the night the results were dropping in saw Lindsay unleash a series of tweets so ancien regime they could only have been the direct inspiration for Theresa May’s subsequent “citizens of nowhere” speech. “Sorry #Kettering,” ran one of these, “but where are you?”Local MP Philip Hollobone was so incensed that he used the occasion of a Commons question to the then leader of the house Chris Grayling to assert that “everyone knows where Kettering is”. A Grayling reply was forthcoming. “Lindsay Lohan – as a star of child and teen movies, a very entertaining actress at the time – hasn’t necessarily fulfilled her professional potential,” judged Chris, who would certainly know about not achieving one’s professional potential. “Perhaps now we know the reason why,” he went on. “She should visit the fine town of Kettering and find herself returned to stardom.”Well, there’s careers advice gold right there. That said, this exchange did appear to elicit an apology from Lindsay, and a pledge to switch on the town’s Christmas lights. A broken pledge, as it would turn out. But hey: it’s hardly the most significant pledge to have been broken in the two and a half years since.By that stage, in any case, our heroine had moved on. East, in fact, to Turkey, where she fulfilled her obligations as the face of an energy drink by handing out cans of it to Syrian refugees in a camp. From there, it was a short hop to Athens, where she and a Greek business partner opened a nightclub called LOHAN. Filmed on its steps on opening night, Lindsay debuted a mixed European accent best described as the full Steve McClaren. Speaking only haltingly in the strange American tongue, she announced that this was only the start of an empire. “There’s bigger things to be done with the LOHAN club,” she told reporters. “There is spas, there is refugee camps.” Sure.“We create peaceful locations where we can all be happy,” Lindsay went on. “And we start with the refugees, and then we open nice places, and maybe one of the refugees will open a place with us … I want LOHAN to be a celebration of everybody coming together, in the European nations.” Mmm.It wasn’t entirely clear – it rarely is – but Lindsay did assert of the Lohan club brand that “we can make it a good purpose” and it “will fix bad things in the world”. “We have to help people,” she elaborated. “And if we can do it with a nightclub, or with a spa, or with refugee camps, or with containers …”Was the Enigma machine in one of the containers? Because I struggled to decode the business model here. Luckily, all has become clear with madam’s current venture. Having surfaced in the headlines only briefly in 2017 (“I was racially profiled at Heathrow and asked to remove my headscarf”) and in 2018 (“Lindsay Lohan accuses homeless Moscow family of trafficking their own children”), Lindsay has now returned to the primetime cable schedules with an MTV show called Lindsay Lohan Beach Club: Paradise Boss.The premise? Lindsay Lohan has opened a Mykonos beach club. Either by MTV’s design or by Lindsay’s, the beach in question is the one on which she was publicly hit by a former boyfriend in 2016. As Lindsay explains it, the club is the result of a promise she made to herself at the time. “I said I’m going to own this beach one day because I always want everyone to feel safe.”To work in it, she has summoned 15 MTV-hot young contestants who need to be “the best of the best”. At what? Serving expensive drinks, I think. Serving clients. Getting them to upgrade from loungers to cabanas and so on. But mainly at all the reality-TV things: fighting, backstabbing, partying and hooking up.In her new role as hardnosed entrepreneur businesswoman, Lindsay has to be appalled at this behaviour, for instance when she shows up unannounced at the group house and finds one of the contestants swimming in her underwear. “When you meet your boss, don’t show up in a bra,” Lindsay rules. “It’s like me going to Steven Spielberg in a bra and wet hair.”That … feels like a real thing that might have happened in about 2004?All in all, the show is going to struggle to resolve its central tension: that Lindsay is a professional beach club owner who prizes the reputation of her business above all and that the people who staff it are only pretending to be dedicated beach club workers on reality TV.Still, this isn’t the only fish the growing Lohan brand has to fry. As Lindsay revealed to Jimmy Fallon this week: “There will eventually be an island.” So happily – or rather, less sadly – the universe has other plans for expansion."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7920653e8b6154ea7872e91c5294af4759f0b274/0_0_6000_4000/master/6000.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=c9a1f77fad033475f4d7a9a1a56a9901 1320w","title":"rapper octavian wins bbc sound of 2019 poll","story":"The rapper, born in France and raised in the UK, said ‘it’s going to be a very loud year for me’ as he earns honour previously won by Adele and Sam SmithThe BBC Sound of 2019 poll has been topped by the Anglo-French rapper Octavian.The 23-year-old joins previous winners including Adele, Sam Smith and Ellie Goulding in the industry poll that has traditionally anointed the next big thing in music.On receiving the honour, Octavian said: “I knew that one day I was going to be successful. I get inspired and I try to make a new sound every day. It’s going to be a very loud year for me. Loads of music, loads of visuals, loads of albums.”Born in Lille, he shuttled between France and London throughout his childhood, eventually landing a scholarship to the Brit school – the performing arts school that trained Jessie J, Leona Lewis and Adele. But he dropped out and, amid friction with his family, became homeless. “I didn’t have no money, but I still managed to eat, to live,” he told the  in 2018. “It wasn’t the worst thing in the world. Once you’re there, that is your life. You can only look up, because down there’s nothing left.”Rapping over genre-straddling production that touches on US trap, UK drill, grime and more, his rise has since been swift – Canadian superstar Drake was filmed rapping along to Octavian’s breakthrough track Party Here, and he was chosen by Louis Vuitton designer Virgil Abloh to model for a collection. He released his debut mixtape, Spaceman, in September.According to  pop critic Alexis Petridis, “His music exists outside the security of a scene or sub-genre – it carves out a space of its own, somewhere between grime, drill and trap, drawing in influences from beyond their confines. For all the vulnerability in his lyrics – he left home at his mother’s behest aged 15, a state of affairs that clearly left its mark – there’s a poise and self-assurance about his work that goes beyond the standard rapper’s bluster.”It is only the second time a rapper has won the Sound of poll, after 50 Cent won in its inaugural year in 2003. It is another reflection of how rap has become, by some metrics, the world’s most popular genre – the three most streamed artists of 2018 worldwide on Spotify were rappers Drake, Post Malone and XXXTentacion.Votes in this year’s poll came from 136 figures across the media and music industries. Their task was to pick the new artists they are most excited about in 2019, from any country or genre. To be eligible, acts must not have already had a UK Top 10 album or single.The runner-up is queer US pop singer King Princess at No 2, widely tipped this year after debut track 1950 amassed 183m plays on Spotify. Rounding out the top five are piano-driven British balladeer Grace Carter, Northampton punk rapper Slowthai, and Spanish neo-flamenco star Rosalía."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2dfb18c1b4ac2eda05e2413c62cddec04130eaa4/0_147_4423_2654/master/4423.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0e07e7d263ddf41f19e60c579e3f5fcf","title":"deal or no deal where next brexit today in focus podcast","story":"As Theresa May prepares for the showdown Brexit vote on Tuesday, the government is stepping up its contingency planning for crashing out of the EU without a deal. ’s Patrick Wintour sets out the routes available to the government as the exit date fast approaches.

It’s time to go back to the people, 9 January) pinpoints many issues as to why the UK voted to leave the EU in 2016, but then perversely creates the wrong solution to the clear and decisive voice of the British people.The dispossessed were given a voice as the sovereignty of parliament was transferred to its citizens via a referendum. The UK has respected every decision of every referendum in the past. Our remain top-heavy parliament is creating difficulties for itself the answer is to listen more carefully to the people and not to ask the people to speak more clearly.Your call for humility on behalf of those who failed to hear the people’s cry is not best displayed by not fulfilling the instructions of those very same people who we recognise have had enough. wants to see a reformed UK in a reformed EU, but it is evident that the EU is not for reforming other than to continue its repetitive march towards the United States of Europe that you say you do not want. The EU is simply not for turning away from closer integration on finances, foreign policy, defence structures and ever closer integration as it engineers the tools that in the end create our ultimate governance from a remote, undemocratic, elitist Brussels. It failed to heed the overtures from David Cameron in 2016, and it is on broadcast mode only as we try to negotiate our withdrawal from its institutions. too is on broadcast mode. We must respect our own tools of democracy, and simply because parliament is in contempt of the people is not sufficient reason to further enrage those who have spoken to ask for greater clarity on what they meant when they said “enough” of this project.Entrepreneur and international hotelier Rocco Forte, writing on the same day in another publication, writes lucidly about the strengths of the UK economy and its significant standing in the world. He is confident about the steps that need to be taken to deliver on the vote and our continued and expansive role with the rest of the world. He points out that the EU sold £341bn of goods to us last year and the leverage that our £95bn deficit with the EU gives us if only we used it.So instead of dressing up our disappointment in the result of the people’s vote of 2016, and pretending that failing to listen to its call is ultimately nothing other than Orwellian doublespeak, let us embrace the opportunities that have been offered by the boldness and astuteness of our ultimate bosses: the people. To deny them their Brexit would certainly be the worst of all worlds and would most certainly put us in uncharted waters – and the repercussions of that would be dire.Nigel Evans MPConservative, Ribble Valley• Your leader makes good points, but is once again based on the assertion, also maintained in the past by the Observer, that the referendum result was valid – “We accepted, without enthusiasm, that leave had won”. Thanks largely to the investigative reporting for which the Scott Trust is revered and supported, we know that a number of factors subverted the referendum. Several of these abuses were claimed, indeed claimed by the perpetrators themselves, to have swung the narrow result the fact that they did so when added together must now be almost certain. At the very least they render the result unsafe as a premise upon which to decide the fate of our nation.Surely the  and the Observer should change their stance on this vital issue in the light of the evidence to which they have themselves contributed with such distinction. Then we will have more hope that our elected representatives will change their stance as well.James WillisAlton, Hampshire• Your editorial on Brexit omits to mention a key factor that is used to argue against a second referendum – that to hold one would disrespect the democratic will of the people. Such a view ignores two glaringly obvious facts. One, the leave majority was extremely slim and therefore cannot be considered to represent a single “will of the people”. Two, democracy was gloriously disrespected by those who made promises that have turned out to be fanciful at best and blatant falsehoods at worst. Now that the people have seen enough evidence upon which to base their rational judgment, their democratic right to express it must be restored.Dr Allan DoddsBramcote, Nottinghamshire• Your leading article supports some mechanism such as that used recently in Ireland. This is potentially crucial for the future of this country in two particular ways. First, it addresses the basic question of who is fitted to guide our country’s policy, and brings in the principle of randomness. Random selection applies no filters: not gender, not race, not education, not class, not wealth, not family connection. It therefore is revolutionary in, at last, assuming equal citizenship. Who owns the country? All its citizenry.Second, the mechanism includes study of the issues. It brings together a number of citizens small enough over a reasonable period of time to become well informed on the principles and technicalities involved. It is not a marketing campaign, but an educational enterprise. I rejoice.Howard HiltonAudlem, Cheshire• Your front page (9 January) carried these messages, in an extract from your editorial: 1) “The message must be that this country needs a new and fairer deal” I believe that is true 2) “and that this is best guaranteed by a better Britain in a better Europe.” I believe that is true 3) “The government has failed” I believe that is true 4) “… so we must go back to the people.” If that means a second referendum, I believe that is not true.The 2016 referendum was ill conceived by a government desperate to dig itself out of a hole, Is that different now? It was badly executed. The wrong question was asked of the wrong electorate at the wrong time. Would that be different now? It was intended as advisory but treated as binding. Is that different now? If you aren’t convinced yet, perhaps you watched the film Brexit which showed an eminently repeatable set of events. So what should happen?I believe that parliament, the ultimate law-making body in the UK, should revoke its article 50 notice, so prematurely sent, and the whole sorry mess would end. Government response to the question “Can article 50 be revoked?” has been: “It’s not government policy”. Presumably that means “yes”. So, that’s what we should do now. And later, when the dust has settled, have a real people’s vote in a general election.Celia WilsonDidcot, Oxfordshire• Your editorial suggests that it is time to take the matter of Brexit out of parliament and back to the people. I agree. However, you appear to avoid calling for the traditional mechanism of a general election and instead suggest a somewhat convoluted process of a citizens’ assembly followed at some point by a reconfigured second referendum. The problem is that if the discussion takes place in the same climate as we currently have, the conclusion is likely to be much the same. That’s why I, and no doubt other  readers, will be gathering at Portland Place in London on Saturday to join the people’s assembly march. It will call for the much-heralded end to austerity to actually happen and challenge the rise of racism. Both of these are essential prerequisites for a more a rational Brexit debate.Keith FlettLondon• The issue should be decided by intelligent, well-informed people from across the political and cultural spectrum of parliament. If their decision reverses Brexit and attracts the ire of vehement Brexiters, so be it. It won’t be the first time parliament has ignored the so-called public will.Michael HeatonWarminster, Wiltshire• For once, a leading article that leads: thank you. You should give credit where it’s due by acknowledging that it was Gordon Brown who put the idea of a citizens’ assembly on the table in his November speech at the Institute for Government.Willy McCourtLondon• Join the debate – email • Read more  letters – click here to visit guletters• Do you have a photo you’d like to share with  readers?

Any complaints process has to be transparent, balanced, fair and confidential. That’s in the interests of the complainers and those complained about.”In August last year, he called for an investigation into what he has described as the leaking of information surrounding a confidential process.Regarding the referral to the ICO, a Scottish government spokeswoman said: “The Scottish government has never commented on the content of the allegations against Mr Salmond and we will not do so.“As a precaution, and in line with our legal obligations, we instructed a detailed review into our handling of Mr Salmond’s data in August 2018.“We are satisfied that information relating to this case has been processed in accordance with our legal and information handling obligations, and that there is no evidence of any data breach.“We are currently in the process of sharing this information with the information commissioner.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c03be08e27f2c109d00b03ed5b5ea937f29dbcb1/0_23_5976_3586/master/5976.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fa122550f2a542802f7a76243462abf4","title":"no one voted to be worse off wakefield locals brace for brexit","story":"As Jeremy Corbyn was giving his Brexit speech, Peter Clarke had popped into Duchniak’s, a Polish restaurant on the outskirts of Wakefield city centre. He wanted to know if they sold Pączki, donuts eaten on the Polish answer to pancake day. They call it Fat Thursday (Tłusty Czwartek) and the 72-year-old was trying to order a big batch for a Rotary Club do next month.“We’ve recently had a new Polish member and I thought it would be nice to make her feel welcome,” the retired policeman said.He saw no contradiction in enjoying a restaurant opened by a young Polish woman taking advantage of the EU’s freedom of movement and labour, and Brexit. He seemed surprised that his vote might have made Poles feel unwanted.“Does it?” he asked Sabina Niemczyk, the 29-year-old waitress, who came to the UK four years ago. “It does a bit,” she said quietly. “Especially when I used to work in a shop and could hear people saying I should go back to my country.” She plans to go home again in 10 months.Clarke went to reassure her. “I don’t have a problem with people who work. It’s the scroungers I don’t like. The ones who come on the back of a lorry.” Never mind that asylum seekers who arrive hidden in trucks are a) not European and b) not entitled to claim benefits. Clarke’s Brexit vote wasn’t really about immigration, he said – his niece is married to a German and recently got her German passport “just in case”. For him, it is about sovereignty and the EU “bit by bit taking extra power – it’s become a government in itself”.He was unconvinced that Jeremy Corbyn could do a better job than Theresa May and negotiate a better deal, including a new customs union. “Well, how?” he asked. “Others have tried and failed.”Corbyn’s call for a general election may not pay off in Wakefield, where Labour’s Mary Creagh has a delicate 2,176 majority over the Tories. Joiner Geoffrey Walpole, 60, said he didn’t know who he would vote for but certainly not Corbyn – “he’s never done a day’s work in his life”. He voted for Ukip last time they stood, in 2015, coming third, but thinks “they’ve had the stuffing knocked out of them”.People are too scared to take a risk and deviate from the main parties, he believes: “If you told the British public to take fewer breaths every day because there was a shortage of oxygen, most people would do it. People are frightened.”In the carpark of OE Electrics, where the camera trucks stood to broadcast the Labour leader’s speech, three Wakefield remainers were protesting.John Sheard, a retired IT worker, said Brexit was the first issue he had protested against since he was a student and went on a demonstration against grant cuts. Both he and Gosling are Labour members and campaigned for their local party to submit a motion to Labour conference in favour of a second referendum: a move eventually backed by Creagh.“I thought it was a positive thing, Corbyn being Eurosceptic,” Sheard said. “I thought we could remain in the EU and have a Eurosceptic leader who would be a strong voice for a reform in Europe. But it’s not been how it worked out.”Lynne Stainthorpe, a retired teacher, said she had been campaigning since the People’s Vote march in October. “Most Labour members are remainers, aren’t they, and most Labour MPs are remainers,” she said. “I just wanted him to see that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd42f54b1ab7f8aee9d46cd21a77bbd55b99eaf7/0_0_2597_1558/master/2597.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aeea8de696aed43eec01383f8f1080e9","title":"theresa may surprised john bercow allowed brexit amendment","story":"British PM calls on Commons Speaker to ‘explain decision’ as she emphasises ‘set of rules’Theresa May has said she was surprised that the Commons Speaker, John Bercow, had allowed MPs to vote on Dominic Grieve’s Brexit amendment on Wednesday, and called on him to explain himself before parliament.The amendment compels the government to say within three sitting days what it will do if, as expected, May’s Brexit deal is voted down next Tuesday – giving her a deadline of Monday 21 January to make a statement on the government’s intentions.The prime minister said there should be “consistent interpretation” of the rules as she waded into the row about Bercow’s decision to allow Grieve to submit an amendment on a government motion that was intended not to be altered.Speaking at a press conference alongside the Japanese prime minister, Shinzō Abe, May said: “Obviously the Speaker made a decision on a particular amendment I was surprised at that decision.”She called on Bercow “to explain that decision” and endorsed a call made by Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, on Wednesday to “publish the advice that he had received” from the parliamentary clerks.May has no power to dismiss Bercow, who has been in the job for over nine years. His appointment is a matter for the whole House of Commons, and the Speaker retains the support of pro-remain Conservatives as well as opposition MPs.But she warned that the Speaker was at risk of making up the rules as he went along. “Members of Parliament need to know that there is a set of rules in the House of Commons they need to know that there will be consistent interpretation of those rules so that they know how they can operate within the House,” May said.Grieve’s amendment passed on Wednesday by 11 votes after Bercow allowed it to be debated. Government business managers had submitted a procedural motion for the Brexit debate that they said was unamendable, but Bercow directed his clerks that it should be taken for debate.Earlier, a defiant Bercow had told MPs that “there was nothing arbitrary about the conduct of the chair yesterday” when he was accused of arbitrarily changing the rules by Leadsom in the Commons.“This Speaker is well aware of how to go about the business of chairing the proceedings of the House because he’s been doing so for nine and a half years,” Bercow said, describing criticism as “water off a duck’s back”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c02d66033ec91b08037359a7e138d74e61e831c5/23_110_3655_2194/master/3655.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f27afe021bef5c5afdde86603213cf64","title":"what is going on in brexit and what might happen next","story":"Your no-frills primer to the UK’s departure from the European UnionConfused by the latest developments in the UK’s fraught departure from the European Union? Here’s your no-frills primer to what’s going on in Brexit – and what might happen next.Two-and-a-half years and a fraught series of negotiations after the UK voted to leave the EU, the two parties finally managed to sign their two-part orce deal late last year.The first part of this is the 858-page withdrawal agreement covering the rights of EU citizens in the UK and British nationals on the continent, the sum Britain must pay the bloc for past commitments, and a mechanism (the “backstop”) to avoid customs and other border controls between Northern Ireland and the Republic.The second part is a much shorter political declaration on the shape they would like their future trading relations to take, which is vaguely worded enough to allow for almost any outcome, from a close Norway-style relationship to a more distant free trade arrangement like the EU has signed with Canada.In theory, this whole package must now be approved by the British parliament so the necessary legislation can be passed to allow the UK to formally leave the EU as planned at the end of the two-year article 50 exit process on 29 March.Britain would then enter a 20-month transition period, during which nothing much will change and the future relationship will be negotiated, before finally stepping out into the big, wide world in December 2020.Essentially because the withdrawal agreement – and particularly the backstop, which will come into force if the detailed terms of the future trading relationship do not manage to avoid that hard Irish border – does not have a majority in parliament.MPs in favour of Brexit fear it could leave Britain a perpetual Brussels “rule-taker”, potentially trapped in the EU’s regulatory orbit for ever. Those opposed to Brexit say the deal risks leaving the country economically weakened, with no say in EU rule-making, and worse off all round than staying in the EU.The opposition Labour party rejects the deal, as do a large number of Conservative hardline Brexiters. The Ulster unionists of the Democratic Unionist party, on whom the government relies for its majority, also object, leaving the government facing a crushing defeat in the House of Commons.For this reason, Theresa May, the prime minister, pulled the Commons vote on the agreement that was planned before Christmas, rescheduling it for 15 January in hopes she could persuade the EU to come up with concessions or guarantees that would win her opponents (or enough of them) over.Good question. The EU hasn’t budged (it can’t, to any great extent: the agreement is legally binding, approved by 27 countries, and will not be re-opened), and it is hard to see what supplementary assurances it could offer that would satisfy the Brexiters.Parliamentary resistance has not weakened, and the government has been reduced to trying to cut side-deals – in the form of amendments to the deal – with various different interest groups to try and peel off some of the objectors. Few observers think this tactic will work.In the meantime, the prime minister’s opponents in the Commons are waging a procedural guerilla war, tabling – and winning – amendments aimed at wresting more and more power over the process from the government and giving it to MPs instead, particularly if a no-deal Brexit looks likely.The problem is that while there is no clear majority for May’s deal, there is no clear majority for anything else either: not for a second referendum, nor a fresh election (Labour’s objective), or no deal (which almost all economist and business groups say would be a catastrophe), or a mooted “Norway-plus”, single-market style deal. And the clock is ticking.Assuming May is defeated on 15 January, it seems increasingly likely that the government may have to ask the EU27 for an extension to the two-year article 50 deadline to allow it (or more accurately, given the current mood, MPs) to look again at the existing deal, or try to develop an alternative Brexit approach it can agree on.Brexit, in other words, is far from over yet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd629bc887ca246bb4c2b45264093b2b5442477c/89_171_5111_3066/master/5111.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef5557e78f57eef9035c19bb2200dc53","title":"mystery of location of easter island statues revealed","story":"Location of statues was based on nearby fresh water and other resources, says US studyThe huge stone figures of Easter Island have beguiled explorers, researchers and the wider world for centuries, but now experts say they have cracked one of the biggest mysteries: why the statues are where they are.Researchers say they have analysed the locations of the megalithic platforms, or ahu, on which many of the statues known as moai sit, as well as scrutinising sites of the island’s resources, and have discovered the structures are typically found close to sources of fresh water.They say the finding backs up the idea that aspects of the construction of the platforms and statues, such as their size, could be tied to the abundance and quality of such supplies.Easter Island, or Rapa Nui, has more than 300 megalithic platforms, each of which might have been made by a separate community. The first of these are believed to have been constructed in the 13th century, and many are found around the coast. It is thought the monuments represent ancestors and were linked to ritual activity, forming a focal point for communities, but the reason for their locations was previously a mystery. While studies have suggested the sites might have been chosen because of a link to key resources, the team says the latest research is the first attempt to scrutinise such claims.The team focused on the east of the island, where various resources have been well mapped, and looked at the distribution of 93 megalithic platforms constructed before European sailors turned up in the 18th century.After finding no link to the proximity of rock used for tools or for the monuments, they looked at whether the ahu were found near other important resources: gardens spread with stones in which crops like sweet potatoes were grown, sites linked to fishing, and sources of fresh water.Lipo said he became interested in the latter after he and his colleagues began delving into where those living on Rapa Nui got their drinking water from. The island has no permanent streams, and there is little evidence that residents relied on the island’s lakes.However, fresh water passes through the ground into aquifers, seeping into caves as well as emerging around the coast. “It is sort of amazing at low tide when the water goes down, suddenly there are streams running off at different spots right at the coast that are just pure fresh water,” said Lipo. “We noticed this, actually, when we were doing a survey on the island, that we would see horses drinking from the ocean.” Historical records reveal islanders drank this rather brackish water, while studies suggest they also made wells to capture drinking water.The results of the new research, published in the journal Plos One, reveal proximity to freshwater sites is the best explanation for the ahu locations – and explains why they crop up inland as well as on the coast.“The exceptions to the rule about being at the coast where water comes out actually are met by the fact there is also water there – it is found through cave locations,” said Lipo, adding historic wells were found to explain some ahu locations apparently without fresh water. Lipo said the results chimed with the team’s experiences on the ground. “Every time we saw massive amounts of fresh water, we saw giant statues,” he said. “It was ridiculously predictable,” he added.The results, said Lipo, made sense, as drinking water is essential for communities and it is impractical to have to walk miles for a quick swig. “You would do stuff near the fresh water,” he said. But he says the study also adds weight to the idea that communities competed and interacted through monument building, in contrast to the idea that islanders engaged in lethal violence over scarce natural resources – something Lipo says there is little evidence for. Indeed, the team is now exploring whether various aspects of the statues such as their size or other features might be linked to the quality of the water resources, potentially offering a way in which a community could show off a competitive advantage to other groups of islanders.And community and cooperation, stresses Lipo, were crucial in construction of the monuments. “Anything that brings you together is going to make you stronger and allow you to survive,” he said. “I think that is the secret to Easter Island.”But not everyone agrees about the location of the statues. Jo Anne Val Tilburg, an Easter Island expert from the University of California, Los Angeles, said: “The existence of fresh water seeps near coastal ahu is well-known and was certainly important at European contact. However, such seeps are today, and probably always were, minor resources. It is highly unlikely, in my view, that these resources were of major importance in locating ahu during prehistory.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c214b4bd79b2e7d955d7b4487d309c40e3b2bd2b/0_613_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=553fd0b4e8076453d999ae63ca715ea5","title":"how to get your daily 30g of fibre","story":"A WHO report finds few people in the UK eat enough fibre.

A key announcement is scrapping the plan for universal credit payments to only be made for a family’s first two children, which was due to start next month. The wider two-child limit for benefits came into effect in 2017, as part of efforts to curb spending.Opponents, led by the SNP MP Alison Thewliss, have condemned the limit, in particular the so-called rape clause, which decrees that mothers can gain exemptions to the limit if they are able to show a third child was born due to rape.At the speech on Friday, at a job centre in south London, Rudd was to say the two-child limit for people on universal credit, and the new working-age integrated payment which replaces a series of existing benefits, would not happen, but only for children born before April 2017.Rudd was to argue that it would be unfair to penalise parents who made financial decisions before the wider limit came into force, and it will still apply to children born later.Thewliss said that while she was pleased the government “has finally agreed that the two-child policy is unjustifiable”, she warned against the dual approach.“Those born after the 6 April 2017 will still be subject to the pernicious rape clause, and forced to fight for exemptions to feed their kids. This will cause confusion and perpetuate unfairness. The two-child limit will still exist and still continue to push many families into poverty in the future.”Labour’s shadow work and pensions secretary, Margaret Greenwood, said: “This partial U-turn does not go far enough. Labour has long called for the government to abandon the two-child limit in its entirety.”Since taking on the role after Esther McVey resigned in November, Rudd has tried to take a more cautious approach to the extension of universal credit, which has prompted concern about confusion, and delayed payments pushing claimants into debt.The government had been due to hold a vote on the so-called migration of universal credit – shifting existing benefits claimants onto the new system. But Rudd has announced that instead there will be a test of this process involving 10,000 people.“This will begin, as planned, from July 2019 and the next six months will be a period of careful preparation,” she was to say in the speech.“The lessons from the pilot will inform our next steps, but there will be no overall delay. Universal credit migration will be completed, as planned, by 2023. However I will consider carefully the results of the pilot, and its implications for scaling-up migration.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77c9d90bb153f8237f80d878d904939c48aeecff/0_101_3518_2111/master/3518.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=260910e4d63efc21ff2532a815c0210b","title":"benefits freeze likely to end in 2020 says amber rudd","story":"Work and pensions secretary hints that costly Tory welfare policy will not be renewedA Tory welfare policy estimated to cost some working families hundreds of pounds a year is likely to be brought to an end five years after it was first imposed, the work and pensions secretary has signalled.Amber Rudd suggested the benefits freeze, which was introduced by the former chancellor George Osborne in 2015, may not be continued when it becomes due for renewal in 2020.“The whole point about the three-year benefit freeze was making sure that people on low incomes had the same rises as people on benefits,” she told Sky News. “This was a time when inflation was very low and it was the right thing to do at the time, given that we also had the massive debts that the country had inherited from Labour.“It was the right policy at the time, it’s got one more year to run, I look forward to it coming off.” Pressed on when this might be, she said: “It has one more year to run … I do not expect that to be renewed at all.”Reacting to the comments on Thursday night, a Labour source said: “The Tories’ social security freeze reduced incomes every year for those most up against it, while they gave tax cuts to the rich and big businesses. Rudd is flat wrong when she says it was the right policy, which is why Labour is committed to ending it.”On Friday, Rudd will announce a partial rollback to the two-child limit on universal credit payments as the Conservative government reformulates its welfare policy. In October last year, Theresa May said the decade-long period of austerity put in place by successive Tory-led governments would come to an end, though her claim was met with some scepticism.The benefits freeze was initially imposed for a two-year period and was renewed in 2017 for three more years. Two separate pieces of research released since then by the Resolution Foundation suggested the worst-hit households would lose between £200 and £300 per year.The freeze affects benefits including tax credits, child benefit, jobseeker’s allowance, part of employment and support allowance and universal credit. In 2017, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation predicted it would drive almost half a million people into poverty by the time it came up for renewal in 2020."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af1d27bc77ffea38c10323099cc9d79fad23c69f/0_144_6120_3671/master/6120.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=05ef928fdd83fbbcae3e2a4f2c69200f","title":"poppy bryony cleall saracens twins womens rugby union","story":"Poppy and Bryony Cleall have played together – and against each other – since the age of six and this weekend will be side by side in a top-of-the-table clashAs kids, Poppy and Bryony Cleall always sat back-to-back when they were unwrapping their birthday presents so they wouldn’t spoil the surprise if they were both given the same things. This stuff is always tricky for twins. Like the time Bryony got picked for England Under-18s but Poppy didn’t, or Poppy made the under-20s but Bryony was left out. Then there were the years they played for competing teams: Poppy was at Saracens while Bryony was at Bristol, and Poppy was at Bristol while Bryony was at Saracens. Just last week, when the RFU announced its first batch of permanent full-time contracts, Poppy got one but Bryony did not.Bryony is still in the England elite player squad, but will carry on in her day job as the head of girls’ PE at the Harris City Academy in Crystal Palace. “Poppy’s never even asked me if I’m OK about not getting a full-time contract,” Bryony teases. She is. She missed five years of her career because of injuries which is why she is a step behind her sister. Bryony has not played for England yet but Poppy made her debut in 2016 and now has 24 caps. “The email that told me I was in the elite player squad said at the bottom of it: ‘I know you may be disappointed by this’ but I was over the moon. I rang Poppy and I shouted: ‘Woohoo! I got in!’ I’m proud just to be involved.”The twins started playing when they were six. Their brother Josh used to play in an after-school rugby club, Poppy explains, “but Mum and Dad would come and pick us up all together at four o’clock so we had to wait around and watch until one day the coach said: ‘Do you two want to come and play?’ We’ve been at it ever since.”Sometimes they were playing with each other, sometimes against. Once they were on opposite sides in the Premiership semi-final. “Dad was like: ‘It’s OK, at least one Cleall will be in the final,’” Poppy says. Bryony cuts in: “Then she got injured and missed it anyway.”“Poppy will hate me for saying this,” Bryony says, “but my favourite story is the time she pulled my hair. It should have been a red card. I was with the ball and she went to tackle me and got a fistful of my hair. She let go and went: ‘Oh my God! I’m so sorry!’”Now they are back playing together at Saracens. This Saturday Sarries, the leaders of the Women’s Premier15 table, are playing Harlequins, who are second. Poppy is recovering from an injury but says she’ll be fit, if picked, for the latest round of what is becoming one of the league’s defining rivalries. “It extends beyond the pitch,” Bryony says. “Quins are definitely pushing women’s rugby to the forefront and so are Sarries. Both clubs want to be the number one draw in women’s rugby.”Lately the twins have been working together too. Poppy’s new contract means Bryony is going to have to find a new coach for Harris City’s under-18s team. Poppy took on the job when she moved back to London. But, as of 1 January, she is a full-time pro. “It’s such a privilege that we can be the first ever professionals,” Poppy says, “and it’s a little bit of pressure, too.” She has been a professional before, briefly, when the RFU gave the women full-time contracts before the last World Cup – but scrapped them when the tournament was over. “People just always ask me how come Poppy’s skinnier than me,” Bryony says, “and I always say it’s because she went professional four years ago.”Before that Poppy worked as a prison officer. “Anyone that can juggle a sporting career and a job, hats off,” she says, “because it was so stressful and some days it really did get me down.” She used up her holiday allowance taking time off to play games on the weekends. “I remember one weekend when our manager told me I had to play but I just couldn’t get it off work. In the end I told her I’d play so long as she didn’t put my name on the teamsheet. Lo and behold I scored a hat-trick, and on Monday morning my name was right there at the top. Two days later at work they were like: ‘You know when you rang in sick at the weekend? How do you explain this?”She felt like she was always letting somebody down, either her coaches or her bosses. It was always “sorry I can’t train because I’ve got work, or sorry I can’t work I’ve got to play”. Bryony is lucky as the school allows her some flexibility. But she is still painfully aware of the problems her playing career causes for her teaching colleagues.“It’s the work I leave behind, it’s really a burden for the department to have to pick up the load I’m missing.” For years, this was just the way it was if you were a woman who wanted to play international rugby. “You just put your head down and get on with it,” Poppy says. “Everyone’s got to make the sacrifices.”It should not be that way. And now, at last, it is not. “The women’s game has taken a big step in the right direction,” Bryony says. “I would have loved to have that first professional contract but I think it’s really more important for kids who are six years old now who can pick up a ball and think ‘actually, I want to be professional’ not ‘I want to play rugby and do some other job for a living’ but ‘my dream is to be a professional rugby player’.” Poppy agrees: “That’s the history that’s being written now, we’re living a dream that all the little girls who come after us can have from the start.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97279def4bca90a69d49b1b011260d8779592904/0_279_4063_2437/master/4063.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f2cc0252b208406a4c40ddfb3cb48f61","title":"andy murray announces impending retirement from tennis live","story":"It’s just about time for me to return to other activities. Thank you for your company and be sure to check back throughout the day for more reaction to Andy Murray’s retirement announcement.In the meantime, here’s Sir Andrew Barron Murray OBE rapping (skip to 1.30 to minimise the pain). You’re welcome.Ok, so this not a question I expect an answer to any time soon (especially not towards the ends of my stint on the blog) but where does Murray’s career rank in the history of British sport? Two olympic gold medals, a Davis Cup, three slams (including two at Wimbledon) - and all achieved during a period of tennis that could not have been tougher. He has to be considered right up there with the very best. Rory McIlroy agrees. You’re not going to find a more driven, more dedicated professional athlete in the world than Andy Murray. He does absolutely everything in his power to get the most out of his game. He’s a Wimbledon champion, US Open champion, Olympic champion. He’s one of the best British sportspeople ever in my opinion.In other tennis news, local hope Thanasi Kokkinakis has qualified for the Australian Open main draw, while Ash Barty is a set down in her Sydney International semi-final with Kiki Bertens.“I’m an Indian living in the U.S. and I have lived all the highs and lows of Andy’s career like that of no other tennis player. I remember exactly where I was when Andy won his first Wimbledon title in 2013. In a little cafe in Istanbul (on holiday) checking the score every few seconds on my phone like a maniac and chewing my nails till there were none left! I’ve been a huge tennis fan since I was a kid but haven’t watched too many matches since Andy’s hip injury since I can’t stand to see tournaments without my favourite player. Andy - you are an absolute legend and you will always be special to all your fans all over the world!” Thanks for the email Swati.We’ll miss the deadpan humour, that is for sure.British tennis, once a light-entertainment punchline, reached glorious heights at Murray’s peak. Perhaps the only other man on the ATP World Tour who can rival Murray for misfortune in the injury and trying-to-win-slams-against-three-legends stakes is the Tower of Tandil. The tributes from tour colleagues keep pouring in. Here’s the second story posted about Murray on  online. It’s from back in 2005 when Martina Navratilova delivered a column brimful of insight.He’s already strapped up he’s pretty strong but he’s really long and lanky and that puts real strain on the joints. Players like Pete Sampras are more compact but Andy’s arms and legs are soooo long and it’s this kind of body type that is more likely to have problems with the joints. He’s already had ankle injuries and that’s what you can’t control. Back in 2016 Murray looked set for an extended spell as the king of men’s tennis. Injuries were beginning to catch up with Federer and Nadal while Djokovic looked spent after an extraordinary run of form. Alas it wasn’t to be. Favourite Murray memory? This would have to be up there. Just a week ago life was all park cricket and kangaroo tails. On any other day Andy Murray would be making headlines for continuing to be a thoroughly good bloke. After struggling through a hit-up with Novak Djokovic yesterday he ed into his Instagram mentions and offered tickets to his Australian Open round one match to a fan who he was concerned he had disappointed.He wrote: “I’m sorry I couldn’t be more entertaining today - thanks for the support.” Then: “If you’d like to come along and watch on Monday or Tuesday I’ll sort you a ticket.”The full unedited press conference is gut-wrenching. You hope someone was ready to give him a big hug as soon as he walked out of the media centre. “I’m English but lived in Scotland for 10 years. I played tennis for Edinburgh Uni in the late 90s and early 00s when the Murray brothers were growing up and practicing on some of the same courts in Edinburgh and Stirling. I’m pretty sure I practiced close by them when they were being coached by their mum. I’ve lived in the US for 15 years, with comprehensive coverage of all his important matches, most of which I watched. I have friends in Stirling and Dunblane. It’s an incredibly tight community. Andy rarely mentions it, but they are so proud of their own and how he represents them, given their shared horrifying memories. On a larger scale, he’s come to represent so much more than one of the greatest British athletes of all time. We knew he was in pain for much of his later career, which made his resilience and brilliance so much more inspiring, especially through the year he won his second Wimbledon and retained the Olympic title. As a cancer patient myself, I appreciate his efforts to raise money and awareness of the disease through his charity work as a British tennis player, he instilled so much pride for us on the biggest stages in the most brutal era of competition. As a human being capable of the utmost integrity and honesty, he should always be lauded as an example for every young person.”Could Murray’s retirement herald the beginning of the end of a golden age of men’s tennis? As Kevin Mitchell wrote recently, we could be in for a few significant retirement announcements in the not too distant future.The four greatest male players in modern tennis – who between them have won more than £400m across 16 years – arrive in Melbourne aware that their days as a dominant entity are numbered, if not already history.This, for example, is beat perfect. Murray’s advocacy for women’s sport and women’s tennis in particular is reflected in the tributes he’s receiving today. Adam Hirst has shared his favourite highlight from Andy Murray’s career, and you can to, via the contact details at the top of the page.“Favourite Murray Moment? All of him really. Just having a top-class British tennis player to enjoy, a top-class interviewee to listen to, and a top-class sportsman and human being to admire all these years. One moment that I enjoyed was when he’d defended the hell out of Tommy Robredo in the 2014 Valencia Final, and really shouldn’t have won it. Robredo waited for the collapsed Murray to meet him at the net, leaning over it and gave him the double bird with a wry smile on his face. It was lovely. And the Wimbledon win, Obviously. He did the rest for himself, I just enjoyed it. He won Wimbledon for all of us.”Lovely stuff Adam, this is quite superb. Thanks Mike. I won’t pretend to be anything other than downbeat. Andy Murray is ace.OK, duty calls for me, so I’ll hand you over to Jonathan Howcroft, who will steer through the rest of the reaction. Bye for now.If ever a single point, and a situation, were to sum up Murray as a player and a character, this is quite possibly it:Juan Martín del Potro, one of the foes Murray faced regularly over the years and who he beat in the 2016 Olympic final, refuses to believe it’s over.The tributes are running thick and fast. This is particularly lovely. “Andy achieved what I thought I would never see in my lifetime firstly seeing a British player win the US Open and then of course that unforgettable first Wimbledon,” emails Darren Downs. “I was always a big fan of his but it couldn’t compare to how big a fan my mum was. She would watch every match of his whatever time it was played. I can’t say she watched every minute because she would often have to disappear into another room when things got particularly tense as they so often did with him. When he won Wimbledon the pride she had was almost as if one of her own kids had done it.“Sadly she became seriously ill in 2015. She would still watch almost every match and as he wasn’t having a great time she kept telling me he would have his day again. She was convinced of it. In 2016 she was proved right and how. Sadly her favourite armchair was empty when he won Wimbledon the 2nd time and when he finally got to number 1 but I like to think she was looking down on events from a new favourite armchair. I don’t know if Andy realises just how much his achievements meant to so many of the British public but I can only thank him for the many joyful moments he gave to my mum during difficult times for her. He’ll be sorely missed.”After Murray called for female players to get equal billing on the show courts at Wimbledon in 2017, his words prompted the ’s Zoe Williams to write: Murray isn’t just an incredible athlete. His advocacy for gender equality in sport over the course of his career, and in particular in recent years, has been unrivalled. He will be sorely missed on the men’s circuit but his absence will be equally felt on the women’s side of the game. “A few Murray memories,” writes Max Sopel on email. “The fourth round win over Gasquet at Wimbledon in 08... typical Murray rollercoaster with a magical ending. Remember being on the tube in London for the final set, desperately wanting us to get overground to check the score! Also, the gold medal against Del Potro was pretty special, both of them in tears at the end. Beating Federer for gold a few months after losing the final to him at Wimbledon! Just so happy he won some slams... after losing five or so in a row the relief when he won the US open was huge! Legend and hope he commentates in retirement.”Consider those achievements listed by Niall earlier. And then consider Murray has played in an era when three of the greatest male players of all time have also been active. It’s really quite remarkable. And I think it’s widely accepted that if Murray had been born 10 years earlier or later, he too would have a bagful of major titles to his name. I’m not crying. You’re crying.Thanks Niall, and hello from Sydney. I’ll take up the reins for the next half hour or so as the sad news of Murray’s impending retirement begins to sink in. Feel free to send your thoughts over via email (mike.hytner@the) or Twitter (@mike_hytner). I’m going to hand over to Mike Hytner now, who will guide you through more reaction and Murray memories.Here are a few more quotes from Murray on the hip problems that have plagued him for the last 18 months, and why he’s decided to call time on his career:It got to a level where I didn’t recover from that match, pushed it over the edge. Having the operation would hopefully make it as good as possible. It didn’t help with the pain at all. There are certain things on the court I cannot really do properly now, but the pain is the driving factor. I can play with limitations, that’s not an issue, it’s having the limitations and also the pain is not allowing me to enjoy competing, training or any of the stuff I love about tennis. I have tried to deal with it, talked about it, but none of that makes my hip feel better, unfortunately. I wish it did, because it would be feeling brilliant right now.I’m not sure if anything Murray achieved was more extraordinary than winning the Davis Cup for Great Britain. It’s a team event, of course, but it felt like he carried the team to the trophy by sheer force of will. He also pushed his body to the limit for the cause. Here’s Jacob Steinberg reflecting on that victory back in 2015:Here’s Holly Lane with a lovely tribute:I’m absolutely devastated by this announcement, because it’s clear he has so much more to give, but his hip just won’t let him. I think we all hoped he would make this amazing comeback against all the odds, just because he’s Andy Murray, the consummate fighter.Like so many Brits, I’ve been watching him for years, and Wimbledon ‘13 was breathtaking, especially after his emotional final the year earlier. But really the highlights for me are all the little times he shows what a gent he is, both on and off court. His respect for his fellow competitors, how he mentors younger players, and the way he shuts down anyone who implies that female players aren’t deserving of the same respect (and pay) as the men. Sir Andy will be sorely missed. Murray had plenty of highs to go with the lows – and it was the failures along the way as he battled into the ‘big four’, as much as his later successes, that endeared him to the British public. Today’s announcement feels strange because we’re so used to seeing Murray get back up when he’s knocked down.Few had expected Murray to beat Nadal in the semi-finals in New York but he did, raising hopes he could somehow produce the same result against Federer in the final. Despite some flashes of resistance, he lost to the dominant Swiss in straight sets.Five times Murray reached the final of the year’s first major and five times he lost: 2010, 2011, 2013, 2015 and 2016. No one has lost that many times in a slam final without ever winning it at some stage. The closest he came was defeat in four sets in 2013 and 2015, both to\u0026nbsp Djokovic.A stellar year ended on something of a low note. He already had hip problems and he had withdrawn from the French Open in May so he finally took the decision to try and sort out the issues in time for the next season in order to defend his hard-won Wimbledon title.Eleven years into his professional career he broke new ground at Roland Garros. For so long he had failed to produce performances that matched his world ranking but then he reached the final in Paris. His old nemesis, Djokovic, was there, lying in wait again.Given his condition at Wimbledon in 2017, where he limped and lost to Sam Querrey in the quarters, it was clear something had to be done. Hip surgery wasn’t a surprise in early 2018, but the location – Melbourne – was and slow recovery meant he only played the US Open.Murray is known off-court for never being short of a quote or two you can be sure the punditry offers will be pouring in once he finally bids farewell to tennis. Here are some of his most memorable lines:“I don’t play in any tournaments to come second best.”“We Scots have a fierce pride in the things we do that others can never appreciate. I am the British No 1, but I would prefer to be the British No 1 from Scotland every time.” “People think I am unemotional because my voice is flat and a bit boring. It is unfortunate but it is just the way it is. The truth is, I have lots of emotions inside.” After winning his first Wimbledon title: “I worked so hard in that last game. It’s the hardest few points I’ve had to play in my life. My head was kind of everywhere. That last game will be the toughest game I’ll play in my career, ever.”“Contrary to my image, I do have a sense of humour.”It wasn’t so long ago that Murray was on top of the world – finally shaking his long-time rival, Novak Djokovic, from the summit of the world rankings after a stellar 2016. Both men pushed their bodies to the limit that season and have suffered since – but while Djokovic has returned to the pinnacle of the game, Murray has been unable to do the same. Here’s Kevin Mitchell with a nice piece from that era, which reminds us why Murray is so loved at home and around the world:Murray’s career in numbers: Courtesy of PA, here are some standout figures from Murray’s time in tennis:No 1 Murray became the first British singles player ever to officially be ranked world number one on November 7, 2016. 41 The number of weeks Murray spent on top of the rankings. Three grand slam titles 11 grand slam finals 45 career singles titles Two doubles titles – both with his brother, Jamie Nine singles titles in 2016, including five in a row to end the season as world number one Two Olympic singles gold medals 11 Murray won every rubber he contested to drive Great Britain to Davis Cup glory in 2015 663 Tour-level matches won $61,055,135 total career prize moneyThree BBC Sports Personality of the Year titles5,573 aces served 29 combined wins against Federer, Nadal and DjokovicAndy Roddick, the three-time Wimbledon finalist, is one of the first tennis greats to pay tribute to Murray, calling him one of the game’s “best tacticians in history”:Murray will retire with three grand slams, two Olympic golds and a total of 45 ATP career titles. Perhaps more than anything else, he’ll be remembered for doing what for so long had seemed impossible – ending Britain’s long wait for a men’s Wimbledon singles champion. Here’s Kevin Mitchell’s report from that glorious day back in 2013:Get in touchWe’ve listed some of Murray’s finest moments below – but please get in touch with your own personal favourites via via email, or tweet me – @niallmcveigh.Murray begins the year splitting from his coach Mark Petchey and replacing Tim Henman as British No 1 and goes on to claim more early-career landmarks: he beats Roger Federer for the first time, in Ohio, and wins his first ATP Tour event in San Jose, California, in front of Kim Sears, later Mrs Murray.Murray produces a straight-sets demolition of Roger Federer in the Olympic final at Wimbledon. He then goes on to win his first major, beating Novak Djokovic in New York in a five-set epic, finishing close to midnight, becoming the first British man since Fred Perry in the 1930s to win a singles slam title.Murray had raised hopes of emulating Perry at Wimbledon when he reached the final in 2012, only to come up against Roger Federer and a closed roof, which benefited the Swiss. A year later, however, on a boiling hot day at SW19, he faced down Novak Djokovic for the second time in three slam finals and won again, in straight sets, although he said he could hardly serve in the final game. He ended the 77-year wait for a British men’s singles champion, against the man considered the  best in the world at the time.The defence of his Wimbledon title in 2014 had not gone as planned, but two years later he showed he was back to his best. Against Milos Raonic in the final in SW19, he nullified the Canadian’s huge serve and cantered to victory in straight sets, leaving him one shy of Perry’s total of three Wimbledon wins.Murray had won gold in the 2012 Games on familiar turf but Rio de Janeiro presented different challenges, yet he overcame those to make Olympic history. He beat Juan Martín del Potro in five sets in the final and became the first man or woman to win consecutive singles tennis golds.Murray’s total career prize money from his singles and doubles successes combinedHere’s what Murray had to say at that dramatic press conference, having initially broken down when asked about his hip pain:“I’m not feeling good. I’ve been struggling for a long time. Been in a lot of pain for 20 months now. Pretty much done everything I could to make my hip feel better.“Wimbledon is where I would like to stop playing but I’m not certain I’ll be able to do that. I’m not certain I can play through the pain for another four or five months.”Andy Murray has shocked the tennis world by announcing that the upcoming Australian Open may be his final tournament. The former world No 1 has said he wants to bow out at Wimbledon this summer, but may not be able to continue beyond Melbourne.

Having everything that was good about Amazon’s Alexa voice assistant squeezed into a smaller package half the price of the bigger Echo, it was a no-brainer.But now the Echo Dot has some stiff competition from Google, in the form of the £50 Home Mini and its Assistant, and Amazon’s own second-generation Echo, which is now only £90.The Echo Dot is Amazon’s small, puck-like smart speaker with the firm’s Alexa voice assistant built in. New for the third generation is a softer, more rounded aesthetic with fabric sides. It is also slightly larger in all directions, measuring 99mm in diameter and 43mm tall.At the back is a circular power socket, replacing the microUSB socket of the old Dot, and a standard 3.5mm analogue socket for connecting to a stereo. On top you have the volume buttons, action button and the microphone mute button.You can also use Bluetooth to stream from the Dot to other speakers or from your phone or other device to the Dot to use it as Bluetooth speaker.The updated design is joined by an improved speaker. The sound is fired out from the fabric sides of the new Dot, instead of the plastic top of the old model, projecting sound further into the room making it much better for music.The quality of the speaker has also been upgraded. It won’t beat larger speakers, but for the money it sounds pretty good, edging out Google’s Home Mini.The mids are punchy, the highs relatively crisp and while there’s no real bass to speak of, the new Dot sounds relatively rounded for a small speaker.Feed it guitars and vocals from something like the live version of Hotel California by the Eagles from Hell Freezes Over and you’re greeted with a warm, inviting tone. Classical tracks such as Jupiter from Holst’s the Planets sound fairly rounded too. The Dot struggles with bass-driven electronica, but coped better than expected with Dr Dre’s Still D.R.E. despite its pumping bassline.The Dot can also get pretty loud, although not quite as loud as Google’s Home Mini, and the audio starts to distort in high-energy tracks at maximum volume.With smart speakers, the hardware you buy is only half the story: they live or die by the capability of the voice assistant within them.The Dot’s Alexa performance is first rate, with its four-microphone array being able to hear you over things like the cooker hood going full pelt in the kitchen or when playing music at maximum volume even if you do have to shout a bit. Alexa also sounds good through the Dot’s speakers.But where Alexa was the only game in town, it’s now a two-horse race between Alexa and Google Assistant. For most things Alexa and Assistant are on a level playing field, particularly if you’re not entirely integrated into Google’s ecosystem already.Smart home control, music playback, podcasts, news briefings, playing radio stations, setting multiple alarms, timers and various other little bits like that all work great.Alexa has a lot of third-party “skills” (apps), including those from news publishers such as the , games such as Escape the Room, utilities such as National Rail app and silly things such Star Trek – Red Alert, so you can pretend you’re on the starship Enterprise.You can change Alexa’s wake word too, which is the word it listens out for when dormant before activating. “Alexa” is the default, but options include Echo, Computer or Amazon - helpful if you have anyone called Alex in your house and want to avoid accidental activations of either the Dot or the human.Where Google’s Assistant has the edge is in interpreting speech when you mess up your questions, or when you issue multiple commands at once such as “turn off the Christmas tree and the living room lights”. Google can also answer a greater range of questions than Alexa.The new Echo Dot is a slight improvement over the old one in every way. It’s more attractive, sounds better, hears you just as well, still has a 3.5mm socket and Bluetooth audio in and out.It isn’t a patch on the larger Echo speakers, which are almost twice the price, but just about beats its closest rival, the Google Home Mini, on sound and connectivity.At £50, or frequently £30 on deals, you get a lot of smart speaker for the money with the Echo Dot. But where the original Echo Dot was a no-brainer, the decision now comes down to whether you want Alexa or Google Assistant in your tiny smart speaker, which is a much tougher call to make.Pros: can always hear you, small but loud enough, great device support, clear when muted, activity can been seen from across the room, Bluetooth, 3.5mm audio socketCons: music distorts at max volume, no real bass, general knowledge not quite as good as Google Assistant This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Trailing his series This Week, which has to wait to get on air until Bruce’s show is over at 11.45pm, Neil concluded a metaphor about traffic jams with the words, “Honk if you hate Question Time,” an apparent resumption of the bad blood between the Thursday night rivals, for which Neil has been ticked off by BBC bosses in the past.Bruce’s opening link, in which she declared “it’s lovely to be here!”, like a mayor opening a garden party, raised fears that she was going to soften the show. But her follow-up questions to the three politician panellists - James Cleverly for the government, Emily Thornberry for the opposition, and Liberal Democrat Jo Swinson - were as brisk and persistent as Dimbleby’s.Bruce could do nothing, though, about the fact that it was a case of new year, new presenter, but same old format and subject matter.The only sign of a tweak to the usual proceedings was that Bruce seemed slightly keener to include the people. “Let’s hear from the audience!” made an early bid to become her catchphrase, those interludes introduced by a firm “Wait a minute!” to the panellists. And wearing distinctive clothing seems to be the trick to catching her eye. She called on “the man in the hat”, and members of the public wearing a yellow scarf and jacket respectively. She was so keen to be inclusive that her pen, waving invitingly at the audience, often intruded in the corner of the shot.But, if the public is going to be more involved in the discussion, there surely need to be fewer than five panellists. Comedian Nish Kumar spent the first 22 minutes draining his water glass, before being invited to make the first of only three contributions in the hour. The other non-Westminster presence – journalist Melanie Phillips – was also called on so rarely that the camera caught her at one point with her head in her hands on the desk.Too many guests faced too few topics. One consequence of Theresa May delaying the Commons Brexit vote from early December was that Bruce was stuck with exactly the same questions as Dimbleby had fielded in his farewell show: Could the PM win and was there a plan B if she didn’t? Kumar lamented that, on his three Question Time appearances in the last year, the questions had been the same each time: “I’m stuck in an endless loop!”The fate of May’s deal occupied 40 of the available 60 minutes, leaving time for only one other matter: the rise in knife crime in London, the city in which Bruce’s debut was taking place.The new presenter felt fresh and effective, but the BBC should have taken advantage of the succession to shake up the structure as well, and Bruce can only truly be judged when she has some non-Brexit subject matter.As she moves on to Derby and Winchester in the next two weeks, the problem for the host of Antiques Roadshow may be that she has been handed what was sold as a priceless television treasure but which, on close inspection, looks like a rather faded and wobbly relic."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8996ac88b93eecb7896ad1e21081b693c458df00/208_0_2688_1613/master/2688.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bcfdb562995be36a982a4dc340493b57","title":"none of this is fair to you the five worst us government shutdowns","story":"The current halt could soon become the longest that has left workers out of pocket, beating Bill Clinton’s battle with Newt GingrichThe US government is about to conclude its third week of a partial shutdown, with 800,000 federal employees sent home or working without pay.Government shutdowns occur when Congress refuses to pass, or the president refuses to sign, a spending bill, cutting off funding to federal departments, like the FBI and parks services.Since 1976, when new budget laws giving Congress more power were enacted, there have been more than 20 gaps in budget funding, though not all of them have led to federal employees being furloughed (meaning sent home on unpaid leave, or working without pay). One shutdown in 1978 under President Jimmy Carter lasted 18 days after Carter vetoed a bill that included funding for a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, but federal employees continued to work and be paid.Most shutdowns have lasted just days – Ronald Reagan’s administration faced eight shutdowns lasting less than four days, three of which led to employees being furloughed. Here are the five longest shutdowns in US history that left staff without pay.If Trump’s shutdown continues through the weekend it will become the longest in US history, beating one held during Bill Clinton’s presidency that lasted 21 days. The 1995-1996 shutdown occurred when the president vetoed the budget passed by a Congress led by then-Speaker Newt Gingrich, which sought to rein in spending on health and education, amongst other things.The shutdown ran from 16 December, 1995 to 6 January, 1996 and followed an earlier, related shutdown.Eventually, after concessions on both sides, the shutdown was resolved and Clinton’s approval ratings shot up.Trump’s shutdown began on 22 December and has been caused by a standoff between the president, who is demanding $5.6bn for his border wall, and Congress, which is refusing to sign off on spending bills giving him that money.As a result of the shutdown, 800,000 federal employees have been sent home or are working without pay and Friday will be the first day that many employees will miss their paychecks.Trump used a televised address to argue for the need for a wall to increase border security and has told reporters that while he would prefer to work with Congress on a deal, he would use his emergency powers to circumvent Congress if it could not come to agreement.“I have the absolute right to declare a national emergency,” Trump said on Thursday, contradicting legal scholars who have questioned the president’s right to take such action in this case.This shutdown (1-17 October) was caused when House Republicans offered continuing resolutions aimed at delaying or defunding the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare. At the time, Obama wrote a letter to the “dedicated and hard-working employees of the United States government” in which he apologised for the disruption to their work, writing: “None of this is fair to you.”This shutdown, lasting 14-19 November, was the first of two related shutdowns, the second of which lasted 21 days. In this initial five-day shutdown, 800,000 workers were furloughed.Monica Lewinsky testified that it was during this November shutdown, when many paid employees had been sent home, that she and Clinton began their sexual relationship.Like the current shutdown, the first shutdown of 2018 was on the subject of immigration. The shutdown began at midnight on 20 January after Republicans and Democrats could not agree on protective measures for people under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) program. Almost 700,000 federal employees were believed to have been furloughed during the shutdown."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58a8ff29f33f5e74e23f7eb1124efb954a051a65/0_8_4400_2641/master/4400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e4bc9d74c6b87f197d1da12991c5d94f","title":"venezuela president nicolas maduro begins second term","story":"President Nicolás Maduro shrugged off a tempest of international condemnation to begin his second term in officeThe Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro, has castigated the European Union and accused Washington of waging an imperialist “world war” against his crisis-stricken nation, as he shrugged off a tempest of international condemnation to begin his second term in office.Maduro, who inherited Hugo Chávez’s Bolivarian revolution after his 2013 death, has overseen a calamitous decline in his country’s fortunes and was re-elected in disputed elections last May.A shower of domestic and international censure met the 56-year-old’s swearing in at the supreme court in Caracas on Thursday.The United States secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, condemned Maduro’s “illegitimate usurpation of power” and vowed to “use the full weight of US economic and diplomatic power to press for the restoration of Venezuelan democracy”.Latin American governments also denounced the inauguration, with Paraguay breaking off diplomatic ties and Argentina’s president, Mauricio Macri, branding Maduro “the victimizer who plays victim”.Maduro defied those attacks during a feisty 80-minute address to fellow chavistas and international leftist allies including the Nicaraguan president, Daniel Ortega, Bolivia’s Evo Morales and Cuba’s Miguel Díaz-Canel.“We are a true, profound, popular and revolutionary democracy … not a democracy of the elites … of super-millionaires who go into power to enrich their economic group and to rob the people,” he claimed. “And I, Nicolás Maduro Moros, am a genuinely and profoundly democratic president.”Maduro, who is facing growing regional pressure as Latin American politics swerves back to the right, claimed his country was “at the centre of a world war” being waged by US imperialists and their “satellite governments” in Latin America.He assailed Colombia’s president, Iván Duque, and Brazil’s new far-right leader, Jair Bolsonaro, calling him a “fascist”. Maduro also attacked the European Union.“Stop, Europe … Don’t come again with your old colonialism. Don’t come again with your old aggression. Don’t come again, old Europe, with your old racism,” he said. “There’s been enough enslavement – the looting that you subjected us to for 500 years … Respect Venezuela … or sooner rather than later you’ll pay the historical price.”But there was also public acceptance that chavistas – implicated in a succession of eye-watering corruption scandals – had a hand in Venezuela’s collapse. “I want a new start for the Bolivarian Revolution … I want us to correct the many mistakes we have committed,” Maduro said, calling corrupt chavistas a greater threat than US imperialism. He promised “a great moral revolution” and “a profound correction of the mistakes of the Bolivarian revolution” in his second term.“We are the heirs of a great legacy. We cannot fail and we will not fail,” Maduro concluded to loud applause.Amid heavy security, red-clad chavistas gathered outside the court in downtown Caracas, surrounded by posters reading: “Yo soy presidente” – “I’m the president”.“I identify with Maduro because he’s a humble man, like me. My ideology is what brings me here today,” said Jesús Alcalá, a 44-year-old craftsman.Others were obliged to appear. “I was forced to come today,” said one 30-year-old housing ministry employee and who asked not to be named for fear of dismissal. “I’m not happy with this situation,” she confided. “I have three kids and I really struggle to feed them. I’m planning to leave the country this year.”On state television channels the Socialist party faithful lined up to defend their embattled leader. “Lots of countries are saying that our president is illegitimate – they are wrong,” a woman named as Sory Ramos told Telesur.María Alejandra Díaz, a member of Venezuela’s powerful constituent assembly, urged Maduro’s opponents to reject what she called foreign plots to unseat her leader.“Do not invite the demon into your home. Never ask a foreign power to intervene or invade,” she warned. “Economically we are in a death spiral,” said Phil Gunson, a Caracas-based expert for Crisis Group. “There is a real sense that the whole country is grinding to a halt – and a cold analysis has to reach the conclusion that it is impossible to go on like this.”But with the opposition “shattered into a thousand pieces” Gunson admitted there was no sign of even a midterm political or economic fix. “Some people say the government may collapse because it has collapsed the whole country and there is no way it can continue. But if there is nothing to take over from it then even if it’s collapsed it will remain in power.”David Smilde, a Venezuela expert from the Washington Office on Latin America advocacy group, said Maduro hoped forging “an alternative network” of partnerships with authoritarian countries including China, Russia and Turkey would enable him to weather the storm.“They think … that if they can just keep holding on, within a couple of years they can wait this out and countries will get tired of pressuring Venezuela eventually things will normalise. I think they’re just trying really to hang it out without any great master plan.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a04a308ed570ac5609523715eb9c5cdc425ff018/374_269_4126_2476/master/4126.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ba977efa332c7119cca22188b3cf2278","title":"kabila victor democratic republic of the congo contested election tshisekedi","story":"Claims provisional winner Tshisekedi has done deal with former ruler may be more than sour grapesIn the Democratic Republic of the Congo, an election is not a single decisive event, but just one part of a never-ending struggle to gain and keep power in which living to fight another day is as important as landing a knockout punch.Of the half dozen or so major players a year ago, only two or three remain standing.Felix Tshisekedi, named as the surprise, provisional winner of last month’s much delayed presidential vote, is the 55-year-old son of the country’s most respected opposition leader. However, he has never held high office or even a managerial role, and his Belgian professional qualifications have been questioned by opponents.Tshisekedi is the leader of the Union for Democracy and Social Progress (UDPS), DRC’s oldest and largest opposition party. Critics say he is unproven, inexperienced and lacks the charisma of his father. “His father was a man of the country. The son is very limited,” Valentin Mubake, former secretary-general of Tshisekedi’s party told the  last month.In 2008, he became national secretary for external relations and was elected to the national assembly in 2011 as representative for Mbuji-Mayi, the country’s third city. However, he never took up his seat as he did not formally recognise his father Étienne’s 2011 election defeat to Joseph Kabila.He inherited the UDPS leadership when Étienne – who spent 35 years leading the opposition but never won office – died in 2017. Tens of thousands thronged the streets when Tshisekedi visited his political stronghold of Mbuji-Mayi, a southern city, in early elections, chanting slogans calling on the father of five to save the nation.But Tshisekedi’s apparent victory is contested – not by the outgoing president, Kabila, whose own hand-picked candidate was soundly defeated, but by the opposition rival, Martin Fayulu, who came a close second.The few reliable surveys of pre-poll voting intentions make it clear that Fayulu was the favourite by a considerable margin. The conclusions of 40,000 observers deployed by the church on the day of the election are that he won.Fayulu, who has denounced the result as an “electoral coup”, is not a “fils de” (“son of”) like Tshisekedi and many other dynastic politicians across the continent. He is a former business executive and 30-year veteran of politics who has earned a reputation as brave, honest and effective. More importantly, perhaps, he also has the backing of political heavyweights Jean-Pierre Bemba and Moise Katumbi, both forced into effective exile overseas and unable to contend the polls.“Fayulu came very fast from more or less nowhere to become this great people’s champion, but it is unclear if he has the big organisation and depth of support he needs now. We are about to find out,” said Ben Shepherd, an expert in the DRC at London’s Chatham House.The real winner may be the outgoing president. Kabila, 47, took power in 2001 on the assassination of his father Laurent, and ceded only reluctantly to regional powers’ pressure to hold elections. He was banned from standing by the constitution’s two-term limit.Kabila has made no secret of his continuing political ambitions, which is one reason why so many analysts say Fayulu’s claims that Tshisekedi has done a deal with the DRC’s former ruler may be more than sour grapes.Many noted that Fayulu’s campaign suffered significantly more harassment than Tshisekedi’s, and that the latter’s rhetoric towards erstwhile enemies underwent a dramatic change in recent days.Tshisekedi’s camp has acknowledged contact with Kabila’s representatives since the vote but denied there had been any deal and said talks were aimed at ensuring a peaceful transition“This is not a bad result at all for the ruling party,” said Stephanie Wolters, an analyst at the Institute for Security Studies, in South Africa. “It will mean a very soft landing for Kabila. With Tshisekedi, they don’t have to give up anything. Kabila gets to walk away looking good and the elite gets to stick around.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Psychiatric nurses\u0026rsquo union says it will join wave of strikes by nurses next monthNoel Clancy\u0026rsquos wife and daughter were killed in a crash with an unaccompanied learnerDatabase tracking insurance claims will be running by end of year, says MinisterMinister outlines plans for regulating private security companies involved in evictionsSocial network dubbed \u0026lsquoTinder for teens\u0026rsquo allows for live streaming of video and chatA \u0026lsquotime-limited backstop is not a backstop\u0026rsquo says Sinn F\u0026eacutein on interpreted one-year capMinister says preparation of the Civil Registration Bill 2019 has been approvedEmergency services are at the scene of the Shannon Key West Hotel which closed in 2011The injured girl has been taken to University Hospital LetterkennyResearchers at TCD led \u0026lsquoGaming for Peace\u0026rsquo project which aims to teach co-operation skillsBTYSTE: Fifth-year student tests metals for months first-years make bioplastic from milkOfficials from Garda, Defence Forces, Irish Aviation Authority meet to discuss threats to State\u0026rsquos airports\u0026lsquoMeningitis is a lethal disease.

The Clancys drowned as rescuers could not open the car doors in time to get them out.Ms Gleeson later pleaded guilty to dangerous driving causing the deaths of Mr Clancy’s wife and daughter, and she was given a three-year suspended jail sentence and banned from driving for 15 years by Judge Seán Ó Donnabháin at Cork Circuit Criminal Court in November 2016.Mr Clancy, who joined in the attempted rescue of the victims without realising who they were, recently participated in an RSA ad for its Crashed Lives series, focusing on his own personal tragedy, where he speaks poignantly about how he didn’t recognise his wife and daughter as they were taken from the car.“The undertaker asked me what coffin would we lower first. I told him we would lower Geraldine first and then place Louise back in her arms. I will never see my wife and daughter again,” says Mr Clancy in the ad, which has been broadcast on the main TV channels and screened in cinemas over Christmas.It has generated a lot of debate locally and online. One Facebook user, Liam Evans, received a lot of support for a post where he described the minute-long RSA ad as “being in extremely bad taste”.“While nobody disputes the fact this man suffered a massive loss, it was as a result of a terrible accident. The other driver has been convicted by the court and no doubt carries a huge burden of guilt. Is it fair that she must be repeatedly reminded by prime-time television. Will this save even one life? I doubt it.”However, Mr Clancy said he made no apologies for the emotional nature of the ad, while stressing that his motivation was not to seek any retribution on Ms Gleeson but simply to highlight a recent change in the law that allowed gardaí to confiscate cars driven by unaccompanied learner drivers.“The idea was that it would be hard-hitting. The director and the two researchers came down here and I said to them I wanted it to be as hard-hitting as possible. I didn’t want it to be some bland, in one ear, out the other ear job.”“This was never about retribution,” he stressed. Rather, “I wanted parents and car owners especially to sit up and take notice of this ad.”“It’s too late for me and my wife and daughter, but what I set out to do was try to spare other families the hell that was inflicted on our family.”Mr Clancy said he found making the ad extremely harrowing as he returned to the scene of the crash near his home with gardaí controlling traffic as they did on the day of the tragedy. He conceded he found it difficult to watch the advert but said he was not aware of any local negativity in Kilworth to it.In Kilworth village, locals were reluctant to speak on the record. Canon Donal Leahy declined to comment, saying he knew both Clancy and Gleeson families well. “This was a terrible tragedy and I’m certainly not going to get involved one way or another,” he said politely but firmly.One woman, who didn’t wish to be named, said it was the intensely local nature of the tragedy with the Clancy and Gleeson families living less than 1km apart that added to the poignancy of the event, but she rejected any suggestion that the hard-hitting nature of the RSA ad had led to any split or ide in the community.“It would be a lot easier for people to support the ad if it involved people from two different towns or counties, but it’s the fact that people know both sides and know that nothing was done deliberately or out of badness that has suddenly made it an issue and people are talking about it.“It was a tragedy at every level for both families. I think everyone knows a vulnerable kid who learned to drive that way but there were endless coincidences that led to the tragedy and then for Noel to come upon it only added to the sadness of it, losing his wife and daughter,” she said.“So I don’t think the community is split over this. I believe everyone wants to support everyone in this. It’s just it’s so close to us. To me there are other ads that are just as traumatic but we don’t know the people and the pain behind the tragedy whereas we do here and the ad reminds us of that.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3754015.1547153431!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ministers face travel lockdown over d%C3%A1il votes","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWhile one source described the conversation with the Taoiseach as ‘housekeeping’, another said that Ministers were effectively told that they need to do better. Photograph: Niall CarsonPA Ministers have been told to cancel future mid-week travel plans and to make sure they are present for votes in the Dáil after being warned by the Taoiseach and Chief Whip that the Government is losing too many votes. An email has been sent to Ministers informing them that they must be present in the Dáil on Wednesdays and Thursdays in case votes are called, and the issue was also raised by the Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Chief Whip Seán Kyne during a pre-Cabinet discussion last week. The practice of pairing will also be stopped.While one source described the conversation with the Taoiseach as “housekeeping”, another said that Ministers were effectively told that they need to do better. “It’s an effective lockdown to make sure that we make the votes. We got an email from the Chief Whip’s office as well saying that, from now on, we will have to be around on Wednesdays and Thursdays so Ministers can no longer travel around the country mid-week on engagements. “Some of it is Brexit-related, but the main reason is that we are losing votes unnecessarily. A very strong line is being taken on this. The only excuse for not being there during those times that will be accepted is if we are out of the country. It’s a clampdown.” Last May, the Government lost a series of votes on data protection legislation including one on the digital age of consent. Fifteen Fine Gael members were not in the chamber as the Dáil voted to accept 16 as the digital age of consent with the support of Fianna Fáil, Sinn Féin and Labour. The vote was 56 to 51. According to the official Oireachtas record, Ministers who were not present for the vote included Paschal Donohoe, Heather Humphreys and Michael Creed. Ms Humphreys was paired, an arrangement whereby a TD of one party agrees with a TD of an opposing party not to vote, giving both TDs the opportunity to be elsewhere. She was on a trade mission. Last October, the Government lost a vote calling for a better response to the housing crisis. The Dáil vote was lost 83 to 43 with Fianna Fáil supporting the motion – which called for the housing crisis to be declared an emergency and for rent controls to be introduced. Ministers who were not present included Ms Humphreys, Mr Donohoe and Charlie Flanagan. Ms Humphreys was again paired as she was at an EU meeting. Mr Flanagan was in the Seanad dealing with the Judicial Appointments Bill.Last December, the Government lost another Dáil vote on an anti-eviction Bill which would ban landlords from evicting people into homelessness. The Government lost a Dáil vote on that Bill by 45 votes to 39, with Fianna Fáil abstaining. Ministers who were not present for the vote included Mr Donohoe and Katherine Zappone (both of whom were paired with other TDs). The Dáil resumes next Tuesday for normal business, but the Government is on alert for a potential no-deal Brexit which would require a large amount of emergency legislation to be passed, effectively blocking the passage of other Bills. About 45 laws would need to be passed by the Oireachtas in the event of a no-deal Brexit, but Mr Varadkar has indicated that these could be condensed into four pieces of primary legislation. The Cabinet will next week discuss Brexit planning for ports, airports and medical supplies."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3754106.1547152262!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"sinn f%C3%A9in defends decision to attend maduro inauguration","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tNicolas Maduro poses after being sworn-in for the second term as Venezuela’s president  in Caracas on Wednesday.  Sinn Féin has defended its attendance at the event. Photograph: Miguel GutierrezEPA.Sinn Féin has defended a decision to send two senior party members to the inauguration of Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro. The party has been criticised over the presence of MLA Conor Murphy and its general secretary Dawn Doyle at the event. Mr Maduro’s re-election has been denounced as illegitimate both domestically and abroad. He replaced Hugo Chavez after his death in 2013 and won a six-year term last year despite hyperinflation, chronic food shortages and a severe economic contraction hitting the country. He blames an “economic war” led by the US and local opposition adversaries for the country’s woes. The vast majority of the opposition boycotted last year’s vote on the grounds that it was rigged in favor of Mr Maduro, noting a host of irregularities, including Socialist Party activists offering monetary payments to voters.However, he continues to enjoy support from the armed forces, leaving him with few serious challenges at home despite the international outcry.Niall Collins, Fianna Fáil’s foreign affairs spokesman, said Sinn Féin’s presence at the inauguration was “just another example” of why the party is “unfit for government”.He said that since Mr Maduro came to power in 2013 there had been an increase in human rights violations. “Mr Maduro has stifled dissent, targeted the opposition and has presided over the collapse of the economy which has led to sky-rocketing inflation and a shortage of food and medicines,” he said. “Venezuelans are leaving the country in their thousands and yet Sinn Féin continues to support the Maduro regime and saw fit to send representatives to his inauguration.”He added: “In the aftermath of the election the European Council issued a statement stating that the ‘presidential and regional polls went ahead without national agreement on an electoral calendar and without complying with the minimum international standards for a credible process, not respecting political pluralism, democracy, transparency and rule of law’.” However, Mr Murphy defended his decision to travel, stating that Mr Maduro had been “democratically elected”. “This is a particularly difficult and challenging period for the citizens of Venezuela, ” he said. “We will use our presence in Venezuela to express our continuing solidarity to the people supporting their legitimate demands to build a just and equal society free from foreign intervention.” The country’s pro-government supreme court, which has largely supplanted the opposition-run congress, swore him in following a welcome with a symphony orchestra and cheering supporters waving miniature yellow, blue and red Venezuelan flags.

Some said Mr Maduro should do more to crack down on business leaders for raising prices.“Sometimes its hard to find food because businesses hide it and then say its the president’s fault, even though we all know that’s a lie,” said Graciela Laya (43), a homemaker, at a rally near the supreme court.He won re-election last year despite hyperinflation, chronic food shortages and a severe economic contraction. He blames an “economic war” led by the United States and local opposition adversaries for the country’s woes.The vast majority of the opposition boycotted last year’s vote on the grounds that it was rigged in favour of Mr Maduro, noting a host of irregularities including Socialist Party tents in which activists offered monetary payments to voters.The United States and many Latin American and European countries condemned the vote, leaving Mr Maduro backed by just a handful of stalwart allies from leftist governments.“It is time for Venezuela to begin a transitional process that can restore the constitutional, democratic order by holding free and fair elections that respect the will of the Venezuelan people,” US secretary of state Mike Pompeo wrote in statement.Paraguay’s president Mario Abdo said his country was shutting its embassy and pulling out all diplomatic personnel due to what it called a “rupture of constitutional order” caused by the inauguration.Most other countries plan to maintain their embassies and diplomatic relations with Venezuela, according to sources, but most European and Latin American countries did not send diplomats to the inauguration.Opposition activists have called for protests on Thursday. Authorities have responded by filling streets with police checkpoints and rifle-toting troops.“This inauguration is illegal,” said Jose Navarro (17), a student at a small anti-government protest in the restive western city of San Cristobal. “And this military deployment is also an offense to the constitution.” – Reuters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3754102.1547152052!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"may tempts big unions in bid to avert defeat on brexit vote","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tOn the day British prime minister Theresa May met Japanese PM Shinzo Abe the embattled Mrs May reached out to two big unions in a bid to build support ahead of next week’s meaningful vote. Photograph: Getty ImagesBritish prime minister Theresa May called the leaders of two of Britain’s biggest unions to seek support for her Brexit deal after her government indicated it would support an amendment to protect labour and environmental standards. MPs will vote on the Brexit deal next Tuesday and the prime minister’s calls to the leaders of Unite and the GMB were part of an effort to win the backing of Labour MPs.GMB general secretary Tim Roache said he welcomed the call but remains opposed to the prime minister’s Brexit deal.“After nearly three years I’m glad the prime minister finally picked up the phone. As you would expect, I was very clear about GMB’s position – the deal on the table isn’t good enough and non-binding assurances on workers’ rights won’t cut it. If the deal genuinely did the job for GMB members, our union would support it. But it doesn’t,” he said.MPs voted this week to require Mrs May to outline her Plan B for Brexit within days if, as expected, she loses next week’s vote. A majority of MPs also voted this week to rule out a no-deal Brexit, but the prime minister said on Thursday that her deal was the only alternative.“The only way to avoid no deal is to have a deal and to agree a deal. And the deal that is on the table, the deal that is the deal that the EU has made clear is the only deal. There’s an issue that’s been raised about the backstop, and we are continuing to work with the EU on that particular issue, but there is a good deal on the table and for those who want to avoid no deal then backing the deal is the thing to do,” she said.Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe said during a visit to Downing Street that the whole world was watching Britain’s withdrawal from the EU. He expressed support for Mrs May’s deal, which he said was necessary to protect the 150,000 jobs in Britain provided by Japanese businesses.“That is why we truly hope that a no-deal Brexit will be avoided, and in fact that is the whole wish of the whole world.“Japan is in total support of the draft withdrawal agreement worked out between the EU and prime minister May which provides for transition to ensure legal stability for businesses that have invested into this country,” he said.Two Conservative MPs said on Thursday that they are dropping their opposition to Mrs May’s deal and would vote for it next week. George Freeman said he would “with a heavy heart, on Tuesday, vote for this deal because we’re now in the dying stages and no deal is unconscionable”.But with dozens of Conservative Brexiteers and the DUP’s 10 MPs promising to oppose it, the prime minister needs to persuade a number of Labour MPs to back her deal.The government is prepared to accept an amendment to protect labour and environmental standards tabled by a group of Labour MPs who represent constituencies that backed Brexit.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward.

These can result in companies being fined up to $525,000 (£291,000) and the poster being fined up to $105,000 (£58,273).Asked about whether the government was considering the Australian model, Baroness Williams said: “One of the things that we always do is look to see what other countries are doing and certainly we are looking into it in the white paper.“Nothing is off the table in terms of what we are looking at in terms of the white paper.”Her comments come as the minister also said social media companies needed to do more to stop people with facial disfigurement and visible conditions being abused online.The charity Changing Faces, which campaigns for people visible differences, said many had experienced abuse online with some having their picture taken in public so they can be mocked on social media.Baroness Williams, who is working with the charity on the issue, said: “I think the responses (from social media companies) are sporadic. Just because something doesn’t meet a legal threshold there are still the terms of user conditions that they have.“Also I think for the social media companies there is a reputational risk here. Social media was actually developed for very positive reasons and we don’t want it to become a platform which certain people can’t go near because of some of the bile that is spat out with a cloak of anonymity.”Becky Hewitt, the CEO of Changing Faces, said social media could be a positive place for people with visible conditions, but that abuse was putting them off.That charity has found that a third do not use their photo on their profile and that some people had had their online photos taken and turned into hurtful memes.She added: “One of the things that people often talk to us about is people taking their photos and without their permission when they are out and about.“So one of our champions talks about a time that she was in the car with her brother and her mum and someone stuck a phone in to get a photo of her and then that can be used on social media as a form of bullying. It is those kind of things that are quite common.”There have been some positive steps taken by social media companies to combat the abuse, such as by Twitter, which has now given Changing Faces special status to report incidents.However Ms Hewitt said many people facing abuse still felt a sense of “resignation” when it came to social media companies taking action.The charity is calling for the government to officially recognise abuse against people with visible conditions in the white paper.Natalie Ambersley, a 36-year-old PA from London who has the skin condition vitiligo, told the : “People don’t realise how damaging and upsetting it can be for that person, so social media platforms should make it a priority.“It can have a really negative impact on how people see themselves.”Department for Culture, Media \u0026amp SportPlease review our commenting policyWet wipes to receive \u0026#39fine to flush\u0026#39 kitemarkLoyal broadband and TV customers paying £6,000 loyalty penalty every ten years Half of failed asylum seekers remain in UK illegally, says ex-immigration chiefHigh fibre diet can cut risk of early death by one third: Lancet studyAmber Rudd scraps plans to extend two-child benefits cap to another 15,000 familiesWhatsApp groups for parents become overrun with \u0026#39vitriolic tirades\u0026#39,  leading headmaster warnsJeff Bezos \u0026#39forced to announce orce\u0026#39 ahead of story about 8-month affair with Fox presenterComment: Jaguar Land Rover has many challenges -

What assumptions are they based on? And what\u0026nbspreal significance does any of it have? asks Ben ChuClick to followThe IndependentChina and India will be the two biggest economies in the world by 2030, according to a report by analysts at Standard Chartered bank.The US will be a distant third and the UK will not even be in the top 10.Countries such as Indonesia, Turkey, Egypt and Brazil will all be higher than us on the list.But how plausible are these predictions? What assumptions are they based on? And what\u0026nbspreal significance does any of it have?The answer is Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and the exchange rate used is something called Purchasing Power Parity\u0026nbsp(PPP).For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialStandard Chartered’s projections suggest the size of the Chinese economy in 2030 on this measure will be $64.2 trillion, India’s will be $46.3 and the United States’ will be just $31 trillion.A US dollar generally goes much further in poorer countries than in richer ones – something anyone who has, for instance, eaten out in Thailand or bought something from a market stall while on holiday in Morocco will know.When one makes a statistical adjustment for this fact of erging purchasing power, the measured size of a less developed economy rises. This is GDP at PPP.Using the measure, China is already larger than the US, having surpassed America in 2015.And Indian output at PPP actually surpassed that of the UK way back in 1995.Is there another way of measuring the size of an economy then?Yes. One could use simple market exchange rates.By this measure the US is still today the world’s biggest economy, with a $7 trillion lead over China.Using market exchange rates rather than PPP would also most likely change the 2030 picture.The International Monetary Fund\u0026nbspdoes not forecast beyond 2023, but at this date the Fund thinks the US will still be the world’s largest economy at market exchange rates and that the UK will still have a comfortable lead over the likes of Indonesia, Turkey, Brazil, Russia and the rest with little evidence of catchup.India, however, will surpass the UK even at market exchange rates in the coming years.Which is the better measure?Views are ided. Some economists argue market exchange rates give a better indication\u0026nbspof the relative importance of national economies in the global trade and financial system.This is certainly the measure that financial traders mostly use.The PPP adjustment is also based on global surveys to measure relative purchasing power which are conducted only\u0026nbspirregularly and infrequently and which are inevitably\u0026nbspsketchy.But other economists\u0026nbspargue that PPP gives a better indication of shifts in a developing country’s domestic consumer demand.“PPP is generally regarded as a better measure of overall wellbeing,” says the IMF.Yet, leaving aside this debate, the important thing to recognise is that neither measure gives an indication of average living standards in each country, of a country’s general level of prosperity.The reason why China is larger than the US at PPP exchange rates is because it has a population four times larger.If one measures GDP at PPP per person a very different picture emerges, with China on $18,000 and the US on $63,000.And the UK is doing far better than India with a GDP at PPP per capita of $46,000 versus just $7,800.Moreover, on the IMF’s projections over the next five years there is little sign of catchup on this metric between the US and the UK and those developing world countries. Not even China gets close.We can pretty safely predict that people in the developed world will, on average, still be much better off than those in developing countries in 2030.How plausible are these projections?Standard Chartered says its forecasts are “underpinned by one key principle: countries’ share of world GDP should eventually converge with their share of the world’s population, driven by the convergence of per-capita GDP between advanced and emerging economies”.This isn’t unreasonable. As developing countries deploy the productivity boosting technologies of the rich world, they should, in theory, become more productive and their growth rates should be more rapid.This is why China has had a double digit GDP annual growth rate for the past 20 years but growth rates in Europe and the US have been below 3 per cent.And ultimately countries with bigger populations should have bigger national economies, whether measured by market exchange rates or PPP.Yet, assuming an uninterrupted catchup path for poorer countries is questionable, crises are inevitable. A few years ago many economists were projecting rapid growth in Brazil, but instead the country fell into a savage recession. One cannot rule out such a temporary reversal for China or India.There has also been a clear tendency for developing countries to get stuck in a “middle income\u0026nbsptrap”\u0026nbspwhere, after rapid growth up to a certain level, developing countries seem unable to make the leap to developed world per capita incomes.Indeed, avoiding this trap has become an obsession for Chinese policymakers in recent years. They are not assuming a straight line to prosperity, even if some western bank analysts are.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A horrible recession followed hot on its heels. So if\u0026nbspyou\u0027re inclined to run and hide under the covers no one would blame you.But there were some bright spots. The BRC figures showed sales of food, toys and computers were up, which helps to explain, the decent overall performance put in by the supermarkets. Among them,\u0026nbspAldi did great, Morrisons was ok, Sainsbury’s no worse than feared. Tesco, the latest\u0026nbspto go, confirmed the trend. It reported core UK sales up 2.2 per cent over Christmas.\u0026nbspThe beast is well and truly back.\u0026nbspThe consumer seems to have decided to spend on food and gifts for the kids, while reigning in on everyone and everything else.\u0026nbspSuch belt tightening, coming after years of negative inflation adjusted wage growth, is no bad thing. Borrowing or dipping into the savings, which is what people have been doing over the past few years, is unsustainable long term. The decision by many Britons to conserve resources is particularly wise at a time when the Conservative Government of Theresa May seems hell bent on kicking the country in the teeth.\u0026nbspBut you have to pity the people on the sharp end. Debs is in the worst state. There is a big question mark over the long term future of the department store as a concept, but the rapidity of the decline at this one tells you it’s got it badly wrong.Sales fell by 5.7 per cent over the 18 weeks to January 5. Chief executive Sergio Bucher somehow managed to confirm his profit guidance, but the ongoing conversations about refinancing he’s having to hold with lenders can’t be easy. Would you be keen to lend to this business?The decline in sales at M\u0026ampS - 2.2 per cent - was par for the course for this one time high street bellwether that has been scratching its corporate head about how to get things moving for years now.\u0026nbspCompared to those two the John Lewis Partnership is basking in the sunlit uplands. Even with distressed rivals throwing cheap stock out of their doors before closing them, it managed to report a 1 per cent rise in sales at stores open at least year.\u0026nbspThat might not look like anything to write home about, but there are plenty of retail bosses that would e into a pool full of hungry crocodiles if it meant they\u0026nbspcould get even close to that.\u0026nbspProfits will be down this year, but they\u0026nbspwill\u0026nbspstill be decent enough. The only fly in the ointment was the warning that\u0026nbspemployee partners may not get a bonus for the first time since 1953.\u0026nbspThe final decision on that is made in March, which is significant because that’s the month when Brexit is supposed to happen.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.High-end slipper retailer Mahabis has gone into administration. 2 Jan 2019Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

We encourage all of our customers to join Sky VIP – a loyalty programme that says thank you to customers for their time with us, with exclusive offers and experiences.”Digital minister Margot James said: “It is outrageous for loyal customers to be penalised like this and I’d encourage them to always shop around for the best deal once their initial contract ends.“We’ve strengthened Ofcom’s powers to better protect consumers, and will continue to work with Which? and others on a fairer and more transparent system that helps people save money.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s also worth limiting who can find your Facebook profile with your number and email address. 49 Control access to your TimelineYou can limit who gets to post things on your Timeline and who gets to see posts on your Timeline too. In Settings, go to Timeline and Tagging and edit the sections you want to lock down. When you block someone, they won’t be able to see things you post on your Timeline, tag you, invite you to events or groups, start conversations with you or add you as a friend. To do it, go to Settings and Blocking. Annoyingly, you have to block people on Messenger separately. One of Facebook’s handiest privacy features is the ability to review posts you’re tagged in before they appear on your Timeline.

It’s also worth limiting who can find your Facebook profile with your number and email address. 49 Control access to your TimelineYou can limit who gets to post things on your Timeline and who gets to see posts on your Timeline too. In Settings, go to Timeline and Tagging and edit the sections you want to lock down. When you block someone, they won’t be able to see things you post on your Timeline, tag you, invite you to events or groups, start conversations with you or add you as a friend. To do it, go to Settings and Blocking. Annoyingly, you have to block people on Messenger separately. One of Facebook’s handiest privacy features is the ability to review posts you’re tagged in before they appear on your Timeline. They’ll still be visible on the News Feed while they’re fresh, but won’t be tied to your profile forever. In Timeline and Tagging, enable Timeline review controls. 79 Clean up your appsYou can view a list of all of the apps you’ve connected to your Facebook account by going to Settings and Apps. The list might be longer than you expected it to be. It’s worth tidying this up to ensure things you no longer use lose access to your personal information. 89 Change your ad preferencesYou can view a list of everything Facebook thinks you’re into and tinker with your ad preferences by going to Settings and Adverts. A lot more information is displayed on the desktop site than the app, so we’d recommend doing this on a computer.99 Download your dataFacebook lets you download all of the data it has on you, including the posts you’ve shared, your messages and photos, ads you’ve clicked on and even the IP addresses that are logged when you log in or out of the site. It’s a hell of a lot of information, which you should download to ensure you never over-share on the social network again.Facebook refused to disclose how many agreements were in place and did not give further information about the financial nature of the agreements.\u0026nbspA Facebook spokesperson said the deals had been put in place to give Android users the best phone experience.The spokesperson said that when disabled the app acts in the same way as when it has been deleted, meaning it doesn\u0027t collect data or send information back to Facebook.This is unlikely to provide much reassurance to Android users, given recent revelations about Facebook\u0027s data collecting practices.A report by Privacy International last week\u0026nbsprevealed how the firm was tracking Android users even if they didn\u0027t have a Facebook account.\u0026nbspAfter analysing 34 popular Android apps with user bases of between 10 and 500 million, the charity found that 23 of the apps sent data to Facebook the moment a user opened them.The report stated: Facebook routinely tracks users, non-users and logged-out users outside its platform through Facebook Business Tools. App developers share data with Facebook through the Facebook Software Developer Kit (SDK), a set of software development tools that help developers build apps for a specific operating system.Apps found to be sharing data with Facebook included language-learning tool Duolingo, job database Indeed and flight search engine Skyscanner. A spokesperson for Skyscanner\u0026nbspsaid it had updated its data-collecting practices in the wake of the report.Facebook said that sharing data is common practice for many companies and that it did so in a transparent manner.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

On the filters page, scroll to the end, tap Manage, then drag and drop the ones you want to reorder, and un-check the ones you want to hide. Instagram controversially ditched its reverse-chronological order feed for a new order determined by an algorithm, making it easy to completely miss some posts. To make sure you never miss a certain somebody’s updates, you can set up notification for them by visiting their profile, tapping the three dots in the top right-hand corner and selecting Turn On Post Notifications.If you’re worried about how much of your mobile data Instagram saps, you can limit it by sacrificing the speed at which the photos and videos in your feed load. Go to your profile, tap the three dots in the top right corner, open Cellular Data Use and choose Use Less Data.411 See your LikesIt’s easy to lose track of your friends’ old posts on Instagram, but if you know you Liked it, you’ll be able to track it down easily.

Take a look at everything you’ve bookmarked by tapping the same icon that sits near the top of your profile.Everyone knows you can expand the reach of your posts by using a number of relevant hashtags, but what those are aren’t always glaringly obvious.

The British empire was seen by others around the globe as the cornerstone of its stability (imperial injustices aside). This view arose from the former British colonies’ familiarity with British troops, British industry and trade, as well as British soft power (the royal family and BBC) and what it used to mean for them, for their past and future.However, the increasing dominance of the US moonlight’s beam in the 20th century meant, naturally, the sunset of the British hegemony. Since the Americans grabbed the world’s remote control, there has been a reset – with the world order drastically changed in the American direction. And the world has received the new American cultural reality with few apparent\u0026nbspconflictions, except one, the British legacy. British officials, institutions and soldiers may have left their ex-colonies, but their imprint has remained.Due to its intertwining impact on the future and welfare of people in the UK, Brexit has tended to be seen, from abroad, as a local mess with no immediate implication anywhere else. Is it true though? Are citizens in other parts of the world immune to the effects of Brexit’s shrapnel? In any event, do people elsewhere care about us? Certainly it might be reasonable to think that it’s important to know what they make of us and of our country.350m a week for the NHS became a defining symbol of the Brexit referendum campaign (Getty)Many people in Britain see their country in mayhem, but they don’t necessarily know what to do to get themselves out of Brexit\u0027s snare (not even the government appears to have an answer, nor most of those who voted for EU withdrawal). The confusion over the outcome of the referendum in 2016 – which is psychological at its core – has been so powerful that it has split society in two. Some are doomed to see Brexit as a Noah’s Ark others are ready to put a big hole in it below the water line.But if you think we in the UK are confused, it should be said that people around the world follow events without having any clue about what on earth is happening here. Wherever you go now, the question on everyone’s lips is along the lines of: why are the British muddling themselves into this most abhorrent and unjustified self-harm?Brexit casts a dark cloud over our experts’ predictions for 2019Do not get me wrong, people from all over the globe watch the BBC too. Many are still able to form some sort of opinion on the subject. Indeed, given the complexities involved, this has created a paradoxical reality where someone in Nicaragua can be as educated on Brexit as a Brexiteer from the midlands of England. It’s not the information that people lack, it’s their ability to absorb (and perhaps contextualise) it.For many beyond our shores, the right acronym for this dogged quandary which the UK has been juggling with for two and a half years is political “civil war”. This might be a bit over-amplified, but it is, indeed, some kind of a war waging, but in a civil manner.Yet the outcome of the British conflict over Brexit still might, as the UK did in the past, play a role in forming the world’s reality. Exiting the EU has set a different course for the post-Second World War\u0026nbsporder a course which could end up setting Europe ablaze.People on the other side of the English Channel have certainly grown very sceptical about British integrity when it comes to doing business of any kind. There is no point signing a deal with a nation that appears unable or unwilling to honour its word on previous European deals it has been part of. This is what Britain’s image abroad has become in some quarters.Take the Norwegians as another example. Once a “Norway-style” option became a possible alternative to Ms May’s Brexit agreement, Norwegian politicians panicked mainly because, after turning our back on the EU, they duly thought that Britain could get Norway’s ship scuttled too. Many in Europe just don’t trust Britain anymore. They increasingly think that the British gamble over leaving the EU could wreak havoc on their own present and future.But Europeans are not alone. Americans watch Brexit with horror too. Well, not all Americans, but especially those who did not vote for Donald Trump. Trump supporters see Brexit as a victory on the same historical scale as their waggish president’s inauguration. But on the other side of the US political scene, life is gloomier.In fact, Brexit didn’t promote ision and fear only in Britain it also helped to create two Americas. One understands that Britain had no need whatsoever to depart the EU in order to deepen its ties with the US, as those disingenuous leavers are still trying to argue. This America represents the liberal institutions, most branches of officialdom and those who see the benefits of globalisation.Nevertheless, Trump is still pushing Britain to crash out with no deal, claiming that an endorsement of Ms May’s Brexit deal would mean the UK losing out on a favourable bilateral trade agreement with the US. This is not an off-the-cuff claim: it is a real bid from the most powerful man on the planet to sabotage the UK’s “special” relationship with America by feeding his own nationalist agenda.An opinion poll by Emerson College, published at the end of last year, showed that 91 per cent\u0026nbspof Americans support the “special relationship”.However, it seems that Americans have lost their faith in Britain as a trade partner. While\u0026nbspa majority still support a bilateral free trade agreement with the UK after Brexit, the poll showed that many in the US don’t think that Britain is a trustworthy partner to do business with. Of the respondents, 48 per cent\u0026nbsprated China as the most important trading partner for the US (76 per cent\u0026nbsphad China in their top two), and 20 per cent\u0026nbspwent for Canada first. Only 6 per cent of respondents saw Britain as the top trade partner (behind Israel and Australia too).Does the relationship, under Trump, still sound “special”?The other America – Donald Trump’s America – does not spare any thought to what’s happening abroad: it simply wants to take back control, supports building a wall on its border to stop immigration, chants “America first”\u0026nbspand wants to ditch multilateral institutions, such as Nato and the EU. It rings a bell, right?However, the association of Brexit’s bad boys with Trump’s presidential campaign was not the ultimate eye-catcher in terms of foreign involvement in the UK’s decision to split from the EU. What was most notable was capturing Nigel Farage and Arron Banks, and other leavers, in the same bed with Russia.Indeed, the alleged efforts of Banks and Farage to foster contact with both Russian officials and Trump’s campaign have raised concerns among investigators in the UK and the US.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBrexit has so far proved to be a zero-sum game, and the only nation still in love with zero-sum games is Russia. There should be no doubt by now that Brexit will only play into Russia’s hands. The very notion of “apocalyptic Europe”\u0026nbsphas informed the national belief system of the poker-faced Russian president Vladimir Putin for years. Stumbling out of a humiliating defeat at the end of the Cold War, the ex-KGB officer always saw a united Europe as another Soviet Union, but on the other side of the game.Ostensibly, it looks like this assumption has a Russian government monopoly, but, as time passes, skies are becoming cloudier. Putin managed to manipulate the Russian people into his antagonised theory through fuelling acrimony towards the west. This has been always a key tactic, which has proved efficient in turning ordinary citizens – more or less compelled as they are to consume constant, malicious propaganda – to believe that Brexit can turn the wheel in Russia’s favour. It’s so obvious from every angle in the globe – except where Brexiteers sit, of course – that Russia can’t wait but to see us out (for its own ends).No wonder Moscow has been meddling in Brexit from day one. The US Senate published a report in January last year noting that UK campaign finance laws do not require disclosure of political donations if they are from “the beneficial owners of non-British companies that are incorporated in the EU and carry out business in the UK”. This opacity, the report suggested, “may have enabled Russian-related money to be directed with insufficient scrutiny to various UK political actors”.This came as experts from the University of California at Berkeley and Swansea University identified 150,000 Twitter accounts with Russian ties that had been spreading messages on Brexit, which is not even to mention the Russian-owned media outlets RT and Sputnik’s extensive and “systematically one-sided coverage” of the Brexit debate, as the Senate report put it.Russian fake news teams targeted Mueller to discredit Trump probeBut Russians don’t really like these “accusations”, and robustly defend their government’s theory no matter what (and its denial of involvement). “We all agree that the Russian government has nothing to do with Brexit, and didn’t intervene one bit. We are stunned by these accusations,”\u0026nbspElena Sobonina, a Moscow-based expert on Russia’s foreign policy, told me.“We are Europe’s closest neighbours, therefore stability of the continent is crucial for us. We can’t afford playing this game, but if you want to know who is really working on weakening the EU and Nato you have to look west, to the US”, she said. “Everyone in Russia believes so.”Russians can point to Trump as Europe’s biggest rival, they can also claim that they are the champions of the EU’s stability but in Putin’s eyes, Britain will always be a special enemy. \u0026nbspThe poisoning of the ex-double agent Sergei Skripal in March last year in Salisbury helped Putin’s close circle to make the case to ordinary Russians. While wacky politicians, like Boris Johnson, were turning the show into an outcry for their own self-indulgent political tactics, Putin was mobilising Russia’s citizens – through their natural sense of grievance since the collapse of the Soviet Union – against Britain and what it represents.Britain’s hard stance on Russia – that it was to blame for the attempted assassination and ought to be punished – sent a message to Balkan and former Soviet nations that they would not be on their own, that Britain would not abdicate its responsibilities towards this part of the world, where people still perceive Russia as a threat. A young Lithuanian told me: “Old people, who lived under the Soviet occupation, do not invest in a home or\u0026nbspland because they still think the Russians will, eventually, come over and take everything away.”However, the way in which Britain’s position was perceived in ex-Soviet spheres of influence also uncovered a huge sympathy towards Russia and Putin’s cause in countries seen as crucial for Britain after Brexit, like China.British politicians have rarely been able to understand China due to a major misconception about its intentions. Ironically, Britain – the liberal empire which used to dominate the world – is plagued by isolationism and xenophobia, while the ex-communist acropolis, China, is becoming ever more free market orientated, undertaking a systematic process to liberalise trade.What I learned about Brexit inside the school for the French eliteDuring his visit to Beijing last summer, the\u0026nbspchancellor Philip Hammond seemed to be presenting Britain’s letter of credence to the Chinese, as they become the champion of free trade. \u0026nbsp \u0026nbspAnd sure enough, despite seeing Brexit as an imminent threat to the world’s economic stability, Chinese leaders still see it as a potentially big opportunity. Chinese businessmen, especially, believe it is a good idea to take advantage of the British “national desperation” to sign free trade deals. This promise, which has always been at the core of Brexiteer’s arguments for leaving the EU campaign, created Britain’s vulnerability in the eyes of pushy China. Chinese president Xi Jinping will trade with Britain, but this time on his own terms.In truth though, while China and the US are locked in a trade war, Britain’s dreams in the east seem diminished for now. Post-Brexit Britain will increasingly become dependent on the US (probably on Trump’s terms), and as long as Trump is in the Oval Office, the likelihood of any trade deal with China is minimal.As for ordinary Chinese craftsmen and small business owners, who look to foreign markets to sell their goods, many wonder why their British equivalents would countenance running away from the EU, the biggest market in the world. Asked about Brexit and how people back home see it, a Chinese restaurateur in London’s Chinatown told me: “People don’t get it! They just sit there mocking the British and having a laugh at them.”The real laugh is that Brexiteers are trying to sell a globalised “new” Britain, while leaving the very European organisation that still holds the global liberal system together and that is at the heart of global trade.According to the same diplomat, “Arab leaders want Britain to stay in the EU because they know that Brexit will hit its role on the international stage really hard, and subsequently we, in the Arab world, would have a lot at stake”.For Gulf countries particularly, trade with Britain is indisputably important. But in a region where stability (such as it is) still relies heavily on the US and the UK, any radical change in these two countries’ roles on the global stage would reflect heavily on the area. \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp“In the GCC, those who are traditionally bigger proponents of regional organisations see Brexit as a threat to regionalism tout-court, and see … the potential weakening of the EU as mirroring or anticipating the weakening of the GCC,”\u0026nbspsays\u0026nbspCinzia Bianco, a researcher on Gulf-European relations at the University of Exeter.“This is especially because the GCC, for a period during the early 2000s, looked at the EU as a potential model in certain aspects,”\u0026nbspshe adds.Those who represent the traditional regional order, just as the Mullahs’ regime in Iran, Putin in Russia and Trump in the White House, don’t really like the idea of an international multilateral dynamic. In their perception of the EU, they enjoy more listening to the extreme right wing’s toxic ideasMany in the Gulf believe the UK was never meant to be part of the EU, and saw the UK as something different. According to Ms Bianco: “This is mostly due to the historical background of the UK being a semi-colonial power in the Gulf: GCC countries, therefore, have traditionally dealt with London on a bilateral level, with strong defence, political and economic relations, and very rarely through the EU.”This might explain why the Arab media is pretty much obsessed with Brexit. All the big ones – Al Jazeera, Al Arabiya, Sky News Arabia, Al Ghad – and even local news channels now follow Brexit more than Syria or Libya’s bloody civil wars.But when you participate in a Brexit debate on one of these channels, the pressing question they all ask is: “Do you think another referendum will take place?” It sounds like Arabs, for some reason, want Britain to stay in the EU more than British people themselves. This interest is reflected in the number of Independent readers from the Middle East who are keen to read about the subject. Brexit is our best-read topic in Egypt.Why might this be? Maybe it is a subconscious sympathy hammered out of an historical feeling of association (for good or ill) with Britain’s affairs. Maybe it is a genuine fear that if Great Britain exits the EU, it will not be great again and its role in the Middle East will be diminished.An Arab diplomat reflected ironically on the question when I put it to him: “Maybe our people are afraid of European immigration if Brexit would, at some point in the future, result in the collapse of the EU.”\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 65Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Red smoke from a canister hangs in the air as around 100,000 demonstrators march through London during a People\u0027s Vote anti-brexit demonstration savings banners and placardsMayor of London Sadiq Khan takes part in the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.MP Chuka Umunna (left) and MP Vince Cable (right) as MP Anna Soubry (centre) addresses Anti-Brexit campaigners at a rally after the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.

Most seem to be aware, despite the extensive coverage, of nothing more than the bare fact that Brexit means Britain would be walking away from the EU. But their favourite question remains: “But, why?” And that is a good question indeed.“The reason why Brexit hasn’t been on the ordinary Arabs’ top of the agenda is that it happened in conjunction with what is called ‘the Arab Spring’, including the Syrian, Yemeni, and Libyan civil conflicts,”\u0026nbspsays Mohamed Kawas, a prominent French-Lebanese journalist.“On governments’ level, those who represent the traditional regional order, just as the mullahs’ regime in Iran, Putin in Russia and Trump in the White House, don’t really like the idea of an international multilateral dynamic. In fact, in their perception of the EU, they enjoy more listening to the extreme right wing’s toxic ideas”, he adds.It should be clear by now that Brexit is not just a local British dilemma. It will not only change people’s lives here, but in some other parts of the world too – directly or indirectly. This is due to its strategic and economic impact on Europe’s stability, Britain’s position on the world’s stage, and how Brexit will help Russia to rise again as a superpower in a new bipolar order.It is notable too that whereas the English language has always been a big help in making local issues, especially in the UK and the US, explicable internationally, the complexities of Brexit (and its inane explanations) did the opposite. For many outsiders, debate about Brexit remains something their eyes can see but their minds can’t process.Still, it has been the UK’s global standing as a nation of good repute that has been hit most. Those who always looked up to this country and its democratic and liberal values are united with those who loathe its imperial history and disastrous foreign policy decisions, such as the invasion of Iraq. Both sides – allies and foes – are now sceptical about Britain’s integrity and honesty, and doubtful about the extent to which other nations can any longer follow Britain’s leadership.\u0026nbspOf course, the British people themselves still have to get their heads around Brexit before anyone else. But whatever the outcome, it will not change the new reality:\u0026nbspthe damage is done, and Britain is not great anymore.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

This is the first time the camera has acted up like this, said Cheryl Gundy, a spokeswoman with the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, which handle science operations for the telescope.\u0026nbspNASA is trying to pull together the team to try to diagnose the issue, Gundy said Wednesday.\u0026nbspWe would like to have Hubble back up and working as quickly as possible, and NASA is making that happen, even with the partial government shutdown, she added.Additional reporting by Associated PressBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It both deepens the mystery and offers a potential opportunity to finally understand what might be throwing out the burst from a galaxy billions of light years away.Fast radio bursts have been speculated to be the result of everything from exploding stars to transmissions from aliens. But they have remained entirely mysterious, with little evidence at all of where they might be coming from.The flashes only last for a milisecond but they are flung out with the same amount of energy the sun takes 12 months to produce.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialProbably most exciting of the new bursts is one that scientists saw repeat six times, apparently from the same location. Of the more than 60 fast radio bursts detected so far, only one of them has ever repeated.\u0026nbsp“Until now, there was only one known repeating FRB. Knowing that there is another suggests that there could be more out there. And with more repeaters and more sources available for study, we may be able to understand these cosmic puzzles—where they’re from and what causes them,” said Ingrid Stairs, a member of the CHIME team and an astrophysicist at UBC.Seeing two repeating signals probably means that there exists – and that humanity will probably find – a\u0026nbspsubstantial population of repeating signals, the researchers write in one of the two papers published in\u0026nbspNature.Having two sets of repeating bursts could also allow scientists to understand what distinguishes them from single bursts, helping them understand more about their source and watch for future blasts.Nasa finds strange alien planet hiding outside our solar systemIn all the researchers spotted some 13 of the bursts in just a three week period, offering a vast new trove of data for the scientists hunting for their source. Together they could offer some evidence of the extreme or unusual environment they are coming from – or the mysterious technology that some claim alien civilisations could be launching them into space with.“Whatever the source of these radio waves is, it’s interesting to see how wide a range of frequencies it can produce. There are some models where intrinsically the source can’t produce anything below a certain frequency,” says team member Arun Naidu of McGill University.The blasts were discovered by the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment in British Columbia. Some scientists had worried that the range of frequencies it can pick up would be too low for it to receive the FRBs – but it found far more than expected, and scientists expect it to identify even more.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of space Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.130 Earth from the ISSFrom the International Space Station, Expedition 42 Flight Engineer Terry W.

It was one of those beams of light, thrown out from the quasar, that happened to pass near a galaxy that happened to bend and magnify the light, sending it towards us and allowing it to be seen today by Nasa-sponsored researchers.Black hole spotted by Nasa provides new insight into mysterious bodiesIf it weren\u0027t for this makeshift cosmic telescope, the quasar\u0027s light would appear about 50 times dimmer, said Xiaohui Fan of the University of Arizona, who led the study. This discovery demonstrates that strongly gravitationally lensed quasars do exist despite the fact that we\u0027ve been looking for over 20 years and not found any others this far back in time.Scientists were able to take observations of the light from the Gemini Observatory, along with data from other observatories, and understand where it had come from.When we combined the Gemini data with observations from multiple observatories on Maunakea, the Hubble Space Telescope, and other observatories around the world, we were able to paint a complete picture of the quasar and the intervening galaxy, said Fan.The light came soon after what is known as the Epoch of Reonisation\u0026nbsp– when the very first light came about.This is one of the first sources to shine as the Universe emerged from the cosmic dark ages, said Jinyi Yang of the University of Arizona, another member of the discovery team. Prior to this, no stars, quasars, or galaxies had been formed, until objects like this appeared like candles in the dark.Quasars are very intense sources of energy that are fuelled\u0026nbspby black holes, and are thought to have been around in the very first galaxies in the universe. They are so bright and distant they can offer a unique glimpse into the beginnings of the cosmos, as in this case.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Through membership of this organisation, however, the country is required to accept the EU’s four freedoms –\u0026nbspincluding the free movement of people.This would of course be inconceivable for many Brexiteers and the prime minister consistently referred to ending the free movement of people as one of her “red lines”\u0026nbspduring the negotiations.EU ‘reflecting’ on how it can give Theresa May more help on BrexitRAF unveils stealth fighter for ‘new era’ of defence after BrexitNo-deal Brexit ‘catastrophic’ for UK food supplies, say farmersCorbyn indicates Labour will back Brexit delay During her recent trip to the G20 in Buenos Aires, the prime minister told reporters: “What we are doing as a government as a whole is looking at producing a set of immigration rules which ensure that the thing we are doing is bringing an end to to free movement”.\u0026nbspIt is clear that a Norway-style model\u0026nbspwould make this impossible, but some of those advocating the option (under the banner “Common Market 2.0”),\u0026nbspincluding the Tory MP Robert Halfon and Labour’s Lucy Powell, suggest it could nonetheless gain widespread public support.\u0026nbspOn immigration specifically they claim new controls over free movement in certain circumstances would be available as the EEA allows members to suspend free movement if a country can demonstrate it is experiencing “serious economic, societal or environmental difficulties”.\u0026nbspUltimately, though, it’s hard to see how the UK government could\u0026nbspmake\u0026nbspsuch an extreme argument\u0026nbspand in any case, such a move would only be temporary. This is why many MPs\u0026nbspfrom constituencies that voted Leave (on both side of the House)\u0026nbspare uneasy about backing the model.\u0026nbspIndeed,\u0026nbspErna Solberg, the Norwegian prime minister, recently pointed out that the UK would eventually have to accept the four freedoms under a model similar to her country, and asked: “Should you leave the EU if you’re accepting that?”“You can’t just opt out of one of the freedoms,” she added.\u0026nbspGot an unanswered question about Brexit?

Monday 21 could be parliament’s last chance to avoid the cliff edge. The decision on a people’s vote can’t be put off any longer.”Sarah Wollaston, a leading Tory Final Say supporter, said it was time for the prime minister to concede a fresh referendum on Brexit without delay.“Because parliament has reached an impasse, the right thing for her to do is say ‘parliament can’t decide, I’m going to take it to the people direct’,” she said.Created with Sketch.

It’s wake up time – we have a very short time in which to sort this out.”But Jacob Rees-Mogg pointed out it did not have legal force, saying: “Parliament can pass motions saying the moon is made of green cheese, but that doesn’t mean it’s legally binding.”A total of 17 Tory MPs rebelled, including Ken Clarke and Final Say supporters Justine Greening, Sam Gyimah, Jo Johnson, Philip Lee and Anna Soubry.The fresh setback for the prime minister came as she put herself on another collision course with Brussels, after toughening her stance on the Irish border backstop.The government accepted a backbench amendment that could give the Commons a veto over entry into the backstop – even though it would be legally bound to do so, under the terms of the withdrawal agreement.Furthermore, if the backstop is implemented, the government would have “a duty to have an agreed future relationship or alternative arrangements” with one year, so it “ceases to apply”.Both contradict the orce deal, under which the UK agreed the backstop was the default option if a trade deal is not in place by the end of 2020 and that it should apply indefinitely.The move risked the EU’s wrath while being clearly designed to win over Tory MPs posed to vote down the prime minister’s deal next Tuesday.But it was immediately dismissed by one leading Brexiteer, former minister Steve Baker, who said: “This flimsy rubbish will only persuade those who have decided to be persuaded. Most of us have made our decision.”Until the Grieve defeat, Ms May was only required, after losing on her deal, to make a statement on what will happen next within 21 calendar days and then allow a vote in the Commons within seven sitting days.That subsequent motion was not expected to be amendable until Mr Grieve’s victory, last month, which meant MPs would be able to put forward their alternatives – but only for indicative votes.Before the defeat, Tory MPs raged at Mr Bercow for more than one hour, raising numerous points of order to vent their fury, in the closest the Commons comes to a riot.David Natzler, the Commons clerk and expert on parliamentary procedure, was believed to have advised Mr Bercow that the Grieve amendment should be struck out, because it clashed with standing orders.If the government does table the required motion within three working days, it could come very late on 21 January, postponing any debate until the following day.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A police officer speaks with anti-Brexit protester Steve BrayPolice surround a pro-Brexit protester after he confronted a pro-European protester Conservative MP David Davies, wearing a gopro camera, speaks to anti-Brexit protester Steve BrayDowning Street reported that Ms May had also talked to the CBI president John Allan and said that all of the conversations had been “constructive” and that there would be more in the coming days.Asked if the move to call unions was desperate, her spokeswoman said: “It’s part of her ongoing engagement with leaders from across the United Kingdom.”Earlier in the day Ms May signalled the government would “consider very seriously” a plan from\u0026nbspLabour\u0026nbspMPs to safeguard workers’ rights in her Brexit proposals, as part of her drive to woo the party’s Brexiteers.\u0026nbspAn amendment tabled by Labour MP John Mann, which has the backing of his colleagues Gareth Snell, Caroline Flint and Lisa Nandy, would keep EU rules on pay and conditions, health and safety issues and environmental standards.Mr Mann called the move part of a process, suggesting it would not immediately mean Labour MPs swinging behind Ms May’s plan.Ms Nandy also said its adoption would not be enough to persuade her to vote with Ms May, telling BBC Radio 4’s World at One: “The amendment that we’ve tabled, even though it represents progress, isn’t sufficient to give me or many other Labour MPs confidence that this will lead to the sort of close relationship economically with the EU that we need to protect jobs in our constituencies.”She added: “I’ve been saying for five months now that I would be prepared to vote for the withdrawal agreement, but Theresa May needs to get in touch with Labour on our front benches and back benches, and start having this dialogue about what we need to have the confidence to vote for it. Until now, she’s only been prepared to talk to her party – particularly, the right of her party.”Mr Corbyn was also reaching out beyond his own benches as the crucial vote approached, urging Conservatives to back a no-confidence motion in their own government to end the Brexit impasse.The Labour leader appealed to rival parties to unite behind a bid to tear down the current administration and force a general election, admitting his party would need the support of Tory rebels to win.He said in a speech in Wakefield: “I say to Theresa May – if you are so confident in your deal then call that election and let the people decide.“If not, Labour will table a motion of no confidence in the government at the moment we judge it to have the best chance of success.“Clearly, Labour does not have enough MPs in parliament to win a confidence vote on its own. So members across the house should vote with us to break the deadlock.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But indeed they had agreed to remain in touch throughout the week, which is not yet over.”Corbyn indicates Labour will back Brexit delayBut the spokesperson said they could not offer the prime minister a timescale on when help might arrive – raising the prospect that it might come after the vote, possibly helping smooth a second attempt.The Commission provided some political cover for the prime minister on Thursday however by failing to raise an objection to a eurosceptic amendment that would see MPs given yet another vote in 2020 on whether the most controversial parts of the plan should come into force at all.The so-called “Swire amendment”, which the government has accepted, would let MPs vote on whether the backstop should come into effect. According to Downing Street the vote would not have automatic legal force, but there would be significant pressure on the government to abandon the backstop if it lost. This action would amount to breaking the withdrawal agreement.Behind the scenes an EU source told The Independent that it was for the UK government to explain the amendment and that the deal could not be changed.No-deal Brexit would mean flight numbers capped at 2018 levelsRAF unveils stealth fighter for \u0027new era\u0027 of defence after BrexitNo-deal Brexit \u0027catastrophic\u0027 for UK food supplies, say farmersMinister hints at resigning if PM oversees a no-deal BrexitBut publicly a spokesperson would not be drawn on it, telling reporters: “We are not commenting on the on-going parliamentary debate in the United Kingdom.\u0026nbsp“I can recall that we have reached a deal with the UK government and this deal is the best and only deal possible and will not be renegotiated so this is where we are at this stage.”The form any reassurances could take – and whether they happen at all – is still subject to debate and will depend on how the EU reads the situation unfolding in Westminster.The Independent reported at the weekend that any further reassurances are not expected to go as far as the full legally binding commitment as demanded by Tory MPs.Such a text with legal status would require yet another summit – which EU leaders are not prepared to hold after having already been dragged back to Brussels in November for an extra meeting.Created with Sketch.Brexit betrayal march in London Show all 41Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A protester carrying a noose at the Brexit betrayal march.

This would not go as far as Tory eurosceptics have demanded – they want a mechanism for the UK to leave the backstop, or a fixed time-limit.The EU already made clarifications to the deal at a Brussels meeting in December where it said the bloc’s “firm determination to work speedily on a subsequent agreement that establishes by 31 December 2020 alternative arrangements, so that the backstop will not need to be triggered”.Additional paragraphs going further that had appeared in earlier drafts were deleted by EU leaders after an apparently unimpressive showing by Ms May at a meeting with the 27 prime ministers and presidents.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He cited alleged “discrimination” against Poland by Brussels.Austria’s right-wing chancellor Sebastian Kurz last year called for an anti-immigration “axis” using the same language. Speaking alongside the right-wing Bavarian CSU party he cited Italy and Germany as possible allies.Mr Orban’s speech comes as he comes under popular pressure in Hungary, where he is facing sustained public protest against a so-called “slave law” that loosens overtime protections.\u0026nbspMatteo Salvini, who is also deputy prime minister and right-wing League party leader (ReutersAmmar Awad)His party Fidesz still remains the most popular in opinion polls, though it appears to have lost some support.The far right is expected to make significant gains across the continent in this year’s European parliament elections, consolidating those it made at a national level since the last round in 2014.The European parliament elections in part decide the president of the European Commission, with the council and parliament making the choice in tandem.Polls suggest that a far-right group could credibly become the second largest grouping in the transnational parliament – though isions between different parties in different countries could prevent them from coalescing around a single banner.Anti-immigration parties and governments have already had some successes in the EU – putting the issue they do best on high on the agenda. In the summer the European Council changed its policies on rescuing migrants in the Mediterranean under pressure from Italy – condemning NGO-run rescue boats for picking up drowning people.Asked about the proposals for an alliance, a European Commission spokesperson said: People in Europe, all over Europe, talk to each other, and they are free of course to do so. This does not question at all our commitment and the European Commission’s commitment to guarantee the values that are enshrined in our treaties, and there are many of them - ranging from the rule of law, equality, democracy - all these things that member states are committed to, that they have signed up to voluntarily by being a member of the European Union. So the European Commission will always continue to uphold these values in everything that we do.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Supporters of Felix Tshisekedi, leader of the Congolese main opposition party, the Union for Democracy and Social Progress who was announced as the winner of the presidential elections celebrate along the streets of Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of CongoPhilippine Coast Guards keep watch as Roman Catholic devotees cross the bridge in a raucous procession of the Black Nazarene to celebrate its feast day in Manila.

Much more can and must be done to protect and assist children.”Children living in countries at war have come under direct attack, have been used as human shields, killed, maimed or recruited to fight. Rape, forced marriage and abduction have become standard tactics in conflicts from Syria to Yemen, and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, to Nigeria, South Sudan and Myanmar.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialOver the course of 2018:- In Afghanistan, violence and bloodshed remain a daily occurrence, with some 5,000 children killed or maimed within the first three-quarters of 2018, equal to all of 2017, and children making up 89 per cent of civilian casualties from explosive remnants of war.Unicef photographer captures men bonding with their newborns- Cameroon has seen an escalation of the conflict in the northwest and southwest regions of the country, with schools, students and teachers often coming under attack. In November, more than 80 people, including many children, were abducted from a school in Nkwen, in the northwest of the country and released a few days later. To date, 93 villages have allegedly been partially or totally burned due to conflict in the areas, with many children experiencing extreme levels of violence.- In the Central African Republic, a dramatic resurgence in fighting has enveloped much of the country, with two out of three children in need of humanitarian assistance.- In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, interethnic violence and clashes between security forces and armed groupsmilitia in the Kasai region and in the eastern provinces of Tanganyika, South Kivu, Nord Kivu and Ituri have had a devastating impact on children. The response to the ongoing Ebola outbreak has been seriously hindered by violence and instability in eastern DRC. In addition, an estimated 4.2 million children are at risk of severe acute malnutrition. The situation is compounded by violations of children’s rights, including forced recruitment by armed groups and sexual abuse.Pierre’s mother died after he was born three years ago he now lives with his father in the Central African Republic- In Iraq, even as fighting has largely subsided, four children were killed in November in the north of the country when the truck they were travelling to school in came under attack. Children and families returning to their homes in areas previously impacted by heavy violence continue to be exposed to the danger of unexploded ordnance. Thousands of families remain displaced and now face the additional threats of freezing winter temperatures and flash floods.- In the Chad Basin, ongoing conflict, displacement and attacks on schools, teachers and other education facilities have put the education of 3.5 million children at risk. Today in northeast Nigeria, the lake region of Chad, extreme north of Cameroon and Diffa region of Niger, at least 1,041 schools are closed or non-functional due to violence, fear of attacks, or unrest, affecting nearly 445,000 children.- A recent surge in violence in the border region between Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger has left 1,478 schools closed.- In Myanmar, the UN continues to receive reports of ongoing violations of the rights of Rohingya remaining in northern Rakhine State, which include allegations of killings, disappearances and arbitrary arrests. There are also widespread restrictions on the rights to freedom of movement and barriers to access health and education including in central Rakhine State. Ensuring children have access to quality education and other essential services will avert a “lost generation”\u0026nbspof Rohingya children otherwise they will lack the skills they need to contribute to society.- In northeast Nigeria, armed groups, including Boko Haram factions, continue to target girls, who are raped, forced to become wives of fighters or used as “human bombs”. In February, the group abducted 110 girls and one boy from a technical college in Dapchi, Yobe State. While most of the children have since been released, five girls died and one is still being held captive as a slave.Nawai, 15, during a ceremony to release children from armed groups in Yambio, South Sudan- In Palestine, over 50 children were killed and hundreds more injured this year, many while\u0026nbspdemonstrating against deteriorating living conditions in Gaza. Children in Palestine and Israel have been exposed to fear, trauma and injuries.- In South Sudan, relentless conflict and insecurity throughout the annual lean season pushed 6.1 million people into extreme hunger. Even with the advent of the rainy season, more than 43 per cent of the population remain food insecure. While the promise of a revitalised peace agreement offers a glimmer of hope for children, reports of extreme violence against women and children continue, most recently in Bentiu, where more than 150 women and girls reported suffering horrific sexual assault.- In Somalia, more than 1,800 children were recruited by parties to the conflict in the first nine months of the year, with 1,278 children abducted.Unicef’s research on water predicts one in four children will not have access to clean water by 2040- In Syria, between January and September, the UN verified the killing of 870 children – the highest number ever in the first nine months of any year since the start of the conflict in 2011. Attacks continued throughout the year, including the killing of 30 children in the eastern village of Al Shafa in November.- In eastern Ukraine, more than four years of conflict have taken a devastating toll on the education system, destroying and damaging hundreds of schools and forcing 700,000 children to learn in fragile environments, amid\u0026nbspvolatile fighting and the dangers posed by unexploded weapons of war. The situation is particularly severe for 400,000 children who live within 20km of the “contact line”, which ides the government and non-government-controlled areas and where shelling and extreme levels of mine contamination pose a lethal threat.- and in Yemen, the UN has verified 1,427 children killed or maimed in attacks, including an “unconscionable”\u0026nbspattack on a school bus in Sa’ada. Schools and hospitals have come under frequent attack or been used for military purposes, denying children access to their right to education and healthcare. This is further fuelling a crisis in a country where every 10 minutes, a child dies due to preventable diseases, and 400,000 children suffer from severe acute malnutrition.A doctor measures the arm of Yemeni Ali Mohammed Ahmed Jamal, 12, who is suffering from malnutrition“2019 marks the 30th anniversary of the landmark Convention on the Rights of the Child and the 70th anniversary of the Geneva Conventions, yet today, more countries are embroiled in internal or international conflict than at any other time in the past three decades. Children living through conflict are among the least likely to be guaranteed their rights. Attacks on children must end,” Fontaine says.Unicef calls on all warring parties to abide by their obligations under international law to immediately end violations against children and the targeting of civilian infrastructure, including schools, hospitals and water infrastructure. Unicef also calls on states with influence over parties to conflict to use that influence to protect children.In photos: a toddlers recovery from malnutritionConflict in Congo has led to children being recruited as soldiers“Much more needs to be done to prevent wars, and to end the many disastrous armed conflicts devastating children’s lives. Yet even as wars continue, we must never accept attacks against children. We must hold warring parties to their obligation to protect children. Otherwise, it is children, their families and their communities who will continue to suffer the devastating consequences, for now, and for years to come,” Fontaine says.Across all these countries, Unicef works with partners to provide the most vulnerable children with health, nutrition, education and child protection services. For example, in October, Unicef helped to secure the release of 833 children recruited into armed forces in northeast Nigeria, and are working these children to reintegrate them into their communities. Since conflict broke out in South Sudan five years ago, Unicef has reunited almost 6,000 unaccompanied and separated children with their families. In Bangladesh, in 2018, Unicef reached thousands of Rohingya refugee children with mental health and psychosocial support. In Iraq, Unicef is working with partners to provide specialised services to women and children affected by gender-based violence.Democratic Republic of the CongoOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

We aren’t done playing.’”But once his image was released by his rescuers, the world reacted with shock and sadness at the image of Kennys deformed face.He was labelled the worlds ugliest tiger with people saying he looked like a dog rather than a big cat.Commenting on images of Kenny on the refuges Facebook page, one person, labelled tiger inbreeding as one of the most ignorant, abusive acts at playing God that Ive ever seen.And while many claimed he was the first tiger with Downs Syndrome scientists say that, as the condition is caused by an extra copy of a specic chromosome, only animals closely related to humans, such as chimpanzees, can have it.The sanctuary said that inbreeding caused his unusual characteristics.Although tigers in the wild typically live to , Kenny died from an aggressive form of skin cancer eight years after his rescue, at the young age of .Tiger farms are hugely popular in Asia and are quickly turning into a global industry.Often disguising themselves as animal sanctuaries, they look to meet increasing demands for tiger fur, body parts and domesticated tigers to be kept as pets.Skins are turned into luxury rugs, tiger bones are used to make “self-healing” health tonics and wines and the meat is popular with high-flying businessmen, who believe that consuming the cats will improve their performance at work.Shockingly, tigers are often shot through the eyes so that their fur is not damaged.The growth of the illegal farms has driven down the going price of £, for a white tiger cub to just under £,.Elisa Allen, Director of PETA UK told Sun Online: White tigers are not a species but simply an aberrant colour iation of Bengal tigers, and breeding them is done solely to draw paying crowds.All captive white tigers are inbred, which has led to serious congenital defects, including cataracts, clubfoot, and near-crippling hip dysplasia.Tigers are on the very brink of extinction, yet one of the biggest threats they face is the  promise of captive-breeding programmes.None of the tigers born in captivity will ever be released, so these programmes do nothing to help wild tiger populations.If big-cat species are to survive, our focus must sht from breeding and displaying them in captivity to habitat preservation in the wild. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And as this carries on day in, day out, we see no nightmare queues of lorries backed up at our ports.In fact, there is no friction at all at the borders even though much of the “just in time” delivery we depend on comes from outside the European Union.We are not told the Civil Service is ready and prepared to handle a No Deal Brexit. This plan is being withheld from MPs and the British people in order to push Mrs May’s withdrawal agreement, which could bind us to EU control indefinitely.Make no mistake, Her Majesty’s Revenue  Customs are ready for a No Deal Brexit. All computer systems will be ready by January  and businesses have been advised about “Trusted Trader Schemes” to keep trade flowing.The EU has announced plans for visa-free travel and aviation rights.The French have installed high-tech scanners at Calais to keep both trade and tourism flowing.Friendly “Open Skies” agreements have been signed with our most important partners outside the EU — the US and Canada. We have agreed transitional trade agreements with Switzerland.There is so much to be optimistic about.As for our trade with the EU, that will not stop evenextra tarfs are slapped on our exports.The EU has a trade surplus of £billion with the UK.In , European countries sold £billion-worth of goods to us — that’s a lot of cars, food and wine they want to go on selling us.It is strongly in Europe’s interests to cut a deal.There are so many advantages of a No Deal Brexit. Number one, we keep our £billion — the cost of Theresa May’s deal. That is taxpayers’ money that can be used to boost British businesses.We will be free to enter into new trade deals. We are the fth largest economy in the world. The suggestion that we are too small to cut trade deals is nonsense.Australia, a much smaller economy than ours, negotiated deals with China, South Korea and Japan in just  months.Iceland has an agreement with China and its economy is tiny compared to ours. We would be free to run our economy as we wish, slashing red tape and burdensome regulation.Our friendships across the world with Commonwealth and other English-speaking countries can be re-energised. We have nothing to fear.The risks of staying in the EU, by contrast, are great.The EU has not been an economic success. Its love affair with bureaucracy and heavy taxation hold it back.Its growth rates since the financial crisis have been much lower than ours. Levels of unemployment are so high in some EU countries, no wonder young people there come to the UK where, at four per cent, we have the lowest level of unemployment for  years.As a hotelier, I can say without exception, it is much more dficult to do business in Europe than it is in the UK.The EU’s high corporate taxes, complex labour laws and tricky legal system make Britain’s low taxes and fair laws very appealing.There are so many reasons to be cheerful about our future outside the European Union.But Remainers are not able to provide any positive arguments for staying in.That is why they scaremonger with Project Fear. They won’t listen to the British people.They want to reverse the result of the referendum by almost any means.No one should believe their blinkered view and this country should not be held hostage by it.Britain has always been a world leader. We should not doubt that we always will be.A No Deal Brexit is the only way of ending the uncertainty and allowing us to get on with our lives as a successful, independent nation.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Their motion was backed by a majority of MPs. But it still has three fairly obvious shortcomings.First, the Government isn’t in favour of leaving the EU without a deal. It agrees there shouldn’t be “no deal”. It has a deal. It is in favour of passing its deal. Second, the Government doesn’t need to be reminded about the damaging ­consequences of leaving without a deal.It knows what they are. Making it harder to prepare doesn’t make the ­Government keener to avoid no deal, because it’s keen to do that already.The third point is the most important one. Among those who argue that no deal must be avoided, there appears little agreement on what the alternative might be. The main sponsors of yesterday’s footling motion in the Commons are admirably open-minded but appear to have no idea how to win the majority of MPs around to their open-mindedness.I suppose these anti-no-dealers think they are warning Theresa May that,her deal is defeated next week, she has to come up with something . But this advice is only sensiblethere is an obvious alternative that stands a ­better chance of passing the Commons. Come on, really, what is that I’ll make a personal point at this stage. I believe that the referendum produced a legitimate outcome that Parliament has a duty to implement. It would be a grotesque failurewe were not able to arrange to leave.I’ve been against a second referendum all along. But even so, I insist that the departure should be orderly. I’m not ­willing to support a calamitous crashing-out, evenit means accepting the shame of failing to implement Brexit.Yet what do the anti-no-dealers offer to someone like me, who ought to be one of their natural supporters  Nothing except the frivolous message that they, too, are against no deal. And a perverse deter­mination to make an ­accidental no deal even worse than it might otherwise be.In those circumstances the only sensible position for me is to back the Prime ­Minister’s deal and urge Morgan, Cooper and Benn to do the same. Let’s look at the options once Mrs May’s deal is defeated in the Commons vote, as it seems it will be.There is the idea that she might be defeated in a no-confidence motion, lose the ensuing election and be replaced by a Corbyn government that negotiates a new deal. Except that a successful no-confidence motion is highly unlikely and there certainly won’t be a new deal, evenLabour got into power.By the way, the Labour Party is now toying with fighting an election, proposing a renegotiation with Brussels which would be followed by a public vote. In this vote, would they back leaving the EU  Or are they seriously suggesting they renegotiate a deal which they then urge voters to reject by recommending we stay in the EU after all Brussels would ­certainly want that. So you would have two sides negotiating a withdrawal ­agreement that both hope would fail. I think we can safely scrub that one off the list of sensible ideas.Next, there is the option of arranging to remain in the single market, in a Norway-style arrangement. This would require support from the Labour front bench to succeed because a lot of Tories would oppose it, evenMrs May agreed to it. But Labour has ­repeatedly resisted this idea. At the moment, a Norway-style deal stands less chance of success than Mrs May’s deal.A more realistic option is that ­Parliament supports a permanent customs union. Shortly after next week’s vote, members of the House of Lords will ­consider the Trade Bill.Peers will almost certainly pass an amendment to the bill, allowing Britain to stay in a permanent customs union with the EU. That creates a showdown in the Commons, where it is quite possible, given the strength of support, that the ­Government would have to agree.This would cause turbulence in the ­Government but, crucially, it would allow Labour to support Mrs May’s dealit wanted to — and to get it through the ­Commons. However, I doubt very much that it will want to. Labour only supports a customs union in which we get to decide on trade deals, which is not on the table.Then, of course, there is the possibility of delaying Brexit with or without a ­second referendum. Labour is still ­resisting this option and,it backs it at all, might do so in a form which is impossible to implement, such as ­insisting its own renegotiateddeal be on the ballot paper.In these circumstances, the chance of us accidentally ending up with no deal is very large. It is irresponsible to hinder any preparations we may need to make.We should be thinking harder about how to manage it. What side-deals do we need on things like air travel  Is there any way of agreeing a short transition   What physical preparations are in place Passing motions against such measures is worse than foolish — it’s positively reckless.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Right ahead.”Then we all sat and waited for the impact that would surely follow.And waited . . . and waited, as Gemma remained stubbornly upright for the duration.Such is le at Dancing On Ice, “the show where anything could happen”, according to the continuity announcer, but never actually does.That’s the main reason why people stopped watching and ITV buried it in a cold and shallow grave five years ago.Then, without much warning or any great demand, it was suddenly brought back to le, last year, and proved every bit as underwhelming and injury free as I remembered.There’s no horse too dead for another ITV flogging, though, so it’s just ed for yet another run, with most of the same fixtures and fittings.Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby do a solid enough job of hosting, considering their script could suck a black hole inside out, and there’s a four- man Ice Panel where the truth bombs are exclusively supplied by Jason Gardiner, who arrived dressed as Bret Maverick for Sunday’s opening show.What seems to separate this year’s Dancing On Ice from almost every other series, however, is the line-up. It’s actually quite imaginative and offers the show a serious chance of redemption,just one of them can be hospitalised before the end of the run.Among the  contenders, we’ve got: Westle’s Brian McFadden, Richard “Hollywood is the catalyst for everything I do” Blackwood, cricketer Ryan Sidebottom, and Saira Khan, who was advised by Ruth Langsford to “do Strictly”, but is a bit too low rent for the BBC so is stuck here wearing skates and tights.Despite having two hours to fill, none of that lot actually got to dance on Sun- day, though, as, I suspect, ITV wanted to clear the decks for its preferred bookings.These include -year-old Didi Conn , from Grease, Corrie’s Jane Danson, who was put in “a horse lt, with half rotation”, and Mark “Joe Mangel” Little, who’s turned into Dog The Bounty Hunter since we last saw him on Neighbours.But let’s not kid ourselves here. The reason many of us probably tuned in, on Sunday, in was to see Gemma Collins.Towie’s self-styled “GC” the first letter of which stands for Gigantic. A woman who really could do with a heavy landing on that over-entitled a**e of hers or, better still, developing a work ethic and some humility.I prayed for the worst then, and saved what was left for her partner, Matt Evers, but he’d clearly taken one look at Gemma and thought “screw that for le without a disability allowance”.There were no lts, no falls and she didn’t even have the decency to rip her drawers when she tried the splits. Sunday was just another entry in DOI’s endless list of crushing disappointments.Partly thanks to some very sympathetic marking, from everyone except Jason, Gemma will also get to skate again in a fortnight, which, I think I’m right in saying, means they’ll have to make an attempt at the infamous “King Kong lt”.And then, once Addison Lee has dropped her off at the rink, it’s on with the skating.Piers Morgan: “I bumped into Gemma Collins in Langan’s restaurant, at Christmas, and . . . ”A “She’s OK, actually.”B “A Japanese sports network bought the footage for million yen.”THE expression TV gold doesn’t begin to do justice to BBC’s fly-on-the-wall documentary about Matt and Luke Goss’s O reunion gig.It’s a genuine masterpiece that would deserve to be mentioned in the same breath as Spinal Tap,the pair of them weren’t so wonderfully serious about everything.Bros: After The Screaming Stops is the title of the film, directed by David Soutar and Joe Pearlman, who had the good sense just to point their cameras at the boys and let them say things like: “I made a conscious decision, because of Stevie Wonder, not to be superstitious.” “Rome wasn’t built in a day, f*** me that’s true, but we don’t have the time Rome did.” “He was a rectangle, I was a rectangle and together we made a square, which is a fortress.” And “There were  one-way streets and one solitary two-way street, where me and my brother met in the middle.” .As well as all the tortured metaphors and Matt’s profundities, though, the film also features a fantastically earnest rant about conkers and an escalating feud between the boys, which should have had every single viewer crying out for both of them to be included in the next I’m A Celebrity line-up, pretty much from the word go.But how did I feel at the end of this emotional dual carriageway In the words of poet philosopher singer Matt Goss: “Two words. Privileged.”John Humphrys: “At least  of the  books of the New Testament are usually attributed to which author ”The Time It Takes, Joe Lycett: “New Year’s Day in the UK, January or December ”Lauren: “December.”And Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “In , Mark Calaway, who’s better known as The Undertaker, retired from which sport ”Gerry: “Golf.”The Voice UK fooling me into thinking it might go a whole episode without Jenner Hudson “spontaneously” bursting into song.Luther turning out to be a soulless, unpleasant, far-fetched mess. The insane pouting contortions of Candice “Bake Off” Brown during Celebrity Mastermind.The BBC somehow crowbarring an anti-Brexit dig into The Greatest Dancer.And Dee Dee Wilde calling her old Tena Lady troop, on the same show, Pan’s Fans, rather than the far more appropriate and eye-catching Pads People. Basic stuff, really.Steve Howey: “You need to have experienced that experience to have the experience.”And Phil Thompson: “All these City players are like for like. Even Danilo, who isn’t as good as Kyle Walker.”JUST when they thought we couldn’t send them anything worse than the potato famine, up pipes Last Leg Of The Year guest Sue Perkins with this Brexit bonus: “My New Year’s resolution is to try and track down a dim and distant Irish relative, so I can finally get that passport.”Andthere are any genealogists who can help, send the information to me marked “Generation Game: Urgent.”Knighthood’s in the post.Paul Ryan’s Farage cameo on Brexit: The Uncivil War.Clarkson not trying to be likeable, on Millionaire, which, ironically, made him very likeable.Bradley Walsh hating every second of his skye on ITV’s Breaking Dad.Simplicity Cremations’ perfectly-placed advert during The Last Leg Of The Year .And Billy Connolly, overwhelmed by love, on BBC, paying tribute to: “All the things that made me good and bad, Scotland.”Match Of The Day’s Jonathan Pearce on Alo Morata: “He needs to do that game in, game out to prove he’s good enough for Cha.”“They need to do that gay men, gay marriage to prove he’s good enough for Cha.”Sent in by Iain Milne, Newcastle. Picture research: Amy Reading.TV dramatists haven’t yet rewritten the result of Brexit.But, trust me, they will eventually. This is just the start of the softening-up process.Brexit: The Uncivil War, a Channel  production that toyed with neutrality, for about  minutes, but had given up any pretence long before the drama’s rather desperate postscript finally stopped trying to nudge viewers in the Remainer direction.The two main characters weren’t entirely subtle either.One, played by Benedict Cumberbatch, was Dominic Cummings, the hi-vis dork who was in charge of the Leave campaign.The other, “I’M IN” leader Craig Oliver, whose portrayal, by Rory Kinnear, as a brilliant-but-tragic hero, was rather undermined by the fact Craig Oliver was also one of the drama’s political advisers.What saved The Uncivil War, though, was the acting, particularly Paul Ryan’s Nigel Farage turn, and Cumberbatch, who wasn’t a perfect fit for Cummings as his Durham accent slipped too often.It’s a performance brimming with such mesmerising charisma, though, I can genuinely see The Uncivil War effecting genuine change – two extra zeroes on Dominic Cummings’ next salary.Such is the real power of TV drama.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It comes after the Department for Exiting the European Unionwere ridiculed for sending “clunky” translations of the Brexit white paper into  European languages. Translation experts found numerous mistakes and irregularities in several translations, including the French, German, Croatian and Welsh language versions of Theresa May ’s Chequers plan. The fees were registered ahead of the EU leaders informal summit in Salzburg in September and the final November summit on Brexit.   Labour MP Jo Stevens, a leading supporter of the People’s Vote campaign, said: “What an embarrassment – the Government has had to hand over huge sums of money to the EU to translate their negotiations for them. “Maybe the original tactic of trying to talk slower and louder didn’t work ” DExEU documents reveal the department spent pound, on translations in September , when Theresa May met with EU leaders in Salzburg. And in November, which saw the crunch summit where the PM secured agreement for her deal, the department spent pound,.   The department had previously been ridiculed after it translated the executive summary of the Brexit white paper into  languages to distribute to leaders from EU countries. The French version translated “a principled Brexit” to “un Brexit vertueux” - which critics said changed the meaning of the term by adding an increased ‘moral’ element to the phrase. The Croatian version used an outdated translation of ‘United Kingdom’ which has not been used for a number of years. Welsh speakers complained that their version used the word ‘cenhadaeth’ to mean the mission of an organisation. In fact, it most closely translates to ‘religious evangelism’. And the online German edition misspelled the word ‘Deutsch’.   Ms Stevens added: “It’s no wonder the Government has ed with such a shoddy deal when they had to pay our negotiating partners in the EU to do the interpreting. Parliament should reject this deal when it comes to a vote next week. “Paying the EU millions in interpreting fees is symbolic of the whole shambolic Brexit process – an embarrassing waste of both time and taxpayers’ money. It’s time to let the public have the final say through a People’s Vote.” A Government spokesperson said: These interpreters’ costs have nothing to do with translating the White Paper. “DExEU pays interpreters’ fees for meetings at the European Union on behalf of all Government departments. That is what this money was for. DExEU releases data on its spending over pound, every month. Since its formation in , it had never listed any spending on translation services until September . DExEU later claried that the two charges represented a year’s worth of translation fees.

Fronting the BBC’s flagship political discussion show for the first time, the Antiques Roadshow presenter demonstrated that she’ll be no pushover.As the Tory deputy chairman tried to claim his party were in control of the Brexit process, she intervened to the delight of the audience.She said: So James,this is being in control of the Brexit process, what does not being in control mean ’   And it wasnt just the Tories she gave a hard time.

Bruce, , was praised for not letting the politicians “waffle” and for keeping the debate moving. Audience member Damian Singh told the : “She gave all the dferent ists time to put their time across. “There were a few times when she challenged Emily Thornberry and James Cleverly because they weren’t really answering the question and she kept saying come back to the question, come back to the question. “She was very good at that and overall she was very good. “She did give a little talk beforehand saying it is my first time, I’m a little bit nervous, but during the show she was excellent. “She said don’t be afraid to hiss and boo and clap what you like and ask as many questions as you want.” Colin McLeod said: “It was a very polished performance, there were a couple of little technical problems but she just sailed through it. “She was really confident. You would have thought she had been doing the job for years. “She didn’t let any of the politicians politic too much and when the politicians tried to take the discussion, like for example when James Cleverly wanted to talk about the Mayoral elections, she shut them down straight away.” And Jonathan Watson added: “I think she was very natural, very relaxed and like the pro that she is.

Now were told there could be one next week, meaning the country will go to the polls in March - just a fortnight before were due to Brexit.And there is almost nothing that could be a bigger disaster for him.For it to happen, there would have to be a massive swing against the government. Such a swing could happen onlythe country turned against Brexit something entirely possible, in this febrile atmosphere. Surveys have shown most UK constituencies now have a majority to Remain.If that happened, hed be the first Labour leader in almost a decade, handed a mandate to rip up the fondest dreams of his arch enemies on the Tory backbenches.A mandate backed just as strongly by Labour voters, .m of whom have switched from Leave to Remain. A majority of both Labour voters and paid-up members of his party also want a second referendum, and at the same time more than half of his partys members have considered quitting it because they oppose Brexit. Just four months ago the Labour Party conference backed a second vote - backed it, more importantly, with a standing ovation for Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer.And this week, , Labour members wrote to him ahead of a policy meeting this week demanding he do more to oppose Brexit. The Devizes Labour Party said people were resigning already and warned of a mass exodus. He is opposed to the Tory deal and last night, he voted to make no deal a financial impossibility.So as a democrat and a man of principle, as a politician and a humanist, and as a man who has opposed both Theresa Mays deal and not bothering with a deal at all on the grounds of the damage it would do, theres only one option left. Hed have no choice but to stop Brexit dead. Which would be awkward, because Our Jezza wants to Brexit with all his heart.  He has said the EU always suffered a serious democratic deficit and said it handed economic policy to an unelected set of bankers. He has complained about its free market, the business free-for-all, its limiting of national sovereignty and growing military co-operation. He voted against further EU integration, over and over again.He basically said a lot of the same things as Nigel Farage, but without holding a pint of beer or being invited onto Question Time.He has tried to change.After he became Labour leader, Jeremy wrote in the FT that we should remain in the EU and negotiate to restore our rights. And in , during a visit to Brussels, he told the BBC: The Labour Party is going to be committed to campaigning to stay in the European Union... when theres a Labour government in , we will be trying to ensure ... a Europe that is based on social justice and good, rather than solely on free-market economics.But he wasnt that committed to Remaining. He went on holiday during the referendum campaign and the evening before the vote held a hustings at Islington Waitrose. He couldnt have been futher away from the Labour heartlands which voted to Leavehe tried. The referendum presented him with the same problem as every other party leader - a large turnout, a small majority, and an instruction to not only deliver a unicorn but one that was red, white and blue.Labour, like the Tories, had its support split between Leave and Remain. Jeremy was presented with a tightrope along which he must tiptoe while appeasing two totally-opposed desires. His problem was made worse by the fact only one of them was possible, and he preferred the other one. But a few months ago his job became easier. Labour voters switched to Remain. His party demanded another vote. His activists want him to oppose. His MPs want him to present a firm alternative to Theresas mayhem. In such a situation, the electoral maths, Parliamantary requirements, and democracy itself combine to present one blissfully-easy path for any party leader to take - to Remain. He took the other one. Not the path that backs Brexit. No, Jeremy chose to stay on the tightrope. To take no sides and then to add immeasurably to his problems by asking to be given an utterly-impossible job AT THE SAME TIME. While trembling above a precipice, he has demanded the heavy burden of premiership be placed on his shoulders. To not only find a cure for the NHS, house the homeless, decide what to do in the event of nuclear war and authorise drone strikes on terrorists in foreign lands - which would be enough to keep Gandhi awake at nights - but to solve the insoluble problem of Brexit, something which has devastated the Tories like political Ebola.This is either stupid or heroic, depending on your objectivity. But take another step back, and youll see its a circle that even this messianic geography teacher is going to struggle to square.  Because as PM, Jeremy would have to do what he has said he will. And he has said pretty much everything. He has said remain, he has said Brexit. He has said renegotiate a better deal, while saying no more free trade. He has called for more responsive democracy, but wants to adhere to what the people said almost  years ago rather than what they say today.He has criticised the Good Friday Agreement, and as PM would be forced to defend it. He gets to dump on the DUP which everyone will enjoy, especially them, but to do so he has to say that supra-national trade, globalism and capitalism is the best way to be free.And to top it all, what hes most recently said is that even though weve spent all this time talking about how we will talk about a trade deal, we want to start again. Trade can wait, and Parliament can be shackled, for a couple of years more.Theresa might be a stupid woman, but I cant wait to see what the lipreaders see him being calledhe tries that.Of course, he might not be PM. He could be a victorious loser, again. On the Opposition benches he can holler and criticise without having to decide, andhis previous positions on Europe are anything to go by, not deciding is his favourite decision to take.Being PM means picking a principle and sticking to it. It means listening to the rest of the country, the party and the Parliamentary party. It means resolving Brexit the quickest and simplest way, so that Labour can get on with unpicking  years of tragic Tory rule.It means hard maths, and putting the countrys wishes before your own. And that is perhaps why he had no confidence in asking for a no confidence vote before Christmas, and why when a shadow minister said thered be one next week it was quickly defined as a personal opinion rather than a party one. Corbyns best interests are served, not by being PM, but by pretending he wants to be, and doing everything necessary to be PM except taking the final step, and filing the paperwork.The problem with that is your, and my, and the countrys, best interests are not being served at all.

I know, Mr Speaker, there are some distinguished citizens in this country who have put on their cars a poster or sticker saying bollockss to Brexit - but we now know from Labours own frontbench that their official Brexit position is bollocks.MrGoveadded: I have to say that the shadow international trade secretary is a jewel and an ornament to the Labour front bench.He speaks the truth with perfect clarity, and in his description of Labours own policy can I say across the House were grateful to him, grateful to the constant Gardiner for the way in which he has cast light on the testicular nature of Labours position. His remarks came as he opened the latest day of debate on Theresa Mays Brexit deal. Liberal Democrat former minister Sir Edward Davey called a point of order, asking whether Speaker John Bercow had made a new ruling on Parliamentary language which I am not aware of    Mr Bercow responded that MrGovehad not been disorderly and use of the word was a matter of taste. He said: I have made no new ruling on Parliamentary language and I was listening, as colleagues would expect, with my customary rapt attention to the observations of the Secretary of State for Environment Food and Rural Affairs. I richly enjoyed those observations and particularly his exceptionally eloquent delivery of them, which I feel sure he must have been practising in front of the mirror for some signicant hours. Theres nothing disorderly - because a number of people were chuntering from a sedentary position that the use of the word beginning with B and ending in S, which the Secretary of State delighted in regaling the House with - was it orderly  Yes, there was nothing disorderly about the use of the word - I think it is a matter of taste.   Opening debate for the day, Brexiteer MrGovesaid compromise was inevitable with any Brexit deal and insisted Mrs Mays agreement honours the referendum result and protects the interests of every British citizen. He went on to defend the Northern Ireland backstop, saying: One of the opportunities that the citizens of Northern Ireland have as a result of this deal is to have unimpeded access, not just to the rest of the UK market, which is essential for the maintenance of our union, but also unimpeded access to the rest of the European Union. The Cabinet minister also warned that a no deal would see economic turbulence, at least in the short term, and that tarfs of up to % would absolutely be applied by the EU to certain goods.   He later claimed other European countries will be envious of the UKs deal with the EU when pushed by the SNPs Patrick Grady . MrGovesaid: I think other countries will be envious of the position that we will be in because I think it will be the case, for the sake of argument, that some Italian politicians will look at our ability to have quota and tarf-free access to their markets, and yet at the same time be out of the jurisdiction of the ECJ and to have full control of our borders and to be paying no money. And he said he had decided after long reflection to back the PMs deal, saying MPs had an obligation to honour the mandate of the . million people who voted for Brexit in the EU referendum. He said: All of us might have a perfect version of Brexit, a change here, an alteration there - but we all have to accept our responsibility next Tuesday to decide, are we going to honour that verdict  MrGovesaidMPs reject Mrs Mays Withdrawal Agreement and we leave on March  with no deal, then of course Britain will prosper, eventually, but it is undeniably the case - the facts on the ground demonstrate it - that there will be economic turbulence and damage that our citizens and constituents face. He finished by saying: That is why I, after long refection, have decided that we must back this agreement. We must ensure that the British peoples vote is honoured, that their future is safeguarded, Britain can embrace the opportunities that our people deserve in the future. Shadow environment secretary Sue Hayman told ministers that it was not acceptable that after two years we have so little from the Prime Ministers negotiation with the EU. She said: Theres only one paragraph in the political declaration that refers to protecting rights and standards, which just shows how low down the priority this is for theGovernment, which is why we cannot support it. Ms Hayman went on to explain that Labour would pursue a general election in the event of Mrs Mays deal being voted down on Tuesday with aim of negotiating an improved deal.

You haven’t got a plan B ” Cleverly said: “Delaying to have a second referendum is not an option.”   Comedian Nish Kumar shouted: “Well what’s the plan, dude ” “Our plan is on the table,” insisted Cleverly. Bruce said again: “I just asked you what is your plan B  You said: ‘I’m going to tell you what plan B is.’” She asked the audience: “Have I missed it, folks ” “Our plan,” Cleverly repeated, “is to deliver the agreement that’s been negotiated with …” The audience began to groan. But asked by Lib Dem deputy leader Jo Swinson whether he really believes his party will win the vote on Tuesday, he admitted: “I suspect we might not.” And he claimed that had May’s deal been on the ballot paper in , people would have voted for it. Bruce again interjected, saying: “James, occasionally you have to stop talking.” She noted a recent poll, which found % of grassroots Conservatives do not support May’s deal. “So what are you talking about ” she asked. “The government is working on behalf of a whole country,” he said. “This evening we’ve seen a number of people say they support Theresa May, say that they support the action she’s taken. “You can rewind the video later on and watch it again.

Anyone that has ever been burgled will tell you that the cost goes beyond the value of the items stolen, from the psychological impact of your home being violated to the dficulty of replacing things with sentimental value.That’s why it’s surprising to see that almost half of people haven’t put any additional protection in place for their home, despite one in five believing they live in a burglary hotspot.   postcode areas with the lowest burglary rates Contents theft rateCA - Whitehaven, Cumbria .

Ms Garland added: For thieves, it’s all about risk versus reward –the reward looks likely to exceed the risk, they are going to target that home. Homeowners must do as much as possible to tip the balance in their favour and make things harder for burglars. People who have been targeted by thieves previously pay an average of . per cent more for contents insurance, so it pays to ensure your home is as protected as possible.If you take precautions - such as fitting new door and window locks, installing bar windows where necessary and using security cameras – you can reduce both your contents insurance and your anxiety about getting burgled.Looking for the best deal possible at every renewal will also help keep premiums low.

The Jack and the Beanstalk adaption at the council-run Neeld Community and Arts Centre in Chippenham, Wiltshire, left families furious and upset over Christmas. Standard tickets cost pound but the audience complained about the number of actors and the quality of the show. And red-faced bosses at the Neeld Community and Arts Centre took the unprecedented step of publishing an apology and giving everyone their money back, to the tune of pound,. Natalie Uff wrote on Facebook : Such a shame, we were really looking forward to seeing it but left at the interval as it was really bad. It was awful. There were only three people, no scenery, they couldnt sing or dance. At one point they were talking to voices in the wings as they ran out of people.   A review of the performance at Chippenham on Oooh Arrrs own social media says: It was pretty terrible! People walked out. My kids were bored and I thankfully found the bar. We mustve got the off-season cast! Wont be paying for that ever again. The venue said: We would like to apologise to all customers who attended the Jack and the Beanstalk pantomime and were disappointed by the quality of the performance. This was not the standard of show the Neeld is used to presenting.   We had been assured by the theatre production company there would be a cast of six professional actors with industry standard staging. The images provided by the company for promotional purposes, which we posted on our social media, did not reflect the show they brought to us. We would like to sincerely apologise again to anyone who was disappointed by the performance. We pride ourselves in providing high quality shows for Chippenham, and we hope to see you at the Neeld again in the future.   But response to the Neelds offer of a refund was positive, with many applauding the arts centre for taking action - though Peter Rose, however, commented: I dont want a refund - justmy magic beans. A Chippenham Town Council spokeswoman confirmed the show was not a private hire, but a show the Neeld had programmed. She said: We had a couple of complaints but we were disappointed ourselves. It was not the quality we would want to offer. A spokesman from Oooh Arrr Productions said: We are currently investigating this matter and due to legal reasons we are unable to comment further.

Pretty happy about it. The woman didnt realise her match was Cannon Harrison, , part of the Oklahoma Game Wardens team, who work to protect wildle in the area. After she said shed shot a buck, Cannon probed to find out the details about it.

She admitted to the warden that she did use spotlighting, which is illegal according to the states hunting regulations. The woman even shared pictures of the dead animal. Cannon found out her address and wardens arrived at her property.An investigation showed the woman committed another illegal act, which is harvesting only the deers head and back-strap meat,  according to the Tulsa World newspaper.

Mark Davies and three friends visited eerie wood Kennall Vale, at Ponsanooth, Cornwall on Saturday when they had the encounter. He claims footage shows a silhouette appearing across a small bridge which leads to one of the derelict mills which stand on the site. Mark and his friends were trying to measure paranormal activity in the area and communicate with supernatural beings, reports Cornwall Live They brought several instruments with them including a ghost box, which is claimed to be used by spirits to communicate through electronic voice.   In the video, Mark said: “I always knew they existed, I have felt them, smelt them, heard them and now I have seen them. “Some call them aliens, some call them demons, the Watchers and many other names.This is my best evidence visual up to date of a non-human being caught on my video camera. “Some might think this is a hoax, that I manipulated the photo evidence provided. Well, the smoking gun is the end clip. “You decide and thanks for the support. I am only interested in bringing real evidence to the paranormal table like other genuine people.”   Mark adds: “Spirits, can you touch those pods on the bridge, please  Make the lights to off like you did last time for us.Show us that you’re here. Show us that you live on, please. We’re here to communicate with you.” A few seconds later, Mark’s friend Wendy started choking as the image appeared across the bridge. “Can all the spirits in these woods stand in front of this bridge, please,” he continued, asking Wendyshe was okay. “Is it safe to go beyond this bridge  If it’s dangerous, can you show yourself, please, on this camera ﻿” He said that a change of frequency affected the group. “The frequency’s changing,” he said. “It’s getting really cold here right now. “There’s something around us. Can you stand in front of us please, and not affect us ” However, Mark started to be physically affected by the presence. The video shows that he had to walk away from the bridge for a bit. He said: “My back is killing me.”   Mark later said although the group could feel a presence, the creature could not be seen in person. He said: “I haven’t actually seen it, but spotted it when I watched the video back.” When asked what kind of being it was, Mark said: “I haven’t got any idea. “The face is not right, it’s not human.But it’s definitely there, it was a solid form, with the light you can see the shadow behind it.” The -year-old said that he did some research online and that he found reports of a strange creature in bushes and trees between Swanpool and Maenporth. The Paranormal Database website describes the phenomenon as cryptozoology and describes the creature as slightly larger than a dog, with cats face, walking on its hind legs. Mark said that the description seemed to match, and that the presence did not seem harmless. “I don’t want to go there again,” he said, laughing. “It gave me a feeling that scared the hell out of me. “I just think it’s evil. It’s not from this world, it was definitely there and it was a solid form. “I felt a presence, the coldness and the pain. I just asked it to show itself and it was there!”   Mark has been a ghost hunter for four years. He had been to Kennall Vale before, to investigate, and says he saw orb lights and strange phenomena. The wood used to be the site of a gunpowder factory which blew up in the th century, killing one person. Several buildings in ruins are still there and Mark believes that there was also an Iron Age settlement there thousands years ago.

But Donald Trump is far from the only world leader to boast a multi-million pound plane at his disposal. Today Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe touched down at Heathrow Airport in the pound million jet, which boasts lavish features and can carry up to  people. The  Air Force One has a meeting room, a secretary cabin, an administrative office, a media area with a press table, and a passenger section - for VIPs at the front and the media at the back. Mr Abe touched down in London ahead of talks with Theresa May ahead of Brexit . This could be the last time Japan’s current Air Force One will touch down in the UK, since it’s due to retire and to be replaced by the all-new boeing -ER in April.   The current aircraft has a capacity for  people, but is traditionally only used by the Emperor or Prime Minister and his associates on official government business. Japan’s two  planes usually fly together, so one can be used as a backup should something go wrong with the first. The reserve plane is known as Air Force Two.   Japan’s government has been using two - planes since , serving  prime ministers. The aircraft, which arrived at Heathrow Airport this morning, has carried out many important journeys. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has used it to visit  countries and regions, with  trips in just seven years.  In  the plane was used to carry forces personnel to a humanitarian mission in Iraq, and also used to bring the offspring of Japanese abductees in North Korea home to Japan. In  it transported bodies of Japanese nationals killed during a hostage crisis in Algeria. Due to the ’s old age, its maintenance cannot continue, and so it will be replaced by the special Boeing -ER in April. The interior fitting of the new  was completed in Switzerland last year. This will be the Japan Special Air Defence Force’s first boeing - to be used for VIP transport. It is not known what will happen to Japan’s current Air Force One jet after it retires from official business.

He brought me into the team against Inverness last month and again against Thistle on Saturday.“After Inverness I had a wee while out because of illness but he’s brought me back in again and I enjoyed it.”Despite his tender years, for the Dundonian having to impress a new manager at United is not something new.Such has been the turmoil there since he was first signed up that he’s had more gaffers than many players come across during the course of their entire careers.“I think it is about seven managers I’ve had here now and I’m only , so there have been a few. It is tough because I’ve never had a manager who has brought me into the team and given me a run of games. I’m glad the manager has given me my chance now and it’s up to me to take it.“He had been great with me, he speaks to me in training and it’s been good for me.“There a few of us young boys, some even younger than myself, that can get a chance.“The manager will also bring a few more new players in as well during this window because it’s not really his squad yet and we’ll see what develops.“He’s played me out wide. I’d like to play in the holding role in the middle because I’ve played there as well but, even though the manager has started me on the wing, he wants us to come into the middle and get on the ball there.”Smith has performed well under his new boss at a time when United have been struggling to maintain the momentum they were building shortly after his arrival.The youngster admits that’s been frustrating but believes United are not far away from ing to winning ways on a regular basis.“Saturday was very frustrating. After Ayr and Ross County dropping points we were looking to get a victory but it wasn’t to be.“Partick came at us first half to be fair to them. I thought in the second half we were very good and we can, hopefully, take that into this week against Dunfermline.“There are no bad teams in this league and, at times, you just need to battle it out in games.“We did that in the first half and I think in the second half we showed up better.“We got the goal back in that second half and then had a lot of chances to win the game, we should have been more clinical and finished them off.“We need to keep grinding results out.

in a Friday night clash that saw the men from the capital make an emphatic statement that they, not United, were the team to beat.There followed a disappointing home draw with Queen of the South and the month ended with another share of the spoils at Dunfermline.Sandwiched in between those stalemates was a Scottish Cup visit to Premiership Ross County that did nothing to boost morale – the Staggies running out big winners by -.Fast forward a year to Csaba Laszlo’s time as manager and it was another season-defining period.The final game of  saw a chance to go top blown when United went down - at leaders St Mirren and, although the New Year kicked-off with a comfortable - home success against doomed Brechin, after that the bottom quickly fell out of their promotion challenge.A trip to struggling Falkirk looked the perfect opportunity to take another three points to keep the pressure on the Buddies.Instead, United crashed to a - loss to the Bairns that has to go down as one of their worst results in recent decades.A trip to Dunfermline had to again be negotiated and only a point was taken.If this time round the cup provided some respite via a - win at Alloa, the month ended with another crushing defeat as Morton visited Tannadice and chalked up a - success that on the day might have been even better for the visitors.That’s why, following the now seemingly obligatory end-of-year defeat when a winning position was blown at Alloa the week before last, Saturday’s draw and below-par performance against the Jags will have alarm bells ringing among fans.Their big hope this time round has to be that, backed by the millions of new American owner Mark Ogren, the new players the manager has already started bringing to the club in the window will give the team a lt.Another home game this Saturday, when Dunfermline are the visitors, will provide a decent opportunity to take three points.With Montrose to follow in the cup and high-flying Ayr to be visited a fortnight on Friday, a win against the Pars looks a must, or those January jitters could again be season-defining."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/thecourier/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2019/01/SeeDundee-1-940x369.jpg ","title":"win experience dundee at its best with seedundee coms big weekend giveaway","story":"Dundee has been hailed as one of the UK#s top tourist destinations — and here#s your chance to find out why with SeeDundee.Dundee#s new visitor website SeeDundee has teamed up with some of the city#s most exciting hotels, restaurants, pubs and attractions to give you the chance of winning the ultimate weekend break in Scotland#s sunniest city.Taking part is easy.Just visit seedundee to find out more, and make sure you#re following them on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"mcdonalds-launches-veggie-happy-meals-as-greggs-sells-vegan-sausage-rolls","story":"MCDONALDrsquoS restaurants across Glasgow have launched their first-ever vegetarian Happy Meal for children from today."},{"url":null,"title":"richard-madden-flashback-to-when-rising-actor-spoke-to-the-evening-times","story":"RENFREWSHIRE actor Richard Madden has picked up a Golden Globe for his role in gripping BBC drama Bodyguard."},{"url":null,"title":"is-jermain-defoe-past-it-this-is-what-the-stats-say","story":"THE transfer window has only been open for just over a week, but Scotlandrsquos top sides have wasted no time in bringing new bodies in and getting deals over the line."},{"url":null,"title":"celtic-sign-2m-ivorian-striker-vakoun-issouf-bayo-on-four-year-deal","story":"CELTIC have announced they have signed Vakoun Issouf Bayo on a four-year contract, subject to the Ivorian striker passing a medical and being granted a work permit."},{"url":null,"title":"drivers-abandon-vehicles-after-being-left-trapped-in-glasgow-car-park","story":"UPDATE:Member of the public lsquoforced to direct rush-hour trafficrsquo at busy Duke Street junction amid chaotic scenes.

No more.McInnes and his squad can now look at the lush G training pitches on the outskirts of Dubai in the knowledge they will soon have access to similar facilities.Aberdeen have already begun work on a training complex at Kingsford on the outskirts of the city, which is on track, during the close season.It is phase one of a plan with a £m ,-capacity stadium also proposed for the site.McInnes said: “We have been successful on the pitch and managed to raise the standards in spite of not having the facilities others have.“Being out in Dubai and working in those facilities does give you a real flavour of what having a training ground is like.“Obviously the weather out in Dubai is much better, though.”Aberdeen recently confirmed an additional £m will be budgeted for the training facility to cover an upgraded specication for the G pitches, which includes irrigation and a hybrid surface with undersoil heating on one of the professional pitches.Kingsford will include a training pavilion, groundsman’s accommodation, three professional training pitches, two G pitches and one grass pitch, the latter being mainly for use by Aberdeen FC Community Trust.Chairman Stewart Milne insists delivering the training complex will be a “milestone” in the -year history of the club.Had they failed to deliver, Milne feared the repercussions would have included losing out on potential signings.Milne said: “It is absolutely crucial.

And they had reason to be upbeat, with Mackay-Steven not the only player ing from injury out here in Dubai.Centre-back Mikey Devlin also ed to training for the first time in six weeks.The -year-old has been side-lined since suffering a foot ligament injury while training with Scotland ahead of the Uefa Nations League tie against Albania in mid-November.It is understood Devlin is hopeful of being in contention for the fourth-round Scottish Cup tie next week.Centre-back Mark Reynolds also came through full training.

Stevie May had a little bit of an ankle strain from the Livingston game and will stay with the physios for a few days.“There are two or three of those lads still a bit short of joining in the full sessions, but hopefully that will come by the end of the week.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/01/SNS-18311566-ABERDEEN-117x84.jpg class=attachment-small size-small wp-post-image ","title":"vlog dons in dubai day one","story":"With Aberdeen#s training camp in Dubai under way, Sean Wallace and Jamie Durent reflect on ing faces, an exit and the excellent facilities in the Middle East.Press and Journal sports writer Jamie and Evening Express chief football writer Sean will be sending video updates daily from the United Arab Emirates."},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/01/SNS-18311566-ABERDEEN-117x84.jpg class=attachment-small size-small wp-post-image ","title":"vlog dons in dubai day two","story":"With Aberdeen two days in to their training camp in Dubai, Sean Wallace and Jamie Durent reflect on Gary Mackay-Steven#s choice between staying in Aberdeen or moving to New York.Press and Journal sports writer Jamie and Evening Express chief football writer Sean also discuss the bargain that is Sam Cosgrove in their daily video update from the United Arab Emirates."},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/01/SNS-18311566-ABERDEEN-117x84.jpg class=attachment-small size-small wp-post-image ","title":"greggs working to bring vegan sausage rolls to even more stores","story":"Following incredible demand across the UK, bakery chain Greggs has confirmed it is working to bring its new vegan sausage roll to even more stores.When the plant-based pastry was launched last week, there was disappointment in the north-eat when it was revealed none of the stores in the region would be stocking them.However, following massive demand across the UK, Greggs says it is working on increasing supply of the sausage roll, with the aim of rolling it out to the remainder of their stores.A spokeswoman for the bakery chains said: “Vegan sausage rolls have sold out well ahead of our expectations in those shops selected for launch.#We are currently doing all we can to increase supply to these shops as a priority.#When we have satisfied demand in these shops we will roll out vegan sausage rolls to the remainder of our shops where we know customers have been asking for it.#We are doing this as quickly as possible.”Greggs vegan version of the iconic snack has some “classic features” of the traditional sausage roll, including  layers of puff pastry – but instead of meat the filling is made with Quorn."},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/01/5c344cb99b9489.30894192-940x528.jpg ","title":"looking to get rid of your real christmas tree these north east goats want to eat it1","story":"A north-east woman is on the lookout for old Christmas trees – so she can feed them to her herd of goats.Sarah Pumfrett, , from Oldmeldrum is looking to pick up any real Christmas trees that may be going spare after the festive season.Sarah, who also owns several rare-breed horses, has been driving around the north-east picking up any discarded pines people have no use for.She said her  goats love the trees, which they strip bare before eating the nutritious needles.Sarah said: “They absolutely love them.“As soon as they see the trailer pulling into the yard with trees, they get really excited.

Local girls Jasmine McPhie and Carla Todd were both key players in Rangers Girls triumphant run in the Girls Under  Scottish Cup.In their run to the final, Rangers played the top four under  girls teams in Scotland beating Aberdeen - in the first round, then Hamilton - and Central Girls - in rounds two and three. A quarter-final tie against Glasgow City saw the Rangers Girls win - to set up an old firm semi-final against Celtic Girls in which the Rangers Girls emerged - winners in a close game.The final was played on Saturday November  at the Oriam Performance Centre in Edinburgh. In a competitive match, Rangers started strong but Hibernian began to come into the game and whilst both sides had chances, the score remained - at half time. In the second half, Rangers took the lead in  minutes but three minutes later Hibernian drew level.There were few chances in the remainder of the second half and at full time both teams were level at -. Rangers took the lead again in extra time with a deserved winner to secure the cup.Jasmine and Carla came through the Lochgilphead Soccer Centre from primary one age to primary seven, playing in local festivals.In   the girls were important members of the successful Lochgilphead Red Star  team which won the DFDL league cup and finished second in their league. At the end of that season they joined Rangers Girls where they are in their second season playing mostly in the Paisley League against boys teams but also in national girls# competitions.Both girls have also been involved in Scotland national squads for their age group and the Soccer Centre is delighted to see them thriving with a big club.With more than  girls now playing football through the Soccer Centre, the success of Jasmine and Carla should be a real inspiration for local girls.So girls, you may live out in rural Mid Argyll but with talent, hard work and the right attitude you could be creating your own football opportunities."},{"url":null,"title":"argylls astonishing marine pollution captured on camera","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowImmersed in the fast-moving cosmopolitan world of the London photographic scene, it would surely take something special to draw Elizabeth Presland to the chilly west coast of Scotland in winter.Elizabeth is picture desk editor for the Sunday Times.

Invited to join Cameron up at the Cruachan dam for the second of his two recent programmes, I was delighted to tramp the mighty mountain with Scotland’s Number one authority on outdoor pursuits.As an author and broadcaster, Cameron always has an eye on a good story, and so as well as asking me about the lack of health and safety regulations at the time the hydro project was being built, he also wanted to knowthere really was a murder during the construction. There was, as I told him, a body – but the body wasn’t identied, no arrests were made, no court case took place.It would be a shamethat construction period went down in history as an invasion of , workmen – #Tunnel Tigers# as they were dubbed – into one of Argyll#s most beautul settings and a possible murder.My book was intended to give the story of the local people whose lives were punctuated by this ambitious construction project. Quite rightly, those Tunnel Tigers had been lauded in a number of publications. The work that was done hollowing out Argyll’s highest mountain to provide electricity for the nation was amazing.The plan for Cruachan – as for the other major hydro projects of the post World War II era – was conceived by Tom Johnston, to whom I dedicated my book. Johnston was a politician who remained true to his ideals of bringing rural Scotland into the modern world. There was no power in the Highlands, and without power there could be no industry and no prosperity. The engineering genius was Sir Edward MacColl, whose biographer Norrie Fraser called him #a maker of modern Scotland#.Cruachan was the first reversible pumped-storage system in the world. During its years of construction from  to , eminent international engineers visited the project to see how the water was pumped between two reservoirs through reversible turbine generators. At off-peak hours, the water was – is # pumped back up to the reservoir you see high up in the corrie above Loch Awe, held back by a dam that is now so much a part of our landscape. The loch itself is the lower reservoir.I had imagined that the scale of such a project – using Scotland’s top engineering companies who shipped in workers from other parts of the UK and Europe – would have been a cause for resentment and protest by local people.That, of course, failed to take account of the vision of the folk of Dalmally, Lochawe, and Taynuilt. Although it took men with engineering experience to blast the  miles of tunnels, hollow out the mountain itself, and construct the dam, there was also a need for a support army. There were clerks and porters, joiners and caterers, folk willing to let out a room, a caravan, a house, serve in a pub where just occasionally it was necessary to keep a baseball bat behind the bar to maintain bonhomie. The project kick started careers, fortunes and marriages, and gave the area good roads and a tourist industry.If you haven’t visited the hollow mountain or walked Cruachan’s slopes, make  the year you do.[In bold please] Cruachan: The Hollow Mountain is available from the Argyll Book Centre in Lochgilphead and all good book shops, along with Marian Pallister#s other books of local interest.PICS:The Pass of Brander before work started. no_aCruachanLe before the project # the Loch Awe Hotel with steamers. no_aCruachanThe Queen opening the project in October . no_aCruachanWorking on the  miles of tunnels. no_aCruachanWorking on the road to the dam, overlooking Loch Awe. no_aCruachan"},{"url":null,"title":"now ewe see him the mystery of tarberts rambling ram","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowA four-legged Houdini running free around an Argyll fishing village has had local people flocking to social media channels.A rogue sheep # a maleof the Scottish blackface breed # was first spotted loose near Tarbert Golf Club around New Year#s Day.There followed a number of sightings around the Loch Fyne village of the scarlet-painted pimpernel, ranging from the harbour side to the Campbeltown road.He was even spotted near Tarbert Parish Church on Sunday January , though it is not clear whether he joined the flock.One Tarbert resident commented: #It#s like now ewe see him, now ewe don#t.#The woolly wanderer#s fun was curtailed early the following week when he was captured and taken to a nearby farm.As the tup sheepishly set off for more secure accommodation, it seemed the online jokers# fun was at an end # puns involving  #ewe#, #horns#, #mint sauce# and even some unfair references to certain football fans were all the rage on Facebook.But that was that, the sheep was gone.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"iceland plans new ayr store","story":"NewsIceland plans new Ayr store as Food Warehouse makes application to open at Heathfield Retail ParkAn application has been made to occupy the former Homebase unit at Heathfield, which was vacated last year.ShareBySarah Hilley:,  JAN NewsThe vacant site at Heathfield \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIceland’s new Food Warehouse store is lining up to open in Ayr. The food giant plans to move into the old Homebase shop at the Heathfield Retail Park. Home Bargains could also occupy the large empty unit, according to documents lodged with South Ayrshire Council. Fast-growing Home Bargains sells budget toys, household and beauty products, among other goods. The Food Warehouse has a bigger grocery choice than Iceland as well as bulk buys. A planning statement said: “The proposal is not speculative. Unit b will be occupied by Food Warehouse.” The plot is too big for only one shop, according to Heathfield Retail Park operators Ediston. The document added: “The prospects of securing a bulky goods retailer to occupy the whole unit are extremely limited. “Sub-ision of the unit is the only viable option to secure tenants.” Ediston is waiting for a decision from the council on whether food can be sold from the space. The firm has also applied to allow homeware goods to be offered at the plot as part of the Home Bargains proposal, which has yet to be decided. Home Bargains would take up a floorspace of , square feet and the Food Warehouse would span , square feet. Ayr Central owners MG Real Estate objected to the proposals to alter premises conditions at Heathfield. A supporting statement on the Food Warehouse plan dismissed the shopping centre as a possibility. It claimed that “Ayr Central has no units available that could accommodate the proposal.” The document also ruled out the former BHS site on Ayr High Street and the Kyle Centre. It said: “The former BHS unit is the only unit available with any sizeable floorspace but this is too large and would require signicant redevelopment and sub-ision to create a potential unit that may be suitable to the occupier.” Wren Kitchens is a recent addition to Heathfield, along with Poundland.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"man knocked down new years","story":"NewsMan knocked down in New Years Day hit and run as police appeal for witnessesA man was knocked down with the driver of a vehicle failing to stop following the incident in Tarbolton.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN NewsPolice are appealing for witnesses following the incident\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA man was knocked down after being the victim of a hit and run attack in Tarbolton.

Vanessa Good, who heads up her own independent firm based in the town’s Newmarket Street, admits travellers need “far more clarity” over Brexit. But she this week laughed off the notion that flights will be grounded – leaving sunseekers stranded – when Britain takes a step into the unknown. It comes as fears grow that a ‘no deal’ Brexit will spark chaos at Britain’s borders and lead to untold problems for travellers. Vanessa, , who bosses the Good Travel Company, said: “There’s no doubt people are on edge at the moment. “Our customers are still coming in to book holidays in the usual numbers, but there is understandable concern. “The problem is we’re seeing so much political scaremongering and it’s hugely unsettling at a time we need far more clarity.” Vanessa, whose firm employs seven across two sites and also specialises in currency exchange, insists her team is trying to issue a note of calm to holidaymakers. She said: “We have people flying out to EU destinations on March , which is the day after Brexit, and they’re perfectly relaxed about the situation. “Others are more concerned so we’ve seen some look to other destinations as a result. “After all, the world is a lot bigger than Europe, and there will definitely be a knock-on effect in that regard. “Market experts say a no-deal will have a negative impact on the pound, and that is obviously something that nobody wants to see. “But the idea that they start grounding flights and nobody can move anywhere seems a bit far fetched. “Uncertainty will always be the biggest crippler and that is the problem facing the industry just now. “But our message to people is to continue booking their holidays as before. “In reality, it is changes like the new EU visa coming into play in , which will cost around seven euros every three years, which will be the biggest dference.” An ABTA spokesperson said: “The European Commission has said that even in a no-deal scenario, flights will still operate between the UK and EU. “ABTA is providing holidaymakers and travellers with advice about Brexit and travel, including on pet passports and driving licences, which can be found at abta brexit.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnEuropean UnionAyrHolidaysAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"top-marks-for-peebles-dance-school","story":"A PEEBLES dance school is celebrating after achieving its best-ever exam results.

These days in between, traditionally known as the Daft Days, are my favourite of Yule time.Yet not so long ago the most popular focus of festivity was neither Christmas nor even Hogmanay, it was Handsel Monday.It fell upon the first Monday after New Year, although there was some dispute as to the exact Monday it should be celebrated, for some measured the date by the old calendar.This was the case for the country folk in East Lothian, or Haddingtonshire as it was then known. So Auld Handsel Monday fell for them on the first Monday after January .It was the country folkrsquos winter holiday because Christmas and Yule festivities had for so long been banned by the Kirk.The word Handsel apparently comes from an old Saxon word which means to give by hand.On Handsel Monday the family gathered together and shared gts and social time, which for much of the th century remained the main winter festival of the rural poor in East Lothian.The East Lothian writer and poet James Lumsden captured the atmosphere of this now forgotten holiday in one of his poems about the day.He tells us the children would wake up all excited, and the merriment would begin as the dawn of this winterrsquos day heralded a special time of conviviality and reunion:ldquoBy screich o morn the bairns are up,\"And loud the auld folk rousin\"What braws are donnd, what sangs are connd,\"What daffin an carousin!\"It was a time when family members made huge efforts tohome and celebrate together. Food had been specially kept for the occasion and those at home awaited the arrival of others who they had perhaps not seen since the previous Handsel Monday.Lumsden says streams of young folk left the towns for their homes in the countryside. Domestic servants, shop assistants, apprentices all set off in the early hours on Handsel Monday ason a pilgrimage, to share in the celebrations:ldquoSune ran we hame wi anxious haste\"For our grand Hansel denner,\"Pork chops and dumplins ndash lord a feast ndash\"A gorge for saunt or sinner!We can picture the scene as daughters and sons ed, greeted by parents and younger siblings, grandparents and old friends. It was a time of gt giving, with family and neighbours sharing treats.But the rich were expected to give too, as it was the tradition that masters and employers would give gts of drink, food and even a financial contribution to the communityrsquos festivities. In fact, the social norms were often overturned on this day, with the landowners serving and working for the poor on this one special day.While it had no religious content, Handsel Monday was in its own way sacred. It was a longed for day off for those who worked hard with little in the way of holidays. It was Christmas Day, Boxing Day and Hogmanay all wrapped into one.And as the day wore into evening, the merriment would build. People made the most of this precious social time together, with stories, dance and song:ldquoSyne sune wi reels, an strathspeys even,\"The wee cot housie dirled,\"As a the blasts o yearth an heaven\"Were gainst its boukie hurled\"Braw lads and lasses lap and skirled.As is always the case with such gatherings, time flew and too soon the day would draw to a close:ldquoBut daffin jigs, an sangs, an tales,\"Sped far too swith the hours on.Sad farewells would have to be made. Mothers and fathers hugged tightly their grown children as they prepared to set off back to their employment. Old and new friends from near and far, who had come to share the day, parted to their duties.They would have to wait another year for the next Handsel Monday gathering. Who knows what fortune and fate would have in store before that time:ldquoFor freends were met whom morrows gales\"Wad waft apart les course on\"Anither year, and maybe neer\"Again while times flood roars on,\"Might they eer meet, or even greet,\"This fickly warls shores on,\"Tho here this day!And yet it was to be Handsel Monday itself whose fate was sealed, as it faded in importance compared to Hogmanay and its traditions of gt giving and family time overtaken by Christmas.It has became part of our Auld Lang Syne, yet its spirit is perhaps now spread over a thankfully longer time of winter festivity.Happy New Year, when it comes.With thanks to Electric Scotland website for the copy of the poem."},{"url":null,"title":"man-caused-disturbance-at-tranent-opticians","story":"Paul Donaghue behaved in a threatening manner and repeatedly shouted and swore at MontgomeryOptometrists on the townrsquos Bridge Street.Donaghue, of Main Street, then began throwing papers around the shop and refused to leave the premises when asked to do so by staff.The -year-old also stole a toy from the Tranent Paper Shop and a quantity of foodfrom a nearby Greggs shop.All the offences took place on November .Donaghue then told police officers his name was James Davidson in an attempt to evade arrest and he was prosecuted for perverting the course of justice.He also pleaded guilty to being in possession of a screwdriver on the same day.Donaghue appeared at Edinburgh Sherf Court,where sentence was deferred for reports to next month."},{"url":null,"title":"new-council-houses-planned-for-ormiston","story":"Proposals submitted by East Lothian Council for  new homes in the village will be scrutinised by its planning department.The site, which would be made up of one, two and three-bedroom properties, is off Tynemount Road and forms part of a wider development of the area which includes  new homes by developer Walker Homes.The development would consist of four one-bedroom ground-floor cottages four one-bedroom upper-floor cottages six two-bedroom ground-floor cottages six two-bedroom upper-floor cottages  three-bedroom end-terraced houses five three-bedroom mid-terraced houses one two-bedroom bungalow and one three-bedroom bungalow.A council spokesman said the local authority was investing pound million in new council housing over the next five years.He added: ldquoThis development would provide a mix of dferent house styles, providing high-quality accommodation for families and iniduals, contributing to the outcomes set out in our local housing strategy by increasing the supply of affordable housing.ldquoWhile a small number of the new properties may be made available to a housing trust for rental opportunities, the majority of the new homes built will be offered as council housing.ldquoFollowing a number of applications for market housing on the site this detailed application is for the development of affordable housing on the site.Scott Gillies, chairman of the villagersquos community council, welcomed the potential of council houses being built.He said: ldquoWithout a doubt it is welcome."},{"url":null,"title":"unique-new-features-for-new-elphinstone-playpark","story":"Pupils at Elphinstone Primary School were given a choice of three potential options for a replacement playpark on the villagersquos Buxley Road.A vote was taken, with an option chosen to create a playpark with two features which will be unique to East Lothian.The first of those is made up of three D hexagon structures which have foot and hand-holds and are designed for climbing on.The second is a raised disc which youngsters can run on.The rest of the park is made up of familiar playpark favourites, including swings, a slide, seesaw, flying fox and climbing net.Elphinstone Community Association has been busy working with East Lothian Council on the project for nearly a year.Now they are hopeful the playpark, which it is estimated will cost about pound,, could be in place in the spring.Stuart MacKenzie, chairman of the villagersquos community association, said: ldquoI think it is fantastic.

The storyteller smiled and nodded: ldquoYes we all have dreams of being rich, but rich in what  Rich in love and happiness, or rich in money and things ldquoItrsquos the same, said one child. ldquoI donrsquot think it is, said another, looking at the storyteller. ldquoIs it ldquoThat is a good question, replied the storyteller, ldquofor sure having too little money is not a good thing. And the world is an unfair place where those who have too much money and too many things keep it to themselves, so those who have too little money never get their fair share, even though there is sufficient for everyone to have enough.ldquoSo I want to be one of those that has too much! declared one member of the class, to laughter.ldquoAndso would you share what you have with others who do not have enough  asked the storyteller.The child paused for a moment for thought: ldquoMaybe some of it.Other children voiced dferent opinions. ldquoIrsquod keep it all, ldquoIrsquod share it, ldquoIrsquod give some to my family and friends.It created some discussion amongst the children.The teacher was going to ask the children to be quiet and listen to the storyteller, but he indicated he was happy with what was happening.ldquoBut then yoursquod end up being poor again, said one. ldquoNo, Irsquod not give it all away.ldquoBut the whole point of being rich is that you can do what you want.ldquoWell, it also means you can help other people.The storyteller listened to the debate for a minute or two, then he beat his drum to regain the childrenrsquos attention.ldquoAnd so, for most here, money will be your dream. I understand that. Nobody wants to be poor. But lots of money is not really your dream.A chorus of: ldquoYes it is!ldquoNo, replied the storyteller, ldquomoney is not your dream, it is what you spend it on, what it might make possible for you that you do not have now, that would be your dream. That is what you must think of before you set out on your quest.ldquoBecauseyou pick the apple of your dreams, but have no dreams for your le, then you will still be poor, evenyou have all the money in the world.ldquoThatrsquos just stupid, said one boy. The teacher was quick to remind him not to be rude, but the storyteller asked him: ldquoWhat is stupid ldquoWhat yoursquove just said, you canrsquot be pooryou are rich, that doesnrsquot make sense. Thatrsquos what I meant is stupid.The storyteller smiled. ldquoPerhaps you are right, but do you think sometimes people can also be poor in things that money canrsquot buy There was silence for a moment. Then a girl said: ldquoYou mean people can be poor in dreams for their le The storyteller smiled and nodded.ldquoPrecisely, said the storyteller. ldquoThe whole issue of getting rich has stopped us thinking about what our dreams actually are.ldquoI want to be a dancer, said one child. ldquoI want to drive fast cars, said another.ldquoI still want to be rich so I donrsquot have to do anything and just play computer games.ldquoI want to make the computer games, said his friend. ldquoYeah, me too, agreed his pal.ldquoI want to be the President! another said.ldquoI just want to be happy!The storyteller beat his drum again.ldquoAnd so before you set off on your quest you must think about your dreams. And let me tell you that dreams can be shared too.ldquoHowrsquod you do that  he was asked.The storyteller thought for a moment: ldquoWell, for some their dream may be to save an animal that is in danger of being extinct.ldquoOr save the planet, called out another.ldquoThatrsquos why I want to be President.ldquoSo I want you to think about your dreams, and once you have you got your dreams you are ready for your quest into the forest, said the storyteller.The children assembled their thoughts and soon everyone had a collection of dreams to take with them to the apple tree.ldquoThere is one more thing I forgot to tell you, said the storyteller. ldquoItrsquos an important piece of information. You see, when you finally get to the clearing you must be very careful, for wrapped around the base of the ancient apple tree there is a ferocious dragon.ldquoIt sleeps, but very lightly. It will wake when you approach the tree. It will hear you no matter how quiet. It will hear your heartbeat. And there is no place to hide in the clearing. The moment you approach the tree, the dragon will pounce on you.ldquoCan the dragon fly  asked one.ldquoYes.ldquoAnd breathe fire ldquoYes.There were murmurings.ldquoAnd so, the storyteller continued, ldquoyou must decide how you will overcome and defeat the dragon. It is there to stop you reaching the apple of your dreams.Some of the children came up with immediate ideas:ldquoIrsquod run as fast as I could in zig zags.ldquoIrsquod distract the dragon.ldquoIrsquod shoot the dragon with a gun.ldquoIrsquod make a giant kite and fly to the apple.ldquoIrsquod take some friends and feed them to the dragon while I get the apple, then dream my friends back again.There were many solutions and the storyteller listened to them with interest. Each child came up with a dferent strategy.The storyteller nodded, explaining the powers of the dragon that it couldnrsquot be killed by bullets or blades or fire, that it was faster than lightning and once it had heard you and seen you it would go for you.ldquoKnowing all this, are you still going to try and defeat the dragon and reach the apple of your dreams They all said yes, refining their ideas.And so once the children had come up with their final strategy, the storyteller asked them to think about what they might need to take with them to defeat the dragon. They will have to carry these things through the forest, or perhaps collect them on the way.Then the storyteller set the children the task of drawing the things they would need and then the dragon and apple tree. In drawing the apple they would have to decide what the apple of their dreams would look like.When this was all done, the children settled down to hear who had the right answer.ldquoI have looked at all the ideas, said the storyteller. ldquoWhat I must say is that le is unfair and so is this quest. For some, the journey through the forest will be longer than others. The dragon will be more dficult to defeat for some than others, as its mood changes. But you have all come up with the same answer, and so you are all right.There were howls of protest.ldquoNo, we didnrsquot we all have dferent answers!The storyteller beat his drum again to calm the children.ldquoWell yes, you all have dferent ideas on how to defeat the dragon and reach the apple, that is true. But you all have the same answer to the most important question.ldquoWhatrsquos that  the children asked.ldquoWell, said the storyteller, ldquoI had told you how fierce and dreadful the dragon could be. And then I asked youknowing all this, are you still going to try and defeat the dragon and reach the apple of your dreams.ldquoAnd you all said yes, yoursquod try to reach your dreams, even though you had a big fight on your hands.ldquoThat, I believe, is the right answer. You may have dferent ideas on how to get that apple, but yoursquore all right because each of you will have to fight the dragon in a dferent way. The most important thing is your determination to get to that apple.ldquoWhatafter all that we fail  asked one child.ldquoYou might, said the storyteller, ldquobut on your journey to your dreams you may find a new path that leads to another ancient tree without a dragon.ldquoTherersquos another magic apple tree without a dragon !ldquoPerhaps, perhaps not. But the only way to find out is set off on the journey with determination in your heart.

Like the Ides of March, Britains fate must be sealed on Brexit day in only  weeks time.Will May finally win parliamentary support for her Withdrawal Deal  Will she be ousted in a cabinet coup  Will there be a repeat referendum  Will Britain end up revoking Article   These are the options, broadly speaking. About the only thing that seems pretty certain to me is that there will be no General Election and no ldquoNo Deal Brexit. I simply cannot see parliament or the country accepting the chaos, cost and potential suffering of crashing out of the European Union without any negotiated settlement.True, planes wouldnt fall out of the skies and trade would continue, somehow, but the disruption would create enormous stress. There is a strong possibility of food shortages, and people with medical conditions would suffer needless anxiety over medicine supplies. The fact that the Government is preparing to put the army on the streets and ports testies to the risk of civil disturbance. There would be a hard border in Northern Ireland overnight and a resumption of sectarian tensions. Small firms would go bust and big firms would leave.So, I am confident that MPs and ministers will prevent this happening,necessary by removing Theresa May and forming the equivalent of a wartime coalition. Working back from that the most probable outcomes look like: Revoking Article  or Mays Withdrawal Deal. And, it will be Labour, not Theresa May, the Tory Brexiters or the DUP, who decides which.Brexiters hate the Withdrawal Deal, which they think chains Britain to the EU, and Jeremy Corbyn does too ndash and for rather similar reasons. He thinks the state aid rules would prevent a Labour government nationalising the utility companies, and also believes that a permanent backstop would give Britain ldquono say on any future trade deals. Mays Withdrawal Deal should therefore be defeated by around - votes.Corbyn will then finally table that motion of no confidence in the government which he delayed in December. May will assuredly win that vote, because the last thing Tory MPs and the DUP want is general election, a Corbyn government and an even worse deal. May will now have won confidence votes from her own MPs and from the House of Commons. That will make her immovable ndash at least for the time being.Armed with this she willto Brussels and stage another televised spat with Jean-Claude Juncker. The  will probably have something  up their sleeves . Perhaps Michel Barnier will propose amending the Political Declaration to include a -month limit to the Irish backstop. This was dropped from the final draft of the December communique.The  could also extend the transition period making a commitment that negotiations must be concluded by March . This is already in the Political Declaration, but it could be built into a firm commitment and subject to independent arbitration. The Irish backstop would thus become a last resort and triggered only in the event of a total breakdown of time-limited trade negotiations.This will be the moment of truth for Labour, as Theresa May brings her amended deal back to the Commons in February. The hardline Brexiteers and the DUP will not be persuaded because the legally-binding Irish backstop will still be there in the Withdrawal Agreement. The future will be in Labourrsquos hands. Many pro-Europeans tell me that Corbyn will at this point ldquopivot to a referendum, voting down the Withdrawal Deal a second time, and backing a cross-party amendment for a Peoples Vote.But while he doesnt accept Mays Withdrawal Deal, still less Norway Plus, nor does Corbyn favour remaining in the European Union. Before Christmas, he caused widespread dismay among pro-Europeans by confirming that, evenhe were to win a general election, Labour would still be committed to Britainrsquos departure from the European Union.The Labour leaders instinct will surely be to secure concessions from Theresa May on the future trade negotiations. A closer alignment with the single market and a permanent customs deal, is what he wants. To get her business through, she would surely end up agreeing. Deal done. Britain leaves as planned. Pro-European Labour MPs would rebel, but that would be unlikely to scupper the governments pro-Withdrawal majority.Alternatively,Jeremy Corbyn stands firm and pivots to a referendum, there will be unprecedented turmoil in parliament, not least over what the question should be. Theresa May will stand down and there will be a political vacuum. As the clock ticks down to Brexit day, a new parliamentary party could emerge: the Europe Party, uniting all the pro-Remain MPs, and dedicated to a second referendum. The choice for voters would be Revoking Article  or No Deal. Mayrsquos deal, it seems to me, would be a dead duck by this stage.By Revoking Article  Britain would retain its opt-outs from the euro and its budget rebate and there would be no disruption of trade. It would be asBrexit never happened. Brussels would happily delay Article  for a referendum. However, this referendum would be like an offer voters canrsquot refuse, because MPs in the ldquoRemaniac Coalitionwould have to resign en massethe country opted for No Deal.It would be terrible campaign, exactly three years after the original referendum, with the far right raging about immigration. It would take years, decades for the bad will to subside. But faced with the prospect of a chaotic No DealI suspect voters would back Revoke. There is nothing undemocratic in having a final say. Parliament has failed to find a credible formula for leaving the EU.

Having bonded with Cave and guitarist Roland S Howard, this time Reekie made sure he had his camera.More than three decades on, some of the photographs he took that night and over the next few years in London and Berlin can be seen for the first time in Sometimes Pleasureheads Must Burn, Reekiersquos -page zine-like collection belatedly launched next weekend at Street Level Photoworks in Glasgow.ldquoLooking at the pictures again brought a lot back to me, says Reekie. ldquoI can remember the chaos and the aggression of the shows, but not any aggression in the people. I was really surprised to find everyone in The Birthday Party was so articulate, well-read and literate, and yet onstage it was almost like everything was stripped away to the most basic bones of absolute nihilism, and almost hatred for the audience. They got into a lot of fights that I witnessed, but after the show once things had calmed down, they relaxed with a bottle of bourbon, and you could chat with them about James Joyce or Dostoyevsky.The idea for Sometimes Pleasureheads Must Burn came after Reekie put some of his hitherto unseen archive on social media, and was approached to contribute to an exhibition in Los Angeles called Nick Cave Smoking. Reekie submitted four prints, one of which sold for . As Reekie puts it, ldquoIf someone in LArsquos willing to pay that for something Irsquove just got lying in the cupboard, maybe I should think about doing something.ldquoIrsquove always thought of doing an exhibition of my archive, but never got round to it. The book has already travelled as far afield as America, Japan, Poland, the Czech Republic, Bosnia, Scandinavia and Canada. Itrsquos never going to make me a millionaire, but I feel quite validated by that.Reekiersquos images capture an unguarded sense of ease amongst Cave and co, with the band captured backstage making their own mark on the back of a torn-down Sad Cafeacute poster. Despite a strung-out demeanour that foresaw the self-destructive effects that heroin would have on the band, there is a sense of camaraderie at play, with Cave and Howard in particular looking like brothers in arms. It was a bonding perhaps caused by the absence of bassist Tracey Pew, who was serving a prison sentence. This necessitated Howardrsquos brother Harry stepping in.ldquoIt was chaotic, says Reekie. ldquoHarry had never played onstage before, and you could tell that Mick Harvey, as the only non-drug taker in the band, was trying to keep everything together.Later images reveal a haunted-looking Howard captured with his post Birthday Party band, These Immortal Souls. Elsewhere, a now solo Cave looks increasingly messianic. While Pew was dead by the end of  and Howard passed away in , one of Reekiersquos fondest moments is of offering Howard, his then partner Genevieve McGuckin and These Immortal Souls a bed in his flat following an Edinburgh gig.ldquoI went through to take Roland and Genevieve tea in the morning,rsquo says Reekie, ldquoand they were both sitting up wearing matching silk pyjamas, and were so polite in a way that no Birthday Party fan would believe.Sadly, no pictures of this myth-busting incident were taken.While he continued to take photographs, Reekie went on to become a music journalist of note, writing for Esquire, GQ and Loaded after that side of his career was kicked off in s Scottish music magazine Cut. The cover image of Reekiersquos book was taken in the Groucho Club, where Cave held court about his newly published novel, And The Ass Saw The Angel.ldquoThat was my first cover feature for Cut, Reekie remembers. ldquoI wanted to do the photographs for it as well, but they got Gavin Evans to do them.Sometimes Pleasureheads Must Burn is the first in an occasional series of photobooks produced by Stereogram Recordings, which have released albums by the likes of The Eastern Swell, James King and The Lonewolves and The Cathode Ray. It is also the latest example of an ongoing unearthing of photographic archives from a pre-digital age that document often hidden histories of the post-punk era.This came to prominence in  with What Presence!, an exhibition and book of lost images by Glasgow-based former Sounds photographer Harry Papadopoulos. Produced by Street Level, What Presence! featured images of the Sound of Young Scotland era of bands, including Orange Juice, Altered Images and Fire Engines. Revealed! was a similarly styled document of the same era in Liverpool by Francesco Mellina, who photographed the likes of the late Pete Burnsrsquo band, Dead or Alive, and the post-punk scene based around Ericrsquos club.The Scene Inbetween and Untypical Girls are two volumes of DIY images taken of bands and fans in the s and s collated by Sam Knee, and which feature several images by Reekie. In a similar vein, former journalist turned AR man Ronnie Gurrrsquos Hanging Around Books has launched an ongoing series of booklets featuring never before seen seen images of the likes of Simple Minds and the Skids.As the age of the archive runs on, Reekie himself has thousands of photographic negatives in storage. These include shots of Edwyn Collins and Roddy Frame performing at the Assembly Rooms in Edinburgh, and of Sonic Youthrsquos Kim Gordon alongside Lydia Lunch in their short-lived duo, Harry Crews.ldquoI reckon wersquove got enough to do another seven books, Reekie speculates. ldquoI could do one of early s club le in Edinburgh. Thatrsquos more about the people who were there rather than the bands, which might appeal to people of a certain vintage who were around then.It is this sense of empathy that makes Sometimes Severed Heads Must Burn such a crucial document of its era.ldquoItrsquos a step back in time, says Reekie, ldquoand because itrsquos all fly on the wall stuff, you can see therersquos a trust there, which the people in the pictures didnrsquot have with a lot of people at that time. Thatrsquos what I think makes them worthy.Sometimes Pleasureheads Must Burn: The Birthday Party and Beyond - ndash Photographs by Innes Reekie is published by Stereogram, and launches at Street Level Photoworks, Glasgow on January .www.stereogramrecordings.bandcampwww.streetlevelphotoworks.orgends"},{"url":null,"title":"holyrood-bosses-criticised-after-spending-1000-on-msp-pipers-outfit","story":"A piperrsquos outfit was bought for the SNPrsquos Stuart McMillan in  at a cost of pound, but officials insisted it remains the property of the Scottish Parliament.This does not include the cost of a kilt purchased in the previous parliamentary session as this information is no longer held ndash meaning the overall bill is likely to be substantially higher.Mr McMillan, who represents Greenock and Inverclyde, holds the informal position of Holyroodrsquos bagpiper and has played at events since .He declined to comment, but the SNP insisted he has performed at more than  official occasions, taking no remuneration for his role.The Scottish Tories branded the spending a waste of taxpayersrsquo money.A spokesman said: ldquoTaxpayers will be dismayed to hear that pound of their money is being spent on special outfits for SNP MSPs.ldquoPublic money must be spent with care, not thrown around on such luxuries.Spending on Mr McMillanrsquos outfit was released following a Freedom of Information request.Holyrood bosses said he was provided with ldquoceremonial attire in parliamentary tartan over the last two sessions of parliament.However, they said the outfit remained the property of the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body and was adjustable, and could also be altered in futureneed be.Meanwhile, the cost of a kilt bought during the last parliamentary session was ldquono longer held.

Itrsquos absolutely right they are stopped.Mr Wishart commended the Speaker for putting the rights of MPs first and warned ministers: ldquoIf this Government wants Government versus Parliament, it will be on the losing side because we are now in the majority.In response, Ms Leadsom stressed how it was the Speakers role to \"uphold the rules that Parliament has made for itself, not to arbitrarily change those rules\".She explained that yesterday was not about Parliament taking back control but, rather, about a number of MPs, who had tried to put amendments to the business motion and were told it was unamendable and undebatable.ldquoThe role of the chair is to uphold the rules that Parliament has made for itself not to arbitrarily change those rules. So, yesterday was not an example of Parliament taking back control, it was an example of a dferentiation between those members who were told that it was unamendable and undebatable, and those who were told dferently.\"Mr Bercow then intervened to declare: \"There was nothing arbitrary about the conduct of the chair yesterday.\"This Speaker is well aware of how to go about the business of chairing the proceedings of the House because hes been doing so for nine and a half years.\"I hope colleagues will understand when I say that I require no lessons or lectures from others about how to discharge my obligations to Parliament and in support of the rights of backbench parliamentarians.\"The Speaker added: \"I have been doing it, Im continuing to do it and I will go on doing it, no matter how much abuse I get from whatever quarter its water off a ducks back as far as I am concerned.\"He piped up again after Mrs Leadsom reiterated that she was advised that the controversial amendment by her Conservative colleague Dominic Grieve \"would not be selectable\".The Speaker intervened a second time to stress that it was his responsibility as chair to select amendments.\"It is a matter for the representative and champion of Parliament, it is not a matter for a representative of the executive branch, who is the executives representative in the chamber of the House of Commons. Ill do my job and other people can seek to do theirs,\" he insisted.Earlier, Ms Leadsom confirmed the Government would abide by Mr Grieves amendment, which asks it to outline a revised Brexit plan within three sitting daysthe PMs deal were defeated. The normal process, as outlined in law, requires a statement within  days of the deal being rejected and a motion being tabled within seven days thereafter.\"Of course the Government will do so, the Prime Minister has shown her willingness to alwaysto this House, at the first possible opportunity,there is anything to report in terms of our deal and we will continue to do so,\" added the Commons Leader.Because the House is not sitting next Friday, then the deadline for Mrs May to make a statement on a Plan B would be Monday January . Her statement is likely to be made on this day with a debate and vote following in that week.The Governmentrsquos understanding of the Grieve amendment is that this debate would last only  minutes and only one amendment could be submitted. However, given the strength of feeling on the Brexit issue, MPs are likely to object to a debate lasting only  minutes. As has been seen this week, the Speaker could determine to interpret matters in a dferent way and allow MPs a much longer debate."},{"url":null,"title":"jeremy-corbyn-admits-delaying-brexit-day-a-possibility-if-labour-forces-general-election","story":"The Labour leader conceded that extending the Article  process, which stipulates the date of exit day, ldquowould be a possibilityhellipbecause of the practicalities of negotiating a new deal with Brussels.In a keynote speech, Mr Corbyn confirmed his party would seek to vote down Theresa Mays Brexit Plan next Tuesday and at some point thereafter call a confidence vote in her Government,she lost, in the hope of forcing a general election.:Speaker Bercow clashes again with Cabinet minister over parliamentary procedure on BrexitHe dismissed the Governments offer to consider new safeguards for workers as part of the Brexit package, backing a trade union assessment that \"it simply doesnt guarantee the protections that we are seeking\".The Labour leader confirmed that Labour would go into any early election on a  of opening new negotiations with Brussels on a Brexit deal involving a customs union, single market relationship and a guarantee to keep pace with EU rights and standards.He explained how \"time\" would be needed to complete these talks.Mr Corbyn insisted there was \"no split\" between him and his Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer, who on Wednesday suggested an extension of the two-year period for negotiations set out in Article  of the EU treaties might now be \"inevitable\".Askedhe agreed, the party leader said: \"Quite clearly, moving into office at a period right up against the clock, there would need to be time for that negotiation.\"What Keir was doing was reflecting the practicalities of how that negotiation would be undertakenhellipAn extension would be a possibility because clearly there would have to be time to negotiate.\"But the SNPrsquos Stephen Gethins called on the Labour leader to end the ldquopolitical posturing and work with other parties to break the Brexit deadlock and ldquosupport a second EU referendum.Sir Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, echoed the point, saying: ldquoWe have no confidence in this Conservative Government but neither do we have any confidence in Mr Corbyn.:Nicola Sturgeon faces grilling at FMQs over Alex Salmond investigationldquoIn the public interest, he needs to get  per cent behind a Peoplersquos Vote, including the option to remain in the EU.Speaking to party supporters in Wakefield in West Yorkshire, the Leader of the Opposition said a general election was the most \"practical\" and \"democratic\" way to \"break the deadlock\" in Parliament over BrexitHe said: \"If the Government cannot pass its most important legislation, then there must be a general election at the earliest opportunity.\"A government that cannot get its business through the House of Commons is no government at all.

This surface could accommodate hockey, netball , tennis as well as general multi-sport.”He adds that the council recognises that this option is not the preferred choice of Inverurie Hockey Club and Garioch Sports Trust, but stesses officers will continue to work with the club to attempt to meet its needs, making use of the new small pitch for local training opportunities.In addition, officers will consider how best to meet the hockey club’s competitive needs at Oldmeldrum Academy including access to changing facilities and adult matchplay opportunities when required on a Saturday.Funding for the two surfaces is included within the approved project budget.data-src\"https:res. jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"The Inverurie Business Association and We Are Inverurie believe shoppers will stop visiting the town centrethe free parking ends\"  Council urged to keep free parking viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"council urged to keep free parking","story":"Inverurie Business Associationhas been working closely with We Are Inverurie to retain the town#s -minute free parking.The option to remove free off-street parking from the town has recently been under review by Aberdeenshire Council.Both of the not-for-profit organisations have voiced concerns about the latest proposal to remove  minutes free parking from towns across Aberdeenshire, including Inverurie.At the end of November Aberdeenshire Council’s report to the Infrastructure Services Committee indicated that a preferred option of the Working Group was to remove all free parking across the region.Both IBA and We Are Inverurie believe that, as Inverurie’s parking is currently ing a surplus, removing it would effectively result in people having to pay to park in the town’s subsiding other towns, a move the two organisations say is “unacceptable”.A spokesperson from IBA said: “We feel very strongly that the removal of the free parking could have a negative impact on Inverurie’s retail and town centre businesses by reducing trade from local people who pop in to the shops, visit the bank or library, or get coffee and lunch.“Most people do not carry change and the parking app available at the car parks isn’t always the easiest for everyone to use and is dependent on drivers having access to a moblie phone.“We have been canvassing feedback from our social media followers and to-date the majority of people who commented have said that the  minutes free parking encourages them to use local shops, with many saying that they would notthe free parking was removed.”IBA and We Are Inverurie have approached Aberdeenshire Council to request that they reconsider the option to retain the free -minute parking in Inverurie to support the town’s local businesses and encourage people to shop locally.data-src\"https:res. jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"The three candidates who are contesting for the two Vice President roles within NFU Scotland will speak at the event\"  Inverurie hustings for NFU candidates viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"disney success for ne dancers","story":"Dancers from across the north east took part in the International Gathering of Scottish Highland Dancerecently.The event was held at Disneyland Paris and featured dancers from the Lawrence Dance Academy.Participants performed their own unique Disney-themed, Highland-based choreographies and compete in the annual Disney Magics Highland competition and at the Paris International Highland Gathering Championship.The dancers are also invited each year, such is their ability and stature, to dance through the Main Street of Disneyland Paris in a pre-parade that is watched live by thousands of Disney tourists.This year was no dferent, with over  Highland dancers performing and competing with great enthusiasm.Many awards, trophies and medals were won, but far more importantly each dancer and their families came away with a great experience and more friends.Principal and Director of Lawrence Dance Academy, Rhona Lawrence, said: “It’s such a great opportunity for the dancers.

He will be  next month but still visits schools and other groups to give slideshow presentations about his war experiences. Here we reproduce an interview with Don which was published in the Groat in June  to mark the th anniversary of the D-Day landings. Don flew to Normandy twice on D-Day, first dropping paratroops and then a glider with more troops and equipment.*WHEN the grey dawn broke over Normandy on June , , Don Mason had already made the first of his two contributions to the momentous events of D-Day. The young airman was part of the six-man crew of a modied Stirling bomber that had dropped  paratroops and their equipment at Ranville under cover of darkness. Heading for home, the Stirling came under fire from anti-aircraft guns on the French coast but ed unscathed to its base at Fairford in Gloucestershire. In the early evening the same crew were back over Normandy, this time towing a glider with more troops destined for the original dropping zone ndash and by this stage, almost  hours after the start of the Allies seaborne invasion, the full enormity of Operation Overlord was clear to see. \"It looked like a scene out of a nightmare,\" Don now recalls.Don had been fascinated with aeroplanes since his childhood in Worcestershire. As a young boy he once walked four miles with his family to see a travelling circus which featured a plane of Great War vintage Don could only gaze in wonderment as the flying machine entertained the crowds, and he resolved that one day he would fly an aircraft of his own. It was an ambition that would be fulfilled with the onset of World War Two.Although just  at the time of D-Day, Don had already clocked up numerous operations as a bomber pilot. He had been severely injured in a fighter attack over Germany in  and was declared medically unfit. After being reinstated on appeal, he was retrained as a radio observer.\"We had been in No.  Group Bomber Command,\" says Don, who moved to Thurso in the s but whose Caithness connection goes back to  when he flew Blenheims out of Wick. \"The whole squadron were suddenly lted out of Bomber Command and put into  Group, airborne support, which was a completely new role because wed never worked with paratroops or the like before.\"He was now in  Squadron, flying a modied version of the Stirling four-engined heavy bomber: the Mk IV troop-carrier and glider tug. \"We had to do a lot of exercises to get used to that aeroplane and to get used to dropping troops and towing gliders, which obviously was a dferent ball game altogether... it required a lot of dferent techniques.\"And it was necessary with any airborne group to drop them accurately in as tight a bunch as possible ndash therefore youd got to operate at a low height and also not get them scattered, so timing was important.\"There developed a formation flying technique which was called starboard echelon, so youve got two lines of aircraft flying parallel to one another. We had to practise these on group exercises, and a number of things happened: tow ropes broke, gliders went down in dferent places.\"On one group exercise we were flying along in this starboard echelon formation and there were literally hundreds of us ndash it wasnt just my squadron, it was a number of dferent squadrons ndash and suddenly an aircraft in the port line veered straight across into an aircraft in the starboard line and they both went down in flames. We lost two aircraft and two crews, just like that, on an exercise. Those are the things that stick in the mind.\"That tragic accident occurred on May , , in one of the last group exercises before D-Day. It was becoming clear that a big operation was imminent, one that would have major repercussions for the course of the war.\"Obviously we knew something was happening,\" Don says, \"because we were practising with troops and gliders and whatever. But we werent aware, of course, until the th of June when we were briefed originally.\"The invasion was scheduled initially for June  but was postponed for  hours because of the weather. \"Before that we had the indications of the airfield being closed off and we werent allowed to leave ndash we were shut in, the mail was censored.\"Paratroops of the th Airborne Division had been arriving at Fairford from the middle of May, and glider pilots were gathering there too as the security arrangements became ever tighter. The troops camped out on the airfield and Don remembers: \"One thing that struck me was that most of them were not very big men but the amount of equipment they carried was phenomenal, with kitbags full of gear strapped to their legs. The other thing that struck me as quite remarkable was they were all carrying water bottles full of white rum!\"Stirling LJ  took off from Fairford at . hours on June  in what was code-named Operation Tonga, with Don as wireless operator air gunner. On board were  fully equipped paratroops and the BBC correspondent Guy Byam.Dons chief recollection of that night flight over the English Channel is the sight of vast numbers of landing craft and other vessels in the assembly area ndash which was known as \"Piccadilly Circus\" ndash as they awaited the signal to head for the beaches.\"We were briefed to drop precisely at a time and place,\" he explains. \"It was important to get the troops on the ground in a bunch, not scattered. We were only over mid-Channel so we did an orbit ndash that was a bit dicey with so many aircraft about, all flying in one direction, and us crossing the stream. It all went to build up the tension.\"Finally, at . hours, the troops were released at Ranville, where they were to set up a homing beacon to aid following aircraft and also to assist in holding bridges over the nearby river Orne after the seaborne invasion had begun. Don remembers the red light in the fuselage turning to green on reaching the dropping zone. \"They all had to go together. Naturally some hesitated on the lip of the door ndash but they had all got to go.\"In the lead-up to the drop, there had been a close encounter between the Stirling and a group of paratroops released by a nearby Dakota. \"He released his troops and they came past us and we flew right through and didnt touch one,\" says Don.\"There was no flak at all over Normandy but then we had to fly in a northerly direction towards the Pas de Calais after dropping our troops, which was a feint because the Germans expected us to attack the Pas de Calais rather than anywhere . So we flew on a northerly track and we experienced flak around Le Havre and Dieppe, and then when we exited France towards Beachy Head we got some light flak on the coast, but there wasnt a great deal of resistance.\"It was a dferent matter altogether when Don and his crew-mates embarked on their second operation of D-Day, code-named Mallard.This time their Stirling had a Horsa glider in tow, containing more troops bound for the Ranville area along with an armoured jeep, four anti-tank guns and ammunition. Take-off time was . hours and the glider was to be released at ..Don remembers the scene vividly: \"The Channel was still littered with shipping but when we approached the Normandy coast it was a chaotic mass of ships and landing craft and smoke and explosions. It looked like a scene out of a nightmare, really. And, of course, as we went over land and approached the landing zone there was a lot more activity and a lot more flak.\"You couldnt tow a glider above  knots so it was fairly slow. You were low because you didnt want the glider to be shot down before it could get down to land. So obviously a big aircraft like the Stirling, with a ft wingspan or thereabouts, and a Horsa glider behind it, was a good target. In fact, all  of our aircraft were hit by anti-aircraft fire.\"Indeed one of those planes was shot down and crash-landed into the beachhead. The airmen were uninjured and got away for a while before being picked up by a German patrol.Subsequently the German position where they were held prisoner was captured and the crew ed to base.Reflecting on the chaos and confusion of D-Day, does Don recall feeling scared by what was happening around him  \"Well, everybodys scared ndash I dont care what anyone says,\" he replies. \"If youre not scared you dont perform, but its discipline and training that takes you through. You do reach a point of no .\"This is rude, I know, but its what I call s**t or bust. You go on and do it. Its a matter of accepting whats going on and just dealing with it, and doing the job youre supposed to do.\"Its not a question of bravery. Im very suspicious when people say, Oh, youre a brave man, or Youve got a lot of courage. You react to circumstances. Its a question of training and discipline and doing your job, without really recognising the probability of being killed.\"And I think to some extent the unorm protects you ndash you feel less vulnerable when youve got a unorm on and youre acting in that capacity. Everything happens very quickly.\"So Im very suspicious about bravery. I think we react more instinctively based on our training and our own iniduality. I dont think I could have coped with being an infantryman, for instance. I dont know how those chaps did it, because it must have been hell on earth for them.\"Don can look back on hundreds of hours of operational flying in a distinguished RAF career that included missions for the Special Operations Executive. And yet, despite the passage of years, he has never forgotten the thrill of his first tantalising taste of aviation.\"I fell in love with aeroplanes when I was a kid when Alan Cobhams Flying Circus came to visit our town with an old World War One aeroplane, and it was fascinating,\" Don says. \"He had a couple of old SEs [fighter aircraft] and you could have a flip round the field for  shillings ndash but of course  shillings was half a mans wage, so we just stood there with our mouths open.\"But the smell of hot engine oil, castor oil and fumes and what-not got into you. I was determined to try to get into it in some way, and of course thats what I did.\"He grew up in Kingswinford, Worcestershire, where his father ran a transport yard. Don trained as a motor mechanic after leaving school at the age of  and went on to qualy as a motor vehicle technician in the summer of . He was called up when war broke out in September of that year, having joined the volunteer reserve two years previously.After pilot training he enjoyed rapid promotion in Bomber Command and was an acting squadron leader when, ing from a mission near Hanover in May , his aircraft was attacked from below by an unseen German fighter plane. The bomb aimer, navigator, flight engineer and wireless operator were all killed but Don survived along with his mid-upper and rear gunner. Somehow he managed tohis crippled Stirling to an emergency landing field on the east coast of England despite suffering severe spinal injuries, damage to his left eye, lacerations around his head and a hole in his knee. He still bears the scars.Don spent eight months in hospital and was discharged as medically unfit. However, he refused to accept that his flying career was over and lodged an objection with the air ministry. Eventually his appeal was successful and he was reinstated, being retrained in the new discipline of radio observer.Operations in the aftermath of D-Day included Market Garden in September  ndash \"I went to Arnhem five times during that debacle,\" says Don ndash and he continued in Stirlings until .He and his first we Lillian were married in  and they had three children: daughter Elaine, now living in Ashby-de-la-Zouch, and sons Peter and Robert, who are both ex-Navy. Peter is in Denmark while Robert has a management post at Dounreay.Don ed to the motor trade after the war and became general service manager with a large garage group. He then spent more than  years working in further education, including a spell as head of the engineering department at a college of technology in Salisbury.Lillian died in  after many years of ill-health and in  Don moved to Thurso, coming out of retirement to work for eight years with local firm Ashley Ann. In  he was married for a second time, to Lybster-born Isabel, whose three daughters became part of the family. Isabel died in .Don still keeps in touch with three of his former crew-mates from those D-Day operations: Jim Wayman, the rear gunner, who lives in Dorset Eric Winter, flight engineer, in Coventry and Sid Harrison, the mid-upper gunner, who lives in Crewe. However, there was a particularly close and enduring bond between Don and his pilot, New Zealander Frank Cox.\"Although our families were half a world apart, they sort of grew up together ndash he came over [to this country] and I went to New Zealand,\" says Don. \"In  his daughter rang me from New Zealand and said Frank was dying of bowel cancer ndash he knew he was terminally ill and he hadnt got long to live. They had asked himthere was anything he really wanted, and hed said, Id love to see my old mate again. So I went to New Zealand and I was with him when he died.\"Now you cant explain relationships like that ndash they exist because of the worth of each one of you to the other in action. Its what they call camaraderie. Im still in touch with his family.\"As his thoughtsto the events of  on the Normandy beaches, Don agrees that D-Day was a turning point ndash \"theres no doubt about that\". But he adds: \"I regret to say I dont think weve learned any lessons. I dont think we should be doing what were doing now [in Iraq].\"As I look back I think first of all how lucky I was and I feel very sad about the people who gave their lives in that struggle. Its not really appreciated, the sacrices that were made both on the home front and in action. Its a sad reflection on society, I feel.\"We ought to be very thankful that were free, because thats what it was about. We should remember that this country wouldnt be freeit had been overrun by Nazi Germany.\"It was all for a cause. People may say, Oh, thats patriotic nonsense. But it isnt.\"* This is a slightly edited version of an interview first published in the John OGroat Journal of June , .Friday  Jan  : AM"},{"url":null,"title":"More festive frustration for Wick Academy as Formartine snatch victory in stoppage time","story":"Wick Academy  Formartine United Formartine United took advantage of a late red card to Danny Mackay to hit an injury-time winner and consign Academy to a second defeat over the festive period.The Scorries struggled to create any clear chances but defended resolutely and the game appeared to be drting towards a goalless draw before Graeme Rodgerrsquos late strike.Manager Tom McKenna made two enforced changes to his side, with Ross Allan and Andrew Hardwick replaced by Gordon MacNab and Craig Gunn. Sixteen-year old Mark Macadie, brother of Richard, made his first appearance on the bench.Academy started positively and Marc Macgregor twice tested Formartine keeper Kevin Main within the opening  minutes ndash first when he scuffed a shot straight at Main after being set up by a driving run down the right from Davie Allan, and then seeing an edge-of-the-box effort comfortably held.With Wick sitting deep in clear defensive blocks of four and five, the visitors took control after that and passed up several decent opportunities to take the lead.Archie Macphee found himself with a clear look at goal a quarter of an hour in but he somehow poked wide of Sean McCarthyrsquos left-hand post, and Rodger followed that moments later by guiding a shot wide of the same spot.After coming through that tough -minute spell, it was Academy who threatened next when, after a great spin in midfield by Grant MacNab, the ball came through for Macgregor whose shot was blocked by Main.The biggest cheer of the half came when Formartine assistant manager Russell Anderson, unhappy with what he felt was a series of unfair decisions against his team, was given a strict talking to by lineswoman Molly Alexander.Academy made a tactical switch with Craig Gunn and Davie Allan swapping wings and Gordon MacNab moving upfield to partner Macgregor up top. The move failed to pay idends as Wick couldnrsquot trouble the away defence throughout the half, Davie Allan coming closest to goal when he skewed his shot wide after a one-two with Macgregor.Formartine similarly struggled to break down a well-drilled home defence, but they smelled blood when Mackay was given a second yellow card in the last minute after a collision with substitute Scott Ferries.It was another Formartine sub who played a key role in the winner when Liam Burnett skipped past Craig Gunn to the by-line and cut back for the unmarked Rodger, who had the simple task of tapping it home.Wick Academy: McCarthy, M Steven, Farquhar, D Mackay, Manson, Henry, Gunn, Macgregor , D Allan, Gordon MacNab , Grant MacNab .

He argued the SNP Government was to blame for the dficult position the council was in.Cllr Clark said: “The family silver is sold, the grass uncut, the potholes unfilled and now our children are paying the price.“I say to the people of Clackmannanshire: these are the Keith Brown cuts, their source is Holyrood, so don’t be too hard on the ‘patsies’ locally who have to implement them.”Last year the council was told its finances were not sustainable by a public spending watchdog.In , the local authority was told its spending was unsustainable by the Accounts Commission.It said they were “seriously concerned” with the council’s financial position with it needing to make savings of £m over three years.

It is crucial that all political parties use the upcoming budget negotiations to correct our country’s course.Just over a year from the passing of the Child PovertyAct and following the damning assessment of poverty in the UK from the United Nations’ Rapporteur, we had high hopes of the draft Budget.The Scottish Government has made tackling poverty a top priority, but platitudes and promises are not always making the transition into real, funded policy to transform people’s lives. Rhetoric does not help youyou are trying to decide whether you can afford to take a bus to work or pay for your child’s lunch.While ministers are right to restate their commitment to building more affordable homes, expanding childcare and helping parents into the workplace, we will not solve poverty merely with reannouncements of existing policy.It’s unacceptable so many children are living in poverty in Scotland – and the forthcoming Budget negotiations must right that wrong.Living in poverty can affect every aspect of family le. In the recent Joseph Rowntree Foundation report into poverty, we spoke to a single mother, Hazel, in Fe who is a care assistant with two teenage children.She told us: “If I compare things to an object it would be a hamster’s wheel. No matter how hard I work and how much I push myself, I still feel I am getting nowhere.”Too many families in poverty are faced with impossible choices, balancing paying the rent with the cost of childcare and being able to get to work, as essential costs rise. Every decision is finely balanced – do you buy fresh food or put the heating on  Everywhere they look, families can be restricted and restrained by poverty – but we know it can and must be solved.: One in four children living in poverty as childcare woes and disabilities biteOpposition parties will now play a key role in shaping the final Budget put before Holyrood and together, the parties must ensure the proposals avoid a step back in its fight against poverty.The Scottish Government now has an increasing range of choices about how it raises and spends money. But local government delivers critical support for low-income families, such as housing provision, local bus services and out-of-school care. To keep these families from being swept into poverty, they need adequate funding. Councils have been faced with continually squeezed budgets for day-to-day spending on existing services with little,any, recourse to tax-raising powers.Council tax reform will rightly be a key area of the budget negotiations. Currently, our evidence shows that falling behind with council tax, and harsh recovery of the money that is owed, is one of the key causes of destitution – where people regularly lack the ability to keep a roof over their head, feed themselves and keep dry and clean. Any reform to the system must ensure that there is a proper anchor for low-income households in dficulty so that they all receive the support they need.There are steps ministers can take now to ease the strain on household budgets. First of all, a quick and much-needed fix would be to increase the thresholds for the council tax reduction scheme in Scotland. This would ensure that working families in poverty are able to keep more of what they earn before they are asked to pay towards their council tax. Doing so could buy the Scottish Government and partners the time they need to develop and implement long-term reforms.: Gordon Brown warns of growing child poverty crisisSecondly, social security is another key tool that the Scottish Government can use to loosen the grip of poverty, and families should not have to wait until  for the income supplement to be paid. We would like serious consideration of delivery of an interim solution that is fully funded by Scottish Government but paid locally, using the expertise of councils in this area. As well as helping people who desperately need a step up now, it would provide genuine insight and learning before permanent rollout in .Finally, our labour market is not working for hundreds of thousands of Scots. There is much that Scotland’s business owners and managers can do to get the best out of their workforce by providing compassion, flexibility and security to allow people to build a le free from poverty. But fair work requires a supporting infrastructure that the Scottish Government must do more to provide.To make progress on labour market equality for women at work and boost their incomes requires further targeted investment in accessible, affordable and flexible childcare that can respond to the realities of the local jobs market, particularly in lower wage sectors. More investment in employability services is vital in breaking down physical and mental barriers, especially for those with long-term health conditions or disability. The Scottish Government also needs to look seriously at whether transport systems and concessions support those who need help the most. We all want to live in a society where nobody is worrying how they will get by from one day to the next. The true test of this Government will not be its words but its actions to support the poorest children in our society.Emma Congreve is senior economist at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4854537.1547130555!/image/image.jpg","title":"fmqs nicola sturgeon denies intervening in salmond inquiry","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Nicola Sturgeon has revealed she informed the Scottish Government#s top civil servant about a series of meetings with Alex Salmond to discuss his sexual harassment probe.But the First Minister insisted that she did not “intervene” in the conduct of a inquiry into her predecessor which dramatically collapsed at the Court of Sessionin Edinburgh this week over “procedural flaws” in the way it was carried out.It also emerged at First Minister’s Questions today that Ms Sturgeon’s chief of Staff was present at the first of three meetings she had with Mr Salmond.

It has lost its mandate so must go to the country to seek another.”And he added: “So I say to Theresa May:you are so confident in your deal, call that election, and let the people decide.“If not, Labour will table a motion of no confidence in the Government at the moment we judge it to have the best chance of success.”In a message apparently directed at Conservative rebels, Mr Corbyn urged MPs from across the Commons to join Labour in voting for an early poll to “break the deadlock”.“Clearly, Labour does not have enough MPs in parliament to win a confidence vote on its own,” he said.“So members across the House should vote with us to break the deadlock.“This paralysis cannot continue. Uncertainty is putting people’s jobs and livelihoods at risk.”The Labour leader said he would “keep all options on the table”a general election can’t be secured, “but an election must be the priority”.Mr Murray said: “Jeremy is right that Article  will need to be extendedwe somehow manage to secure a General Election.“But it would be a betrayal of our voterswe went into such an election vowing to continue with Brexit, and we would certainly pay the price at the ballot box.”The Edinburgh South MP, who is campaigning for a so-called ‘People’s Vote’ on the terms of Brexit, added: “Any type of Brexit will harm workers and the communities we represent, while making people poorer.“If, as is likely, an attempt to hold a General Election fails, it is incumbent on the Labour leadership to immediately throw its support behind a people’s vote and campaign to remain in the EU.”©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"a","story":"SOME lucky folk had an amazing view of a pod of killer whales off west Unst last Friday. A phone call from Brydon Thomason to Alastair Wilson, the Scottish Natural Heritage warden, alerted folk to them heading north off Westing, which triggered a mega sprint across to the coast where they were able to look down on about four animals including a male.To be able to see them close to is a memorable experience, but to be able to look down on them underwater even more amazing. Such oppor­tunities don’t come often. They were also seen to catch a seal in the bay at Lund, and photographed by several folk during their progress north, and so hopefully can be identied by the team that are still up here researching the distribution and abundance of killer whales around Scotland.From photographs, it has been established that an orca seen off Cullivoe, north Yell, on the evening of the th July, is a big male known as  or “Bigga”.Next day, the same inidual was identied at hrs heading north through Yell Sound.Some of our showiest plants are in flower just now. “I know a bank whereon the wild thyme blows …” wrote William Shakespeare in “A Midsummer Night’s Dream”. And indeed I do. There’s a fantastic bank near me where the pale mauve flowers of thyme are pushing through between the bell heather, itself with some plants paler than others.Common heather is not so bold in its colouration, but works in mass production, and will soon be colouring the hills with subtle shades. The third in the trio of obvious heathers is cross-leaved heath, whose compact flowerheads drooping from a single stem are pinker in colour.Changing colour, two striking plants are now in full bloom – angelica and meadowsweet. Although names for meadowsweet in dferent coun­tries all translate as “queen of the meadow”, it seems that its name actually comes from its use in flavouring the drink mead. Also in the days when hygiene was not quite so good as now, the plant with its rather nauseating scent was spread out on the floors of houses to counteract unpleasant odours. A Shetland name is “blackenin-girse”, from its use for dyeing wool.From the showy to the opposite – demure and unnoticed is a little plant with a big name that is very common about gardens, steps and roadsides: procumbent pearlwort. This low, hairless, tufted perennial has its base as a non-flowering rosette. However, the name pearlwort is said to come from the tiny, pearl-like white, long-stalked flowers whose sepals are actually longer than the usually four petals. In folklore it is said to have special powers of protection. So next time you go to pull out this so-called weed, just give it a closer look first. Maybe its powers of protection will rub off on you!"},{"url":null,"title":"financial inclusion officer at hjaltland housing association ","story":"Hjaltland Housing Association is an organisation with big values.

Seismic political events, including the Home Rule crisis, the World War, the  Rising and the Conscription threat had shaken the country since the last General Election in . Women had the vote for the first time, other restrictions on the universal right to vote had been removed and the widening of democracy helped to ensure a stunning victory for Sinn Féin on a Republican . Ireland elected  members to the House of Commons in the Westminster Parliament. They were elected in single-seat constituencies on the first-past-the-post voting system, as Westminster MPs are elected to this day. Since its foundation in  Sinn Féin had advocated the withdrawal of Irish MPs from Westminster and the establishment of an Irish constituent assembly. It was only in , in successive by-election victories, that Sinn Fein won Westminster seats and put its abstentionist policy into operation. The swing to Sinn Féin was not only because of the executions and mass imprisonments after the  Rising there was also growing opposition to Irelands involvement in the war and its cost in lives, the inclusion in the British Cabinet of Tory Unionists who vehemently opposed any form of Home Rule, the threat of Partition and the ineffectiveness of the Irish Party at Westminster, led by John Redmond, increasingly seen as collaborators with British imperialism, as well as ongoing repression and press censorship. Redmond died in March  and in April the British government introduced legislation to impose Conscription in Ireland. The Irish Party MPs withdrew from Westminster in protest, thus ending forever any signicant Irish nationalist presence in that Parliament. Sinn Féin, the Irish Volunteers and the trade union movement took the lead in the anti-Conscription campaign. The Irish Party was also involved and it had three by-election successes in  but the writing was on the wall. In East Cavan in June Sinn Féins Arthur Grfith won a decisive victory on the abstentionist  which Irish Party leader John Dillon had called a policy of lunatics. It was widely predicted that Dillons party faced heavy defeat whenever the General Election came. Well before the war ended, Sinn Féins election preparations were under way. The jailing of many of its leaders in the British governments concocted German Plot did not deter the movement. In August  General Secretaries Harry Boland and Tom Kelly reported to the Ard Chomhairle that there were over , cumainn throughout the country. The same meeting endorsed a motion to contest every seat in the General Election “in order to give every Irish voter the opportunity of voting for or against the establishment of an independent Irish Republic”. By the time of the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis in October , many candidates had already been selected, a process overseen by Harry Boland, based at the movement’s Head Office in  Harcourt Street, Dublin. That same month the electoral register was revised to take account of the widened franchise. Women over  could vote for the first time and remaining property qualications for men over  were removed. This meant that the number of people in Ireland entitled to vote in the General Election grew enormously from , in  to ,, in . On  October the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress announced its intention to stand in a number of constituencies. But there was opposition both internally and externally. Sinn Féin requested that Labour candidates take a pledge to abstain totally from Westminster, in which case Sinn Féin would stand aside in selected seats. But the Labour position was to abstain conditionally, retaining the option to attend in certain circumstances. A great many trade unionists were members or supporters of Sinn Féin and opposed Labour standing unless the full pledge was taken. A special conference of the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress was held in the Mansion House on  and  November, at which the decision was taken not to stand in the General Election. Debate has continued ever since about the reasons for this decision and its consequences. There was a wide iety of views within the Irish trade union movement ranging from socialist republicans to Home Rulers to Unionists, so the reasons for non-participation were ied. Historian Dorothy Macardle put it this way: \"The majority of the working men and women of Ireland were members of Sinn Féin or the Volunteers or Cumann na mBan, and, as the disciples of James Connolly, held that the freedom of the nation and the freedom of the working classes must be pursued as one unided aim.\" . The war ended on  November and the British Parliament was dissolved on  November. Polling days was set for  December. The Sinn Féin manesto reflected the republican position adopted by the Ard Fheis a year previously and stated that the party \"gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic\". It was committed to establishing the Irish Republic by withdrawing Irish representation from Westminster, using “any and every means available” to make British rule impossible, establishing a constituent assembly and appealing to the post-war Peace Conference to recognise Ireland as an independent nation. It roundly condemned the role of the Irish Party in collaborating with the British government and attempting to “harness the Irish people to England’s war chariot”. The Manesto endorsed the  Proclamation “guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens”. The manesto was censored by the British authorities when it appeared in the newspapers but the full version was widely circulated. Press censorship was only one of the many forms of repression that the British used during the election. Hundreds of republicans were in jails  – including  of Sinn Féin.s candidates. Raids and arrests were frequent, as were bans on public meetings and among those arrested during the campaign was Sinn Féin Director of Elections Robert Brennan. His two predecessors, Seán Milroy and Dan McCarthy, were already in prison. British soldiers and loyalists had attacked  Harcourt Street on  November and subsequent nights, leading to the death from a stroke of ‘Nationality’ editor Seumas O’Kelly.  On  November the office was raided by a large force of armed Dublin politan Police who arrested Brennan and seized manestos and other election material. Acting Director of Elections James O’Mara wrote to the press: “Each arrest has naturally caused some disorganisation, but the cause of Irish independence will not be stayed or broken by such tyranny. Men have been, and will be, found who will fill the vacant places.” Nominations were due to close on  December. In North-East Ulster the Catholic bishops suggested that Sinn Féin and the Irish Party should not split the nationalist vote in seats where this would allow a Unionist to win. Sinn Féin proposed that a plebiscite be held among nationalist voters in these constituencies. Dillon rejected this in talks with Sinn Féin representative Eoin Mac Néill. The latter acceded to a call for the Catholic Cardinal Logue to propose a four-four ision of eight seats between the two parties. Others in Sinn Féin criticised Mac Néill for not adhering to his instructions. Sinn Féin candidates remained in the race in three of the four Irish Party-allocated constituencies but did not campaign and their voters were urged to support the Irish Party to keep the Unionists out. In taking this position the need to oppose the British threat of Partition was very much to the fore. When nominations closed it was realised that  outgoing Irish Party MPs were not contesting the election and in  constituencies,  of them in Munster, the Sinn Féin candidates were unopposed. Sinn Féin contested  of the  constituencies . Harassment continued right up to polling day with raids and arrests, seizure of Sinn Féin election material and removal of posters by British crown forces. After the death in Usk Prison, Wales, on  December of republican prisoner Richard Coleman, Sinn Féin campaigners wore black crepe on candidate badges. In The Four Glorious Years Frank Gallagher says a final election rally filled Dublins OConnell Street with speakers on several s, each flying a Tricolour with a black cross for Richard Coleman. He describes how on polling day Dublin dockers marched to the polling station behind an advance guard of Citizen Army veterans and hundreds of workers at the new British aerodrome at Collinstown – now Dublin Airport – went to the polls in a fleet of lorries flying Tricolours. The only two women candidates were both suffragists and  Rising veterans - Countess Markeivicz in the St Patrick’s Ward in Dublin’s South Inner City and Winred Carney in the strongly Unionist Victoria ward in Belfast. Markievicz was in Holloway Prison in England and her election address to her constituents she said:“I have many friends in the constituency who will work all the harder for me. They know that I stand for the Irish Republic, to establish which our heroes died, and that my colleagues are firm in the belief that the freeing of Ireland is in the hands of the Irish people today.”There was a two-week gap between polling day and the announcement of the final results on  December. Sinn Féin had won an overwhelming victory, taking  of the  seats in Ireland. Unionists won  and the Irish Parliamentary Party six . The majority vote for Sinn Féin was  per cent:  of the  Counties ed only Sinn Féin TDs. Of Dublins  TDs, all but one were Sinn Féin. The myth of nine-county Ulster being Unionist was exposed. Unionists polled a majority in Antrim, Armagh, Derry and Down but there were nationalist majorities in Cavan, Donegal, Fermanagh, Monaghan and Tyrone. Constance Markievicz was the only woman elected in Ireland and Britain and would go on to be one of the first women government ministers in the world in the First Dáil Éireann. Preparations for that Dáil, the democratic assembly of the Irish Republic so strongly mandated by the electorate, began soon after the General Election that transformed Ireland  years ago. GENERAL ELECTION - MANIFESTO TO THE IRISH PEOPLETHE coming General Election is fraught with vital possibilities for the future of our nation. Ireland is faced with the question whether this generation wills it that she is to march out into the full sunlight of freedom, or is to remain in the shadow of a base imperialism that has brought and ever will bring in its train naught but evil for our race.Sinn Féin gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic.Sinn Féin aims at securing the establishment of that Republic.. By withdrawing the Irish Representation from the British Parliament and by denying the right and opposing the will of the British Government or any other foreign Government to legislate for Ireland.. By making use of any and every means available to render impotent the power of England to hold Ireland in subjection by military force or otherwise.. By the establishment of a constituent assembly comprising persons chosen by Irish constituencies as the supreme national authority to speak and act in the name of the Irish people, and to develop Irelands social, political and industrial le, for the welfare of the whole people of Ireland.. Irelands claim to the application of that principle in her favour is not based on any accidental situation arising from the war. It is older than manynot all of the present belligerents. It is based on our unbroken tradition of nationhood, on a unity in a national name which has never been challenged, on our possession of a distinctive national culture and social order, on the moral courage and dignity of our people in the face of alien aggression, on the fact that in nearly every generation, and five times within the past  years our people have challenged in arms the right of England to rule this country. On these incontrovertible facts is based the claim that our people have beyond question established the right to be accorded all the power of a free nation.Sinn Féin stands less for a political party than for the Nation it represents the old tradition of nationhood handed on from dead generations it stands by the Proclamation of the Provisional Government of Easter, , reasserting the inalienable right of the Irish Nation to sovereign independence, reaffirming the determination of the Irish people to achieve it, and guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens.Believing that the time has arrived when Irelands voice for the principle of untrammelled National self-determination should be heard above every interest of party or class, Sinn Féin will oppose at the Polls every inidual candidate who does not accept this principle.The policy of our opponents stands condemned on any test, whether of principle or expediency. The right of a nation to sovereign independence rests upon immutable natural law and cannot be made the subject of a compromise. Any attempt to barter away the sacred and inviolate rights of nationhood begins in dishonour and is bound to end in disaster. The enforced exodus of millions of our people, the decay of our industrial le, the ever-increasing financial plunder of our country, the whittling down of the demand for the Repeal of the Union, voiced by the first Irish Leader to plead in the Hall of the Conqueror to that of Home Rule on the Statute Book, and finally the contemplated mutilation of our country by partition, are some of the ghastly results of a policy that leads to national ruin.Those who have endeavoured to harness the people of Ireland to Englands war-chariot, ignoring the fact that only a freely-elected Government in a free Ireland has power to decide for Ireland the question of peace and war, have forfeited the right to speak for the Irish people. The green flag turned red in the hands of the Leaders, but that shame is not to be laid at the doors of the Irish people unless they continue a policy of sending their representatives to an alien and hostile assembly, whose powerful influence has been sufficient to destroy the integrity and sap the independence of their representatives. Ireland must repudiate the men who, in a supreme crisis for the nation, attempted to sell her birthright for the vague promises of English Ministers, and who showed their incompetence by failing to have even these promises fulfilled.The present Irish members of the English Parliament constitute an obstacle to be removed from the path that leads to the Peace Conference. By declaring their will to accept the status of a province instead of boldly taking their stand upon the right of the nation they supply England with the only subterfuge at her disposal for obscuring the issue in the eyes of the world. By their persistent endeavours to induce the young manhood of Ireland to don the unorm of our seven-century old oppressor, and place their lives at the disposal of the military machine that holds our Nation in bondage, they endeavour to barter away and even to use against itself the one great asset still left to our Nation after the havoc of the centuries.Sinn Féin goes to the polls handicapped by all the arts and contrivances that a powerful and unscrupulous enemy can use against us. Conscious of the power of Sinn Féin to secure the freedom of Ireland the British Government would destroy it. Sinn Féin, however, goes to the polls confident that the people of this ancient nation will be true to the old cause and will vote for the men who stand by the principles of Tone, Emmet, Mitchel, Pearse and Connolly, the men who disdain to whine to the enemy for favours, the men who hold that Ireland must be as free as England or Holland, Switzerland or France, and whose demand is that the only status befitting this ancient realm is the status of a free nation.ISSUED BY THE STANDING COMMITTEE OF SINN FÉINtest"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27506  ","story":" Aengus Ó SnodaighThe flu epidemic that swept across Britain and Ireland in  struck at the weak and elderly in society. Hundreds died and many more spent many weeks crippled in agony in their beds during the winter months.Richard Coleman was born in Dublin in , one of eleven Coleman children, most of whom were active in the Gaelic League. Brought up in Swords, County Dublin, Richard was a religious and a patriotic young man. He trained to be a Christian Brother, but left to begin a career with the Prudential Insurance Company.When Thomas MacDonagh came to Swords in April  to recruit members for the recently formed Irish Volunteers, Richard was among the first to join. When John Redmond forced a split in the Volunteers later that year, the remaining Volunteers elected Richard as their captain.On Easter Sunday , Richard mobilised his men, the Fingal Battalion, at Saucers Town, ensured that they were ready for what lay ahead and dismissed them till the following day. On Easter Monday they, along with other Volunteers from surrounding areas, came under the direction of Thomas Ashe, whose instructions were to prevent British reinforcements from reaching Dublin. They fulfilled that task heroically that week.On the Tuesday,  Volunteers were sent into the GPO in response to a request from the Commander-in-chief, James Connolly. On reaching the GPO, the group was split up. Six men became the tunnelling unit around the GPO - `the engineering corps - while the others under Richard were instructed to reinforce the garrison under Sean Heuston in the Mendicity Institute. Connollys parting words to them did not augur well for their mission: ``I dont think you will all get there, but get as far as you can.They got as far as the Mendicity Institute unscathed. A Volunteer at one of the barricades they passed through said of them: ``In the midst of the firing, men approached up Church Street towards our barricade. When they reached it, they passed briskly towards their objective - whatever it might have been. They were dressed and, I thought looked, like countrymen... I could not but admire very much they way they went into action.At the Mendicity Institute, the garrison was under severe pressure, with the British attack coming virtually from all directions. By Thursday, things were hopeless and Sean Heuston was forced to surrender to a much larger British force.They, similar to the other captured Volunteers, were corralled at the Rotunda Hospital for identication purposes. They were then court-martialled and sentenced. Richard was sentenced to death, though this was commuted to three years penal servitude.The sentenced prisoners were transported to Dartmoor Jail in England first and then ided up. Richard was sent to Lewis Jail in Kent. When they were released after a very successful campaign in Ireland and abroad for their freedom, each Volunteer was granted £ from the National Aid Fund in America to help them rebuild their lives. They all pooled their money and began the New Ireland Friendly Society, with Richard as a director and a trustee with a superintendents wage.Like many of the other released prisoners in June , Volunteer Richard Coleman of Swords travelled to Clare to help Sinn Féin and the Irish Volunteers in their efforts to get Eamonn de Valera elected in the by-election.While there he addressed the first unormed parade of Irish Volunteers to be held since . For this, he was arrested and jailed for six months. While in Mountjoy Jail, he and the other prisoners went on hunger-strike, led by Thomas Ashe. Ashes death led to such a public outcry that the remaining prisoners were first moved to Cork Jail and then Dundalk Jail before being finally released.Richard was not to remain `at large for long and he was again arrested, along with many of the other republican leaders whod been active in rebuilding the Movement, as part of the British authorities `German Plot conspiracy.The prisoners were assembled first in Dublin Castle on  May  and were then ided up and sent to Usk and Gloucester Jails in Britain. Conditions were harsh in the jail and attempts were made to criminalise them with the order to wear prison unorms. They resisted and at the direction of the Home Office the prison governor, Mr Young, capitulated. On their first night in Usk, the internees won the right to free association, the right to receive and send letters, to smoke and to wear their own clothes.Despite their victory, the prison regime and their confinement weakened the men and with the onset of a severe winter, many succumbed to the influenza virus which had reached epidemic proportions, killing hundreds outside the prison walls. Richard was among a group of POWs struck down by the virus - they were left in their damp and cold cells for three days after the flu struck them down. On  December, a new prison doctor, Dr. Morton took up his new duties in the prison and immediately he diagnosed that Richard had now suffering from pneumonia and he had him transferred to hospital. He died a few days later on  December .Remembering the result of Thomas Ashes inquest - that the prison authorities were culpable - no formal inquest was allowed and when Richards brother arrived he was prevented from getting an adjournment of the local inquest so as to instruct a solicitor. The local inquest heard Richards brother state that Richard was a strong healthy man at the time of his arrest, while three fellow POWs attested to the insanitary conditions in the jail and that improper nursing contributed to his death. These statements got good publicity in the Irish press and added to the campaign to get the POWs released.Richard Colemans remains were released to his brother and were taken to Dublin where they lay in state for a week in St Andrews Church, Westland Row. Over , people filed past the coffin to pay their last respects. Volunteers in unorm formed a guard of honour during that time. A public funeral procession in driving rain from Westland Row to Glasnevin was followed by over , people. Three volleys were fired over the grave in Glasnevin Cemetery by six Volunteers despite a huge police presence. The size of the crowd prevented the police from moving against the Volunteers.Volunteer Richard Colemans death in an English jail, aided Sinn Féin campaign against Britains occupation and their general election campaign which was in full swing at this stage, and two weeks later Sinn Féin won a landslide victory of parliamentary seats. A month later in January  Sinn Féin MPs met as Dáil Éireann for the first time. The escape from Usk Jailby four of Richards comrades on the same day saw that republican POWs were unbroken and unbowed by their comrades death.Volunteer Richard Coleman died of pneumonia in Usk Jail on  December ,  years ago this week.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27507  ","story":" Michael McMonagle“This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account. - Chris Hazzard MPThe proposal from a senior Tory MP that the threat of food shortages in Ireland should be used to put pressure on the Dublin government and the EU in the Brexit negotiation exposes the colonial attitude of Brexiteers, a Sinn Féin MP has said. South Down MP Chris Hazzard was speaking after senior Tory MP and former minister Priti Patel urged the British government to use the threat of food shortages which could arise from a no-deal Brexit as leverage in the Brexit negotiations. The Tory MP, who previously stepped down from her ministerial role after revelations of secret meetings with the Israeli government, asked why the threat of food shortages wasnt being \"pressed home\" during the Brexit negotiations. Her remarks have sparked outrage on social media, with comparisons to Charles Trevelyan, the notorious British civil servant known for his role during The Great Hunger. Chris Hazzard said the proposal from the Tory MP were \"crass and offensive.\" “This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account.“They know the history of the Irish famine and Britain’s role in it and the very fact that they would seek to inject that into the Brexit debate is crass and offensive.“The Tories couldn’t care less about the impact of their reckless Brexit agenda on the people and economy of Ireland.

And we aspired to be just like her.She was also a POW, and when young women were imprisoned throughout the conflict, in this State, in Britain and in the six counties, they knew they were walking in the footsteps of the women of . We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.And no political opponent or revisionist will tell me, and all those thousands like me, that I should be ashamed of that.But the irony is, that the people who are so quick to condemn today’s republicans for taking the decisions we did, have never once considered what drove so many Irish men and women, young and old, to walk the hard roads we walked during these last  troubled years. We didn’t do for fame or fortune. We did it because it was the right thing to do.There are always reasons and circumstances behind people’s decisions and, we need as much today to consider those journeys, as we do the journeys of the men and women of . Circumstances and history shaped all of us. That’s undeniable.Throughout the decades republican women have been to the forefront of struggles in Ireland in the Suffragette movement, the Labour movements, the Gaelic League, and many other organisations – much as republican women today are deeply involved in every aspect of daily le and organisations working to better peoples’ lives.In every phase of the struggle, women have taken risks. From their involvement in the ’s border campaign, to those who broke the Falls Curfew and carried guns and ammunition out under their coats, in prams and in shopping bags. And, we know many too who lost their loved ones, and their own lives, to plastic, rubber and live bullets on active service for the IRA, and to loyalist and British State murder squads.We all know women who walked the streets wrapped in blankets, in bare feet, in rain and snow, to highlight the plight of the prisoners in the H-Blocks and Armagh who smuggled comms, love letters, and much more into and out of the prisons who marched in their hundreds to the steps of Stormont when Sinn Féin were locked out of talks, demanding their rights and representation.There are women who travelled every week, for years, to visit loved ones imprisoned in this state, in the six counties and in Britain, most times with young children in tow. The hardship of prisoners’ families is often forgotten, and imprisonment impacted on thousands upon thousands of people throughout this island, not just the prisoners themselves.Brave republican women stood as Sinn Féin candidates in the early ‘’s and ’s, when in councils throughout the six counties they were vilied and subjected to the vilest of sectarian abuse and threats of death.And I’m proud to say that the temerity of those who led the way has paid off in idends. Republican women were elected in their hundreds – councillors, MLAs, TDs, MEPs, Senators and including – dare I say it – three very proud and very capable women MPs are walking in the footsteps of the first female MP elected to sit in the British House of Commons the first abstentionist Sinn Féin MP, Countess Constance Markievicz.And still, there are people telling us today that our Sinn Féin MPs, elected by thousands of Irish citizens full in the knowledge that, like Markievicz they would not be taking seats or swearing an oath to a foreign government, should take seats in a British parliament, or better still, resign those seats and gt them to others who are more than willing to doff their caps and swear an oath to defend an English monarch. Do these people even listen to themselves These same people, who are lecturing us, will no doubt be lauding Constance Markievicz for her part in the birth of the nation, with all her history of abstentionism and of physical force republicanism.Do they genuinely not understand irony And do they think that our supporters, those who flock to the ballot boxes in their thousands toSinn Féin elected representatives, don’t aspire to the goal of Markievicz, of a democratic republic that cherishes all of the children of the nation equally Where is the equality for nationalists in the six counties  Where is the respect for the democratic mandate of thousands upon thousands of people who have yet to have their rights and entitlements respected in the British constructed and maintained sectarian six-county state  Where is the support for our democratic mandate  Where is the aspiration to cherish all of the children of the nation equally  Or do they not consider us part of that nation  They need to bear in mind that when the Proclamation was being written there was no border in Ireland – hard or soft.They also need to bear in mind that there is no single narrative to this conflict. Yes, people have been hurt, on both sides, and those who are trying to revise the history of the IRA of , are also trying to revise the history of the IRA of this phase of the struggle to present one side and one side only. As a republican woman I am proud of the rich history of Irish women that we can lay claim to, and many here today were part of that history. And I am proud and in awe of those women who lost their lives as part of that struggle.Unfortunately, throughout the decades of our troubled past people who know nothing about what we went through are writing and rewriting our history.We cannot allow the memories of our dead, the stories of nationalist and republican victims, and the history of repression and oppression that led to young people again taking up arms, in the same way Constance Markievicz and Tom Clarke and Pádraig Pearse and all those others in  took up arms, being airbrushed out of our history. And maybe one day we’ll be in a place where the circumstances that led to those decisions are acknowledged and accepted.Because, rest assured, not one of us woke up one morning and decided on a whim to take up arms, to put our lives on the line, to face imprisonment and death. There are always reasons why people make the decisions they do but some people just refuse to see or accept that.We know those reasons and we need no lectures from people who have not walked in our shoes. is something we should all aspire to.We have a duty to future generations to ensure that our revolution isn’t rewritten. We need to make sure that our young people know why and where our history of struggle comes from to remind, educate and to see that it never happens again to ensure that young women continue to be inspired by Constance Markievicz, by her bravery, her philanthropy and her work for those less well off. But we also need to ensure that the circumstances that led to her and future republican women seeing the need to take up arms, never happens again.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27509  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinI remain optimistic because Ireland is changing.

When the Repeal result was read out a sign was held aloft, ‘The North is next’. Rights transcend borders and so does this generation. will mark the centenary of the First Dáil. A people’s parliament for a revolutionary generation. The coming year is an opportunity to rebuild that culture of change and a parliament that serves the people and not vested interests. Sinn Féin will stand with the people on the streets and stand up for them in the Dáil because the housing and health crises can and must be ended.The policies of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael created and sustained the health and housing crises. As waiting lists grow and the number of patients on trollies hit record highs, the Taoiseach points the finger of blame at doctors and nurses who take Christmas leave. His response to rising evictions and homelessness is to defend the Vulture Funds and give tax breaks to landlords.The Taoiseach and Fine Gael are supported in all of this by Mícheál Martin and the supply and confidence trick.Regardless of what choice the British government makes on Brexit, it cannot be allowed to damage Irish interests, our economy, our agreements or the rights of citizens. This is one issue that unites the majority of parties North and South. We will continue to stand up in the interest of all Ireland. Early in January I will travel to Brussels to continue our engagements with European leaders.An Executive in the North should be in place delivering for all in the community, growing the economy, standing up to destructive Tory policies, and representing the majority view on Brexit. Instead we have witnessed daily at an inquiry the corruption of governance that led to the RHI scandal.No government could sustain the abuse of power and intolerance displayed by the DUP. All the while the Irish and British governments looked on and refused to act. It is a disgrace that the institutions of the north are not up and running.We had a deal with the DUP leadership that would have reinstated the Institutions. The DUP walked away. The two governments promised a new talks process. Ten months on there has been no talks and no process. There has been nothing constructive from the two governments. That is not good enough.Every day that the Executive is suspended undermines the political institutions. Every refusal to recognise rights undermines the political process. The threat to impose Brexit undermines the democratic process.The DUP know that their deal with the Tories will end. They also know that the refusal of rights is not compatible with equality and power-sharing government. They should also know that there is no good or positive Brexit for the north.Sinn Féin is ready for talks, to establish a new Executive working in genuine power-sharing, and operating to the highest standards of governance. A new Executive must include new ways of working, be inclusive of all parties and respect the rights of all the people.The DUP knows what needs to be done. Theresa May knows what needs to be done. It will require leadership that has been absent to date.The two governments have indulged the DUP at the cost of the political process. The two governments know what must be done to form a new Executive in the north. The current do-nothing approach is running out of road.The majority of parties share a common approach to Brexit and to the rights of citizens, and are committed to working together to build a new Executive.The two governments must convene talks and make clear the agreements and rights of citizens will be at the core of a new Executive.The Irish Government cannot look on as spectators. They cannot stand idly by while the DUP and British government shred the agreements. The agreements are the people’s agreements. The people voted for them. The Taoiseach said that the people of the north will not be left behind again. The government must plan for a successful talks process and also have a backup plan.They must also begin preparations for Irish Unity. There is no contradiction in seeking the establishment of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement and fulfilling its promise of a unity referendum. The time is right to hold an informed and respectful conversation and referendum on our shared long term future as a united people and a united Ireland. No government should try and stle that debate or call for it to be suspended.I remain optimistic because Ireland is changing. I believe that we have the policies and plans to tackle the housing and health care crises. The debate on Irish unity is under way, and we will have elections and the opportunity for people to have their say. The choice is simple, continue with the failing policies of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil or plot a new course for a new and united Ireland.I look forward to the new year and the continued challenges and opportunities of a changing Ireland.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27510  ","story":"Civil Rights marchers attacked at Burntollet Bridge.

I had received other such callsfrom Jer over the years but I was never available to join him, untilthis year, so I called my friend and comrade Larry OToole and we metJer in Gaffneys in Fairview in the aptly named snug The OfficersMess. It was an unforgettable afternoon with Jer. He had been very ill in hospitalnot long before and while he was in great form, both Larry and I feltthat this was almost like a goodbye. Little did we think that lessthan a month later Jer would be gone from us. He died on StStephen’s Day. November. And as always his conversation ranged widely - from thefamous ambush in West Cork to Dalymount stadium and his beloved Bohs,from the streets of the North Inner City with the Dublin Brigade inthe s - and indeed the s - to the Dubs winning four in a rowin , from the docks of our city to the plains of the AmericanWest, from a Dublin stage to a Hollywood set. Jer did entrances and exits well,befitting a man of the stage, and even the shortest of time in hiscompany was entertaining. He knew the power of words and versestripped easily from his tongue. His accent was deep and Dublin, aswas everything about him, the historic Dublin of the working class,locked out in , rising up in , resilient and proud of itsheritage of struggle. In his day Jer was an IrishRepublican Army Volunteer and a political prisoner. He was asocialist republican through and through in the tradition of JamesConnolly and in the style of his idol Jim Larkin. He embodied Larkinon many occasions and at many events. He was always available to do aturn for The Cause - be it trade union, republican or internationalsolidarity.  We asked him to read theProclamation at the Dublin Sinn Féin Easter commemoration inGlasnevin in  and he proudly obliged. Previously at many of ourEaster commemorations over the years he had read James ConnollysFinal Statement to his Court Martial to great and stirring effectoutside the GPO. In  he performed Larkin with us at thestatue in O’Connell Street to begin the Centenary of the Lockout,and again at the Liberty Hall conference organised by Sinn Féinearly that year. A more poignant memory is of Jeras Wolfe Tone at the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis in , bicentenary of theUnited Irish Rising. He was accompanied by a group of pike men andwomen, among them his son Diarmuid who died so tragically later thatyear in a fire in Glasgow, after a Celtic game which father and sonhad attended. Leaving the stadium that day, Jer saw his son for thelast time. The loss of Diarmuid was a terrible tragedy for Jer andhis partner Eithne, who died in December , a further loss fromwhich Jer never recovered. Among Jers talents was as adesigner of banners, which he produced with Eithne, and many of whichcan still be seen at trade union rallies. He championed the use ofthe original green, silver and gold Starry Plough as designed for theIrish Citizen Army and flown in Dublin at Easter , and, thanks inlarge part to Jer, it is now widely seen and recognised. It wasplaced on permanent display in the Oak Room of the Mansion House forthe first time, when as Ardmhéara I accepted it as a presentationfrom the Dublin Council of Trade Unions. And it was in the Oak Room,under the Starry Plough, that we gathered on  January to pay tributeto Jer with a night of eulogies, music and song. In October  Jer joined us forSpraoi ar an Sráid, the Moore Street Party that I organised asArdmhéara, in support of the campaign to save the  battlefieldsite. As always, he was proud and glad to answer the call. Once againthat day he passionately declaimed the words of the Frenchrevolutionary Camile Desmoulins, as quoted by Connolly and Larkin: \"The great are not great. Thegreat only appear great because we are on our knees. Let us arise!\" Many hundreds of people attendedJer’s funeral on  January. His coffin was draped in the StarryPlough and passed his North Strand home on the way to the church in aprocession which included some of his finest banners. The attendancewas a cross-section of the republican left, in all its ersity, aswell as people from the theatre, the trade union movement and hismany friends and neighbours. Sinn Féin President Mary Lou McDonaldattended, as did Gerry Adams. In a tribute Mary Lou said: \"Ní bheidh a leithéid arís ann agus mara dúirt Jer féin go  minic an Phoblacht abú.\"Deepest sympathy is extended to Jer’s daughters Noraand Clare and to all his extended family.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27513  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonFor its part, Sinn Féin will continue to be an honest friend, committed to the cause of Palestine, and to working in cooperation with all Palestinian political and civic leaders in pursuit of national reconciliation, and the achievement of Palestinian national and democratic objectives.In the aftermath of her election as Uachtarán Shinn Féin, Mary Lou MacDonald, reaffirmed our party’s practical solidarity with the people of Palestine as a key international priority.I communicated this to the very broad cross section of Palestinian political opinion with which Sinn Féin maintains direct contact.As a result the Palestinian Legislative Council , which is Palestine’s elected parliament, issued an official invitation to Mary Lou and a leadership delegation to visit Palestine.In accepting this honour we asked the PLC to host a programme which would allow for engagement with all sections of Palestinian political and civic society, including all the main political forces.So in mid-December  a Party delegation, led by Mary Lou, including Pat Sheehan, Ciarán Quinn and myself, travelled to the occupied West Bank for five days.The PLC extended us every diplomatic courtesy and assistance during our trip including help to arrange a formal meeting with President Mahmoud Abbas the laying of a wreath at the tomb of Yasser Arafat by Mary Lou and, a tour of the Yasser Arafat museum.Our inclusive programme began with a meeting hosted in the Jordanian parliament in Amman by the Chair of its Palestine Committee, Yahya Al-Saud, before travelling directly to our first meeting in the West Bank, with Jonathon Conlan and Declan Johnston, the Irish government representatives in Palestine. Importantly, the government has just increased Ireland’s aid budget by two million euros – at a time when the US administration has slashed its contribution to the United NationsRelief and Works Agency.Over the next few days we met with all the political parties elected to the PLC women activists young people ex-prisoners political and human rights campaigners, including Boycott, Divestment and Sanction representatives local Councillors community groups and, media organisations.Throughout, we engaged extensively with all shades of political and civic opinion.We listened, learned, and made new friends.This trip came at a time of renewed political instability and conflict in the West Bank with increased Israeli military incursions and expanded settlement activity.An Israeli military lock down on Ramallah city was in place just days before we arrived.However, political disunity among the main Palestinian political forces has also intensied. Indeed it has probably deepened since ourto Ireland.Yet the importance of national political unity was spoken of by all the Palestinian representatives and citizens we encountered.The need for national reconciliation is the single most popular and urgent discussion within Palestinian society. That reality has found further expression in the launch since Christmas, of the new Palestinian National Democratic Assembly, which is an alliance including dferent progressive political and civic forces and personalities.We encouraged the pursuit of national unity among all Palestinians and reiterated Sinn Féin’s commitment to assist in whatever modest way we could to support that being achieved.A palpable anger exists among ordinary people throughout Palestine tempered with an absolute determination and resilience.Everyone we met, regardless of ideological and tactical dferences, is committed to popular resistance against the Israeli occupation.Nasser Al-Laham is the managing director of Maan news agency. He hosted us at his offices in Bethlehem six days before Christmas.Nasser is a former political prisoner who served  years. He’s one of the estimated one in five Palestinians who have been imprisoned since .The experience of prison and detention is prolic within Palestinian society.The Nakba of , when almost one million Palestinians were driven from their homes in historic Palestine to become permanent refugees, permeates every aspect of their historic and present day existence.Their collective, lived reality is one of colonialism, death, detention, discrimination and denial of rights.Nasser said evocatively“The Palestinian people are not violent people, they are angry people.”Just a few hours earlier we had walked around Jerusalem.While there we met Adnan Ghaith. He is the Governor of Jerusalem. He too is a former political prisoner, but is banned under Israeli military law in Jerusalem from visiting his office or carrying out official duties.Afterwards we went to Al-Esawiah, a neighbourhood on the edge of the city.A population of , live in this poor area, and,  political prisoners from there are being held in Israeli jails.From early that same day Israeli troops closed off its narrow, winding streets with ‘flying checkpoints’, carrying out searches and making arrests.These were familiar scenes to me.We were in the local community based Ambulance and Emergency Aid Association when Ahmed joined our company.Two years previously, when he was aged just , Israeli soldiers shot him in the right eye while he visited the shops.Afterwards we all walked outside as we did so three of Ahmed’s buddies, of around the same age, came over for a yarn. One of them had also been shot in the eye, as he ed from school.I shuddered when we were then told - a total of  residents from Al-Esawiah have been shot in the eyes.I felt inadequate. I had nothing useful to say.The previous day in Ramallah during a very emotional meeting with ex-prisoners from all political backgrounds two  year-old boys were introduced with their parents.Shadi and Ahmad had just been released from prison two weeks earlier. They were jailed at the age of , sentenced to three years each, and detained in inhumane conditions.I imagined how I’d feelthese were my sons.Meeting these four young teenagers was an unforgettable and moving experience.On the morning of our last day we visited the Tamimi family in their home at Nabil Saleh.Ahed is the -year-old girl who was imprisoned earlier this year for slapping an Israeli soldier.Her daddy Bassem said that although the nearest beach is only  km away, the nature of Israeli restrictions on Palestinians’ movements in the West Bank meant Ahed’s first experience of a beach was on a recent trip to Spain.The occupation of the West Bank, Jerusalem and siege of Gaza have had a devastating impact on the lives of Palestinian children and youth. The percentage of young people aged between  –  years in Palestine comprises % of the total population.Mustafa Barghouti, leader of the Palestinian National Initiativehas said that for him and many others in his generation, childhood ended on  June  when the West Bank, Jerusalem and Gaza were occupied by Israel.The Israeli occupation has robbed Palestinian youth of their childhoods up to and including the present generation.The one fundamental question which the international community must address is what future can Palestinian children expect under the conditions of this five decades old occupation The Israeli settlement policy remains central to the occupation despite the fact that international law as provided under the Geneva Convention, prohibits an occupying power from resettling its own population on occupied territory.Palestinian family homes are systematically demolished alongside a relentless seizure of property, natural resources, water, crops and arable land to make way for new settlements.An eight-metre high wall, which is nearly  miles long, provides an apartheid cordon through the West Bank serviced by a ‘settlers only’ exclusive roads system.This system is reinforced by a network of permanent and ‘flying’ check points.The occupation has been designed, and is being strategically enforced based upon a form of scientic military precision which has no international parallel.Currently , settlers now occupy vast and expanding tracts of the West Bank and East Jerusalem.In the early hours of Christmas morning, settlers protected by Israeli forces began the annexation of Battir, a UNESCO World Heritage site, by putting a caravan in position to stake a claim on that land.On New Year’s Eve, Gideon Levy, the acclaimed Israeli journalist and commentator observed that things in Palestine may appear frozen in time as the occupation continued without impediment.Then he wrote“It would be a grave mistake however, to think that everything stayed the same . There is nothing status quo about occupation or apartheid, evenit sometimes seems that way.”Levy states that the Israeli state has sought to make the colonial settlement programme an irreversible reality.During  a new phase of this strategy began by putting a legislative infrastructure in place, to entrench within Israeli law the aim of the settlements: that is, to prevent any possibility of a viable Palestinian state existing within the territories occupied in , and to block the potential for the two-state solution ever succeeding.Other laws have been adopted which aim to neutralise any opposition from inside Israeli society, and enforce absolute loyalty to the state.Legislative cover has now been enacted for the daily annexation of the Palestinian territories and seizure of Palestinian land and homes, to enable the relentless expansion of the Israeli state borders beyond those established in .When the Oslo Agreement was signed in  the extent of the compromises made by Palestinians were considered highly contentious both at the time and since. Now the overwhelming view in Palestine is that Oslo is dead.From the outset Israel usurped the terms of that agreement and then acted to hollow out the integrity of the resultant Palestinian Authorityto the extent that many in Palestinian society now suggest the only symbol of sovereignty in the PA is the Palestinian national flag.There is a deep, visceral resentment at the attempts to eradicate the Palestinian national identity, culture and history. This goes to the very crux of why the status of Jerusalem is such a totemic issue for the Palestinian people.The current situation in the occupied territories is rapidly deteriorating.The scale and effects of the repression being inflicted is beyond the comprehension of all reasonable people.Last year alone, Israeli army forces killed  Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, according to a statement from the Abdullah Harani Centre on nd January.The number of Palestinians killed has increased by % in .These figures include  children and three women. were reportedly killed in Gaza and  others in the occupied West Bank.A total of , were injured in Gaza and  others in the West Bank by Israeli Army gunfire.The Addameer Association reported in December  that a total of , political prisoners are currently being detained by Israel. Of these  are being held under administrative detention  are women and,  are children, of whom  are aged under  years.The ongoing occupation of Palestine is the most enduring political, humanitarian, existential crisis of our modern times. And yet, all this continues to happen in direct violation of international law, the Fourth Geneva Convention, and successive UN resolutions.The international community and all its institutions have abjectly failed the Palestinian people. By failing to act in defence of Palestinian rights it has acquiesced in their occupation and repression.The international community needs to become outraged at the violation of universal human rights which is taking place.The Palestinians need more than diplomatic noise or sympathy. They demand action.International law must be enforced.The international community must act in the way it ultimately mobilised against South African apartheid.A new, decisive, international initiative on Palestine is demanded from the UN, European Union , and international governments and agencies, in spite of the Israeli and US administrations’ pressure not to do so.The Irish Government should give leadership, within the EU, by recognising the state of Palestine and supporting the passage of the Occupied Territories’ Bill early in .The legitimate mandate of all Palestinian political parties should be recognised by the EU.The politics of exclusion and policies of non-engagement have always failed.However, Palestinian political leaders can give a powerful mandate for such a step change in policy and action from the international community by speaking with one united voice, and by agreeing common strategic and political positions.National unity among all of the political forces under the representative leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organisationis essential to ensure that agreed and effective national resistance strategies are developed against the occupation.That would surely give renewed impetus, inspiration and hope to Palestinian citizens in the occupied territories, in the refugee camps, and throughout the diaspora.Palestinian political prisoners inside the prisons have in the past shown that dialogue to secure unity can be successful.Of course it is a first principle that only the Palestinian people and their political leaders can determine the direction of their struggle. Others can only offer and share fraternal and comradely advice.But it is clear, that what has not been achieved or attempted to date is the integration of mutually reinforcing international and domestic strategies of diplomatic pressure and popular political resistance to end the occupation.As  begins this may well be an opportunity for a new, bold initiative by all the Palestinian leaders to reaffirm and renew the representative leadership role of the PLO as the fully inclusive authority of the Palestinian national liberation struggle and to also build a definitive consensus on the core national and democratic principles and objectives, which subordinates ideological and tactical dferences to the achievement of a viable Palestinian state.Essential to any progress will be the international community and Palestine has many friends across the globe.So consideration should be given to convening an appropriate international forum under the auspices of the PLO which draws together all international authorities, agencies, and fraternal political parties which have acted in good faith towards Palestinian interests and, to mandate their representatives to take responsibility for the implementation of a newly defined international initiative, premised upon invoking and enforcing international law, and for the mobilisation of a global political momentum against the injustice of the occupation which mirrors the global campaign against apartheid in South Africa.For its part, Sinn Féin will continue to be an honest friend, committed to the cause of Palestine, and to working in cooperation with all Palestinian political and civic leaders in pursuit of national reconciliation, and the achievement of Palestinian national and democratic objectives.The ordinary people of Palestine deserve nothing less.In the words of Adnan Ghaith, the Governor of Jerusalem“The Palestinian people deserve to live their lives like any other people.”Free Palestine!test"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1375347.jpg--.jpg?1546939693000\n","title":"vandals target dunclug play park","story":"A CHILDREN’S play park came under attack last weekend in the Dunclug area.Vandals daubed white paint over the mesh fence with splatters damaging the play surface.Offensive slogans were scrawled along the fence in what locals believe could be in relation to drug activity in the vicinity.The attack is believed to have happened overnight between Sunday evening and Monday morning.One of the slogans read F.A.G while another said D.T.U.S Scum.A local resident said there could be a link between the incident and the supply of drugs which is endemic in the area.The resident said it is believed that children or young teenagers were not the perpetrators.They said due to the size of the letters, which they estimate as being around six foot, it is believed that the unsightly graffiti is the work of adults.

We all want the best for our children and sometimes we can worry that we aren’t doing our best.

Schoolchildren, cyclists, runners, older people and people with acute medical conditions immediately spring to mind, but in fact I think everyone should carry an ICE Card. People don’t think twice about wearing a seatbelt or cycling helmet, butyou had a serious accident you’d like your next of kin to know as soon as possible and you’d want the best care possible in a medical emergency. Almost everyone carries a wallet or purse with them so this is the ideal place to keep an ICE Card”.Chief Inspector Barney O’Connor commented: “PSNI is fully supportive of this initiative which is straightforward, practical and user-friendly and provides families reassurance that a loved one has personal information accessible in all emergency situations. Ideal for use whether you are a student studying away from home, an older person or someone with a medical condition.”The ICE Card ensures all the essential information is accessible in one place meaning it could help save lives, provide the best help and care, as well as make sure your next of kin can be contacted promptly.Information about medications and allergies helps ambulance personnel make better decisions about treatments they can give you and crucially in the case of heavy blood loss, it is important for emergency staff to know your blood type. In the case of people with conditions such asAlzheimer’s it can help a person who may be confused contact their family and avoid any unnecessary distress.The cards are initially being rolled out at PCSP and PSNI engagement events and through groups. For more information on how to get an ICE Card please contact PCSP Project Officer, Billy Stewart on    or by emailing william.stewart@armaghbanbridgecraigavon.gov.uk.\"  \"  Police warn Northern Ireland residents to look out for vulnerable relatives after two people robbed of thousands Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\""},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8756119.1546445050!/image/image.jpg","title":"st colman s have a super tour","story":"Local families attending the Family Health Initiative at St Colman#s Primary School recently visited Moundview Eurospar in Dromore for a supermarket tour.The Family Health Initiative is a healthy lestyle programme delivered by Early Years- the organisation for young children in the Southern Trust and is funded by the Public Health Agency.During the supermarket tour both parents and children took part in a fantastic scavenger hunt to find all the healthy food items on their sheet.

Not initially aware of his good fortune, the two cash-strapped women learn that their patient won’t be around for long and are then faced with a moral dilemma of should they or shouldn’t they… Long time Marie Jones collaborator Katie Tumelty told Daily Belfast how the play has a “universal voice” in its themes that are as prevalent today as when the play was first performed back in .“This play deals with the working woman, in this case two care workers who are running to and from the people that they care for on a daily basis,” she said. “Their work is invaluable to so many families but in the cases of Frances and Loretta there is more going on behind the scenes. Marie’s play deals with poverty, death and dilemma but at the same time has so much humour running throughout it.“Both characters are hard workers, they have stresses in work, stresses at home and they are just trying to make ends meet and get through their working day. I play the character of Frances who looks at the same sky as everyone  every morning, has hopes, aspirations and it’s like many peoplethe situation arises – what to doa small amount of money, should it be £ or £, comes their way, do they take it “What starts out as a tiny grain of sand soon becomes an avalanche for the two women to deal with. The piece is Marie at her finest,” she added.Katie continued: “Everybody knows a Frances or a Loretta, they are going in and out of hundreds of home every day to help those in their care. I remember so many times being stopped in the Kennedy Centre with people saying that the show should be on prescription, that Marie should be getting her wages through the NHS such is the tonic the show has proven to be.”Fly Me To The Moon and its message have been welcomed around the world on stages in New York, Canada, Sweden and most recently Iceland.“For this run I’m performing with Abigail McGibbon and it’s like a homecoming for her as she performed the part back at the start. It’s great to be bringing the show to the Grand Opera House main auditorium for the week and we will be touring down south once the curtain comes down on the .“There is no doubt that those coming to see it will leave with a message and huge laughs in what is a very current, relevant piece of theatre.”Fly Me To The Moon will be performed at the Grand Opera House from January  to .

However, a motion by Sinn Féin’s Charlene O’Hara was passed by  votes to seven at the Council’s People and Community Committee.Both Sinn Féin and the SDLP argued the Council had gone against its own policy, which states leisure centres can only be named after iniduals who have been dead for five years, have lived in the area of the facility and whose family approves of the move.Councillor O’Hara welcomed news that the naming of the new leisure facility at the former Robinson Centre site will go to public consultation.The Colin representative said: “I am pleased that my motion on the naming of the leisure facility at the former Robinson Centre site has been passed at the People and Community Committee.“The Council will now undertake a citywide consultation on the name to allow ratepayers to have their say on the name of the new facility.”In a statement to BBC’s Nolan Show, Mr Robinson accused nationalists of double standards when it comes to naming Council facilities.Mr Robinson referenced the controversy of renaming a play park in Newry after IRA hunger striker Raymond McCreesh."},{"url":null,"title":"book reveals number of catholics in dup and uup","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Majority of UUP members loathe DUP and dont want a merger \"In each party you could count the Catholic members on the fingers of your hand, but it will surprise many people that the DUP is ahead of the Ulster Unionists,\" Prof Tonge said.He said it was surprising that the UUP had no programme in place to attract Catholic unionists as most members would like a more religiously representative party. \"Both unionist parties are currently beyond the pale to Catholics,\" he added.Around , UUP members were interviewed by the authors.Prof Tonge said the party was considerably larger than the DUP, boosting a membership twice the size. However, while almost a third of DUP members claimed to be \"very active\", only one in five UUP members did.The partys strength was in Northern Irelands least populated county, Fermanagh, where around % of members lived compared to % of DUP members.Prof Tonge said the UUP urgently needed to recruit in the more heavily populated counties of Antrim and Down. He revealed that, contrary to popular myth, the UUP had recruited young people in recent years.\"Fteen per cent of its members joined in the last seven years. The party has been very successful in Queens and the Ulster University. Where it needs to do better is with ordinary, non-university young people,\" he said.The UUP boosts more women members than the DUP - its % male to the DUPs %. But Prof Tonge said the centralised nature of the DUP meant greater control over candidate selection by the leadership with women heavily promoted.\"The rise of Arlene Foster to become Northern Irelands first female leader is symbolic of the DUPs deliberate attempts to modernise the image of the party in the face of their unionist rivals,\" the book states. \"Whether Arlene Foster would have been able to rise through the ranks of the UUP will never be known, but is still a question worth asking.\"Although the partys politicians are increasingly liberal on the issue, only % of UUP members support same-sex marriage. However, % believe Northern Ireland should have the same abortion laws as Britain.Whereas Free Presbyterians are the largest denomination in the DUP, they account for just .% of the UUP, which is split almost evenly - % to % - between the Church of Ireland and the Presbyterian Church. UUP members are religious with % attending church weekly, although thats lower than the DUPs %. Almost six in  would mind a religiously mixed marriage in the family a little or a lot.The Orange Orders influence in the party is on the wane. Only % of councillors are members compared to % in the DUP, and % of MLAs . Around % of both parties members are in the Orange Order.

when MPs vote on the Withdrawal Agreement next week should not take things for granted.Mr Coveney said while Ireland would not interfere in the parliamentary process at Westminster, it did want to offer assurances that the contentious border backstop was not what some Brexiteers were “misrepresenting” and “spinning” it as.The Tanaiste held meetings with a number of business and civic groups in Belfast on Thursday before holding talks with the region’s politicians at Stormont.One of the things that I can say confidentially is there is not a majority of people in Westminster who want to see a no-deal Brexit, in fact there is a majority who want to prevent that from happeningSimon CoveneyFacebookTwitterAddressing the media between meetings, Mr Coveney was asked whether a no deal looked inevitable, given indications Mrs May will lose the vote on her agreement next week.“Absolutely not,” he replied.“First of all, I don’t think we should take anything for granted next week.”He added: “One of the things that I can say confidentially is there is not a majority of people in Westminster who want to see a no-deal Brexit, in fact there is a majority who want to prevent that from happening.“What we haven’t seen yet is a majority to support a mechanism that can actually achieve that and, in my view, the only person who actually has a deal that is in place and in writing, that can actually achieve that in a way that solves so many of the complex problems linked to Brexit, is the Prime Minister herself.”Mr Coveney said EU leaders were happy to offer “clarication, reassurance and definition” around the backstop to help Mrs May get the deal over the line, but he again made clear the substantive terms of the agreement could not be renegotiated.“If people are concerned about that, yes of course we are happy to look at ways in which we can provide clarication and reassurance and definition in terms of what is meant by that backstop, its temporary nature, and the fact it is only a fall-back, insurance mechanism in the first place anyway, that we hope to never use.“I mean, are we really suggesting that this whole deal is going to be pulled down because of something that may never be used in the first place and evenit is, will only be used on a temporary basis “Is that what people are actually advocating for ”This isnt a threat to anybody, the Irish government certainly doesnt have any ulterior motives here, apart from to try to protect the status quo on this islandSimon CoveneyFacebookTwitterMr Coveney has been critical of Brexiteers who have claimed the backstop would undermine the constitutional sovereignty of the UK and bring a united Ireland a step closer by creating barriers between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.“This isn’t a threat to anybody, the Irish government certainly doesn’t have any ulterior motives here, apart from to try to protect the status quo on this island, the peace process on this island, the fact that we have a border but it’s a border that’s largely invisible when it comes to trade and movement of goods,” he said.Mr Coveney acknowledged that some unionists had “genuine” concerns about the backstop.But he said he found those concerns usually subsided when the facts around it were laid out.Under the terms of the proposed withdrawal deal, the backstop would only be triggereda wider trade agreement between the UK and the EU failed to materialise before the end of the Brexit implementation period – whether that be at its current expiration date in late  or at a later datethe implementation period is extended.The measure, which is designed to avoid the re-emergence of any border checks, would see the UK as a whole effectively remain in the EU customs union while Northern Ireland would also have to comply with a number of single market regulations.“I don’t believe there is a sting in the backstop at all,” said the Tanaiste.“I think that some people have created the impression that there is and somehow some ulterior motive that is going to weaken Northern Ireland as part of the UK in the future, I don’t accept that premise in the first place. That’s not what’s in the text of the Withdrawal Agreementpeople read it.”The Irish government has also rejected any suggestion that a future Stormont executive could veto aspects of the backstop.Mr Coveney echoed remarks by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar on Wednesday when he expressed concern about a UK Government proposal that,the backstop came into operation, would mean the devolved legislature in Belfast would have to agree to any subsequent changes to EU laws impacting on it.After the meeting with Mr Coveney, which the party described as “very frank”, DUP leader Arlene Foster urged the Irish government to think again on the backstop.“The Withdrawal Agreement is not a fair deal and we cannot support it,” she said.“It should be no more acceptable to build a new east-west border than it is to build a new north-south border.I trust the Irish government will reflect on our principled objections to the Withdrawal Agreement and recognise that there is a better way which can work for both the Republic of Ireland and the United KingdomArlene Foster, DUP leaderFacebookTwitter“The backstop is not needed. No-one is going to build a hard border. We will work with the Government to reach a better deal for the United Kingdom but this will require more pragmatism from the European Union.“Exiting the European Union without a deal is not our favoured outcome. To reach a better deal will require a change of heart in Dublin and Brussels.“I trust the Irish government will reflect on our principled objections to the Withdrawal Agreement and recognise that there is a better way which can work for both the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom.”But Sinn Fein vice president Michelle O’Neill urged the Irish government and other EU member states to “hold firm” in the face of Brexiteer calls to ditch the backstop.“As this unfolds it is crucially important that the Tanaiste and the Irish government continues to stand up for the people here in the north,” she said.As we see how this unfolds in the next number of days and weeks, I think it’s vitally important that the Irish government holds firm, along with the other member statesMichelle O’Neill, Sinn Fein vice presidentFacebookTwitter“I put it to the Tanaiste that the DUP are on the wrong side of this argument, they bizarrely are actually turning their face against the interests of the citizens here.“As we see how this unfolds in the next number of days and weeks, I think it’s vitally important that the Irish government holds firm, along with the other member states, who gave assurances yesterday that they will remain firm, that there is no room for renegotiation or reopening up the negotiation that has already happened and concluded.”Ms O’Neill said a no-deal “crash out” would be “catastrophic”.“The ramications are just unthinkable,” she said.At the end of his day of engagements, Mr Coveney said it was clear people in Northern Ireland were concerned about a no deal.He said his meeting with the DUP was “open and robust”.“But it was respectful and I think the DUP wanted to outline their position in relation to their concerns at the current deal that is on offer and I think I outlined in very clear terms why the Irish government supports the deal,” Mr Coveney said.The Tanaiste added: “I don’t think anyone would have expected that the conversation would have resulted in agreement on the backstop between the DUP and the Irish government but certainly I think it was useful to have an open and frank discussion.”"},{"url":null,"title":"no one is going to build hard border in ireland claims dups foster after coveney meeting","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Geri Cameron, president of the National Association of Head Teachers in Northern Ireland, said: “It is totally unsatisfactory, parents have had a very strong voice in telling us that it is not sustainable.”The budget for schools has reduced by about % in real terms over the past five years.The union leader added: “Schools are now at crisis point.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Rancour between the two main political parties over Brexit means it has been months since substantive political talks aimed at restoring devolution have happened Charlene Brooks, chief executive of Parenting NI, a family support organisation, said families were expected to buy extra items like stationery and contribute to the cost of particular lessons.“Parents have made it very clear that this has had an additional financial and emotional strain.“They talk about a voluntary contribution butone parent does not make it does that mean that their child is left out of a lesson and is more vulnerable to being picked on “Does that mean that that child stands out from the group “There appear to be much greater expectations on parents to pay towards things that they would not have to in the past.”It is unsustainable, the rates system no longer worksHospitality Ulster chief executive Colin NeillFacebookTwitterA spokeswoman for the Department of Education said % of the total budget for day-to-day running costs went towards funding schools and pupils.She added: “However, the department fully acknowledges the financial challenges facing schools and continues to make the case each year for additional funding, based on an analysis of the financial pressures facing the sector.“That said, we do not determine what the final outcome will be each year, as the education pressures are considered alongside other competing pressures across all departments.“Overall budget allocations to departments must be funded from available resources and are decided by ministers.“To benefit pupils, all grant aided schools are entitled to request or invite voluntary contributions from parents.”Endless rounds of political talks have failed to restore the Stormont institutions.An official probe into the Renewable Heat Incentivescheme and its threatened massive overspending is due to report later this year.The DUP wants to re-enter Government immediately but refuses to meet a republican demand for official protection for the Irish language.The unionist party’s stance against abortion and same sex marriage has rankled with its former partner in Government.Meanwhile, tourism chiefs are awaiting a long-overdue reform to cut red tape, and the tax burden on pubs contributed to one closing every four days last year, Hospitality Ulster chief executive Colin Neill said.He added: “It is unsustainable, the rates system no longer works.”Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley has been unwilling to introduce full Direct Rule from Westminster, but has passed a budget to keep public services running and intervened in piecemeal fashion in policing and addressing the legacy of the conflict."},{"url":null,"title":"staggering northern ireland lorry driver four times over limit in petrol station","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Nobody would mind paying to use an open, clean facility instead of going behind a tree..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"‘Utter confusion’ at bin collections and overfull skips  ","story":"RATEPAYERS across the district were left confused about alternative bin collection arrangements over the Christmas holiday period, according to a local politician.Mournes councillor Laura Devlin said there was also frustration that household recycling centres struggled to cope with the huge volume of waste and that many were forced to close early.Cllr Devlin has met with Newry, Mourne and Down Council officials to discuss the issue which resulted in what she described as ldquototal confusion over Christmas bin collections.She said she was inundated with queries about alternative household bin collections due to the bank holidays and claimed that residents did not receive direct communication from the local authority, with the onus on householders to check social media or press advertisements.ldquoThis simply wasnrsquot good enough and didnrsquot work, declared Cllr Devlin. ldquoIf the council is serious about recycling and ensuring that its targets are met, as well as delivering a fit-for-purpose service to ratepayers, we need to improve lines of communication with the public.ldquoThis utter confusion in respect of when bins were to be lted had a knock-on effect on the demand at the household recycling centres with skips filling up much quicker than usual and centres being forced to close.Cllr Devlin said staff at the centres in Castlewellan, Downpatrick and Ballynahinch worked very hard.ldquoFor these staff to be placed in the position of having to deal with many irate members of the public who had duly loaded their cars and travelled to the ious sites which were closed as the skips were full is far from acceptable, she continued.Cllr Devlin explained council officials had taken her concerns on board and had invoked what is being described as a ldquolessons learned exercise.A report on how the service can be improved due to be tabled at the next meeting of the councilrsquos Regulatory and Technical Services Committee.ldquoThe council previously issued collection schedules but these ran out last October. Advising people to check online is all well and good, but we still have many households who donrsquot have access to broadband and people who are not computer literate.ldquoThe council needs to reflect on this and act accordingly and I look forward to seeing these much-needed changes in advance of the next bank holiday, she added.A local authority spokeswoman said Newry, Mourne and Down District Council was aware of a number of issues affecting both the collection of bins, as well as the operation of its household recycling centres over the holiday period.She said the organisation was ldquoactively working to resolve these issues as a matter of urgency..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Aidan’s work to go on display at Down Arts Centre  ","story":"A LOUGHINISLAND artist famed for his colourful and lelike portrayal of animals is holding his first exhibition at Down Arts Centre.Thirty year-old Aidan Sloan, whose work also includes some locally renowned politicians, will have  pieces on display in the exhibition entitled, lsquoThis Wee Place Herersquo.The talented artist can certainly stretch his imagination to determine what kind of surface to paint on. He has used everything from boards, wooden planks, old suitcases, football tops and even an old Belfast sink for his masterpieces.Aidan, who is often seen at home in his studio with a paintbrush in hand and his six week-old baby daughter Siacutene lying across his shoulder, says he has loved drawing all his le.ldquoIt wasnrsquot until  that I took a career break from my job as a civil servant to look after my young family and try to turn my passion for art into a career, he remarked.ldquoSo far it is going from strength to strength. I fit painting and researching my work in between school runs and the daily routine of having four children.ldquoMy we, Deacutearbhla, and our four children are my inspiration, although I can draw creativity from the subject I am painting too. Sometimes other artists and genres inspire me and perhaps inspiration comes from the meaning behind the painting.ldquoTo be totally honest I just go with what feels right to me at the time. I have no training in art or qualications in art history, but rather I have developed my talent from experimenting with paints, canvases and subjects over the years.ldquoI really admire the work of Christian Hook and Angela Bell. They both have created their own wonderful styles that are unique to them and I would say I have created something of my own style too.The painter, who already has one piece of work hanging in the Ulster Museum as part of the annual Royal Ulster Academy of Arts exhibition, described his delight in seeing his familyrsquos artistic gene falling onto the next generation.ldquoMy three eldest children love art too and they have grown up watching me paint and produce art.ldquoMy youngest child, Siacutene, is only six weeks old but I am sure it wonrsquot be long until she has a paintbrush in her hand. My eldest son, Ethan, won the Art Shield when he left primary school, and my daughter, Riacuteoghnach, who has epilepsy and autism, uses art as a therapeutic way to relax.ldquoHaving them watch me paint is also an inspiration and I feel it demonstrates to them that you should follow your passion and dreams, no matter what.Aidan has some of his own favourites in display at the exhibition, including lsquoBlending In, which is an acrylic painting of a hare on an old loft door, and a portrait of the late David Ervine, former PUP leader, which is acrylic paint and pencil on the inside of an old fishing wader.Heavily influenced by farming and all things agricultural, it comes as a surprise to learn the Co Down artist didnrsquot grow up on a farm.ldquoI often help my brother-in-law out on his farm and quite a few of his cows have become the subject of many of my paintings, he said.ldquoThere was something about the characters of animals that I really felt I could utilise in my paintings. Then I began to produce portraits of people with pencil, and my we encouraged me to try painting them a few years ago.ldquoI am Loughinisland, through and through. This has actually inspired one of the pieces of artwork that will be on display. The exhibition gives an insight into my depiction of growing up in Northern Ireland post-troubles.ldquoIt contains many animals from Northern Ireland, but I have also reflected on some things such as landscapes, political figures and events that had some sort of impact on me when I was growing up.ldquoWhen I was in primary school I loved art and I kept a booklet from P where I said that I wanted to grow up to be an artist. It wasnrsquot until I was in my late s, and with a lot of encouragement from my we, that I realised I could make a career out of something I had always done as a hobby.bull Aidanrsquos work can be admired throughout the month of January up to February  at Down Arts Centre and admission is free..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Devlin and Quinn selected by SDLP for upcoming elections  ","story":"THE SDLP has chosen sitting councillors Laura Devlin and Brian Quinn to defend their seats in the Mournes district electoral area at the forthcoming local government elections.Their nomination was confirmed at a recent selection meeting when the party also confirmed its candidates in the Downpatrick, Rowallane and Slieve Croob areas.Candidates for the Newry, Crotlieve and Slieve Gullion area will be selected shortly as the SDLP aims to increase its membership on Newry, Mourne and Down Council.Cllr Devlin said it had been her ldquotremendous honour to serve the people of the Mournes DEA over the past five years.ldquoAs someone who grew up with a strong sense of community and reconciliation, I believe the policies I have pursued during my years on council have adequately reflected that, as have the results, she explained.ldquoThis year will be busy as I am expecting another baby as well as contesting an election. But I enjoy a challenge and I hope that my constituency work on the ground spanning the past  years will stand by me as we approach polling day.Cllr Quinn said there was much more work to be done and he trusted that the public willboth him and his party colleague in the Mournes area to continue with this vital task.He added: ldquoI look forward to continuing to represent the needs of the public at council and ensuring that nobody is left behind.South Down MLA Colin McGrath paid tribute to the ing local government candidates.

An engineer explained that a conductor on a transformer, which had probably been smouldering due to a layer of snow or ice, caught fire.Carryduff, the highest point between Belfast and the Mourne mountains, had falls of up to six inches and drts were reported as deep as one and two feet in some areas.Ballynahinch had several inches fall inside an hour and this worsened as snow continued to fall. Dromara got it bad yet again and Comber reported several inches.The Department of the Environmentrsquos snow ploughs were in use at Carryduff, Ballynahinch and Dromara, and gritting machines were needed on many local roads.In Downpatrick and coastal districts there was sleet and heavy rain mdash and roads were made treacherous when this turned to ice yesterday morning. There was a spate of minor accidents as cars slithered through the snow and ice.Roads are being gritted by the DOE, but owing to decreasing fuel and salt they have only been treating priority roads.CROSSGAR mdash Crossgar is taking part in an appeal organised by the BBC programme Blue Peter, which will help provide bicycles for villages in Africa.The campaign, which involves the collection of stamps on Christmas card envelopes, is already well underway and these will be sold to buy bicycles which will help with transporting medical aid in remote African villages.Anyone in the Crossgar area who wants to help with appeal can leave their contributions at the Post Office.DOWNPATRICK mdash Representatives of Downpatrick organisations are asked to turn their backs on the wintry weather and go to the townrsquos library for a public meeting to consider plans for a major Maytime festival.A steering committee, which was born out of ideas kicked around by Down Councilrsquos arts committee more than a year ago, will present good thinking on how a wholehearted three-day festival of family fun will put the town in holiday form as never before.The centrepiece of the holiday weekend will be a pageant with a Patrician theme and possibly a medieval type flavour. Jousting is a distinct possibility and so are a number of other unusual dimensions.Although it will be called St Patrickrsquos Festival, the steering committee believe that a Maytime date would be better favoured by the weather than one on March  and would allow them to provide a much wider range of outdoor and indoor attractions.KILLYLEAGH mdash A Stormont Minister is to be asked to prevent the extension of a caravan park near Killyleagh.The unprecedented step is being taken by Down Council in protest against a recommendation made by planners to allow the development at East Down Yacht Club.

Because of the work to rule action by watermen, it meant the problem was not dealt with for several days.As a result families living near Tullymurray were without water since Christmas Day.PORTAFERRY mdash Stage two of a new sewerage scheme for Portaferry is expected to get underway in May and should take four months to complete.The Department of the Environmentrsquos Eastern Division Water Service has announced that the second of three contracts is now being advertised and work will involve the construction of a pumping station.

Joe is a very experienced performer, both as a solo artist and fronting his own band.A lot of the experience that shows through in Joersquos personal appearances was picked up during a three-year period touring the working menrsquos clubs circuit in England, Wales and Scotland, where he appeared alongside a great many of the artists regularly seen on television.SPORT mdash Outdoor sporting organisations, already facing fixture backlogs due to rain, snow, ice and frost over the past number of weeks, are now facing another problem mdash how to find petrol to get them to their matches.Most clubs find themselves in the predicament of not having the petrol to travel to away games and already one soccer league has decided to postpone all of this Saturdayrsquos fixtures, even though it throws the fixture list into further chaos.Soccer clubs have already been hit severely by weather conditions over the past number of weeks and now some are hoping that the governing body will see fit to extend the season into May.

She always kept a respectful distance unless you had some Nutella.Describing the vixen as very friendly, Aileen continued: ldquoOne of the ladies I play with always kept food in her bag.

This week council officials confirmed that the campaign will be officially launched at the end of June.With the rates process well underway to determine the local authorityrsquos budget for the new financial year, councillors have agreed to make provision for new advertising and publicity campaigns as they bid to get on top of the dog fouling problem. Advertising the campaign on radio is also planned.Councillors and local authority officials are becoming increasingly concerned that a number of dog owners are prepared to turn a blind eye to potentially harming children who come into contact with the mess their animals leave behind.With the new campaign aimed at changing minds, dog owners will be reminded that it is their responsibility to clean up after their dogs and that not doing so leaves them open to an pound fine.Councillors say they are frustrated at the ldquoblatant disregard some dog owners and ratepayers are displaying and are keen to finally address the dog fouling issue.With a number of notable dog fouling hot spots across the district, the local authority is determined to do all it can to tackle the problem, given that it does nothing to enhance the districtrsquos image.Rowallane councillor Billy Walker, who is severely critical of dog owners who do not clean up after their pets, hopes the new initiative will be a success.ldquoThis campaign is long overdue and I hope that the small number of dog owners who break the law by not cleaning up after their pets will get the message that their behaviour is inexcusable, he said.ldquoDog fouling is a problem in many areas, even in my home town of Killyleagh. We are talking about a district-wide problem which we have not yet been able to get to grips with. People should not have to constantly watch their step while out walking and while many dog owners are careful to clean up after their pets, there are those who donrsquot care.Cllr Walker said improving the districtrsquos cleanliness was at the heart of the new campaign.He said that while reminding dog owners to clean up after their dogs was important, one way of dealing with the problem was hitting them in the pocket with a fine.He added: ldquoI have always said dog owners who break the law should be lsquonamed and shamedrsquo and still hold this view. Letrsquos hope that when this new campaign is launched it will be a success and help tackle a problem which is a scourge on this district..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Irish Street traders need consulted about scheme  ","story":"A LEADING politician has backed calls for improved communication with Downpatrickrsquos business community following a series of pre-Christmas incidents.Over  spaces at the Irish Street car park were temporarily unavailable at what is traditionally the busiest trading week of the year after contractors sealed off an area to allow a large lorry to deliver granite paving stones.The move left business owners furious and to compound their frustration, several spaces in Irish Street were sealed off to allow the large lorries to safely turn into the car park.Contractors also arrived in Market Street just days before Christmas to replace a section of granite paving which led to minor disruption, while much of the nearby Lower Market Street car park was under several feet of water due to flooding.The granite paving was being transported to Downpatrick ahead of work starting on Monday on a near pound, environmental improvement scheme in Irish Street.Politicians described the temporary loss of parking spaces just days before Christmas as ldquoextremely unfortunate and insisted that traders should have been told what was happening.This week, South Down MLA Colin McGrath confirmed he has written to business owners in Irish Street traders in the wake of the pre-Christmas debacle.He said: ldquoThe situation which arose in the run-up to Christmas was something of a perfect storm. Part of Irish Street was sealed off, spaces in the nearby car park were temporarily unavailable, contractors were working in Market Street and much of the Lower Market Street car park was under several feet of water.ldquoThere were ious causes for these issues from early delivery of stone pavements for Irish Street works, flood water in the town and emergency work to kerbs, but we must have better coordination between authorities and there must simply be better communication with businesses in the town.Mr McGrath said he has written to businesses and forwarded his contact details should there be further issues as a temporary one-way traffic system comes into operation in Irish Street during work on the environmental improvement scheme.ldquoI have also written to the districtrsquos isional roads manager outlining my concerns. Newtownards, Bangor or Newry would not face public authority road blockages in the lead up to Christmas. Why should Downpatrick Mr McGrath said he wanted assurances that communication with the business community will improve and that work which has the potential to disrupt businesses will be kept to the absolute bare minimum over the coming weeks in Irish Street.The Department for Communities and Newry, Mourne and Down Council are jointly funding the environmental improvement scheme which will result in one traffic lane being closed during the work to facilitate the contractor.The work mdash which includes new granite footpaths, lighting and street furniture mdash is due to be completed before the end of the financial year and is designed to help regenerate Irish Street, providing a boost for traders and residents.Politicians are also confident the scheme can help arrest decline in an area where the presence of the townrsquos former police base was a major impediment to investment over many years..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Jane Coyne’s The Suitcase comes to Down Arts Centre  ","story":"DOWN Arts Centre is hosting The Suitcase next month.The highly acclaimed production by Jane Coyle takes to the stage on Sunday, February , at pm and tickets are now available.The play was premiered at the Belfast synagogue for the  Belfast International Arts Festival and won the Audience Award.Now, in response to popular demand, it is being revived and toured around Northern Ireland during this yearrsquos Holocaust Memorial Day commemorations.The storyline moves between s Vienna and modern day Belfast.

The congestion also blocks access at the crossroads to Kilclief and Ballyhornan.Cllr Enright said the problem had been ldquogrinding on for a number of years and could no longer be ignored.He said it was no longer acceptable to say that roads congestion in Strangford and the problems on the Portaferry side were not the Department for Infrastructurersquos responsibility.He added: ldquoFerry service managers insist that the congestion in Strangford is not a matter for them, but for their roads counterparts.ldquoBoth departments are under the Department of Infrastructure which is why it is vital we meet with the Permanent Secretary to seeheads can be banged together and any budgetary issues resolved.Cllr Gareth Sharvin said there had been many occasions where vehicles queuing to use the ferry service in Strangford had a dramatic impact on the village.He added: ldquoThere is a perfectly good traffic flow system already in place which is not being utilised by drivers. We need to ensure there is enough resource to accommodate ferry traffic flow and demand to minimise the impact on Strangford residents.Cllr Billy Walker suggested the provision of a bridge linking Strangford and Portaferry should perhaps be considered.Cllr Enrightrsquos motion was also supported by Cllrs Willie Clarke, Jill Macauley and John Trainor..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Mahon Cup success for disciplined St Michael’s  ","story":"THE final of the long-standing Mahon Cup was played out before an appreciative crowd in the Drumaness clubrooms just before Christmas.In the final were holders St Michaelrsquos from Downpatrick and Queenrsquos Hall from Newtownards.League sponsor Gary Rodgers conducted the draw for the match pairings, which saw Gareth McKeever up first against Alastair McDonald and Bobby Douglas taking on Keith Lemon.McDonald got into his stride the quicker and soon built up a good lead over Gareth at  points to .

There was no school reputation, no building, no funding, no resources. They were unbelievable and were really pioneering.Naturally delighted with the honour mdash the first in her family mdash Mrs Roulston says that she shares it with a lot of people.ldquoThroughout my career, I have worked alongside so many wonderful and dedicated people, committed to making a dference to the lives of the children and to ensuring that they received the very best possible education in the widest sense of the word mdash teachers, assistants, dinner ladies, caretakers, volunteer parents and members of the board of governors, etc, she said.ldquoSo, on the day that I receive my MBE, I will be paying honour to all the people I have known and worked with and all those from other schools and sectors who show dedication and commitment to the children in our schools.The little people who she had the pleasure of teaching until she retired in  will always have a special place in  year-old Mrs Roulstonrsquos heart.ldquoI would like to thank all the children, those I have taught and also those whom I had the pleasure of knowing for all that they have taught me, for the pleasure they have given me throughout my career, for all the funny things they said or did which brightened up my day, for their kindness to me in all the drawings and little hand-made crafts they made for me.Originally from outside Manchester, Mrs Roulston has lived and worked in the south Down area from the late s after marrying her husband, Mervyn.After teaching practice in England and teaching in two very dferent schools in France, Mrs Roulston taught for some years in Greyabbey and Portavogie Primary Schools, as well as the Rupert Steiner School in Belfast, before taking a career break while raising her three sons mdash John, Peter and Timothy mdash in Kircubbin.ldquoI did a lot of cross-community work at that time as chair of the parent and toddler group, said Mrs Roulston.ldquoI also formed and chaired a community association and did a lot of work together cross community to get facilities for Kircubbin. It wasnrsquot a paid job but it was an important part of everything and I believe itrsquos where I first understood that cross-community work was so important.While working in Portaferry Primary School in the late s, she was fascinated on learning about a group of parents in Carryduff campaigning for an integrated primary school.ldquoI was reading all about it in the local newspaper and it was very interesting to me, but it was hot and heavy as well as there was lot of objection to the school, she said.ldquoI never dreamt that I would apply for it or have anything to do with it. But I did apply as it was a teaching principalship and it was working with both sides of the community as all the work I had done with cross-community work just kept saying to me, lsquoThis is really important work, this needs to be done to break down barriersrsquo.The road to establishing Millennium was far from smooth, however, as the grandmother of three can testy.ldquoYou just wouldnrsquot believe the terrible trouble we had and itrsquos hard to believe now what happened, said Mrs Roulston.ldquoDays before we were due to open, I had  primary ones and no funding and no site as there was a lot of opposition to establishing the school where we had originally planned to in the Carryduff area.ldquoWe ended up down at Breda Park, close to Forestside in Belfast in an old heath trust building. We initially rented it for six months but ended up staying for two yearsldquoWe were in a very derelict, vandalised, dirty building which we all very quickly had to work very hard get it up to scratch for the children.ldquoWe all had to break down barriers in many areas.Together with P classroom assistant, Mrs Marie Coiley, who still works at Millennium, they began to establish a school with an emphasis on total inclusiveness from the start.ldquoIt was very important to me that the school would be child-centred and the children would have a voice, explained Mrs Roulston.ldquoIt would not only be integrated in the whole Catholic-Protestant area but integrated at every level and it would be highly inclusive and children of all abilities and backgrounds would be welcome.After dficult early years in the Breda Park site, she believed that the school finally turned a corner when it secured a site in Carryduff to build around mobile classrooms in its third year.ldquoI always knew it was going to work, I knew it was needed and I knew that I was determined and the others around me were also very determined, said Mrs Roulston.ldquoIrsquove always been a very determined person and Irsquove alway never liked inequality or injustice of any kind.ldquoIt was very important to me that it happened and I was surrounded by some amazing parents who eventually became the board of governors.Shersquos rightly proud of her achievements and adds: ldquoI know I did good work.ldquoI must say there were days when myself and Mrs Coiley would often look around during assembly at all the children and all of the staff and wonder how did we get here.Now a director of the Integrated Education Fund, Mrs Roulstonrsquos hope for the future is to see a planned integrated school.ldquoIntegrated education is a growth area and I would like to see a situation the Department of Education and the Education Authority actually decide to plan an integrated school and not to be relying on parents having to fight for them.ldquoAll our grant maintained integrated schools have had horrendous journeys to succeed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Tally’s Down torment continues  ","story":"DOWN fell to their second successive McKenna Cup defeat when Donegal proved too strong for Paddy Tallyrsquos side in front of just over , spectators at Pairc Esler on Sunday.The Down manager made several changes from the side that started against Cavan as he continues in his bid to unearth some fresh talent, but it was Donegal and their new faces that impressed.The visitors registered the first score when Niall OrsquoDonnell converted in the first minute.

Photograph: Declan RoughanMr Coveney said while Ireland would not interfere in the parliamentary process at Westminster, it did want to offer assurances that the contentious border backstop was not what some Brexiteers were “misrepresenting”.The tanaiste held meetings with a number of business and civic groups in Belfast on Thursday before holding talks with the region’s politicians at Stormont.Addressing the media between meetings, Mr Coveney was asked whether a no deal looked inevitable, given indications Mrs May will lose the vote on her agreement next week.“Absolutely not,” he replied.“First of all, I don’t think we should take anything for granted next week.”He added: “One of the things that I can say confidently is there is not a majority of people in Westminster who want to see a no-deal Brexit, in fact there is a majority who want to prevent that from happening.“What we haven’t seen yet is a majority to support a mechanism that can actually achieve that and, in my view, the only person who actually has a deal that is in place and in writing, that can actually achieve that in a way that solves so many of the complex problems linked to Brexit, is the Prime Minister herself.”After the meeting with Mr Coveney, DUP leader Arlene Foster urged the Irish government to think again on the backstop.“The Withdrawal Agreement is not a fair deal and we cannot support it,” she said.“It should be no more acceptable to build a new east-west border than it is to build a new north-south border. The backstop is not needed. No-one is going to build a hard border. We will work with the government to reach a better deal for the United Kingdom but this will require more pragmatism from the European Union.”Mrs Foster added: “I trust the Irish government will reflect on our principled objections to the Withdrawal Agreement and recognise that there is a better way which can work for both the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom.”Michael Stone should serve six more years in prison, court toldNo legacy inquest for Poppy Day bomb victims Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Mr Coveney said EU leaders were happy to offer “clarication” around the backstop to help the prime minister get the deal over the line, but he has again made clear the substantive terms of the agreement could not be renegotiated.“If people are concerned about that, yes of course we are happy to look at ways in which we can provide clarication and reassurance...in terms of what is meant by that backstop, its temporary nature, and the fact it is only a fall-back, insurance mechanism in the first place anyway, that we hope to never use.”Sinn Fein vice-president Michelle O’Neill has urged the Irish government and other EU states to “hold firm” on retaining the backstop.“As this unfolds it is crucially important that the tanaiste and the Irish government continues to stand up for the people here in the north,” she said.try catch            ..

rejected Irish deputy premier Simon Coveney#s assertion that Dublin is not attempting to interfere in the affairs of Northern Ireland.The DUP MP’s remarks came just hours before he joined his party leader Arlene Foster for a meeting with Mr Coveney at Stormont today, with the discussion centring on the controversial Irish border backstop arrangements.Simon Coveney pictured talking to media in BelfastSpeaking ahead of a day of engagements in Belfast involving meetings with business and political leaders, Mr Coveney denied meddling in UK politics, insisting he has an obligation to challenge those “misrepresenting” what the Brexit deal contains.The Irish foreign minister said he does not have an anti-British bone in his body and wants to be a “candid friend” to the Republic’s closest neighbour.But East Londonderry MP Mr Campbell accused the Irish Government of being a major impediment to the Brexit process, claiming Dublin had been responsible for creating the “mythical monster” of the backstop.“Having now created that monster, they find that their own country is going to be the biggest loserthe backstop is implemented,” he added.Relations between the Irish Government and the DUP have frayed during the Brexit process, with the party accusing the Dublin administration of scaremongering over the threat of a hard border.Mr Coveney has been critical of Brexiteers who have claimed the backstop would undermine the constitutional integrity of the UK and bring a united Ireland a step closer by creating barriers between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.The DUP’s East Antrim MP Sammy Wilson has portrayed the border backstop as a “confidence trick” played by the Irish Government.Mr Coveney suggested that the views of ardent Brexiteer Mr Wilson were not reflective of broader unionism, highlighting the concerns raised by the farming community in Northern Ireland about the prospect of a no deal.“We may not be convincing Sammy Wilson but that is not the same as not convincing unionism,” he said.“I listen to farmers’ organisations in Northern Ireland make it very clear today that a no-deal Brexit needs to be avoided, yet I hear Sammy saying that a no-deal Brexit is something that can be managed.”In response, Mr Campbell urged Mr Coveney to “get off his high horse and get some humility”.Woman ‘caught urinating in Primark changing rooms’Speeding businessman was

told the News Letter: “He says he is not meddling, yet in the same breath he attempts to give an assessment as to who does or does not speak for the majority of unionists. He might want to try and reconcile those two things.“Can he find a section of political unionism that is backing this withdrawal deal  Yet he still protests that those who oppose this deal don’t speak for unionism.“Can you imagine how Mr Coveney and others would reactI was to say that the upcoming election in the Republic will show that Fine Gael do not speak for nationalism ”try catch            ..

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Initially under the baton of Clford Bunford and later conducted by Douglas Baxter, the choir performed many of the major works of the choral repertoire and several less well known works. Following Douglas retirement in , the choir began to suffer a decline in numbers, which led to a ersying of the repertoire.The choir was rebranded as Barry Community Choir in  and, under the leadership of conductor, Emma Arscott, the membership has begun to increase again.The choir meets in Crossway Church in Barry on Wednesday evenings and all are welcome to join. There are no auditions and no previous choir experience is needed.The concert saw many people turn up to enjoy the music alongside a iety of refreshments.Dafydd Jones, administrator of the Parish of All Saints Church and organiser of the Music at Lunchtime programme of concerts, said the concert was a great way to start the season.He said: \"An enjoyable time was had by all - audience and performers who have, by the way, expressed a willingness, nay an enthusiasm, to come back for amatch next year.\"After welcoming the audience and thanking them for their attendance, I introduced the Town Mayor, Cllr Jon Luxton who spoke briefly about Music at Lunchtime, the Barry Community Choir and All Saints Church also expressed a desire to come back for other concerts in the future.\"The choir performed a most enjoyable pot-pourri of songs from the shows amongst many others and ended up with a foot-tapping medley of World War One favourites. All in all, a heart-warming programme of music, appreciated by everyone.\"This yearrsquos autumn programme of recitals at All Saints Church continues throughout October and November with an exciting mix of vocal and instrumental soloists and ensembles.All Saints Church is accessible to the disabled and the elderly and also boasts creche facilities.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The site will potentially generate up to  new work positions across management, supervisory, warehousing staff and apprenticeship roles.Speaking of the new facility and what it will bring, Mr Rattenbury said: ldquoWe are delighted that our vision of a lsquoone stop shoprsquo for our customers is being realised and having a  hour, seven day a week co-packing facility in the heart of Wales, is a game changer for our industry. We can now offer our customers a streamlined product supply chain package by integrating their co-packing requirements with the grouprsquos warehouse and transport subsidiary companies.ldquoLogistically, this works out to be more cost effective overall, but also lowers the carbon footprint on the transportation of food products, which is something we are passionate about.Wild Water Group has a current annual turnover of poundm and Mr Rattenbury believes the company can increase that figure by a further poundm within  months and then reach poundm within two to three years.The project is backed by a pound. million investment from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking and the Development Bank of Wales and has secured Welsh Government funding under the new economic contract.Using a similar business model to the grouprsquos other three sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Llanishen and Cardf Bay, the first phase of development will be the conversion of available space into a large ambient open plan co-packing facility, which will be operational early November  to meet festive season demand.During the first quarter of , Wild Water Group will move the entire Cardf Bay co-packing facility to Aberbargoed, once freezer facilities, production lines and machinery are in place.The company will then continue services such as frozen to frozen storage, bagging, over wrapping, sleeving and tray sealing, as well as the full spectrum of print labelling applications required under the Food Safety Technicalspecications.Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ldquoThis project will not only see a successful, growing Welsh business create an additional  jobs, it will also create a new strategic hub and facility for both large and small food and drink businesses across the region to pack or store products themselves. This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

According to the latest Real Estate Outlook report from CBRE, there was take-up of , sq ft of office space across  transactions, in . It says that was more than double the figure a year earlier. Some of the major deals completing last year included PwC’s move to Merchant Square, the Northern Ireland Civil Service at  Lanyon Place and Allstate at Mays Meadow. “During an unsettling period of political uncertainty, the local office market is an indicator of the health of the Northern Ireland economy, with the professional services and technology sectors in particular leading the way,” Brian Lavery, managing director at CBRE said. “Currently we only have around , sq ft of grade A office space available fragmented across a number of buildings underpinning the need for more investment in this space. “Alongside this office space growth, we are also seeing the green shoots of demand for residential living in the city centre. We believe this is the trend to track in  and beyond as investors across the UK and globally continue to look for opportunities in this area. “However, on a more positive note, we are seeing strong interest from a wide spectrum of investors for office investments in Belfast which is being driven by growing rents and demand, combined with limited supply of high-quality accommodation.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/34453454454.jpg","title":"supporting belfast start ups on the rise","story":"Posted on Thursday January  by Ulster Business The UK’s digital tech sector has attracted more capital than any other European country and Belfast has established itself as a key hub, writes Roisin Byrne, business director, Hays Northern Ireland The  Tech Nation report makes it clear that digital tech makes an essential contribution to our local economy with clusters and start-ups forming primarily around AI , machine learning, cyber security and big data industries. The Belfast start-up community ecosystem is alive and well and has carved out a reputation in the wider tech community for having good access to talent, funding and transport links. It also benefits from great workspaces such as Ormeau Baths, Farset Labs and the Innovation Centre at Catalyst Inc. Indeed, the city is bubbling with entrepreneurial talent as demonstrated by the large number of start-ups which have launched in the last two years. Belfast boasts a disproportionate number of the UK’s high growth firms and it is estimated that the local ecosystem now supports around , jobs. Hays has worked with a number of these start-ups as they have scaled up operations – firms such as Analytics Engines, Uleska and Vox to name a few. As part of our commitment to the sector we’ve also taken space in Ormeau Baths which has become an epicentre for tech meet-ups, hackathons and pitch events. It’s also a campus for early stage and growth stage start-ups to network, share experience and build scalable, globally focussed businesses. In its first year, % of companies based in Ormeau Baths grew their teams and revenues, and raised over £m in venture funding. We’ve also launched a new national initiative called Super Connect delivered by Empact Ventures which aims to help tech start-ups and scale-ups to explore collaboration with large organisations and funding providers through a series of venture labs and pitch days. The initiative brings together corporates, SMEs, angel investors, venture capitalists, grant providers, loan funds and crowdfunding s to explore supporting these start-ups and scale-ups. Details can be found at www.superconnectseries. In an increasingly competitive marketplace Hays sees real value in the innovative ideas start-ups are using to network and build traction and as they scale up to the next stage we are providing material support and employer value branding to help them attract the talent they need.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/34344455.jpg","title":"delta air lines buying  new airbus jets","story":"Posted on Monday January  by Ulster Business US carrier Delta Air Lines is buying an additional  part-Belfast made passenger planes, it has emerged. The order for the Airbus A- jets – formerly Bombardier CSs before the firms agreed a tie-up – brings Delta’s order book to  planes. The latest deal could be worth as much as .bn, according to the book price. However its likely the sale price is signicantly less than that. The wings and signicant parts of the aircraft fuselage are made in Bombardier’s Belfast plant. \"Delta has always been deeply focused on the passenger experience, and the A fits perfectly with that philosophy,” Christian Scherer, Airbus chief commercial officer said. \"You just need to take a look at Delta’s cabin on the A to see it’s setting a new standard in short-haul flying. The A will provide passengers with a level of comfort and convenience that makes flying a pleasure again, while meeting Delta’s high standards for efficiency and reliability.” Gil West, Delta’s chief operating officer, said: “These additional A aircraft will continue to strategically enable Delta to refresh our fleet, drive further advances in the customer experience and serve as an excellent investment for our customers, employees and shareowners for Delta into the next decade. “We look forward to taking our first A- in  at the Airbus assembly facility in Mobile, Alabama.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
