I’ve got a really good friend that my husband introduced me to who is a painter in Scotland. So now we’re going to do cards with paintings on them. And calendars. Diaries.’She added that she had been ‘blessed with a kind of doggedness’ which always left her striving to achieve more.Miss Leith also took the opportunity to criticise 12-course tasting menus, describing them as ‘irritating’.‘When I was on the Great British Menu I had to bottle it sometimes because I would become so irritated at all the drizzles and foams and jellies and glazes, little lollipops of crackling,’ she said.         During the talk she wore a blue blouse, yellow jacket and colourful glasses – a nod to her vivid fashion sense‘Sometimes chefs just fall in love with the kit they’ve got. They’ve got these machines, you know water baths and drizzle things and cappuccino frothers and dehydrators and powder makers. They forget that what really matters with food is flavour and texture.‘Of course some of those things are great, and some of them taste wonderful but by and large a plate of food should not have more than four or five tastes max on it.‘If you put too many different tastes, your tastebuds can’t cope. You know you give children a palette of paints to paint with. If they mix them all together, guess what they get – a brown mud and it is the same with too many flavours, you get something that doesn’t taste of anything. I don’t like too much of that. I like the flavours to be crisp and separate and clean and fresh.’The much-loved restaurateur also said that despite her expertise, she sometimes has to rely on the help of others.‘I have to say that a whole lot of people came yesterday round my garden to have tea and cake and I just did not have time to make cake for 40 people,’ she said.‘So I went off to the Co-op and bought Mary Berry cake. Delicious, really good. I sometimes think, ‘Why does anybody make cake?’ when you can buy hers.’When asked if she was still in touch with Mary Berry, she replied: ‘We’re quite good friends.’Miss Leith joined The Great British Bake Off in March 2017, replacing Mary Berry when the series moved to Channel 4. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/11/25/14/6616864-0-image-a-26_1543156270764.jpg","title":"Joan Bakewell 86 refuses condemn elderly drinkers asked present topic","story":"Share this article The Labour peer explained: ‘I was invited to do a Panorama programme about the fact older people were drinking too much, would I present it?

Her father was the first Orkney man to have been killed in the Great War. Her little farm was a clutter of buildings marooned in fields of cows. The sandstone was patterned with lichen and pitted with years of weathering.On the main building, two bright steel buckets hung, either side of the door, full of rainwater from the guttering. This was the only running water that the house possessed, and much more convenient than hauling up buckets from the well.Stepping through the doorway was like walking through a wardrobe into Narnia. The kitchen was virtually bare, with the exception of a black-leaded range cooker set in a wall of blue and cream tiles.Peat burned in the grate and the room was smoky with the scent of burning heather. The only light filtered through two tiny windows. A heavy porcelain sink with no taps hung beneath one of the windows. A single plate, cup and spoon were drying on the wooden draining board.There was no fridge, no washing machine, no appliances of any kind . . . because there was no electricity.A small voice answered my calls, but it took me a moment to realise that it came from behind a brocaded curtain next to the range. Pulling this back, I discovered a recess with a box bed and, peering warily at me from under layers of covers, a tiny woman with her face and arms dyed oily brown from a lifetime of working with peat.She told me her back was bad. Reaching into the recess I tried to examine her, but it was almost impossible to get near enough.Eventually, I climbed over the wooden threshold into the bed itself and knelt on the sea of blankets. ‘I was born in this bed,’ she told me. ‘My father was the blacksmith on this farm, and I’ve never lived anywhere else.’Clambering out, I gave her some strong painkillers and turned to go. On an oval table under a window I noticed a Tilley lamp, and remarked that I had just acquired one.‘I know,’ retorted Ina. ‘It was Nessie’s father’s old one, and she had no use for it.’ With that she disappeared under the blankets.How did a bedridden woman who lived alone in a farmhouse surrounded by cows know what an equally elderly woman had given to me as a welcome gift only the day before?I’ve come to accept that on Eday, everybody knows everything as soon as it happens.Certainly the seal rescue centre had heard all about my latest patient by the time I placed it in an improvised hospital bed in the shed next to our house, wrapped in a blanket and warmed by a 200-watt light bulb. Its thick, bristly whiskers were twitching with fear and its snout was dripping with mucus, what we used to call a ‘snottery beak’ when I was a schoolboy in the Scottish Borders.A vet at the centre tells me over the phone the pup probably has a distemper virus or ‘seal flu’ and asks me to take its temperature. As I ponder how to stick a glass rod up a seal’s bottom, the voice at the other end of the line is issuing urgent instructions on how to make sure the animal doesn’t get dehydrated — by feeding fluids through a tube.‘The best medicine is herring broth,’ says the vet. ‘You need four or five herring made into a watery soup, perhaps with a little oatmeal, and feed it around a pint and a half every four hours. Through the night. You’re doing a grand job, Doc.’I set my alarm for midnight, 4am and 8am, to administer herring broth. My chief memory of that night is standing over a hissing seal pup, half-dressed by the orange light of a storm lantern, in a shed, while a gale blows outside and my wife stares steadily at me with an eyebrow raised.She doesn’t need to say anything to make her views clear. We reach silent agreement that we’re completely bonkers and carry on.Next day, to our relief, we were able to hand the pup over to the seal rescue centre.But it didn’t take long for word to get around that my medical training could be put to use for animals, and I got a phone call from a farmer who wondered if it wouldn’t be too much trouble for me to nip over and do a caesarean section on a cow.He was serious: calling the vet from the mainland might cost more than the combined value of the cow and her unborn calf. When an animal gets into difficulties during birth, the only economical solution is sometimes to shoot the poor beast. I understood his dilemma, but the answer was still ‘no’.That was far from the strangest request I’ve had . . . and some simply couldn’t be refused. Soon after my visit to bedridden Ina, I had a call from her friend Jenny: would I mind coming out to see her husband Tom, who was ‘going down with one of his colds’ — and while I was there, she had another matter to discuss.Neither Jenny nor Tom was more than 5ft tall and, standing in their bedroom crammed with Fifties curios and ornaments was like finding myself in a doll’s house furnished by an elderly kleptomaniac. There was nothing very much wrong with Tom that his asthma inhaler wouldn’t cure, which made me slightly concerned about the ‘other matter’. And I was right to be.‘Nessie and Ina were pleased with the way you looked after them,’ Jenny declares. ‘And Ann the Post says your boys are right polite when they come into the shop for their comics.‘I’m glad to see you’re in church of a Sunday, aren’t you? Good, so that’s settled. Our minister is going to be away for a while, so you can lead the services from now on, you being educated and all that.’And that’s it. The ‘other matter’ is settled. From now on, I’m reading the sermon. I won’t have to write it, thank goodness, because medical training might stretch to seals, but it certainly doesn’t cover theology.A sermon will be sent each week for me to read aloud. As I leave Jenny’s little house, it occurs to me that I and my family have been vetted and approved by the community without ever being aware this was happening.The following Sunday, I lead worship in the large, stone-grey church on the hillside, with its golden-brown lacquered doors and its eight enormous plain glass windows, shining down on row after row of polished cedar pews.There is seating for at least 300 parishioners: when the church was built, there were more than 600 islanders, five times as many as today.I check with Tommy, the organist, that he has the right hymns, and he explains that a field mouse has chewed a hole in the bellows. The air leak means he must pump much harder when he plays. This worries me, since Tommy suffers from angina, but he has the solution: a glyceryl trinitrate tablet, which he sucks between hymns.He can’t swallow a whole one, he adds cheerfully, because they give him a headache. I can’t scold him: I prescribed the tablets, after all.In the pulpit, I unfold the sermon sent from the mainland and begin to read: ‘Verily, I say unto thee, inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me . . .’ Oh dear. I read on: ‘For where thou must aspire to dwell with the seraphim . . .’It appears the author of the sermon was born in 1853. But I’m stuck with these words, and nobody seems to object.As the nights got colder, ice on the roads became a problem. Cars started to slide onto verges, especially after I attended one minor accident and gave the occupants of the car a lift home.There was a danger this could become a habit, until I had a brainwave: I let it be known that from then on I would be billing the driver’s insurance company for my call-out fee, and that furthermore I was duty-bound to report all accidents to the police.There were no more cars stranded on verges.I doubt I’d have had much luck with the insurers. On my rounds one morning in January, I noticed there was no traffic on the roads. When I pulled in at the pump to fill up with fuel, I noticed two men standing by the kiosk, their chequered police hats just visible.I asked at the shop whether the police were the reason the roads were clear. ‘Aye, it’s not long before word gets around that they’re here to check the road tax and insurance. We didn’t tell you, with you being official and all. We knew your car would be fine, Doc.’ That was a double-edged compliment. I was not yet ‘one of us’.But I was becoming more part of the community all the time, especially after Maggie developed complications during her pregnancy with our fifth child and had to spend six weeks in hospital on the mainland before the birth — leaving me to look after four lively boys. When we brought Megan home, she was truly an Eday baby and we were an Eday family.One of the ways this became apparent was in the system of barter that covered the prescription charge. For some, this was difficult to pay, so I started paying their fees myself. In return, plastic bags appeared, hanging on the kitchen door: three cabbages at the lower end of the scale, fresh lobster at the upper end. The system worked so well the boys soon expected lobster for tea.I chose not to go into the pulpit for the Christmas Eve service after Megan arrived. She was asleep in my arms, and I was afraid I’d wake her if I read aloud. A sleeping baby takes precedence over everything at a Christmas service, naturally.Afterwards, a triumphant Jenny served hot drinks and home-made mince pies, kept hot on the strategically placed paraffin stoves. There was enough for all 50 folk who came.As they melted into the night, the sky behind the little church cleared of cloud. A deep velvet blackness fell, touching the sea. Blackness broken not by starlight but clothed in ribbons of luminous green and yellow light streaming across the horizon, and the air came alive with the shimmering tingle of sound.Many people have seen the Merry Dancers — the Northern Lights — some not knowing what they are. Few, very few, have heard the electric beat of the solar winds.

Sometimes it is unnamed in other cases only the name of the plant manager was given.\u0027KCNA said Kim called for a \u0027higher modernization plan\u0027 for the factory, while he watched a range of daily necessaries being produced.

Their destruction, fuelled by rampant consumption and obsession with economic growth, is accelerating.“The evidence is crystal clear: nature is in trouble. Therefore we are in trouble,” declared Sandra Díaz, who co-chaired the completion of a global assessment of bioersity published this week.There is a dual threat to life on Earth: species loss and climate change. The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Bioersity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) ranked the main factors causing species loss: changes in land and sea use exploitation of organisms climate change pollution and invasive alien species.These are “eroding the foundations of our economies, livelihoods, food security, health and quality of life worldwide”, and climate breakdown could soon become the main driver.Nature is being destroyed at such a rate that a million species are at risk. On the day the IPBES report made headlines, Dr Allan Mee of the Golden Eagle Trust checked for sightings of the Ring Ouzel in the MacGillycuddy’s Reeks in Co Kerry, one of just two of its remaining habitats in Ireland. “No birds located. Sad but likely witnessing local extinction of the species, once found in 28 Irish counties,” he tweeted. Pádraic Fogarty of the Irish Wildlife Trust replied: “This is mass extinction unfolding before our eyes.”How is the potentially lethal cocktail of bioersity loss and climate disruption going to impact on coming generations in contrasting parts of the globe? Equally, what does it mean for an animal that dominates the Irish landscape (the cow), and the majestic lion, not critically endangered yet rapidly disappearing?The baby born in IrelandConscious of what the next generation is facing, Australian Jim Scheer helped set up the FridaysForFuture climate action movement in Ireland, which is driven by young people. As for the babies of today, “their freedom is limited”, he believes. As a child, “the most I had to worry about was, ‘is there air in the tyres of my bike?’” he says.They are facing a whole different world of realities, a place where the First World problem of “where will I go on my holidays?” may be replaced by “where is my next meal coming from?”The issues weigh heavily on the current generation of young people, he believes, which is why “coming together to grieve” – a feature of recent protests – matters, and is part of telling the truth. There is much frustration too at the inaction of elders.“Uncertain” is the future of that child, says climate activist Dr Lorna Gold. Hope is emerging through the climate movement but, looking at the timelines required for transformational shift, there is “more and more uncertainty”.Children growing up in Ireland will be relatively protected, by location, wealth and assets they will have access to, “but even in the best-case scenario, it will be a diminished world.”This will be due to loss of species and a more complicated world, disrupted by climate and associated conflict, where Dr Gold fears the freedom to explore and travel in relative peace is undermined. It’s a place of learning from the internet rather than real life. The pluses will be better local connectedness with “their own earth” and nearby food production.That Irish child will never hear the corncrake or the curlew, says climatologist Prof John Sweeney, and, as they grow, they will be confronted with hard choices on lifestyle and mobility. The fossil fuel-driven car will be forced out by regulation, he says, but different ways of getting off the island, for example, will be needed if aviation does not overcome its emissions issues.By mid-century, most will live in green cities with an almost total absence of the private car. The transport revolution will be in urban areas but slower to come to the countryside until battery technology improves, Sweeney notes.A near zero-carbon world will mean less air pollution. Clean energy in their home and workplace will mainly come from offshore wind.A downside will be more extreme weather events attributable to climate change more intense storms and rainfall, increased flooding with sea level rises – and yet water shortages in summer.The child born today in Ireland – and the adult they become – will cope far better than their counterpart elsewhere.The developing world babyA baby born today in a developing country, on the other hand, will be at the frontline of climate disruption, says Christian Aid Ireland policy and advocacy adviser Jennifer Higgins. They will have to contend with stronger cyclones, warmer days and nights, more unpredictable rains and longer heatwaves.“Here in Ireland we will have the resources and ability to adapt and deal with these unprecedented weather events, but in many parts of the world, going to Tesco to stock up on sliced pan won’t be a possibility.”They will be the ones who will suffer the worst consequences of our inaction on climate change. “Sustained periods of unseasonably heavy rain can have a damaging impact on agriculture, causing the loss of topsoil and serious nutrient leaching,” says Higgins.In Ireland, save for the odd hosepipe ban, water is always on tap for domestic, industrial and agricultural use. “But in the developing world, where most people depend on agriculture to earn a living or just stay alive, it’s a scarce and precious resource.”Those living in coastal regions will suffer a loss of coral reefs, which half a billion people rely on for fish. For those born among indigenous communities in tropical rainforests, not only will they lose their homeland – already being eroded by increasing industrialisation – but there will be loss of habitat that acts as the lungs of the earth and regulates rainfall.Children will be most susceptible to the increasing diseases that a changing climate will leave in its wake, she adds. Their education may be disrupted when schools are used as shelters when disaster hits their communities.If temperatures increase in already hot areas, it will diminish scarce resources to sustain life and will force many to become refugees.But this may “dwarf numbers caused by conflict or political and economic necessity. When their land becomes uninhabitable because of drought, flood or sea-level rise, they will have to seek a safer place to live,” Higgins predicts.It may be a world where techniques such as conservation agriculture transform crop production and smartphone technology helps drive rural economies backed by deployment of cheap solar PV. But extreme weather events will continue to threaten food production, as seen with recent cyclones in southern Africa.Gold fears a business-as-usual approach means such circumstances can become an intractable problem very quickly, and says solutions are beyond most communities on cost grounds. Therefore the child is facing increased malnutrition, chronic hunger, dependency on external aid, and political instability – an existence marked by inequality and injustice.The IPBES report starkly outlines how indigenous peoples and the poorest are most reliant on land and sea for survival. The combination of land grabs by multinationals facilitated by corrupt governments, extreme climate events and bioersity loss add up to a very bleak future for their offspring, Gold concludes.The future of the cow Humans are not the only beings whose lives will change. The IPBES report emphasises that the effects will be felt first among animals and other living things.In Ireland, there are currently more cattle than people, and they are the most common large animal. For many, the cow (for beef and milk) is the bellwether of Irish agriculture and rural life. For others, it’s the problem because of associated carbon emissions.Teagasc’s head of communications, Eric Donald, says cattle numbers are currently a matter for inidual farmers. With no quotas, no policy instruments are in place. In future we are likely to have fewer beef and more dairy cattle.On emissions, Donald says there is wide acceptance of the need to implement mitigation measures – a process is already in train.Having a grass-based system to feed those cattle will be critical to sustainable farms from an environmental, economic and social perspective, Donald adds. Ireland will need to find export markets for 80 to 90 per cent of its product. Meat consumption may decrease on an inidual basis and there may be a shift to plant-based diets, but increased population growth will mean “demand won’t drop significantly”.But cattle will have to compete for space due to a more erse range of crops, land being used for bioenergy and afforestation (increasingly native woodlands and not just on marginal land) that will act as important carbon sinks, and hedgerows ensuring better bioersity and pollinator capacity.To question beef consumption may currently be an Irish “no-no”, but the reality is the consumers of tomorrow will be confronted by a wide range of new plant and synthetic proteins that will taste surprisingly good and be cheaper, which is likely to mean less red meat is consumed – in line with health guidelines.Eric Donald defends the pursuit of higher genetic quality as a means of increasing efficiency and lowering emissions, especially “because lifetime productivity is better”. With extending grazing seasons, it’s the key measure in improving farm sustainability guidelines. It also complements changes in fertiliser use and slurry management.But John Sweeney says the Irish cow is “reaching limits in terms of genetics”. Like pedigree dogs, they are less able to cope with change and stress compared with native species.Unquestionably, there will be fewer of them, he believes, “if we want to maintain bioersity for future generations”.Expansion in the cattle population has coincided with deterioration in water quality, with widespread glyphosate contamination (one study has found 20 per cent of Irish adults have traces of the herbicide in their urine), nitrates pollution and an emerging ammonia problem.“Continued expansion of the national herd is not compatible with this report. That’s where the crux comes.”The future of the lionJennifer Higgins joins in a lament for so many endangered mammals.Of all species threatened, IWT campaign officer Pádraic Fogarty is shocked by the latest indicators for hippos, giraffes and lions. In particular, “it would be an absolutely travesty if lions were to go extinct . . . The magnificent animal has permeated our culture and imagination, from children’s stories to the pillars on Trafalgar Square.”But maps don’t lie. In 1950 there were 400,000 lions in the wild. Today there are 23,000-39,000 lions in all of Africa, which is “extremely low” in global terms, when once they lived in Ancient Greece and North Africa, and became extinct in Greece only around 100BC.Outside of southern Africa, numbers of lions in 23 unfenced reserves in 11 countries are estimated to have dropped by 62 per cent between 1993 and 2014. Asia is home to a small subpopulation in the Indian state of Gujarat, where numbers are growing, but it’s just a pin on the globe.“There is no data to say that lions are about to disappear, but their populations are shrinking fast,” he explains. The species is classified as vulnerable but the slide into the “endangered” and then “critically endangered” categories looms, while “threatened with extinction” is applied to its current status.For Fogarty, the same pressures apply to other mammals, but the lion’s wellbeing is further undermined by gametrophy hunting and false western-world notions that it is somehow good for population numbers. All told, we are facing a scenario where lions will “shrink to a few corners of the planet”.What to doThis is not going to be sorted by putting bird tables in back gardens. The Ipbes report shows nature-based solutions can help bring “transformative change”, but there is a greater systemic problem.In the past 50 years, the human population has doubled, the global economy has grown nearly four-fold, and global trade has grown tenfold, together driving up the demands for energy, food and materials.Thinking that endless economic growth is possible and not valuing the essential services provided by nature is a delusion leading to catastrophe, Sweeney believes.“Until we get away from euros and cents and GDP, we will be in a cul-de-sac . . . Unless we rethink how we value the services provided by the natural world and include them explicitly in a wellbeing measure, we delude ourselves that a sustainable future is possible.”That was the core message in a submission this week to EU leaders meeting on the future of Europe by the European Environmental Bureau (EEB) and more than 200 academics, including John Sweeney, policy experts and civil society groups.There is an onus too on iniduals to act, according to EEB vice president Attracta Uí Bhroin. “It’s not enough for us to sit on the sofa and watch David Attenborough’s latest breathtaking and terrifying documentary and shake our heads. Every politician coming near your front door needs to know environmental sustainability is your priority, and must be Europe’s priority.”Fogarty hopes people now see the connections between climate breakdown and mass extinction, that they are two sides of the same coin. “We have all of the solutions to hand, but what we’ve been lacking is any sense of urgency to get on with it.”He senses momentum moving in the right direction, though the lack of a response from the Taoiseach or any Government minister “makes me feel that they are still hoping it’s an issue that will go away. We can’t really afford this level of disengagement when we need to be getting on with things.”Scheer is brutally frank about future voters born today. “I don’t think people get a choice of what games they play.”They will have to be focused on survival. “It feels as we have handed them a shitstorm.”As for the current generation, too many are stuck in business-as-usual mode. There is a need to raise consciousness quickly. “Ignorance is not a choice” given the IPBES report. “It’s not an opinion, it’s scientific. It’s happening.”Kevin O\u0027Sullivan is Environment and Science Editor and former Editor of The "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3909756.1559226507!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"new to politics hazel chu jackie healy rae jnr and others on their political ambitions","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tJackie Healy-Rae jnr takes a break from canvassing to visit his grandfather Jackie’s grave in Kilgarvan, Co Kerry.

should build mini ponds old kitchen sinks save frogs","story":"Kate Bradbury (pictured) said hedgehogs love her pondGardeners should build mini ponds out of old kitchen sinks to save Britain’s frogs, newts and toads, a Springwatch presenter has said.Kate Bradbury is presenting a new segment of the BBC nature show, called Gardenwatch, and in it she is experimenting with making her own wildlife garden, which viewers can track in real time week to week.In her garden, she has a wildlife pond. She told the Sunday : “I think hands down a pond is the most important thing you can do for wildlife. It had an instant impact.  “It has only been in five weeks and I’m already seeing a huge difference.“I have three different types of beetle, it’s quite early on so I haven’t identified them all yet.“The bees are using the mud from around the edge of the pond to line their nests.“Hedgehogs have been drinking from it as have sparrows, blackbirds and crows, all types of bird. It’s actually so busy by the pond that the birds have trampled the grass I have tried to grow around the edge!”According to conservationists, the number of ponds in Britain has halved since the 1950s, which has been catastrophic for wildlife, especially amphibians. To counteract this, British people have been asked to provide water for wildlife in their gardens.This is, Ms Bradbury said, as easy as lining an old Belfast sink, filling it with water and adding appropriate plants to oxygenate it. It can be dug into a flowerbed, or stood proudly on a patio with a makeshift ladder so frogs can hop in and out.She said: “I think all water in the garden can make a difference. If you make an effort it is worth it- the bigger the pond, the more species you will see.“However if you’re short on time and space, old Belfast sinks can make nice ponds as patio ponds or you can dig them into your garden.“Ponds really are so important because frogs, toads and newts are all declining. They don’t have to be.Old baths and sinks can make great ponds - make sure there is a ramp so frogs can hop in“All you need to do is get a container and put water and a few plants in it and that will help save the species.”The Wildlife Trust and the RHS have also started a “Wild about Ponds” campaign to show you don’t have to have a large garden to help frogs.During the campaign, people have made ponds out of sinks, buckets and baths in their gardens, including removable options for rented accommodation.Helen Bostock, Senior Horticultural Advisor at the RHS said that for a mini pond, ideal oxygenating plants include a miniature waterlily, starwort (Callitriche stagnalis) and lesser spearwort (Ranunculus flammula).Eden Jackson, the pond champion at The Wildlife Trusts told the Sunday : “Sadly, over the years, a lot of ponds, rivers and streams have disappeared. Often the land where they used to be has been built upon or the water drained out of it due to farming. Because of this many of the animals that rely on ponds have nowhere to live.“But all is not lost! There is a lot we can do in our own gardens or outdoor spaces to help and encourage a whole range of visiting wildlife. People are telling us how birds use their ponds to drink and bathe, and have spotted everything from tiny insects to thirsty bees enjoying the water!”You can watch Springwatch at 7:30pm on BBC TwoTips from the Wildlife Trust on how to make a pond Don’t think you have enough space? Think again. Why not create a container pond?  Be creative. You can make a mini container pond from anything from an old washing-up bowl to a sunk in bucket or basin.  Fill up your pond with rainwater. Tap water can contain unhelpful chemicals.  Think native. Plants are an important part of any pond and using native plants helps local wildlife thrive. Don’t transfer species such as plants and frogspawn from one pond to the next. This can spread disease.  Make sure wildlife can get in and out. Add a ramp or sloping edge and build up the bottom of your pond with rocks and stones so that hedgehogs and other animals don’t get stuck. Someone tweeted us to say that he had created a paving slab ramp for his  Leave the fish. Fish can pollute the water and eat other plants and animals so it’s best not to add them in. And that way you’ll get more frogs and newts!  Plant up the areas around your pond. This will create cover for all sorts of animals like frogs, birds and hedgehogs.

If so, you’d be wise to keep it to yourself if you’d like to join the Army. According to a Ministry of Defence leaflet leaked last week, describing oneself as a patriot is one of the behavioural signs which might mark you out as a Right-wing extremist. It’s the second time in a fortnight that I have stumbled over the condemnation of patriotism – the first being when Jean-Claude Juncker, the President of the EU Commission, lashed out at those “who are in love with their own countries” in a CNN interview.Mr Juncker’s judgment has never inspired much confidence in me but I found the MoD leaflet harder to shake off.

Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Phantom Thread has all the trappings of a conventional period romance. Daniel Day-Lewis plays Reynolds Woodcock, a famous dressmaker who falls in love with Alma (Vicky Krieps), a waitress who later becomes his muse. Paul Thomas Anderson’s twisted romance flies off in some psychologically dark and unexpected directions, but the arc is that of a storybook love affair, of two people taking extraordinary measures to hold onto the one they love.Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga scored big at the box office with last year’s A Star is Born remake, but for many, the definitive version was released nearly 65 years earlier. James Mason plays the alcoholic actor whose career is on the wane, while Judy Garland is the supremely talented up-and-coming singer he meets in a nightclub. Although there were two other major screen versions of the story – one in 1937, the other in 1976 starring Barbara Streisand and Kris Kristofferson – Garland boasts the strongest singing voice of any, and her chemistry with Mason is superb.In this futuristic romance, Joaquin Phoenix plays a man who falls in love with an artificially intelligent computer system, voiced by Scarlett Johannsson. Her – written and directed by Spike Jonze – treats Phoenix\u0027s courtship with all the sensitivity of a flesh-and-blood romance, and what could be a cringe-worthy or facetious premise instead blossoms into a touchingly sincere examination of love in the age of technology.This romcom from 1999 brings Hugh Grant’s down-to-earth bookshop owner into the orbit of an A-list actress played by Julia Roberts, and the unlikeliest of British love affairs ensues. Scripted by Richard Curtis, who had already proved himself a dab hand in the genre with Four Weddings and a Funeral, the film manages to stay charming and keep its tone light, even as its romantic plotline descends into schmaltz.True Romance has an all-star cast that includes Gary Oldman, Dennis Hopper, Brad Pitt and James Gandolfini, but eyes are mostly kept on the whirlwind romance struck up between Clarence and Alabama (played by Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette), who go on the run with a suitcase full of cocaine belonging to a notorious gangster. Quentin Tarantino’s script wades through some heavy subject matter, and includes plenty of his characteristic violence, underscored by an effective score from Hans Zimmer.620 Harold and Maude (1971)Age-gap relationships are common in cinema, but seldom like in Harold and Maude. Harold (Bud Cort) is an 18-year-old with an overbearing mother who spends his free time staging elaborate fake suicides. After meeting Maude (Ruth Gordon), a 79-year-old woman trying to grab life by the horns, he falls in love. Hal Ashby’s off-beat cult classic doesn’t shy away from the social taboos of their relationship, but make no mistake, Harold and Maude is an earnest and deeply moving romance at its core.720 Beauty and the Beast (1991)The classic French fairy-tale – about the love between a beautiful woman and a prince cursed to live as a beast – has been adapted countless times, most recently into a live-action blockbuster starring Emma Watson. Disney’s 1991 animated musical, however, is the superior on-screen rendering of the romance. Although elements of the story now seem problematic – most glaringly the idea of the Beast imprisoning Belle, and she loving him despite this – there\u0027s still a lot of appeal in the songs, and the hand-drawn animation is fluid and endearing.Positioning three of Old Hollywood’s most beloved stars at the corners of a love triangle, The Philadelphia Story is one of the most enduring romcoms of all time. Navigating its way around the strict Production Code rules regarding extra-marital affairs, George Cukor’s film tells the story of a orced couple (Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant) who are drawn back together despite the allure of a third party (Jimmy Stewart). All three actors play to their strengths: Grant is suave and sardonic, Stewart wide-eyed and self-effacing, while Hepburn is given a strong role in the woman who must choose between her capable suitors.In Carol, Cate Blanchett plays Carol Aird, a woman in the midst of a difficult orce who falls in love with a young photographer, Therese, played by Rooney Mara. The film – a sexy and stylish period piece directed by Todd Haynes – won a host of Oscar nominations, and stands as one of the most specific and deftly crafted representations of female desire in mainstream cinema, earning a particularly devoted fanbase in the LGBTQ community.The highest-grossing French-language film of all time in the US, Amélie is a modern-day fairy-tale about a socially maladjusted young woman who decides to dedicate her life to impishly and secretly helping others. The film leans into the tweeness of its premise, as well as the romance of its Parisian setting, to build a gradual love story that’s straight from the heart. It’s not all sweetness, however, and some of the more world-weary touches – such as Amélie’s lover working in a sex shop – help give the film some sharp edges, and a comic bite.Ang Lee’s Brokeback Mountain stars Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger as two sheep herders who go through a turbulent but passionate romance. The film’s open and unapologetic depiction of sex and queer relationships made it a landmark release for LGBT representation in mainstream cinema.Directed by Frank Capra, master of the feel-good film, It Happened One Night mixes screwball comedy with heartfelt romance. Claudette Colbert plays a wealthy socialite who decides to slum it with an abrasive but charismatic news reporter, played by Clark Gable. One of only three films to ever win all five major Oscars (Best Picture, Director, Actor, Actress and Screenplay), It Happened One Night endures as the gold standard for a classical Hollywood romcom.1320 Call Me by Your Name (2017)Set in an Edenic villa “somewhere in Northern Italy”, Call Me by Your Name tells the story of Elio (Timothée Chalamet), a smart but directionless 17-year-old who falls in love with his father’s research assistant Oliver (Armie Hammer). Luca Guadagnino’s languid romance is well on its way to being considered a modern queer classic and it made an instant star out of Chalamet when it hit cinemas in 2017.Richard Linklater’s minimalist romance pairs Ethan Hawke with Julie Delpy as two love-struck strangers who meet on a train and spend the evening together wandering around Vienna. The naturally romantic city is the perfect background for a soft and thoughtful meditation on love, fate and missed opportunities. Hawke and Delpy reportedly crafted much of the naturalistic dialogue through improvisation sessions, for which they were uncredited. They would, however, be credited in the film’s two sequels – Before Sunset (2004) and Before Midnight (2013).2016 Best Picture winner Moonlight is a radical film: a queer romance with an all-black cast that captures a boy’s coming-of-age with heart-wrenching specificity. Chiron, the protagonist, is played by three actors across three chapters of his life – and the third act, in which an adult Chiron (Trevante Rhodes) reconnects with an old flame, is one of the most heart-rending in modern cinema. Writer-director Barry Jenkins showed himself to have a poet’s ear for dialogue and James Laxton’s camerawork perfectly captures the vibrancy and the physicality of romantic attraction.1620 In the Mood for Love (2000)One of the most acclaimed pieces of Asian cinema of all time, In the Mood for Love is a masterful study in love behind closed doors, tracking the emotional affair between two people who realise their spouses are having an affair together. Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung are exceptional in the lead roles as two soulmates struggling to contain their desire. In 2016, the film was voted the second-best film of the 21st century in a BBC critics poll.David Lean’s tender depiction of an unconsummated extra-marital affair remains one of the finest love stories ever told, and frequently ranks among the best British films ever made. Adapted from Noel Coward’s one-act play Still Life, Brief Encounter focuses on the relationship between Laura Jesson (Celia Johnson) and Dr Alec Harvey (Trevor Howard). Their courtship is bookended by two fateful scenes at a train station – once meeting, once parting. It’s hard to estimate how many hundreds of on-screen romances have ended with a teary-eyed lover being carried away on a train, but none have done so as memorably as Brief Encounter.When Harry Met Sally took Annie Hall’s subversion of the romcom genre and removed the neuroses and pseudo-intellectualism. The result was a breezy, observational romantic comedy starring Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan as two unlikely lovers. Screenwriter Nora Ephron based much of the film on its eventual director, Rob Reiner. When Harry Met Sally would become a massive hit, spawning an iconic catchphrase (“I’ll have what she’s having”) and even a stage adaptation in 2004.Jack Lemmon plays bedraggled corporate yes-man CC Baxter, who falls in love with elevator operator Fran Kubelik (Shirley MacLaine), who is also his boss’s mistress. The 1960 masterpiece, directed by Billy Wilder, is equal parts cynical and romantic, and features one of the most compelling will-they-won\u0027t-theys in the history of cinema.The romance of Casablanca has resonated throughout the 20th century. Its dialogue is among the most-quoted in film history and its locations – the piano bar the airfield – are indelible pieces of Hollywood iconography. Humphrey Bogart is the perfect romantic lead as Rick Blaine, the bitter, lovelorn club owner in French-occupied Morocco whose ex-lover Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman) arrives with her new flame Victor Laszlow (Paul Henreid), who is wanted by the Nazis. Casablanca has been mimicked and parodied so many times throughout the years that it’s easy to forget quite how inventive it is in its depiction of a love affair torn apart by the brutality of the outside world.Phantom Thread has all the trappings of a conventional period romance. Daniel Day-Lewis plays Reynolds Woodcock, a famous dressmaker who falls in love with Alma (Vicky Krieps), a waitress who later becomes his muse. Paul Thomas Anderson’s twisted romance flies off in some psychologically dark and unexpected directions, but the arc is that of a storybook love affair, of two people taking extraordinary measures to hold onto the one they love.Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga scored big at the box office with last year’s A Star is Born remake, but for many, the definitive version was released nearly 65 years earlier.

Hal Ashby’s off-beat cult classic doesn’t shy away from the social taboos of their relationship, but make no mistake, Harold and Maude is an earnest and deeply moving romance at its core.720 Beauty and the Beast (1991)The classic French fairy-tale – about the love between a beautiful woman and a prince cursed to live as a beast – has been adapted countless times, most recently into a live-action blockbuster starring Emma Watson. Disney’s 1991 animated musical, however, is the superior on-screen rendering of the romance. Although elements of the story now seem problematic – most glaringly the idea of the Beast imprisoning Belle, and she loving him despite this – there\u0027s still a lot of appeal in the songs, and the hand-drawn animation is fluid and endearing.Positioning three of Old Hollywood’s most beloved stars at the corners of a love triangle, The Philadelphia Story is one of the most enduring romcoms of all time. Navigating its way around the strict Production Code rules regarding extra-marital affairs, George Cukor’s film tells the story of a orced couple (Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant) who are drawn back together despite the allure of a third party (Jimmy Stewart). All three actors play to their strengths: Grant is suave and sardonic, Stewart wide-eyed and self-effacing, while Hepburn is given a strong role in the woman who must choose between her capable suitors.In Carol, Cate Blanchett plays Carol Aird, a woman in the midst of a difficult orce who falls in love with a young photographer, Therese, played by Rooney Mara. The film – a sexy and stylish period piece directed by Todd Haynes – won a host of Oscar nominations, and stands as one of the most specific and deftly crafted representations of female desire in mainstream cinema, earning a particularly devoted fanbase in the LGBTQ community.The highest-grossing French-language film of all time in the US, Amélie is a modern-day fairy-tale about a socially maladjusted young woman who decides to dedicate her life to impishly and secretly helping others. The film leans into the tweeness of its premise, as well as the romance of its Parisian setting, to build a gradual love story that’s straight from the heart. It’s not all sweetness, however, and some of the more world-weary touches – such as Amélie’s lover working in a sex shop – help give the film some sharp edges, and a comic bite.Ang Lee’s Brokeback Mountain stars Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger as two sheep herders who go through a turbulent but passionate romance. The film’s open and unapologetic depiction of sex and queer relationships made it a landmark release for LGBT representation in mainstream cinema.Directed by Frank Capra, master of the feel-good film, It Happened One Night mixes screwball comedy with heartfelt romance. Claudette Colbert plays a wealthy socialite who decides to slum it with an abrasive but charismatic news reporter, played by Clark Gable. One of only three films to ever win all five major Oscars (Best Picture, Director, Actor, Actress and Screenplay), It Happened One Night endures as the gold standard for a classical Hollywood romcom.1320 Call Me by Your Name (2017)Set in an Edenic villa “somewhere in Northern Italy”, Call Me by Your Name tells the story of Elio (Timothée Chalamet), a smart but directionless 17-year-old who falls in love with his father’s research assistant Oliver (Armie Hammer). Luca Guadagnino’s languid romance is well on its way to being considered a modern queer classic and it made an instant star out of Chalamet when it hit cinemas in 2017.Richard Linklater’s minimalist romance pairs Ethan Hawke with Julie Delpy as two love-struck strangers who meet on a train and spend the evening together wandering around Vienna. The naturally romantic city is the perfect background for a soft and thoughtful meditation on love, fate and missed opportunities. Hawke and Delpy reportedly crafted much of the naturalistic dialogue through improvisation sessions, for which they were uncredited. They would, however, be credited in the film’s two sequels – Before Sunset (2004) and Before Midnight (2013).2016 Best Picture winner Moonlight is a radical film: a queer romance with an all-black cast that captures a boy’s coming-of-age with heart-wrenching specificity. Chiron, the protagonist, is played by three actors across three chapters of his life – and the third act, in which an adult Chiron (Trevante Rhodes) reconnects with an old flame, is one of the most heart-rending in modern cinema. Writer-director Barry Jenkins showed himself to have a poet’s ear for dialogue and James Laxton’s camerawork perfectly captures the vibrancy and the physicality of romantic attraction.1620 In the Mood for Love (2000)One of the most acclaimed pieces of Asian cinema of all time, In the Mood for Love is a masterful study in love behind closed doors, tracking the emotional affair between two people who realise their spouses are having an affair together. Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung are exceptional in the lead roles as two soulmates struggling to contain their desire. In 2016, the film was voted the second-best film of the 21st century in a BBC critics poll.David Lean’s tender depiction of an unconsummated extra-marital affair remains one of the finest love stories ever told, and frequently ranks among the best British films ever made. Adapted from Noel Coward’s one-act play Still Life, Brief Encounter focuses on the relationship between Laura Jesson (Celia Johnson) and Dr Alec Harvey (Trevor Howard). Their courtship is bookended by two fateful scenes at a train station – once meeting, once parting. It’s hard to estimate how many hundreds of on-screen romances have ended with a teary-eyed lover being carried away on a train, but none have done so as memorably as Brief Encounter.When Harry Met Sally took Annie Hall’s subversion of the romcom genre and removed the neuroses and pseudo-intellectualism. The result was a breezy, observational romantic comedy starring Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan as two unlikely lovers. Screenwriter Nora Ephron based much of the film on its eventual director, Rob Reiner. When Harry Met Sally would become a massive hit, spawning an iconic catchphrase (“I’ll have what she’s having”) and even a stage adaptation in 2004.Jack Lemmon plays bedraggled corporate yes-man CC Baxter, who falls in love with elevator operator Fran Kubelik (Shirley MacLaine), who is also his boss’s mistress. The 1960 masterpiece, directed by Billy Wilder, is equal parts cynical and romantic, and features one of the most compelling will-they-won\u0027t-theys in the history of cinema.The romance of Casablanca has resonated throughout the 20th century. Its dialogue is among the most-quoted in film history and its locations – the piano bar the airfield – are indelible pieces of Hollywood iconography. Humphrey Bogart is the perfect romantic lead as Rick Blaine, the bitter, lovelorn club owner in French-occupied Morocco whose ex-lover Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman) arrives with her new flame Victor Laszlow (Paul Henreid), who is wanted by the Nazis. Casablanca has been mimicked and parodied so many times throughout the years that it’s easy to forget quite how inventive it is in its depiction of a love affair torn apart by the brutality of the outside world.Wong also revealed that many of Reeves’ funniest moments were improvised.“The part where he’s listing off all those Chinese dignitaries, that was his idea. And then the part where he’s like, ‘I don’t have a problem Sasha, what’s your problem?’ and starts air fighting, he improvised that as well.”Wong stars in the film alongside Randall Park and Lost actor Daniel Dae Kim.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It was unveiled in 2001\u0026nbspand has powered generations of music listeners, as well as being associated with the rise of both the iPod and the iPhone.But over that same period it has become controversial, becoming a slow and unwieldy piece of software when compared with Apple’s more recent software.

It is likely to keep some of the same features, but drop the older parts of the app that have been accrued over the many years it has been available.As well as the music app, Apple is expected to release separate apps for videos and podcasts, which have also been a part of the iTunes app. The TV version is already available on some platforms, and will soon come to others as well as start offering Apple’s own streaming video service.The app always had a isive reputation, and many will not mourn its demise. While it helped bring about the iPod era and was one of the primary ways for people to store music, it also gradually became more and more bloated and slow as Apple added increasing numbers of functions into the app.It’s likely that Apple will keep iTunes around for a short while, at least in some form. It remains the only way for people to manage older iPod devices that never had internet connections and so can’t stream music.Songs bought through the iTunes Store will also almost certainly stick around, probably being present in the new version of the music app too. But it is unlikely Apple will integrate the store with that app in such a way as to allow people to make new purchases.Apple will begin its WWDC announcements on Monday, in a keynote presentation that will be streamed live on the company’s website and covered minute-by-minute on The Independent.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Okoye briefly mentions that there’s been an underwater earthquake off the coast of Africa and, when Natasha asks her how Wakanda will deal with the incident, she simply says they were going to avoid it.To the casual viewer, this line will bear no weight. However, some Marvel fans have been questioning whether this revealed the existence of Namor, the Sub-Mariner in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.Whether this means the character – an underwater mutant – will appear in Black Panther 2 remains to be seen, though director Scott Derrickson recently fuelled speculation he’ll\u0026nbspappear in the\u0026nbspDoctor Strange sequel\u0026nbspafter posting a comic book cover featuring the heroic sorcerer and Namor\u0026nbspon Twitter.Created with Sketch.Marvel films – ranked worst to best Show all 22Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.22. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.21. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.20. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.422 Avengers: Age of Ultron19. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.18. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.17. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 722 s of the Galaxy Vol 216. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.15. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.14. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1022 Ant-Man and the Wasp13. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2122 s of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.22. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.21. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.20. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.422 Avengers: Age of Ultron19. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.18. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.17. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 722 s of the Galaxy Vol 216. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.15. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.14. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1022 Ant-Man and the Wasp13. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4.

We can tell exactly how the film will end, but it still feels original both in its screwball energy and in the deft way it continually reverses stereotypes and gender clichés.“Macabre and fraught though The Favourite gets, this isn’t so much a film about sex or power as it is about plain mischief. It’s a hilarious, buffoonish pleasure, right down to the sets and costume design, and a breeze to spend 120 minutes with.” Christopher Hooton“Casting Chalamet as Nic was a very clever move. The young actor from Call Me by Your Name and Lady Bird has a natural charm and charisma. He still engages an audience’s curiosity and sympathy even when his behaviour is at its most selfish and erratic.” Geoffrey Macnab424 The House by the Sea“Guédiguian’s storytelling style is deceptive. At first, it seems as if this is low-key social realism in the Dardennes or Ken Loach mould, albeit set on the French Riviera. Gradually, though, we realise how stylised and theatrical his approach really is.” Geoffrey Macnab“Director Jon S Baird, whose previous film was scabrous Irvine Welsh adaptation Filth, wrings every last drop of pathos he can from his material. This is very much a case of the tears of the clowns.” Geoffrey Macnab“Vice is bravura storytelling. McKay isn’t only taking us through Cheney’s life and career but is giving us a whistle stop tour through US politics from the Nixon administration almost right to the present day.” Geoffrey Macnab“Playing Lee Israel, McCarthy manages something very special: she makes a character who is odd, obnoxious, difficult and alcoholic seem lovable and even heroic. The rest of the world is at fault, not Lee.” Geoffrey MacnabGreen Book flatters the audience about its own good sense and tolerance. It deals with racism and homophobia but still has a fairytale, fantasy feel to it. Whatever humiliations Don endures on their road trip, we know no real harm will ever come to him as long as Tony is at his side.” Geoffrey Macnab“The golden age of bonkers horror movies is gloriously evoked by Netflix’s latest feature length presentation. Beginning as a satire of the arts world, Velvet Buzzsaw swiftly and gleefully descends into a savage splatter-fest, smeared in paint, viscera and garishly-bright blood.” Ed Power“Written by Ben Elton and directed by its star Kenneth Branagh, the film plays so fast and loose with the playwright’s final years that they needn’t have bothered fitting Branagh with a prosthetic nose – accuracy is clearly not the priority here.” Alexandra PollardThe Lego Movie 2: The Second Part is the doomed progeny of a celebrated genius – brilliant but slightly stunted by the knowledge they will never live up to their predecessor.” Clarisse Loughrey“Nicolas Pesce’s sleek and stylish horror comedy is repulsive and funny by turns. In adapting Ryu Murakami’s cult novel, Pesce strikes just the right balance between humour and Grand Guignol-style shock tactics.” Geoffrey MacnabThe best moments here are remarkable. Labaki elicits an astonishing performance from her young lead. He’s an irrepressible figure with such an inbuilt sense of moral decency the film seems upbeat and optimistic, even at its darkest moments.” Geoffrey MacnabRalph Fiennes combines thriller elements with poetic flashbacks to ballet legend Rudolf Nureyev’s childhood and keeps a tight focus on the dancer. When he is most at risk, Nureyev makes decisions with his artistic future more in mind than his personal safety. As Fiennes reminds us again and again in what is his best film yet as a director, the \u0027white crow\u0027 will do anything to put himself in the limelight, the one place he is convinced he belongs.Border reverses the perspective taken by most other horror films. In more conventional genre fare, Tina and Vore would be portrayed as malevolent outsiders, but in the world conjured up by director Ali Abbasi, the humans are the monsters. Tina is the innocent – a visionary who hardly understands her own powers but who can sense human venality and corruption wherever it appears.1724 Fighting with My FamilyCertain scenes feel very trite and predictable but the film gets you in a choke hold early on and won’t let you go. It is far more gripping than its subject matter might suggest. Who ever would believe a story about a wrestling family from Norwich could have quite such heart and resonance?Doppelgangers abound in Jordan Peele’s weird, creepy and ingenious new horror film. As in his Oscar-winning 2017 feature Get Out, Peele leavens matters with ironic humour but the joking becomes increasingly uncomfortable once the main characters come face to face with dark shadows of themselves which wish them extreme harm.The Avengers cycle comes to a rich and very satisfying conclusion with Endgame, surely the most complex and emotional superhero movie in Marvel history. At 181 minutes, this is a veritable epic, but with so many characters and plot strands, it fully warrants its lengthy running time.It’s a rare and precious feeling when a film completely dismantles you. Eighth Grade – the directorial debut of US comedian Bo Burnham – breaks down every delusion we have about ourselves and burrows deep into those parts we’ve made such an effort to lock away. You may cry. You may shudder as every awkward social interaction that’s kept you up at night replays in your head all at once. You may feel the sharp pain associated with those moments when you feel completely isolated from the world. Burnham may have crafted a simple story about the most ordinary of teenage girls, but it speaks with the emotions of a true cinematic epic.Natalie Portman gives her fiercest, most memorable performance since Black Swan in Brady Corbet’s enjoyably subversive satire about a troubled pop star whose loss of innocence mirrors the fall from grace of the US itself. Portman’s character, Celeste, is certainly one of the most objectionable figures she has played: a pampered, hard-drinking drug-taking “floozy” whose appearance and high-handed behaviour rekindle memories of Liz Taylor and Joan Crawford at their monstrous worst.Robert Pattinson gives one of his most striking performances as Monte, the death-row criminal in outer space, tricked into making a voyage described at one stage as a “class-one suicide ride”. The former Twilight star makes his shaven-headed, gaunt-faced character seem hyper naturally sensitive and feral at the same time.Amazing Grace is as uplifting a film as you will see all year. It’s a concert movie filmed over two nights and featuring Aretha Franklin, the “first lady of soul”, performing gospel standards in a church in Los Angeles in 1972, with a huge backing choir and an enthusiastic congregation.Disney’s live-action remake of its 1992 animated feature is a rip-roaring, old-fashioned matinee-style spectacle that turns out far better than we had any right to expect.Olivia Wilde is a visually inventive director, who keeps the tempo here so brisk that we hardly notice how glib the storytelling sometimes becomes. We can tell exactly how the film will end, but it still feels original both in its screwball energy and in the deft way it continually reverses stereotypes and gender clichés.“Macabre and fraught though The Favourite gets, this isn’t so much a film about sex or power as it is about plain mischief. It’s a hilarious, buffoonish pleasure, right down to the sets and costume design, and a breeze to spend 120 minutes with.” Christopher Hooton“Casting Chalamet as Nic was a very clever move. The young actor from Call Me by Your Name and Lady Bird has a natural charm and charisma. He still engages an audience’s curiosity and sympathy even when his behaviour is at its most selfish and erratic.” Geoffrey Macnab424 The House by the Sea“Guédiguian’s storytelling style is deceptive. At first, it seems as if this is low-key social realism in the Dardennes or Ken Loach mould, albeit set on the French Riviera. Gradually, though, we realise how stylised and theatrical his approach really is.” Geoffrey Macnab“Director Jon S Baird, whose previous film was scabrous Irvine Welsh adaptation Filth, wrings every last drop of pathos he can from his material. This is very much a case of the tears of the clowns.” Geoffrey Macnab“Vice is bravura storytelling. McKay isn’t only taking us through Cheney’s life and career but is giving us a whistle stop tour through US politics from the Nixon administration almost right to the present day.” Geoffrey Macnab“Playing Lee Israel, McCarthy manages something very special: she makes a character who is odd, obnoxious, difficult and alcoholic seem lovable and even heroic. The rest of the world is at fault, not Lee.” Geoffrey MacnabGreen Book flatters the audience about its own good sense and tolerance. It deals with racism and homophobia but still has a fairytale, fantasy feel to it. Whatever humiliations Don endures on their road trip, we know no real harm will ever come to him as long as Tony is at his side.” Geoffrey Macnab“The golden age of bonkers horror movies is gloriously evoked by Netflix’s latest feature length presentation. Beginning as a satire of the arts world, Velvet Buzzsaw swiftly and gleefully descends into a savage splatter-fest, smeared in paint, viscera and garishly-bright blood.” Ed Power“Written by Ben Elton and directed by its star Kenneth Branagh, the film plays so fast and loose with the playwright’s final years that they needn’t have bothered fitting Branagh with a prosthetic nose – accuracy is clearly not the priority here.” Alexandra PollardThe Lego Movie 2: The Second Part is the doomed progeny of a celebrated genius – brilliant but slightly stunted by the knowledge they will never live up to their predecessor.” Clarisse Loughrey“Nicolas Pesce’s sleek and stylish horror comedy is repulsive and funny by turns. In adapting Ryu Murakami’s cult novel, Pesce strikes just the right balance between humour and Grand Guignol-style shock tactics.” Geoffrey MacnabThe best moments here are remarkable. Labaki elicits an astonishing performance from her young lead. He’s an irrepressible figure with such an inbuilt sense of moral decency the film seems upbeat and optimistic, even at its darkest moments.” Geoffrey MacnabRalph Fiennes combines thriller elements with poetic flashbacks to ballet legend Rudolf Nureyev’s childhood and keeps a tight focus on the dancer. When he is most at risk, Nureyev makes decisions with his artistic future more in mind than his personal safety. As Fiennes reminds us again and again in what is his best film yet as a director, the \u0027white crow\u0027 will do anything to put himself in the limelight, the one place he is convinced he belongs.Border reverses the perspective taken by most other horror films.

But, the author tells David Barnett, it almost never made it to the screen at allClick to followThe IndependentMichael Sheen and David Tennant in the series, on screens tomorrowIn the first episode of Good Omens, Aziraphale, an angel, played by Michael Sheen, and Crowley, a demon (a cat-eyed David Tennant), are sitting by the duck pond in St James’s Park discussing the imminent end of, well, everything.\u0026nbspThe Antichrist has been born into the world and – this might sound familiar if you’re au fait with the whole Antichrist apocalypse movie genre – has been cunningly placed by Satan’s soldiers on the earthly plane with the family of an American diplomat.The reference to The Omen from 1976 is not lost on Aziraphale, nor is the fact that he’s one of the lead characters in what’s sure to be one of the biggest TV hits of the year. “An American diplomat,” he sighs. “Really? As if armageddon were a cinematographic show you wished to sell in as many countries as possible.”Were this Fleabag, Michael Sheen would at this point have raised an eyebrow at the camera. The six episodes of the show are unleashed in their entirety on Amazon Prime tomorrow, with a BBC broadcast in weekly parts to come later in the year. By which time, yes, it probably will have been seen in as many countries as possible.Good Omens the novel was originally published in 1990, a collaboration between Sir\u0026nbspTerry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman. If you’re familiar with Pratchett, it might be through his Discworld novels and their Sky TV adaptations. Similarly, you might know Neil Gaiman from The Sandman graphic novels, his bestsellers The Ocean at the End of the Lane and Norse Mythology, or the Amazon Prime adaptation of his 2001 novel American Gods.Good Omens is none of these, yet has flavours of all of them. It’s apocalyptic, of course, dealing with the fact that the end is exceedingly nigh, much like American Gods. And it’s funny, too, laugh-out-loud funny in parts, as are Pratchett’s\u0026nbspDiscworld books. But it’s very much its own thing, the fruit of a combination of rare talents, and something never, sadly, to be repeated.Created with Sketch.The best TV shows of 2019 (so far) Show all 22Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.122 Line of Duty (BBC)Plausibility is a spectrum Bodyguard became ridiculous but Line of Duty stays just the right side, and as usual there is more plot in an hour than in whole series of other programmes. As well as being gripping entertainment, Line of Duty has become an effective examination of the relationship between the state and the inidual. The shadowy government forces are elected the organised crime gangs are fuelled by the drug trade. The police are there to save us from ourselves but can only do it if they are subjected to constant scrutiny. It’s exhausting work, policing the police.The footage is glorious, especially the side-on tracking shots of the birds and the hunting, where it is as if the cameramen were able to set up a rail along the ocean. Most spectacular of all is the sequence of a glacier collapsing into the ocean, where 75m tons of ice being sloughed off in less than 20-minutes. But at times Our Planet feels a little unfocused. Attenborough’s last big BBC series, Dynasties, won almost unbearable amount of emotional resonance through its focus on animal families. Our Planet is more of a greatest-hits parade, with overblown orchestral soundtrack and ponderous intonation. You can’t buy love, even if you pay for David Attenborough.322 Road to Brexit (BBC)The Road to Brexit is easily the best thing to emerge from the whole brexit imbroglio. OK, not much competition, but still... Despite the po-faced title, you realise very quickly that it’s not yet another drama starring Benedict Cumberbatch or yet another attempt by Laura Kuenssberg to explain the inexplicable, or yet another show with the public arguing about stuff they don’t understand. Rather, it’s a very clever, very funny, very \u0027different\u0027 parcel of bollocks to Brexit.While there are plenty of well-turned one-liners, the deeper attraction of Fleabag is schadenfreude. The character is as old as Daisy Buchanan or Lydia Bennett or Scarlett O’Hara. The best compliment to Waller-Bridge and her cast is that they find fresh clothes in which to dress these ancient monsters.It is sometimes remarked that the Troubles in Northern Ireland make for an unpromising backdrop for a sitcom about adolescent kids. Well, yer man’s wrong, as they might say. Derry Girls, returning for a triumphant and exuberant second run, proves that humour, dark or otherwise, can be quarried from even the most unlikely of locations.622 The Murder of Jill Dando (BBC)A tremendously sad, strange story then, and just as unfathomable today. Dando’s friends, family and the producer and director of the film have made a fitting and balanced tribute to her, something she deserves. I can’t really add anything to that.Home is a rather gentle, unobtrusive variation on the sitcom theme – but one that is built on a quite a bizarre premise. The twist is that a family who returns to Surrey from a holiday touring around France discover a Syrian refugee stuffed in the back of their SUV. Not only that, but, after a few moments of blind terrified panic about a suicide bombing, they eventually adopt him like he’s stray cat that’s just wandered in.Michael Jackson has long looked like a burning tire yard. There were the allegations, the out-of-court settlements, the arrest, the trial and not-guilty verdict. But there has been nothing like Leaving Neverland” 922 This Time with Alan Partridge* (BBC1)This Time with Alan Partridge is such a consistently strong creative achievement that fears for the future of Alan Gordon Partridge, may, once again, be allayed. Or Alayned, perhaps.” “Like all the best detective dramas, Shetland engages the audience in the very process of detection. That way we grow intrigued, and we care. And so we find ourselves sitting next to Henshall in his (prominently featured) Volvo V70 estate, sharing his thoughts, intercepting suspects and being driven off the road by unidentified enemies.” “It is both a revisionist – and frequently batty – take on the caped milieu and a winningly knotty mystery. And it surely is the first big-budget superhero tale more indebted to Wes Anderson than to Stan Lee.” “Yet again the Williams have woven a brilliantly tangled web, helped in no small part by Karyo’s quietly arresting central turn” “There’s really been nothing quite like Catastrophe on our screens before, and it deserves its cult status for the quality of everything the production team do, not least the stunning cinematography in this finale. Thanks, all. I’m glad Catastrophe died happy. 1422 Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil (BBC2)“For anyone who’s not altogether sure how British politics turned so suddenly into a rolling dumpster fire from which all exits are blocked then Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil is a necessary public service to explain exactly, and exactly how needlessly, we all came to be here.”“West believes Valjean to be “the greatest hero in all literature”, and he plays the part with all the care and intricacy such a character deserves.” “You see, saint or sinner, prince or pauper, we are all part of one race, the brotherhood of man. And the saintly and regal Danny Dyer stands as its finest ambassador.” 1722 The Secret Life of the Zoo (Channel 4)“This documentary goes behind the shrubbery to show off these animals and their s. The humans are a pretty exotic bunch too, judging by some of the lines they come out with.”1822 A Year of British Murder (Channel 4)“The programme-makers must have done much to win the confidence of so many friends and families, as they went through unspeakable personal pain but they repay that confidence with an understated and powerful film.” “Despite what some feared, the casting of Cumberbatch doesn’t simply flatter Cummings – the A-lister is too good a chameleon for that. But, inevitably, as he scrawls out his campaigning brainwaves on a whiteboard, there is a touch of that deductive maverick Sherlock in his portrayal of this scruffy, balding political saboteur.” 2022 The Paras: Men of War (ITV)“From the outset the production is elevated by its sensitive handling of the men – and the Paratroopers remain exclusively male – involved. These kinds of programmes have a tendency to fetishise toughness, lingering on assault courses and weaponry.”2122 Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland (BBC2)“Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland is a meandering look back over his life, career, and national identity – a “Proustian wander through Scotland”. There’s a lot of mordant chat about the weather, illustrated with shots of dark grey clouds above even darker grey lochs.” “As a slightly cheesy reminder of what we love about Doctor Who – i.e. the fact it gives us an intergalactic eccentric in a big flappy overcoat shouting at Daleks  – this is a New Year treat that more than delivers” 122 Line of Duty (BBC)Plausibility is a spectrum Bodyguard became ridiculous but Line of Duty stays just the right side, and as usual there is more plot in an hour than in whole series of other programmes.

On the front row of the cinema there was a reserved seat that nobody ever sat in. It was instead occupied by a hat, scarf and\u0026nbspbox of popcorn.“When we used to talk about Good Omens and whether it would ever be a film or TV show,” says Gaiman, “Terry always used to say he would not ever believe anyone would adapt Good Omens until he was sitting there watching it and eating popcorn, and would probably not believe it even then.”Pratchett died in 2015, aged just 66, eight years after going public with the fact that he had been diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer’s. He was already a national treasure by then, thanks to his prolific output and, in his latter years, becoming a patron for the Alzheimer’s Society and making a BBC documentary about living with the condition.Pratchett and Neil Gaiman\u0027s novel - trailerAfter a career as a journalist and a press officer for the Central Electricity Generating Board, he became a full-time writer in 1987, after the publication of his fourth Discworld novel, Mort, and settled into a role as a true literary character, rarely seen without his trademark black fedora hat. It was that hat that took pride of place on the front row of the Odeon on Tuesday night.“Having Terry Pratchett’s hat front-and-centre with a big bag of popcorn meant the absolute world to me,” says Gaiman.Gaiman at an ‘American Gods’ viewing party in March, another Amazon Prime adaptation\u0026nbsp(Robin MarchantGetty)Good Omens was born when Gaiman wrote the opening chapter and sent it to his friend Pratchett to see what he thought. It had a working title of “William the Antichrist”, riffing off the very British rough-and-tumble William books by Richmal Crompton, and posited the simple question: what would happen if the son of Satan was an ordinary boy from Suburbia?They plotted the novel together over the phone, and would write chunks of the story inidually, exchanging their work on floppy disks sent through the post. When it was published, the book garnered a clutch of genre nomination awards and became a firm favourite among fans of both authors.There had been mutterings about some kind of screen adaptation of Good Omens since around 2011, but following Pratchett’s death Gaiman declared publicly that he would never embark on such a project without his friend and collaborator. Then Gaiman received a letter, written by Pratchett before he died, who had presciently anticipated that TV was becoming a much mightier force in terms of sprawling adaptations, and urged Gaiman to forge ahead with a Good Omens show. The missive from beyond the grave was entirely in keeping with Pratchett’s sense of humour, and so on-message with the whole tone of Good Omens that it might as well have been a discarded plot point.Pratchett\u0026nbspmight have gone, but we still have his representative on earth in the shape of Rob Wilkins. Wilkins had been a constant figure by\u0026nbspPratchett’s\u0026nbspside for years. He was described as\u0026nbspPratchett’s\u0026nbspassistant, but that doesn’t really cover how deeply Wilkins was embedded in\u0026nbspPratchett’s\u0026nbspcareer and life. So much so, that along with\u0026nbspGaiman, he is an executive producer on the\u0026nbspGood Omens\u0026nbspseries.The obvious question for Wilkins is what would\u0026nbspPratchett\u0026nbspthink of the show? It is, as you might expect, one he’s been asked a lot recently. “In Terry’s lifetime, I had no idea what he thought about anything,” laughs Wilkins. “Some days he would want milk in his tea, some days not. Terry\u0026nbspPratchett\u0026nbspwas a very difficult man to predict.“But the question of what Terry would have thought of\u0026nbspGood Omens\u0026nbspis actually a very simple one to answer. Having Neil\u0026nbspGaiman\u0026nbspas the\u0026nbspshowrunner, having him on set since day one, knowing everything that Neil has put into this show, the birthdays and anniversaries he’s missed, the novels he hasn’t written… Terry would just have been delighted that Neil’s been the one to see this through.20th Century Fox)“He would have loved everything about Good Omens, from the production to the design to David Arnold’s music, and he would have absolutely loved Neil’s screenplay.”It’s been an exhausting few years for Gaiman, who has poured everything into the Good Omens production, shuttling back and forth between London and his home in the US, where he lives with musician Amanda Palmer and their young son Ash. He says:\u0026nbsp“It feels like I’ve been climbing a mountain, and I reached the peak of it in January or February, when the production was finished. When the show is launched on Amazon Prime on Friday I’ll finally feel like I’m starting to head back down the mountain and go home.”The idea that 30 years on humanity has done absolutely nothing about these things just strikes me as obscene. This is essentially the same\u0026nbspGood Omens\u0026nbspstory as it was then, it just happens to be a lot more appropriate now than we could ever have imaginedAfter months and months of filming and locking himself away in dark editing suites, Gaiman finally got to see the six episodes of Good Omens in their entirety and in the correct order for the first time last week. “It was incredible,” he says. “To see it all, made by the best crew you could ever get, with such an amazing cast.”The cast really is a stellar one. Tennant and Sheen head it up, of course, but there’s plenty of talent on the screen around them, from Jon Hamm as the officious angel Gabriel, to Anna Maxwell Martin’s Beelzebub, Josie Lawrence as remarkably accurate soothsayer and Lancastrian witch Agnes Nutter, Jack Whitehall as the descendent of a witchfinder general. Veteran actor Brian Cox lends his stentorian tones to the voice of Death, Frances McDormand offers a very soothing God voiceover, while Benedict Cumberbatch plays her Satanic counterpart.And while Good Omens hits screens with incredible production values, as we’ve come to expect from the most high-end contemporary TV extravaganzas, it is a very British show indeed – especially where the humour is concerned.The central idea follows Sheen’s Aziraphale, an angel who has become quite accustomed to living a comfortable life on earth, running a bookshop and enjoying classical music, sushi\u0026nbspand the finer things in life. Tennant’s Crowley is a rockstar of a demon, flying by the seat of his pants and doing just enough – aided by overblown reports to his bosses in Hell – to ensure he can live a decent and undisturbed life as the Other Place’s emissary in the mortal world. Over the millennia, the two have developed a close friendship, despite their obvious differences, and the prospect of armageddon bringing their lives crashing down does not sit well with them at all.The main plot device is a classic trope of British comedy. Entrusted with getting the newborn Antichrist into the care of the unwitting American diplomat and his wife, Crowley becomes embroiled in a farcical (in the finest way) episode with an order of Satanic nuns involving a three-way baby switch which, inevitably, results in the actual Antichrist mistakenly going to live with an unassuming couple played by Daniel Mays and Sian Brookes.Pratchett died in 2015, aged 66. He had early-onset Alzheimer’s\u0026nbsp(Ian GavanGetty)There’s something almost gloriously Carry On\u0026nbspabout the scenes in the convent (without the smut), and Gaiman throws out a whole slew of references and inspirations for the comedic aspects of the show, from the films of Powell and Pressburger to Monty Python’s Life of Brian to Douglas Adams.In fact, the opening sequence of the first episode, in which\u0026nbspMcDormand’s God brings viewers rapidly up to speed, is incredibly redolent of the Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, which Adams wrote as a radio show, then a series of novels, then a 1981 TV show, and that’s no accident.“That’s definitely a homage to Hitchhiker’s,” says Gaiman. “It’s perhaps what it would look like if they made a TV series of it now.”The curious thing about Good Omens, perhaps, is that for an adaptation of a novel that was published almost 30 years ago, it seems actually as relevant today as it did in 1990… in fact, more so. Pratchett and Gaiman\u0026nbspstarted writing the novel in 1988, when the world was just about to start emerging, blinking, from the depths of the Cold War. By the time it was published in 1990, there was almost whiff of optimism in the air.“There was a line we put into the novel, between the first and second drafts, that reflected that,” says Gaiman. “We said something like wasn’t it a shame armageddon had to happen, because there was Glasnost and the Berlin Wall coming down, and everything was starting to feel a bit nice.“When it came to writing the screenplay, I realised I couldn’t put that line in the TV show because the idea of everything starting to feel nice would just make it feel so dated. None of the problems we talked about in the book, from climate change to war, appear to have been sorted out. The idea that 30 years on humanity has done absolutely nothing about these things just strikes me as obscene.“This is essentially the same Good Omens story as it was then, it just happens to be a lot more appropriate now than we could ever have imagined.”Good Omens review: Pratchett \u0026amp Gaiman’s whimsical book brought to lifeThe first trailer for Good Omens is hereBenedict Cumberbatch joins Good Omens cast as release date announcedDavid Tennant and Michael Sheen cast in Good Omens adaptationGaiman got the scripts drafted in summer 2016, in the wake of the Brexit referendum, the result of which surprised him. And the US presidential election campaign was getting underway. Gaiman says:\u0026nbsp“So I thought, OK, this has happened in Britain. But the American’s aren’t idiots, they’re not going to elect Donald Trump…” He pauses and adds:\u0026nbsp“I identify with people who like the world, people who want to continue living there calmly, who want to raise their children to think it’s a good thing that the world has a future.”Where, in other words, armageddon is confined to works of entertainment such as Good Omens. It’s been a long old haul getting Good Omens to the TV screen, and Gaiman confesses that had he known just how much work it would be, how much time and energy it would eat up, he might have had second thoughts about taking the project on.But\u0026nbspWilkins is adamant that only Gaiman\u0026nbspcould have brought his and Pratchett’s\u0026nbspvision to life like this. He says:\u0026nbsp“Neil was on set every day, in the edit suite every day, in post-production every day. Without Neil, the Good Omens series just could not have happened.”And, says Gaiman, “once you\u0026nbspstart walking down that road, there’s no turning back.” But he didn’t make Good Omens for himself. He says:\u0026nbsp“I didn’t do it for the TV critics, I didn’t do it for the audiences, I didn’t even do it for Rob, I didn’t make it for anyone, except for one person. I made Good Omens for Terry Pratchett.”Willikins tells us that Pratchett would have loved Good Omens. But imagine if he’d been here to not only see it, but be involved in the production itself. Gaiman smiles, and knows exactly how that would have panned out. “What would have happened if Terry had been alive is that I would have sent him the scripts and he would have said, yes, very good, but I’ve just played with a few things. And he would have made it exactly 17 per cent\u0026nbspfunnier.”Good Omens will be\u0026nbspavailable in its entirety on Amazon Prime tomorrowOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail. Death is everywhere on Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared?, as much as others may refuse to see it.After a period of tumult, Sharon Van Etten’s fifth album is a reinvention. But beneath its hazy synths and electronics are songs of endurance and inner peace, of settling after a flurry of activity. 432 Bring Me the Horizon  – AmoBMTH frontman Oli Sykes wants to assert the fragility of the boundary between love and hate. Amo is a way of exploring that, even down to the title itself.532 Nina Nesbitt – The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will ChangeNesbitt is back with her second LP, switching to a brand of soul and R\u0026ampB-fused pop that feels bang on time, and suits her far better. The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will Change has slick, polished production from Fraser T Smith (Adele), Lostboy (Anne-Marie), Jordan Riley (Zara Larsson), and Nesbitt herself.This self-titled record, a loose but beautifully crafted collection of folk-rock songs, explores the kinds of anxieties intrinsic to the modern age – the longing to be at once noticed and invisible the paralysing effects of limitless information, and the desire to do good versus the desire to be seen doing good.The album is packed with personal confessions for the fans – “Arianators” – to pick over. It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (Helen Brown)The perma-brilliant James Blake has flooded his fourth album – Assume Form – with euphoric sepia soul and loved-up doo-wop. His trademark intelligence, honesty and pin-drop production remain intact. But the detached chorister vocals of a decade in which he battled depression have thawed to reveal a millennial Sam Cooke crooning: “Can’t believe the way we flow, way we flow, way we flow...”While he recognises his roots and includes plenty of nods to grime, AJ Tracey\u0027s magpie’s eye for a good melody or hook extends far beyond that. With the help of stellar producers like Cadenza (Kiko Bun), Swifta Beater (Kano, Giggs), and Nyge (Section Boyz, Yxng Bane), Tracey incorporates electronic music, rock, garage and even country on his most cohesive work to date.The album title of the year gives us an image of Brexit Britain trashed by Old Etonians David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, but the fifth studio work from the punk duo has more than social commentary to offer. There’s some of that, as vocalist Jason Williamson skewers documentary-makers who take advantage of the poor in “Kebab Spider” – “the skint get used in loo roll shoes” – but elsewhere this is a record that expands the idea of what Sleaford Mods could be.“Do you still have that photograph? Would you use it to hurt me?” asks Australian indie rocker Julia Jacklin, against the menacing throb of “Body”. The tension is stormy: imagine a mid-period Fleetwood Mac song, covered by Cat Power. It’s a masterclass in narrative songwriting.With praise from Kendrick Lamar, five EPs released by the time she was 21, tours with Lauryn Hill, collaborations with Gorillaz and two critically praised albums – including 2017’s excellent concept album Stillness in Wonderland – fans and critics alike wondered what else Little Simz could do to find the kind of mainstream success enjoyed by so many of her male peers.1332 Solange – When I Get HomeSolange Knowles has never been coy about the intent behind her music. Beautiful arrangements and seamless production notwithstanding, you get the sense, each time she drop a project, that it serves a distinct, zeitgeist-shifting purpose.1432 Foals – Everything Not Saved Will be Lost (Part 1)FoalsMerging their asymmetrical early math pop with the deep space atmospherics of Total Life Forever and Holy Fire, plus added innovations – ambient rainforest throbs on “Moonlight”, deadpan EDM on “In Degrees”, Afro-glitch Radiohead on “Café D’Athens” – they’ve created an inspired album of scorched earth new music that, in all likelihood, will only really be challenged for album of the year by Part 2. (Mark Beaumont)Tracks are at once astute and deeply personal in how they capture vignettes of everyday life and spin them into important lessons. “Black”, the most recent single from the record, considers what that word means to different people around the world, as well as to Dave. “Voices” has him singing over an old-school garage beat, fighting off personal demons.At her best, Sigrid throws out precision-tooled high notes like icicle javelins into vast, blue Scandi-produced skies. Then she growls like an Icelandic volcano preparing to disrupt western civilisation until we sort ourselves out.1732 Karen O and Danger Mouse – Lux PrimaLux Prima was born just over a decade ago from a drunken phone call from Karen O to Danger Mouse – real name Brian Joseph Burton – during which the pair vowed they would work on something together. It wasn’t until after O had given birth to her son, though, that recording finally began, and there is a beatific sense of contentment on songs like “Drown”, with its Kamasi Washington-like choirs and stately horns.This is an ambitious creation, meticulously crafted and assembled. For a start, the range of guest performers is a cornucopia of contemporary soul and hip-hop collaborators: vocalists Moses Sumney, Roots Manuva, Heidi Vogel, Grey Reverend and Tawiah strings player Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, and keyboardist Dennis Hamm – both of whom have worked with Flying Lotus and Thundercat.Rose – who found fame in the UK’s indie-folk scene as an unofficial member of Bombay Bicycle Club in 2010, only to walk away amid the band’s growing hype – is darkly compelling on No Words Left. Assisted by producer Tim Bidwell, who worked on Rose’s last record Something’s Changing, she sounds braver than she ever has before. There are moments that recall her Communion labelmate Ben Howard, on his latest album, Noonday Dream, and others that nod to the quiet stoicism of Joni Mitchell and Neil Young. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)The record is loosely conceptual insomuch as it’s punctuated with mock adverts for “WWAY HEALTH, our 247 care programme”. But don’t be put off: Miss Universe is a brilliant collection of songs, an expansive melange of indie, jazz, pop and trip-hop that flits between a lo-fi sparseness and something The Strokes would play. Yanya – who is of Turkish-Irish-Bajan heritage – grew up in London on a mix of Pixies, Nina Simone, The Libertines and Amy Winehouse, and this unlikely combination is certainly reflected in the sound. (Patrick Smith)2132 Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (Elisa Bray)Comprising songs from Segall’s eclectic (that’s putting it lightly) catalogue and performed by him and the Freedom Band (Mikal Cronin, Charles Moothart, Emmett Kelly, and Ben Boye), the album is delightfully short and sweet. It is certainly a drastic switch-up from Freedom’s Goblin (2018), which had 19 tracks and ran for 75 minutes.If you want to know how hard it is to categorise Titanic Rising – the enthralling fourth album from Weyes Blood – look no further than the American musician’s own attempt to do so. It is, she says, “The Kinks meet the Second World War, or Bob Seger meets Enya.”Tension aside, there’s a great sense of fun here. The title track is pure euphoria, as restless synths of a Utah Saints or Orbital rave break into swelling bass and melody. And they create the full club experience with “Got to Keep On”, on which the four-to-the-floor beat, funky rhythm guitar, sweet backing vocals and chiming bells make way for the simple sounds of happy party-goers just as the anticipation builds, so does the instrumentation into a hypnotic crescendo. It’s masterful production. (Elisa Bray)Six months after the release of Oxnard, Anderson .Paak returns with another Dr Dre-produced record, Ventura. Where the former was overflowing with choppy, experimental sounds, guest appearances and clumsy attempts at Gil Scott Heron-esque revolutionary lyrics, the sequel – recorded around the same time – streamlines .Paak’s sound, making for a tightly packaged, melodic and danceable album.Two years after the release of his Mercury Prize-nominated debut Yesterday’s Gone, the south London hip-hop artist unveils its follow-up, Not Waving, But Drowning. And if any two records could portray how quickly someone can grow from a boy to a man, it’s these.2732 Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouNo one could accuse Lizzo of holding back. Not when it comes to her voice – which is raw and rowdy, so laden with personality even the vulnerable moments are a joy to listen to –  and certainly not when it comes to her message of unabashed self-love. That’s the predominant theme of the singer  rapper  flautist-extraordinaire’s hugely likeable third album, Cuz I Love You.It seems as likely as Old Man Steptoe dining with the Rees-Mogg, but this new tactic of burying their confrontational gruesomeness beneath a veneer of alt-rock respectability for album three works well for Fat White Family. Drenched in chamber strings and celestial harmonies, the plush yet sinister “Oh Sebastian” could be Pet Sounds selling its soul to the devil. “Fringe Runner” is so sleek and funksome it could be a New Romantic “White Lines (Don’t Don’t Do It)” “Kim’s Sunsets” is a piece of refined cosmic reggae resembling a blissed-out “Bankrobber”.2932 Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date.SOAK reaches to outsiders once again on her new album. 3132 The Cranberries – In the EndThere’s a cruel irony that the release of The Cranberries’ final album should come just a week after journalist Lyra McKee was shot dead by the New IRA during a riot in Londonderry. “Zombie” was a protest song written by the band’s late frontwoman Dolores O’Riordan after two children were killed by IRA bombs – was released. She was deeply affected by the deaths, and would no doubt have been devastated by recent events in Northern Ireland as well.On her third record, Aldous Harding combines the gothic folk of her self-titled 2014 debut with the dramatically intimate tones of her follow-up album Party.It’s not uncommon for an artist to be influenced by the place they grew up in.

It is not known exactly how this process occurred, but a research team from Kyoto University in Japan has revealed the first ever evidence of wild chimps habitually catching and consuming freshwater crabs.The findings may provide scientists with new insight into the behaviours which drove our own progress, the scientists suggest.Writing in the Journal of Human Evolution, the team describes year-round, freshwater crab-fishing behaviour – primarily among female and infant chimpanzees – living in the rainforest of the Nimba Mountains in Guinea, west Africa.“The aquatic fauna our ancestors consumed likely provided essential long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, required for optimal brain growth and function,” said lead author Kathelijne Koops from the University of Zurich and Kyoto University’s leading graduate programme in primatology and wildlife science.Created with Sketch.

For two years, they documented the demographics and behaviour of the group of chimps, while also analysing and comparing the nutritional value of the crabs to other foods in the chimpanzees’ diet.Crabbing, they learned, not only took place year-round – without regard to season or fruit availability – but intriguingly was negatively correlated with the chimps’ consumption of ants, another diet staple. Mature males were the least likely to consume aquatic fauna.“Energy and sodium levels in large crabs are comparative with ants,” Dr Koops said, “leading us to hypothesise that crabs may be an important year-round source of protein and salts for females – especially when pregnant or nursing – and for growing juveniles.”The study sheds light on our own evolution by illustrating that fishing behaviours may not be restricted by habitat as could be assumed.Chimpanzees filmed eating tortoises after smashing their shells openMystery ‘ghost species’ of chimpanzee discovered in bonobo DNAChimpanzees have much cleaner beds than humans do, scientists findChimpanzees learn to play rock, paper, scissors “This isn’t the first case of non-human primates eating crabs,” said senior co-author Tetsuro Matsuzawa, “but it is the first evidence of apes other than humans doing so.”He said notable previous observations of primates eating crabs came from “monkey species in locations consistent with aquatic faunivory – lakes, rivers, or coastlines – and not in closed rainforest.”He added: “It’s exciting to see a behaviour like this that allows us to improve our understanding of what drove our ancestors to ersify their diet.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

So allow me to make it here, because it’s actually a very good idea.Those concerns about overcrowded, creaking commuter trains are real: but they cannot be solved without HS2, or something extremely similar. The problem is that explaining why is quite complicated, so politicians haven’t really tried.Some people seem to think HS2 is about “knocking 35 minutes off London to Birmingham”. It isn’t. Yes, it will dramatically reduce journey times: the whole project will cut London-Manchester from\u0026nbsptwo\u0026nbsphours to one it takes around an hour off the journey to Scotland Birmingham to Newcastle is cut from three\u0026nbsphours 15 minutes down to two hours. Birmingham to Nottingham, which currently takes over an hour, falls to an almost ridiculous 19 minutes. One misconception is that these will be special “high-speed”\u0026nbsppremium services with higher ticket prices for rich passengers. That isn’t true – these will be the ordinary journey times between those cities, integrated into the existing network.Created with Sketch.Extinction Rebellion: Climate change protests cause chaos in London Show all 46Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A protester gives a thumbs up as he stalls a DLR train at Canary Wharf station in London246 City of LondonProtesters hold up traffic on Upper Thames Street in the City of LondonProtesters hold a banner as they hold up a DLR train at Canary Wharf station in LondonOfficers remove plants that were placed in the occupation of Waterloo BridgePolice officers arrive at Oxford Circus as they prepare to remove protesters during the fifth day of a coordinated protest by the Extinction Rebellion group, April 19An activist waters the plants at the occupation on Waterloo BridgeUndeterred by over 400 arrests, climate change activists continued their demonstration into a fifth day in London with a small protest at the country\u0027s main Heathrow Airport, along with the ongoing protest camps at other iconic locations around the British capitalProtesters with the words \u0027glued on\u0027 written on their hands hold hands as police officers arrive at Oxford CircusOfficers circle the lorry that serves as the central stage to the Waterloo Bridge occupation, repeating their tactic from a earlier at the Oxford Circus occupationOxford Circus reopens after being closed for days due to occupationOfficers prepare to move in on the occupation of Waterloo BridgeActivists relax on a sofa at the occupation on Waterloo BridgeBritish actress Emma Thompson talks to members of the media from atop the pink boat after police officers surrounded the boat being used as a stage as climate change activists occupy the road junction at Oxford Circus  in central London during the fifth day of environmental protesst by the Extinction Rebellion groupAn Extinction Rebellion demonstrator is carried away by police on Waterloo BridgeActivists on Waterloo Bridge have made a garden for their occupation site, April 20Demonstrators began blocking off a bridge and major central road junctions on April 15 at the start of a civil disobedience campaign calling for governments to declare an ecological emergency over climate change, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2025, halt bioersity loss and be led by new citizens\u0027 assemblies on climate and ecological justiceEmma Thompson joins the Extinction Rebellion protest at Oxford Circus.

The objective is capacity, and not just capacity for fast intercity services, either, but for those local regional and commuter services between small towns that have been so neglected. The complicated bit is explaining why that is.Britain’s railways were largely built in the Victorian era, for a different kind of travel. Today, the same lines carry a mix of express intercity trains – the kind which HS2 will take – and stopping local and commuter services, the kind people use to get to work, or pop to a neighbouring town.The colossal HS2 bill could cost the north its much-needed railwayThis mix is a very inefficient way to run a railway, for a reason that is quite obvious if you think about it: trains cannot overtake each other on the same set of tracks. They would bang into the back of one another if they tried. Not good. To get around this, local stopping trains need a large gap behind them in the timetable, so the express trains behind them do not catch up. That reduces the number of trains you can have per hour on a line, dramatically reducing its capacity for every type of service – local and express.The engineering thinking behind HS2 is to take those express services off the older mainlines, leaving them for stopping local and commuter services. When trains are all travelling at roughly the same speed on a line, you can fit a lot more in, because the gaps needed between them are smaller.HS2 will take express trains off the West Coast Main Line that links London with Birmingham and the cities of the northwest the Midland Main Line that links London with the East Midlands and Sheffield and to an extent the East Coast Main Line that goes up to Leeds and Newcastle. That frees up capacity across a huge swathe of the country for local services, and it’s the whole rationale behind the project. That the government hasn’t been explaining this ad nauseum is inexcusable.HS2\u0026nbsphave been fierce every since the project was open to a public consultation in 2010\u0026nbsp(Getty)So if the plan is to improve commuter services, why not build a new commuter line instead of a new one for expresses? It wouldn’t make sense: these existing lines are already good for slow trains, and they go into the centres of towns and cities, which have since expanded around them. A new high-speed line for expresses can make use of engineering advances since the 19th century to speed up journeys, and doesn’t have to go into as many built up areas as a local line would, where the need for tunnelling and demolitions would make it more expensive and disruptive. And making a line high-speed doesn’t actually cost that much more, either, if you’re building one anyway. But the key point is that local services benefit, despite the new line being for express trains.HS2 will also bring other direct benefits to cities and towns that aren’t London. Northern Powerhouse Rail (stupid name) is the government’s plan to connect up the cities of the north of England with high-speed rail. It’s currently in development, but the plan, as put together by northern councils, relies on vast sections of HS2 track. Liverpool to Manchester Sheffield to Leeds and towards York and Newcastle – these bits of NPR will use parts of HS2.The government arguably made a huge mistake by starting planning on the NPR scheme so late, leaving people wondering why they were prioritising journeys to London – but with Labour and the Conservatives both committed to the project, it is likely to happen. HS2 and better connections between non-London cities aren’t an eitheror: the two projects are intrinsically linked. If HS2 is scrapped, who knows when a government will next be brave enough to try a major rail project again.HS2 will be key part of strategy to fix capacity problems for trainsIn the meantime, the West Coast Main Line is filling up, and can’t wait. The reason ticket prices are a rip-off from\u0026nbspLondon to Manchester (£175 for a walk-up, one-way, anytime ticket is absurd no matter what cheap advance fares are available – sometimes you just have to travel) is because the trains are running completely full and Virgin can charge what they like and still have a passenger in every seat – and sometimes the floor. The number of passengers using the route doubled between 1997 and 2005, and it is well on its way to doubling again. The huge capacity increase that HS2 brings is a response to that.It’s understandable that people are sceptical of a project that has been badly explained, when it isn’t obvious why it deals with the biggest problems they see with the railways. That said, some criticisms are red herrings. Take the environmental impact: over the 140 miles of HS2 line, 29 hectares of ancient woodland will be felled. Sounds bad? But for comparison, a single 2.5-mile road scheme, widening the A21 in Kent and Sussex (not even a new road!), will take down nine hectares, around a third of HS2’s phase 1 total. Extinction Rebellion are barking up the wrong tree on this one far more road schemes will be needed if we can’t shift traffic to more efficient rail, and that means building more capacity. High-speed rail has also proven the greenest way to get people off short-haul flights, dominating routes like London-Paris or Madrid-Barcelona, where polluting planes would otherwise be king. Long term, it’s good for the environment. And new trees are being planted elsewhere to replace the ones cut down.Why does Britain keep making a mess of its biggest projects?Lords report recommends HS2 rethink as costs spiral ‘out of control’HS2 accused of poor planning and ‘unacceptable’ damage to wildlifeExtinction Rebellion activists camp out in trees to protest HS2‘Thousands’ of trees die on HS2 route for lack of waterAny large project will be disruptive, but compared to the other options, HS2 is actually pretty good. Consider one much-touted alternative: upgrading the West Coast Main Line with an extra pair of tracks for more capacity. There are several thousands houses built facing onto the line, and you’re going to need to knock them down to put a railway there. And it won’t be high-speed, it’ll be more expensive to do it, and it’ll be massively disruptive – not just for people losing their homes, but passengers who would face about a decade of closures and replacement buses. The more general problem with suggestions that existing lines should simply be “upgraded” (a rather vague proposal) is that there are simply diminishing returns to what you can do with 150-year old infrastructure. The West Coast Main Line already benefited from a major upgrade programme ending in 2005 it took a decade of disruption and cost over £10bn in today’s money, provided only a fraction of the benefits of HS2, and is already full. Plans to upgrade it further were abandoned because they weren’t seen as practical, and planning for a new line that became HS2 is a direct result of that process.Will HS2 suffer from cost overruns? Probably. Delays? You bet. Infrastructure projects are rarely delivered on time anywhere in the world, not least in western democracies with little things like rule of law and environmental regulation. But once they are finally delivered, nobody cares: you probably don’t even remember that the Channel Tunnel or Jubilee Line extension were fiascos in their time nobody would get rid of them now. HS2 will be the same. It won’t solve every problem with the UK’s rail network, but it is a necessary part of solving a hell of a lot of them. If it gets scrapped, in 10 years’ time people will be talking about building something very similar, and moaning that we didn’t get on with it when we had the chance.

We should leave on 31 October. And if we cannot get a deal we should, with great regret, leave without one, having done everything we can to minimise disruption.”The EU has said repeatedly that it is not willing to reopen negotiations on the current deal, but Mr\u0026nbspJavid insisted he would try to negotiate directly with Ireland to find a way to keep the Northern Ireland border open after Brexit.He insisted Home Office analysis had concluded that there could be a technological solution to the problem, meaning the controversial Northern Irish backstop, which is hated by many Conservative MPs, would not be needed.\u0026nbspHe said: “I’ve looked at this in the Home Office, tasking a team from Border Force to look at what we’d need in place.\u0026nbspThey were clear the technologies already exist to avoid a hard border, and important work in being undertaken by the Alternative Arrangement Commission on this front. What we need is the trust and will on both sides to make this work a reality.”A Home Office document leaked earlier this year said the analysis had concluded that such a solution was at least a decade away.Created with Sketch.Who is standing to be the next Prime Minister?

He would seek a new, fairer deal, though he insists that Britain must leave the EU by October 31. Raab announced his bid on Sunday 26 May, 2 days after the Prime Minister announced her departure date.Michael Gove, the environment secretary,  is leaning on his extensive government experience, having served in 3 cabinet roles since 2010, to make the case that he is suited to lead. His greatest challenge may prove to be convincing MPs and members to trust him as he earned a bad reputation for standing against Boris Johnson in the 2016 leadership contest after starting the race as Johnson\u0027s campaign manager.Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, was the first cabinet member to announce his bid just hours after the Prime Minister declared her departure date. He supported the Prime Minister\u0027s deal when she tried to get it through parliament and is pitching himself as the candidate to unite the Tory party.Rory Stewart, the international development secretary, is somewhat of an outsider, he only joined the cabinet for the first time at the beginning of May.

Kit Malthouse, the housing minister, is pitching himself as a fresh face who is not burdened by association with the torturous Brexit process and the disputes that it has borne in the party.

Instead they smear just over half the country as backward-looking and beyond help.Even Michel Barnier seems to think it’s because we’re pining for the days of Empire, rather than to take control of our laws and borders.If the Second Referendum crowd really think Britain is about to change its mind — despite the huge number of votes for the Brexit Party last week — they need to think again.Every time people like Wheatcroft open their mouths, they give one more reason we’re better off out.IT is naive to think education is free.So the idea that you could deliver university courses without somebody paying just isn’t realistic.Tuition fees are necessary. The way they are paid back means youngsters who are bright enough can afford it in the long-run, without ever truly crippling them with debt.But nobody should be arguing that those who don’t go to university should be subsidising those who do, any more than they already do.There are some universities charging full-whack for sub-par courses, and because almost everybody is charging the maximum students don’t have much choice. The “market” the Government hoped for has never truly developed.But the real answer to our skills crisis Supercharging vocational education, and giving kids the skills for the st century’s technological revolution.THE Government is right to demand service station operators are transparent about pricing.They’ve been ripping off motorists for years.

I understand that ious MPs have been to see him to say that while they won’t vote for him, they would accept his leadership.One MP who won’t be endorsing him, though, is Amber Rudd. She and Boris sat down on Thursday. But ultimately the dferences between them over Brexit policy are too great to make any kind of dream ticket work.I understand that Rudd pushed the former Foreign Secretary to budge on his commitment that the UK would leave the EU on October  with or without a deal. Johnson would not. Rudd felt that she could not support someone holding this position.Another complication was that Johnson and Rudd’s dferences on Brexit made it very hard for them to agree on a joint governing agenda. Johnson, though, should still have more votes in the first round than any other Brexiteer candidate.He needs to finish  votes clear of Dominic Raabhe is to establish himself as the clear Leave choice — Raab is more likely than him to pick up support as the second tier Brexiteer candidates drop out.As one of those backing Boris puts it: “He’s got to get as close as possible to a third on the first round.” The support of a third of MPs guarantees you a place in the members’ run-off.The problem for the former London Mayor, as this supporter acknowledges, is that “ there’s ever a perception that Boris was falling back then that would be compounded”.On the Cabinet side of the contest, Sajid Javid is attempting to reboot his campaign by today setting out his plan for how to deal with the Irish border issue.One of those backing him tells me it is “not just how you voted in the referendum, but your ability to implement no deal or negotiate with the EU” that matters. This supporter argues that Johnson and Raab aren’t going to get anything out of Brussels, while Javid might.The Cabinet side of the contest is becoming increasingly fractured. I understand that the Cabinet Ministers most opposed to No Deal have privately agreed to back either Matt Hancock or Rory Stewart in the first round. Both are running interesting campaigns.Stewart is out doing social media walkabouts, while Hancock is making arguments that the other candidates are being forced to follow. I’m told that next week he will propose a levy on betting companies to fund treatment for gambling addiction.The energy of these campaigns is causing trouble for the more established Cabinet contenders. I understand that backers of one of them are now warning MPs: “Go to bed with Hancock, wake up with Boris.”But Jeremy Hunt’s biggest problem is the sense that, in the words of one senior Tory, he is a “completely wasted place” in the final two as it is hard to see how he could beat a Brexiteer candidate.This is why a growing number of Tories think the party is “heading to the destined psycho-drama” of a Boris Gove run-off.BATTEN down the hatches, hurricane Donald is blowing into town. As his interview in this newspaper demonstrates, Donald Trump won’t be governed by the normal diplomatic conventions on his State visit.He is more than happy to make known his admiration for Boris Johnson, despite the Tory leadership contest. Though some of the rival camps think Trump’s blessing will be a double-edged sword.It is the Foreign Secretary, Jeremy Hunt, who will greet Trump on his arrival, which will give Hunt the chance to burnish his statesman credentials. Hunt will also be involved in Tuesday’s Downing Street talks between Trump and Mrs May.Penny Mordaunt, the Defence Secretary, who is expected to throw her hat into the leadership ring, will meet with the President’s daughter, Ivanka, to discuss female economic empowerment.Trump is not an easy President to deal with. But he is the leader of our closest and most important security ally. UK politicians must also realise that on ious issues, including China and the role of Huawei in G networks, the Trump position represents the new political consensus in the US.The UK would be mad to endanger its most import- ant intelligence relationship over this issue.THE next test for Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party comes on Thursday, with the Peterborough by-election.If Farage’s party can win, it will show how Brexit has redrawn the political landscape. It will give the Brexit Party a toe-hold in Parliament and a chance to become a formidable political force.Butthe Brexit Party can’t take a seat which voted heavily for Leave in the aftermath of its Labour MP being sent to prison, then its current momentum will be checked.CABINET on Tuesday has been cancelled. This is surprising given that it didn’t meet this week as Parliament was in recess. The official reason for it not taking place is that there is too much on with the Trump visit and D-Day commemorations.But as one minister points out to me, it is hard to believe that Cabinet would have been cancelledit hadn’t been for the fact that Theresa May is resigning as Tory party leader at the end of the week.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And I know I am that leader.Mr Javid entered Parliament in  and served as Culture Secretary, Business Secretary and Communities Secretary before being promoted to his current job last year.The frontrunner out of the  MPs is Boris Johnson with Dominic Raab, Esther McVey and Andrea Leadsom vying to take his crown as the top Brexiteer in the race.Cabinet ministers Jeremy Hunt, Michael Gove, Matt Hancock and Rory Stewart have also put their names forward.Other potential candidates for the leadership include Penny Mordaunt, James Cleverly, Graham Brady and Steve Baker.THERESA Mays resignation on Friday kickstarted the Tory leadership election.The Prime Minister will formally stand down as party leader on June  - but will stay in place while the new PM is being chosen, rather than handing over to an interim chief such as David Lidington.The leadership contest, overseen by party chairman Brandon Lewis, will take around six weeks.Any Tory MP can enter the race, and the list of contenders is then whittled down by the parliamentary party.MPs vote in multiple rounds, eliminating one candidate each time until just two are left.The partys , activists then choose behind the final shortlist of two, with the winner declared leader and Prime Minister.When Mrs May became leader, she didnt have to submit to a vote of members because Andrea Leadsom pulled out of the race.So the last time activists have had a say on the leadership was , when David Cameron defeated David Davis."},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markle prince harry diana tribute instagram","story":"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex shared a photograph of Harrys late mother as they highlighted the first day of Pride Month today with their million Instagram followers.Princess Diana herself had been a key figure in changing the stigma around AIDS and HIV.Among her work, Princess Diana opened the UK’s first purpose- built HIV Aids unit, which cared exclusively for patients with the virus, at London’s Middlesex Hospital in .In front of the media, she shook the hand of a man suffering with the illness.

They are crying out for leadership which will put the country and our people first.The European Elections clearly reflect that and anybody who has knocked on doors or engaged the public in recent times knows that.We simply must move on and move out of the EU and fast.And in doing so we must move into a trade negotiation as has been outlined through numerous proposals over the last  months.Unfortunately Theresa May’s Cabinet showed themselves unwilling to listen to detailed proposals which would have a delivered the genuine Brexit the public voted for.So now the priority is to exit the European Union and move forward to negotiating a future relationship with protects British interests and keeps open the global prizes and benefits of Brexit which the British people voted for.Ministers who claim they are pro-brexit have failed to stand up for the . million who voted to leave and make that robust case to deliver the referendum mandate.The people were promised we would have left the EU months ago and that ‘no deal was better than a bad deal’.Having danced to the tune of the tune of the EU, spent billions of pounds on ‘no deal’ preparations, our country must just get on and leave the EU.Too many people in our political class lack confidence in our country and trust in the public. They have sought the comfort of the EU making our laws rather than making the decisions themselves. No wonder the British people feel betrayed.They expected the UK to leave the EU on th March as they were promised. Every day longer we remain in the EU adds salt to that wound.The governing class has broken trust in our politics.The British people voted to take back control and for Britain to be free, independent and self-governing again. Our destiny is as a global beacon of free trade, not a satellite of the EU.The Conservative Party must quit the navel-gazing and stop the rot of this Brexit betrayal.Those of us who believe in our Country and people, who respect our democratic and political freedoms, will continue to stand up for our liberty to make sure the days of betrayal are over.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I take them at their word - so on that basis the Withdrawal Agreement Bill is dead.Instead, I have a pragmatic three-step plan - a plan to deliver Brexit in a way that protects citizens of the UK and the EU, delivers certainty to businesses, and maintains the integrity of our United Kingdom.No more preicating. No more fearmongering. And no more limbo. Just compassionate and decisive action that demonstrates leadership.My first step will be to take sensible measures to enshrine certain agreements into law, and to protect our people.I will immediately introduce key legislation to address this.First, I will introduce a citizens’ rights bill. EU citizens who have built lives here, and UK citizens who have made their homes in the EU must have the weight of uncertainty lted from their shoulders.Second, I will introduce a bill that locks in the mutually beneficial measures that have already been agreed between the UK and EU.This will cover areas like citizens’ rights in Gibraltar, our sovereign bases overseas, security and intelligence-sharing relationships, transport, data, and medicines.It is in everyone’s interest to put these agreed arrangements in place, and I believe many MPs would support this, regardless of how they voted in the referendum.The second step is to give businesses and industry the confidence and certainty they need to plan for a managed exit. I want them to be able to invest, hire, and innovate with renewed optimism.So we will ramp up preparations for our managed exit, focusing efforts on delivering alternative arrangements for the Northern Ireland border with the EU.Our continued strong bond with Northern Ireland will be protected.There are some sensitive sectors that rely upon ‘just-in-time’ supply chains, like automotive and aerospace. I know how important these are, and we will propose specic regulatory agreements with the EU for these.For other industries, like medicines and agri-foods, we will seek specic customs agreements on tarfs and non-tarf barriers. This will protect trade in the most vital goods and services but allow us to embrace new free trade deals around the world.At the core of this work will be open communication to Parliament, the public, and EU colleagues about progress, to build an environment of confidence and certainty. Parliament will receive regular updates, and households and businesses will receive communication from government that provides clear information about our managed exit.Transparency will be at the heart of everything I do - it’s what parliament expects, and it’s what the public deserves.The third step will be to lead a delegation of UK Ministers to meet with the EU Council and the proposed new EU Commissioners, to talk directly about the wide-ranging preparations we are making for a managed exit on October .Discussions will culminate in a UK EU summit, in September, in Belfast and Dublin, where the EU Council and proposed Commission will be invited to agree which measures we will all accept, to ensure a properly managed exit.As Prime Minister, I will not advocate an extension of any kind, and it will be clear that in all circumstances the UK will leave the EU at the end of October. With comprehensive arrangements in place, we will be prepared for any eventuality.We owe it to the country, and to our strong democratic tradition, to fulfil the instruction that our voters gave us.I am a passionate, pragmatic and positive believer in Brexit, and with my three-step plan, we can decisively leave the EU. We can demonstrate to the world that the UK remains a beacon for opportunity, fairness and democratic leadership. We can restore that vital trust between politics and the people.It’s not too late to take advantage of the opportunities we hoped for in voting Leave. It’s time to look forward we have an incredibly bright future ahead of us.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Rachel, , had just split from Unwin when he and a prison pal slaughtered nail technician Quyen Nguyen, , after torturing her for five hours. Rachel last night told the Sunday People: “If the Probation Service had done their jobs he would not have been able to kill anyone . “In the five years I was with him I NEVER saw a probation officer visit our home or question who he was mixing with. “I feel so sorry for the family of the girl he murdered. “It preys on my mind constantly, I can’t sleep because I’m running dferent scenarios around in my mind, trying to imagine what went on in that house. “It horries me that the man I fell for, had a five year relationship with and had a daughter with was capable of that kind of sick, twisted cruelty.” Rachel got together with Unwin after he was freed following a jail stretch for murdering retired pharmacist Jack Greenwell, .    After having a baby Rachel split with Unwin and he teamed up with another freed murderer, former cellmate John McFall, . The pair lured Quyen to a business meeting and beat her up and sexually abused her for hours. Then they bundled her in the back of her car, drove it down a secluded track, splashed petrol over her and set her on fire while she was still alive. The evil pair, who took a chilling selfie picture as they drove away, are now serving whole le sentences – meaning they will die in jail. Rachel told the Sunday People: “Quyens’s death could have been avoidedpeople had checked on what he was doing and who he was with.” “I’m preparing myself for the day when I have to tell my daughter what sort of person her father is. I’ve no idea how I’ll find the words. “At the moment all I’ve told her is that he did something bad and had to go to the naughty boys’ home.”  Unwin carried out his second murder despite police logging  incidents involving him in five years after his release for killing the OAP in a bid to get drugs. Northumbria police also failed to report claims he had threatened to rape a woman to the probation service, the inquest in Sunderland was told. Rachel said: “When Stephen first came out of prison he had to go to meetings with the probation service once a week.I went along with him a number of times and all the probation worker was interested in was whether he was working and whether his le at home was settled. “In all the time we lived together I don’t remember any spot checks being carried out at home, to my knowledge we were never visited by the probation service. “He was never asked who he was associating with and I’m certain they had no idea he was with John McFall on a daily basis. “They were living together while both were on le licence and no one in authority had a clue.” Rachel, of Sunderland, met Unwin when they were both  and they dated in . She was reintroduced to him through a mutual friend in  by which time he was in prison for murdering Mr Greenwell. Unwin had been sentenced to le at Newcastle upon Tyne Crown Court in  but Rachel was unaware why he was in prison when she started to write to him.    She said: “He told me why he was in jail in a phone call. “He told me Mr Greenwell came at him with a kne and he then turned it on him, which I now know was nonsense.I was deeply shaken and didn’t know what to do. “But he told me that he was completely rehabilitated, that he’d turned his le around in prison and learnt new skills he could use on the outside.” Unwin was moved from Hull jail to an open prison in Lincolnshire as he was prepared for his release in  after serving  years. Rachel said: “I wasn’t there when he was released but over a few months he convinced me he was a truly changed character and he moved into my home. “One of the things that made me think he was a changed man was his desire to become a father.He felt he had missed some of his best years in prison and said he didn’t want his chance to have a child to pass him by.”    Their daughter was born three years ago. Rachel said: “She idolised Stephen and he loved her. “He set up his own business as a handyman. It seemed as though we were setting out on a normal family le but that didn’t last long.” She discovered Unwin had been trying to meet up with other women. Their relationship ended in May  although they remained on civil terms for their daughter’s sake. But on August  of the same year his true nature was revealed. She said: “My eldest daughter’s boyfriend drove past the house where Stephen was living and McFall was staying.He said there were police all over the place.  “The following day I saw on the news that the young lady’s body had been found in a burning car and I instinctively knew it was him. “I felt physically sick with the horror of it – and that’s before I knew the details of what those animals had done to that poor girl.”Unwin had got to know hard-working Quyen when he and McFall, from Blackpool, worked on properties that she rented out. Rachel said: “Despite the terrible things he has done Stephen could be very convincing that he was a changed man, a decent man. “He seemed to have fooled his probation officer because she seemed perfectly happy with him and in no hurry to see him more than once a month. “With hindsight I wish I had raised the alarm but he’s so manipulative that I thought he was rehabilitated and starting over. “When I heard the evidence from the inquest that he had threatened to rape someone a month before the murder I was devastated. “It made me wonder whether I could have done something but I didn’t see the danger he still presented.” A senior officer told this week’s inquest that the police unit monitoring offenders struggled under “unmanageable workloads”. And the probation officer monitoring Unwin said her office was in chaos after cutbacks. The inquest is expected to finish next week. But for Rachel the verdict will be irrelevant – and too late for victim Quyen. Rachel said: “I hope Stephen and McFall are tortured in jail because that’s what they deserve.” Shambles for Grayling The Probation Service is being brought back under public control after a disastrous part- privatisation. The current system was introduced by then- justice secretary Chris Grayling in . But the chief inspector of probation, Dame Glenys Stacey, has described it as “irredeemably flawed”. Offenders on probation were charged with  murders between  and . Over the same period they were also charged with  attempted murders and, rapes or attempted rapes. The Ministry of Justice said: “Serious further offences are very rare but each one is taken extremely seriously and investigated fully to identy lessons.” "},{"url":null,"title":"couple look like different people","story":"NewsCouple look like dferent people after incredible  STONE weight lossThe pairs impressive transformation saw them nominated for the Slimming World Couple of the YearShareCommentsByDan Kemp:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN NewsSimon dropped over  stone during his transformation \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA couple have revealed how they dropped  STONE after undergoing a dramatic transformation.

They cycled every day and camped at night, enduring temperatures that fell to minus C in Northern China and rose to C in the deserts of Uzbekistan. In some countries they struggled to find food and in Tajikistan had to survive on biscuits for three days. Chris, , says: “Sometimes I really wanted to be at home by the wood burning stove with a glass of wine, but, apart from that, we didn’t miss anything.” Peter, , chips in: “Apart from rhubarb crumble...”    The couple, who live near Hadrian’s Wall in Carlisle, Cumbria, first came up with the idea for the trip in . Chris says: “We weren’t unhappy but we were healthy enough – so we wanted to challenge ourselves.” Although they had always cycled for fun, they were not serious about it. Peter says: “We didn’t dress in Lycra and go out on our bikes every weekend. But all our lives, we’d cycled to work or the shops.”  They bought Thorn touring bikes, got a train to Greece and cycled back as a test run. Chris says: “It was fantastic.” So they began planning their journey to China. The couple, who have two sons, and four grandchildren, set off in January .Chris says: “We had terrible weather . So when we got to Hungary, we went to a mineral spa to relax. But Peter tripped and broke his femur.”   He had surgery before they flew back to the UK but seven months later, on October , , they set off again. Chris says: “We had one change of clothes, waterproofs, a stove, pans and cutlery. It was three weeks before we reached our first country, France, when things began to feel more real.” They travelled through Europe, the Middle East and Asia before reaching the Great Wall on November , . Chris says: “The weather was a bit unnerving sometimes. The wind was so strong in Northern China that we were nearly knocked off our bikes. “The desert in Uzbekistan was C. So, having enough water and staying cool was a problem.”  They also camped every night and Chris says: “I have a sixth sense for finding good places. “But sometimes we struggled and in Italy we had to camp by the side of the road and were visited by the police. In Turkey, we camped in a cave and lit a fire, just like cavemen. It was very special.” Chris says seeing the Great Wall was “very emotional”.  She says: “I was happy and a bit surprised that we’d made it.

The Smithfield Estate lies in Manchesteraposs famous Northern Quarter and was built by Manchester City Council in the s.With its charming exterior, the red brick cluster of homes but looks nothing like your typical council housing. The buildingaposs service charges are capped at £ per quarter, a much lower fee than new building apartments in the town with a £ a month fee. Most of the  or so houses are rented out through Northwards Housing, although around  have been purchase through Right to Buy.  Rachel Hoy bought home in December  and spent three months renovating her place into a five-star abode. Employing a group of builders, Rachel knocked down walls to open up more space and installed a new kitchen and bathroom.Rachel told Manchester Evening News : “I work in property development and I quickly learned it is much harder doing your own project! I moved in three months later and genuinely loved living there.”While renovating her house, she met her neighbours Mani and Celine Keleher who were also in the processing of upgrading their apartments.    Rachel added: “We ended up using the same builders so would often end up in the pub comparing notes and either crying into our beer or toasting a job well done!” Mani, owner of ONE% Microlot Coffees, said: “Like Rachel we gutted the place and opened it up to make it more liveable. We put in a new kitchen and bathroom and added some colour. “And the outside space is ridiculously huge – a rare thing in the centre of the city. We even have a shed. And it is lovely to be surrounded by trees in the heart of the city centre.” Now, both Rachel and The Kelehers have put up their one-bedroom apartments for sale each priced at £,.  Rachel said: “I got a new job and now work in Dublin. The flat is my pride and joy and I did not want to rent it out I would like someone to live in it and love it as much as I did. Make their own mark and there is huge potential outside.” Speaking about moving away from the city, Mani said: “We are looking at what the future holds. But Smithfield has a real sense of community neighbours have been here  years and really care about the place. It is an iconic part of the Northern Quarter and helps make the area what it is.” Manchester City Council is running a £, project to replace windows and doors in the estate as well as installing a new gate system. As Oliver Dolan from agents JLL added: “These apartments don’t come up for sale very often and it’s dficult to find a property right in the city centre with this amount of outside space.  “Both apartments have been refurbished to a really high standard throughout and the added benefit of permit parking makes then unique.” The Manchester City Council still owns two third of the properties but occasionally, houses do come up for rent or sale. A three bedroom maisonette has recently been put up for sale at £, a month.

I was expecting the usual cleanse, tone and moisturise routine with some lovely smelling lotions and potions. But on the Indian sub-continent, they do facials a little dferently – as I found out to my horror when I could smell bleach on my skin. The beautician was unfazed when I demanded to know what she had used on my face. “It’s just skin whitening, your skin will look fair and lovely afterwards.” I was pretty happy with the way it looked before, thank you very much!    It’s sad to say, but there is an obsession among South Asian women to have fairer skin, and it starts the moment you are born.Relatives openly talk about how “dark” or “white” a baby is... the lighter the better because inthat culture it leads to better opportunities in le – marriage, jobs etc.So against this background is it any wonder that the organisers of this year’s Miss India competition have come under fire for having a line-up of contestants that one Twitter user said looked like “an ad for the Aryan nation”  Looking at the photo of the  very pale, albeit very beautul, finalists, the lack of ersity from such a erse country is appalling. And big business is capitalising on this cultural stigma. Multi-national cosmetics brands have found a lucrative market – global spending on skin lightening is projected to triple to US. billion by , according to a  report by research firm Global Industry Analysts. When I was given the bleach facial, I felt my sensitive skin ­tightening and burning. The health risks of using skin- whitening products over a long period of time are staggering. Research shows that steroids contained in these creams can lead to thinning of the skin, bruising or tearing, enlarged blood vessels, increased hair growth in treated areas, steroid dependence, and pustular psoriasis.    Charming. As an Asian woman, I find it heartbreaking that some women resort to slathering themselves in toxic potions in order to feel beautul – or even accepted. What is even more tragic is when this practice is carried out by children. The NSPCC carried out research that showed British schoolkids are whitening their skin with make-up to avoid being bullied or racially abused. I grew up in Britain during the s and s being ashamed of my skin colour, constantly teased and bullied for being dferent. So I could never understand why so many white people spend so much money on tanning products and expensive holidays to get my brown skin. I could not be happier in my own skin now.

Ghamer Sulayman used the social media apps to first make contact with his young victim. He would go on to sleep with the -year-old girl on numerous occasions. The -year-old plied her with alcohol and drugs before ordering her to have sex with multiple men and threatening to throw her onto the streetsshe didnapost comply. Sulayman was eventually brought to justice and jailed for ten years at the end of a trial at Shrewsbury Crown Court.  Judge Peter Barrie said: You didnapost have any genuine affection for her. Nobody who had any genuine affection for her could have contemplated for even a moment getting her involved in what you did to her. How harrowing to think that she was so adrt, so lacking in real personal relationships in her le that she clung on to you even after what you had done to her. In the week he was convicted of two counts of human trafficking and one count of rape, police told of how they tracked him down and how the courage of the victim saw her sick abuser brought to justice. Sulayman found his victim through social media and quickly convinced her to travel with him and several other men to Birmingham from her grandparentaposs home in Telford, Shropshire on July , . Staying in a Birmingham house the abuser told the victim to sleep with multiple men or face a night on the streets. She was then dumped at a train station the next day to make her own way back to Telford. Later that month the two met up in a Telford supermarket car park on several occasions to have sex with the girlaposs approval, although she was too young to legally consent. On some occasions other men would be present at the car park and Sulayman “pimped” her to his friends infor favours. Plying the underage girl with cannabis and alcohol, the offender ignored her pleas when she said she didnapost want to have sex. Following the prosecution Chief Superintendent Tom Harding told of how the investigation began with a missing persons report. A family member had called police just after pm on July , , to report the girl absence - the fth time she had been reported missing to the force. At pm on July  the girl contact her family to say she was in Birmingham and would be getting the train home.  Chief Supt Harding said that at the time the victim was already working with a team designed to stop youngsters from being abused. The Children Abused Through Exploitation was set up specically to help youngsters who may be at risk from groomers and sexual predators. Chief Supt Harding said: “We suspected she was being exploited, however she did not wish to speak to police about what had taken place while she was missing and in turn she did not want us to proceed with a prosecution.” The police chief launched an investigation despite her reluctance., uncovering CCTV footage that showed the teenager with the -year-old. He said: “We managed to pinpoint the car she was picked up in at Asda. “That was identied through detailed inquiries as being at Corley service station on the M. Some CCTV shows Sulayman entering the shop in the petrol station and another shows him ing to the vehicle. “This shows the trafficking nature of the offence.” A search of the victim’s home also turned up names and phone numbers. Chief Supt Harding said: “As part of that work we identied telephone numbers and in turn established that contact had been made through social media – Snapchat and Instagram . We believed that on the night the girl went missing she was taken to hotels in Birmingham city centre.”  The police chief explained how Sulayman had tried over time to get the girl in a position where she could be abused. He said: “She had been in contact with this man for five months before the missing episode which highlights the ‘boyfriend’ type model. The first arrests in relation to the case took place in March , and it was a further ten months and  police interviews before charges followed. Chief Supt Harding said: “The victim would not provide us with an account of what took place so we were having to build up a picture of her movements and those of Sulayman over a period of time. “Also, during that period suspects were interviewed  times with each lasting approximately two hours. She eventually felt able to open up following support from the police. As well as the three guilty rulings, Sulayman was cleared on six counts of rape and one of human trafficking at the judge’s direction. Ayad Hizam and Saleh Qasem, of Balsall Heath, Birmingham, were both found not guilty of offences relating to the victim. Detective Constable Steve Parton, who was the officer in charge of the investigation praised the victim, who is now , for her strength. He also commended the support teams that had worked with her. He said: “The victim in this case has shown great courage and bravery, it has not been easy and I hope the verdict offers some solace to her as she now moves forward in her le. “I’d also like to recognise the fantastic support Telford  Wrekin Council’s CATE team.has provided and have no doubt we would not be where we are today without the work they carried out.” A West Mercia Police spokesman urged sexual assault victims to call    or visit www.victimadviceline.org.uk.

TUI said: “We are really sorry some holidays have been affected by ongoing construction work. “This was due to be completed before customers arrived but due to unforeseen circumstances there was still signicant disruption. “We provided them with alternatives including moving to an alternative resort, receiving compensation or flying home.

Natasha Spychalskiaposs debilitating ME condition can see her sleeping for up to  hours at a time - waking only to eat and shower, before falling asleep again. The -year-old dreamed of starting a degree in fashion buying and hoped to pursue a career in acting before sickness struck.But in her final year in college she became ill with glandular fever, ExaminerLive reported .The illness passed but her symptoms did not and she had so little energy she would go home to sleep during the day.  When her friends were up dancing at her th birthday party, Natasha was left watching from the sidelines, too tired to join them. Natasha was eventually diagnosed with ME - commonly known as chronic fatigue syndrome - after undergoing a series of tests. On top of this she also suffers from fibromyalgia, a long term condition causing pain across her whole body. Her condition is incurable and there is no effective treatment. She is sharing her story to help people understand not every disability is visible and some struggle with symptoms that you cannot see. I feel like my le stopped at .    The illness really deteriorated after I left college - I was bedbound, I found it really hard to do anything active. Even walking to the bathroom was hard. I had managed to get into uni, studying fashion buying at Manchester Met. I did two days and couldnapost handle it. I couldnapost stand up and was in so much pain. The following week I quit. I was gutted. It is what you should be doing when you are . All my friends had gone off to uni and I was stuck in at home with no-one. Natasha, who lives in Bolster Moor, Huddersfield, with mum Pam, dad Richard and brother Alex, , began working for her parentsapos property rental business, but had to give this up too. Instead she has spent her teenage years and early s trying to manage the symptoms. And despite her sunny personality, Natashaaposs condition has caused her to suffer from depression. She says: There are good days and bad days.    She says fibromyalgia causes joint pain but ME causes brain fog and trouble concentrating. Light and noise affect her and she suffers joint and muscle pain. She said: Chronic fatigue makes you feel so heavy, like you have run  marathons in a row. You feel like a dead weight. Itaposs like walking through a pool of syrup. The pain feels like your whole body is bruised and something is pressing on it. But Natasha says peopleaposs reaction to her condition is worse than the pain and fatigue. She said: The worst part is people donapost understand it. People say Iaposm lucky I get to stay in bed all the time but Iaposm bored of being stuck in, not being able to go out. I have missed out on so much. All my friends are buying houses, in long term relationships, having children. I couldnapost even think about being like that. It feels like I have been stuck inside four walls for eight years. I love going to the cinema and theme parks, going out with my friends for a drink and a chat about normal things that arenapost being tired. I try to go out twice a month but in the lead up to that I will sleep all week so I can save enough energy to go out. When you cancel too many times with a friend they donapost bother with you after.    Natasha has tried many kinds of therapies, from painkillers to talking therapies, massage and even cannabisoil - but has found little relief. She said: Doctors donapost have a lot of understanding about it - there is not enough funding or research. They donapost know what to do. My doctor understands but she doesnapost know what to do as there is no cure or treatment. The CBD oil helped with my depression but not with the chronic fatigue. The only thing that has helped the pain is tramadol. But Natasha has found help and support among other sufferers online. She said: In Huddersfield I found the people in the support groups were a lot older and I couldnapost relate to them. But online there are people my age and younger. You hear online about people whoaposve had it since they were  or  - I donapost know how they did high school. She says she has lost friends and boyfriends - but does have huge support from people closest to her. My parents are really good - they will do anything, they will pay for anything, they just want me to get better one day. Natasha dreamed of becoming an actress, landing extra work in Waterloo Road and Shameless. But her illness has made that too dficult. She said: I loved it. It was the best thing I did. It made me want to do it more and go to drama school, but the days are very long. Today I feel OK but tomorrow I will probably be in bed all day. ME is so unpredictable. Now Natasha hopes her experience can help others understand what it is like to live with a chronic condition. She said: I want people to listen. People know what ME is but they make assumptions that itaposs just tiredness. It is much more than that. They judge you for being lazy or pretending because they canapost see whataposs wrong with you.

goals and the season have been massive for me.“It was probably what I would class as my first full professional season playing regularly.”Cosgrove finished just one goal behind Rangers’ Alfredo Morelos in the race for the Premiership Tartan Ball award for the league’s top scorer.Colombian international Morelos finished the campaign on  Premiership goals.Cosgrove had a penalty saved in the dying minutes of the - win at Hibs in the final game of the season that would have drawn him level with Morelos.In his first full season at Pittodrie Cosgrove scored more Premiership goals than Celtic’s record signing Odsonne Edouard.A £ million capture last summer from Paris St Germain, Edouard scored  league goals.Aberdeento pre-season training in the final week of this month where they will travel to Cork in the Republic of Ireland for a week-long training camp.Cosgrove is determined to prove he is no one-season wonder after a prolic first full campaign for the Reds.He said: “It was a bit of a learning curve.“I had the games at the start of the season against Burnley in the Europa League, which were absolutely fantastic.“Then I found myself out of the team for a spell.“However, I came back into the team and started scoring goals.“Now I have to do the same again next season.”Aberdeen boss Derek McInnes has already moved to further bolster the attack for next season by beating Hearts to the capture of Curtis Main.The Motherwell striker, , has agreed a two-year deal with the Dons and is expected to be officially unveiled early this month. Former Aberdeen defender Ash Taylor has also had talks with McInnes regarding ato Pittodrie.Aberdeen could also resurrect interest in Sunderland midfielder Dylan McGeouch.McInnes tried to land McGeouch from Hibs last summer but he opted to move to the Stadium of Light.McGeouch is out of contract at Sunderland after only signing a one-year deal at the club.He is reportedly keen on ato Scotland, although Blackburn, QPR and Brentford are interested.McInnes wants signings secured for the Euro campaign, which begins at the first qualying round stage on July .Cosgrove said: “Europe is massive for us and it has almost been a given the last few years.“It was vital that we got into Europe again.“In previous seasons we have qualied for Europe by finishing in second place but unfortunately we did not get that this season.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/05/SNS-19003599-Hibernian-v-Aberdeen.jpg ","title":"mcinnes is not fazed by task of rebuilding dons again","story":"Aberdeen boss Derek McInnes insists this summer will not be his biggest rebuild because he has already carried out more extensive overhauls at Pittodrie.It will be a hectic summer transfer window as the manager looks to replace seven players who exited following a campaign where the Reds finished outside the top three for the first time since .That figure could rise to eight, as the future of Scotland international winger Gary Mackay-Steven remains in limbo.McInnes is keen to retain the winger, but the Scotland international’s contract expires on June  and he has yet to make a decision on his future.MLS side New York City are interested in GMS.McInnes accepts he faces a busy summer, but insists this is far from new territory as he has faced even bigger rebuilds before.He said: “People have said this summer is the biggest rebuild because we are losing big characters, in particular Graeme Shinnie.“However, we have had big rebuilding jobs in previous seasons here.“I had to put together a squad in my first year and there was also a rebuilding job after the Scottish Cup finalin .“I had five players from my starting line-up leave after that – Pawlett, Taylor, McGinn, Hayes and Jack – and everybody said then that was the end of us.“Last summer it was the same again as we lost four or five important players including Kenny McLean, Anthony O’Connor and Ryan Christie.“However, we were still competitive this season, as we still went to a cup final and lost twice to Celtic in the cups, so this is not new to me.“Rebuilding to put together a squad that can compete is something we have done before.“We will do exactly the same again this summer and be ready to go again for next season.”Aberdeen have lost influential skipper Shinnie as the Scotland international has penned a three-year contract with Derby County.The loan deals for Max Lowe , James Wilson , Dom Ball , Greg Stewartand Tommie Hobanhave expired.Defender Greg Halford has also left Pittodrie following the end of a short-term contract.McInnes arguably faced a more serious exodus at the end of the - season, when the Reds lost both domestic cup finals.That summer they lost Jonny Hayes to Celtic in a £. million deal and captain Ryan Jack to rivals Rangers under freedom of contract.Niall McGinn rejected a new contract offer to sign for South Korean club Gwangju, defender Ash Taylor left for Northampton Town and Ryan Christie ed to Celtic after a loan deal.Christie would come back for another loan spell and McGinn would also pitch up at Pittodrie again, in January  on a three-and-a-half-year deal.Taylor could yetas, following his release from Northampton Town, the centre-back was recently in Aberdeen for talks.During the summer of , striker Jayden Stockley was sold to Exeter Town while Peter Pawlettand Miles Storeyalso left.Having lost - to Motherwell in the Scottish Cup semi-final in May , McInnes admitted his recruitment in the previous two windows left them short of options for the semi, after bans for Shinnie, McLean and Shay Logan. After that semi, he said: “Where I take responsibility is with the recruitment in both windows. Sometimes you don’t know until you know and today smacked me between the eyes that the strength of the squad wasn’t good enough.”McInnes could not afford a repeat last summer – nor can he afford the same during this transfer window.In the recent campaign Aberdeen finished fourth in the Premiership but secured European qualication.There was regression in the league but McInnes believes he successfully strengthened last summer only to be dogged by injury.He said: “With that first team of the season in the two ties against Burnley in the Europa League, we had everyone fit.“I thought we looked a proper team then. I thought to myself, this is the best squad we have had, but every time I went to pick a team after that there were about four or five out at any given time.”McInnes’ rebuilding job is already under way as Motherwell striker Curtis Main is expected to be confirmed as a Pittodrie addition next month, having agreed a two-year deal.Taylor has held talks and McInnes has also opened up dialogue with Ball in a bid to secure the versatile defender-midfielder on a permanent contract.Ball’s deal with Rotherham is set to expire and he will not be offered a new contract.McInnes also wants to secure Lowe on loan again next season, but will have to wait until late in the summer for Derby to make a decision on the left-back.Striker Wilson will also be a free agent as Manchester United have not taken up the option of the clause of an extra year in his contract.McInnes is keen to take Wilson to Pittodrie for next season, after he showed positive form in the post-split games.However, Wilson was reportedly on £, per week at Old Trafford and would have to take a massive reduction in wages at Aberdeen. It is understood Wilson is open to the possibility of a Pittodrie .McInnes had also been keen on securing attacker Stewart, but he looks set to join Rangers.McInnes said: “We’d like to get some signings in before we come back for pre-season and I’m pretty sure we will.”"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 10","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThere will be no room to complainyou don#t speak up and give your opinions on how you see the front green looking.Clearly there will be a range of ideas, and it will be impossible to accommodate them all, but there will be no chance of seeing your vision realisedyou don#t speak to the design team.As ever, money for the project is limited and much of the cash will have to go on basics, such as improving drainage, but we join with councillors in encouraging our readers to drop in and see the initial designs on Colchester Square between am and pm tomorrow, Saturday March .Bringing back native species we humans killed off is a nice idea, in theory.

A bruised and battered face caused alarm on first viewing which gave way to quite a lot of laughter and bold comment.But what a delightful party, laid on by our warden Sheena Stewart and ladies and saw we all had tea, coffee, and home baking, including shortbread and sconesand presents of wine and malt whiskey. What a lovely morning.To all who sent cards for my th, including the community council, the Wednesday Club, the Inveraray Highland Games , my warmest thanks. And many thanks to those who helped me up after my fall and in particular Stuart Campbell of Brambles who took me to the surgery, whose very kind people cleaned me up and sent me on my way to my party half an hour later.And a mention to Take the Floor too on Radio Scotland on Saturday night. Thank you Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club and Margaret Mather our secretary for this request.So I won#t forget my th in a hurry, but such kindness and friendliness cannot be forgotten ever.My thanks to you all,Niall Iain MacLean, InveraraySir,I read with great interest the letter in the March  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser from C Rees, Lochgilphead.In addition to all that was mentioned I wonderyour readers are acquainted with the McCrone Report which was written in the s As I’m sure your readers are aware this was when oil had just started flowing from the North Sea. Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 13","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWe could be wrong, but the confusion over Minard war memorial seems to be nothing a sit-down over a cup of tea couldn#t fix.It#s a pity the community missed out on the centenary fund, but there are general UK funds available for war memorials.

Many visitors also took a seat around the #have-a-go# table to learn more and make their own pompom caterpillar or plant, take up a bit of cross stitch or find out about the art of decoupage – a staple of the immensely popular activity of upcycling, while others took advantage of the opportunity to sit outside the hall enjoying delicious home-made cakes washed down with tea or coffee.Co-organiser Ruth Tott commented: #The idea of the craft day just grew and grew, with one thing leading to another.

An implementation plan was produced in December  to cover the years -. Who in Argyll and Bute is responsible for this plan  How many of the outcomes have been achieved As someone who has been involved with autism personally and professionally for many years, I find it extremely disappointing there seems to be an inability by those in authority to get organised enough to address the issues and provide services for autistic people and their families.There is no need for further drafts and consultations.Someone in the authority needs to take responsibility for the existing strategy and implementation plan and get on with it.Maureen Mackintosh, Ardrishaig.Sir,Scotland’s small building firms had a strong start to , in contrast to the UK construction small and medium sized enterprisesector, according to the Federation of Master BuildersScotland.The FMB State of Trade Survey for the first quarter of , the only quarterly assessment of the UK-wide SME construction sector, showed SME workloads declined for the first time in six years.In Scotland, however, there was a jump of  per cent compared with the previous quarter. Thirty per cent of weighted responses were positive, up from  per cent from the fourth quarter of .It is encouraging the Scottish construction industry is bucking the wider Brexit trend with workloads and enquires in rude health. The UK-wide picture is very dferent, with the construction SME sector overall contracting for the first time in six years.Scotland’s good fortune could be due to fewer EU workers being based north of the border compared with other parts of the country, like in London where one in three construction workers are from the EU.Relying less heavily on migrant workers has meant the Scottish construction industry hasn’t fallen foul of thousands of EU workers ing home during the long march to Brexit due to no longer feeling welcome in the UK or sure of their future here.Scotland’s builders, however, must not be complacent. Looking ahead, the First Minister has indicated thatthe UK does leave the EU later this year, she wants a second independence referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in . This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next. For construction SMEs, this is particularly concerning as their prospects are vulnerable to dips in consumer confidence as so much work comes from the private domestic sector.Gordon Nelson, Director of FMB Scotland.Sir,I was joined by my fellow Conservative councillors in Kilmory recently as we discussed atthe numerous challenges facing Argyll and Bute.Ferry sailings, roads, education and the SNP#s late single farm payments were all mentioned.With the SNP hammering local authority spending and cutting our budgets, challenges in delivering services will become more prevalent.Despite this climate of cuts from the separatists, Conservative councillors are delivering for Argyll. This includes extra funding for the Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund, more funding for infrastructure and an increase in roads winter maintenance resources across Argyll.As ever, my fellow Conservatives and I will continue to fight non stop to make sure our rural constituency is not sidelined by this unceasingly urban and separatism-obsessed over centralising Scottish Government.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and Islands ward.Sir,I photographed this unusual visitor to Kilduskland Road, Ardrishaig, on April .

The weather was a challenge in itself due to the bitter cold, but the young people rose to the challenge and coped admirably.The climax of the weekend was the presentation of six Gold Chief Scout Awards to group members who have been working hard for four years to gain the highest achievement possible for a Scout. All six Scouts who gained the award have now started their careers in the Explorer section of the group.In late March members of the Scout and Explorer section joined with the Heart of Argyll Wildle Organisation to undertake an Earth Hour Camp. During the camp the group discussed how the unit could reduce its impact on the environment and how these changes could be implemented. Plans are now afoot for a further event in May to create an installation that looks at the impact of plastic on the countryside.Most recently three of the leaders, David Smart, Anne Smart and John McCartan took the chance to abseil  feet off the Falkirk Wheel. This event had been organised by Scout Scotland and gave a chance to meet up with other participants from all over Scotland.Looking to the future the group has exciting plans for the summer.

That was the purpose of a meeting of farmers, teachers and others interested in the countryside on May .Organised for the Edinburgh-based charity by the local branch of NFU Scotland, -plus people came along to the Inveraray Inn on a bright, chilly May evening.Making the journey west to spread the word were RHET chairman George Lawrie and executive officer Katrina Barclay, who outlined the structure and potential benefits of RHET.With its headquarters at Ingliston, RHET acts as an umbrella body, co-ordinating the existing dozen Countryside Initiatives around Scotland . Each CI is set up as a charity in its own right, with help and support from Ingliston.The point of each regional CI is to bring children closer to farming, forestry, aquaculture and other rural industries.Working with partners, the charity would deliver learning opportunities for young people aged three to  around the Scottish agricultural environment and the countryside.Examples of the activities undertaken by RHET include farm visits for schools classroom speaker talks by volunteer farmers providing free educational resource materials for schools outdoor education events across Scotland competitions and projects for schools and training farmers and teachers in the delivery of information relating to food and farming.Regional CIs are supported by co-ordinators, who will liaise with schools and nurseries, organise visits, carry out health and safety checks and make sure everything is in place for events like farm visits.Present at the meeting was Argyll and Bute Council#s Head of Education Anne Paterson.#I am really encouraged to hear about the work of RHET,# said Mrs Paterson.Emphasising the the importance placed on outdoor education by the local authority, she added: #We have a good history of farm visits in Argyll and Bute, but on a more informal basis. As an education service we encourage schools to be outdoors.Mrs Paterson concluded: #We are really keen to make it happen and to work in partnership with RHET.#George Lawrie, who has been involved with RHET for around  years, said: #What I find most rewarding in working with the young people is just seeing the smiles on their faces.#If you want to find out more, whether as a farmer crofter, education provider or are involved in any other land use or rural industry, contact Lucy Sumsion by email at lucy.sumsion@nfus.org.uk to express an interest.PIC:From left: NFUS Argyll and the Islands region chairnman John Dickson with George Lawrie and Katrina Barclay of Royal Highland Education Trust. _aRHETmeetingKatrina Barclay addresses the sizeable audience in the Inveraray Inn as George Lawrie looks on. _aRHETmeeting"},{"url":null,"title":"fynefest celebrates turning 10 with a beer","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFyneFest s for , celebrating hitting double figures with as much flair as ever.Beer, food and music: what more could anyone ask for  And there#s going to be plenty of each at this unique event, held over four days from Friday May .As usual, the field will be filled with trucks serving everything from pizza to curry and cupcakes.

This new parliament will be pivotal in determining the nature of our future regulatory environment and we are keen and ready to meet with them.Our industry faces a number of challenges over the coming years, not just in relation to Brexit but on issues such as climate change, environmental policy, plant protection and animal health and welfare. There will also be opportunities for farming and we must ensure that we make the most of these opportunities to build a forward-looking, progressive and resilient sector that benefits farmers and consumers throughout the UK.We would like to invite all UK MEPs on to farms in their local areas to discuss a range of priority issues and to answer any questions that they might have.

Rather than trying to evade him, Taylor threw plenty of punches of his own, leaving the crowd gasping with concern on more than one occasion, but the Prestonpans ace stayed on his feet and knew he had

He goes to bed with his T rex, plays with dinosaurs constantly and knows even the complicated names of lesser-known dinosaurs.However, we have tried very consciously to allow our kids to be who they are and resist the gender stereotyping that defines what a girl should be and what a boy should be.But here was my youngest daughter, at the age of five, clearly articulating the ision between girlsrsquo and boysrsquo toys.Her list was in line with the way toys are still marketed. Often there are two versions of the same thing, one for girls and one for boys.Even some story books are defined in this way, with images and colours which are used to reinforce the gender identity of the object evengender is not specically mentioned.Donrsquot get me wrong, I have no problem that my son loves dinosaurs.But I do have a problem with marketing directed at my children to force them into a narrow definition of what toys they should like based on a patriarchal version of gender.In truth, itrsquos not so much the toys themselves but the emotions and ways of being that are deliberately connected to them.Itrsquos the idea that boysrsquo stuff promotes bravery, toughness, being fierce and adventurous, while girlsrsquo stuff promotes cuteness, romance, beauty and love.It is changing and itrsquos much better than it used to be because there is so much more awareness and debate about this issue. Gender neutral marketing is more common now, mainly as a result of public pressure.But as the conversation with my daughter shows, we still have a way to go.But does it really matter  Is it just a politically correct obsession that is making a mountain from a molehill ldquoBoys will be boys, after all, and ldquogirls are all sugar and spice, and all things nice.It really matters, of course, and I think it matters just as much for my son as my daughters, perhaps even more so.That may be controversial, but I believe that as gender stereotyping is being challenged, it is often more dficult for boys to free themselves from the traditional definition of male identity than it is for a girl.I say this as a father of four girlsand one boy.Perhaps part of the reason for this is the fact that being male is still in many ways the privileged gender, and so there is an understandable focus on removing the restrictive definition of female roles which limit opportunities for women.But the struggle for gender equality has to be a two-way processit is to be ultimately successful.We must also unshackle our boys from the narrow definition of what it is to be male, a definition which still remains powerfully entrenched in our mindsets and the way society works.I personally suffered from this when at school. I was ldquosoft, sensitive, a daydreamer. I was often made to feel I was not a proper boy. There was no space for me to realise that the lsquoladdishrsquo way of being male was not the only way.Irsquom not advocating taking the dinosaurs away from my son and forcing him to play with a unicorn or Barbie doll. Even I loved dinosaurs when I was young. But it does mean allowing him, and yes encouraging him, to explore sides to his nature that society would still label as feminine: nurture, co-operation, make-up, dresses, dancing, looking after dolls and toys, and feeling vulnerable and being allowed to express it.The best way to encourage boys to express this part of who they are is through role modelling by other men, especially in the early years of childhood when a childrsquos brain is forming, and the childrsquos view of how the world works is being created.This includes how to treat others on a personal level.So nurture and care by male family members can be a crucial part of this. But one gender inequality we rarely hear about is the fact that men make up only two per cent of early years childcare workers. And this is an inequality not just for adults, but for our children.It conveys the message to young children that caring and nurture is not a manrsquos job or a male quality. So we grow up believing this is lsquonaturalrsquo.And this idea is so entrenched that there have even been examples of parents complaining that a man is working in a nursery!Looking after children is as much a manrsquos job as it is a womanrsquos. Or it should be, and seen to be. But itrsquos not just about work, or even childcare or parenthood. Itrsquos about ways of being and understanding that there are hundreds of ways to be a man or woman and we all have the right to make our own path.Thatrsquos why itrsquos important from the beginning to show that therersquos no such thing as boysrsquo toys or girlsrsquo toys: there are childrenrsquos toys.Or perhaps more accurately, to show the emotions and qualities traditionally associated with them are not gender specic.As always, children teach us. When we got home, Lewis put his T rex to bed. ldquoHersquos tired, he said, ldquoand hersquos a nice T rex.This was my lesson from my son: a T rex can be nice.He summed up the issue as only a child can."},{"url":null,"title":"looking-back-25-years-since-east-lothians-independence","story":"Twenty-five years ago this week, the Courier proclaimed the news with the headline: ldquoItrsquos independence for East Lothian.This week, East Lothian Council chief executive Angela Leitch said: ldquoThe Local GovernmentAct of  saw the abolishment of the two-tier Region and District Councils to be replaced with  unitary authorities across Scotland.\"I believe this has greatly benefited East Lothian communities, as responsibility for major services including education and social work were decentralised from Edinburgh and instead became the focus of political decisions at a more localised level.\"Over the years, our politicians have ensured ongoing investment in all of our towns and villages, providing facilities for local people, developing our infrastructure and continually working to improve the services we deliver. This has been recognised in a iety of inspection reports that have confirmed that East Lothian Council is a high performing council and has an ethos which recognises the importance of working closely with its residents and communities.\"Our elected members all live within the county, understand local issues and can ably represent the views of communities.\"Previously, some political decisions about our county were approved by people who had no real knowledge of East Lothian.\"Local government reorganisation has improved both local democracy and the ability of local people to hold the council accountable for the decisions it takes.Here, we take a look back at how we reported the news that the county had secured its place as a stand-alone local authority in the upcoming local

can stand on its own two feet.From , the district will once again become master of its own house as an all-purpose local authority.It means East Lothian councillors will be responsible for running a full range of services ndash from education and social work to rubbish collection and recreation.The Local Government Bill which will end the -year lespan of Scotlandrsquos network of region, district and island authorities is currently going through its final stages in Parliament.And earlier this week, Mr Lang ndash supported by local Labour MP John Home Robertson ndash tabled an amendment to give East Lothian the go-it-alone status it wanted.It was the high point in a hard-fought campaign by angry locals which began last year when the Government announced its original intention to lump East Lothian in with Berwickshire.But their success in fighting off that idea was not the end of the battle ndash they still had to persuade Mr Lang and his local government minister Allan Stewart that East Lothian was NOT too small to become an authority in its own right.They had also to force them to give up alternative plans to create an East Lothian-Midlothian-West Lothian authority ndash and

are absolutely delighted with the outcome.He said it was dficult to say what eventually changed the minds of ministers.ldquoBut I have no doubt that the campaign the district council fought had a lot to do with it.He added: ldquoIf I was being charitable, I would say it was a case where the Scottish Office actually listened to the people for a change...It was, however, a ldquogreat decision for the people of East Lothian, who had supported the campaign from the start.ldquoI would like to thank all those who came out on the streets and took part in demonstrations in the early days of the campaign ndash and all those who wrote to Ian Lang in support of the idea that East Lothian should be an all purpose authority.Councillor Wanless totally rejected the previously-held Government view

pleased that the Scottish Office ministers have listened to the electorate.ldquoThe view of the electors all along has been consistent ndash that East Lothian could and should be an all-purpose authority.ldquoI believe East Lothian has the capacity and potential to become an authority on its own and its staff are well capable of serving very well the needs of all the people.He added: ldquoI am very pleased that that message has now been accepted by the Scottish Ministers and that they have departed almost entirely from their original plan.ldquoLarge is not always beautul and I think we can do better on our own.He believed the transition to a stand-alone East Lothian council would be fairly simple.ldquoThe staff structures are already on the ground and all you really need to do is build on that.ldquoI do not anticipate a great deal of dficulty.ldquoIt is a challenge.ldquoIt is something that we should think through.ldquoWe have a new council coming into being and we should try to run it in a new style way.ldquoI hope councillors will concentrate on the needs of East Lothian people and will try and make that their main concern.Said SNP councillor George Thomson: ldquoEast

morning totally unaware of the events of the previous evening which resulted in the group not allowed to remain at the park, where they were due to stay another night, after their football tournament at nearby sports pitches ended.ldquoIt was all very upsetting, he said.ldquoWe didnrsquot really know what was going on. To kick everyone out after a few incidents seems to me really unfair.ldquoThere were young kids there who were very upset and humiliated.ldquoAs I understand it, the people responsible for what happened had offered to leave so that the rest of us could stay. It seemed cruel to kick every single one of us out.ldquoWe were on the bus when members of the security team came on and cut the childrenrsquos wristbands off [for entry to the park] which was really unnecessary.ldquoMy daughter was crying, it was disgusting behaviour.ldquoWhen it came time for us to leave after packing up our stuff, we had to walk to the place of pick-up and wait for the buses, watched by security guards the whole way.ldquoWhen we got to the place we were getting picked up from, we then found out that they werenrsquot going to allow the buses into the park. My daughter had her walker with her instead of her chair and was already struggling at how far she had had to travel there was no way they could ask her to walk another fair distance to the buses.ldquoIt was after what felt like ages, and I had kicked up a bit of a fuss, they finally let the buses come down to us to collect us. It was a humiliating experience.And he claimed: ldquoThe security guards were very intimidating, especially to the children. We were all treated like criminals, even though the majority of us hadnrsquot done anything wrong.ldquoMy daughter even turned to me at one point in tears, asking: lsquoWersquove done nothing wrong, why are we getting thrown out rsquoldquoI understand some of the behaviour was unacceptable, but there were young children on the trip and they should have been taken into account before the decision was made. To punish everyone for the actions of a small few seems very unfair.Flamingo Land did not respond for requests for a comment this week,Last week, spokesperson Andy Miller said: ldquoThe anti-social behaviour which was displayed by members of the football team in question couldnrsquot be tolerated as it was interfering with other guestsrsquo enjoyment.

Trees emit chemicals too, and darken the land, thus absorbing heat. But letrsquos not quibble. The Committee on Climate Changewhich inspired last weekrsquos landmark target, is in no doubt that mass reforestation ndash and wersquore talking billions of trees ndash will be one of the major methods of scrubbing CO from the atmosphere.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeScotland is well placed to deliver on this at least. Those barren hills and glens used to be under a dense covering of foliage. The forests were cleared for agriculture and charcoal in the south, and latterly for sheep and deer in the north. So mass forestation is only restoring the ecological default in Scotland.Nice to know, too, that Scotland, on paper at least, is leading the way on meeting climate change targets, having reduced emissions by a creditable % since . This is better than the UK as a whole, which is itself a world-leader in climate control. Scotlandrsquos abundant renewable energy is going to play a major role in transforming the UK economy.Transport is one of the main areas yet to be decarbonised, and every watt of that green energy is needed to make the switch from petrol and diesel in the next decade. Itrsquos long overdue. The internal combustion engine is th-century technology, horribly complex, unreliable and inefficient. Future generations will be astonished that we allowed our city streets to remain sewers of toxic chemicals.Mind you, the Scottish Government needs to put its foot on the environmental accelerator pedal. It is three years since I wrote a series of articles on electric cars after being allowed to drive some of them around Scotland. There were precious few charging points back then, and therersquos scarcely any more now. Yet, the electrication of transport should be a relatively simple exercise.Every petrol station should be a charging station, every supermarket car park, every school and hospital. Wherever cars congregate, in fact. The good news is that no-one who tries a modern electric car will want to drive anything , because they are faster, cheaper, safer and more reliable.Of course, manufacturing any car uses prodigious amounts of energy too, requires many costly materials and produces toxic waste. Electric cars arenrsquot a solution to climate change, but electrication of transport must be, especially micro-transportation. Every city in Europe seem to be turning to those electric scooters ndash except in the UK where they are illegal. Half of the bicycles sold in Germany now are electric. People are turning naturally to more energy-efficient transport so why not give them a push :Climate clock is ticking and now is time for politicians to fightThe CCC report was rather benign on flying. Yoursquoll be pleased to know that itrsquos not being phased out. This is probably because reducing aviation requires international agreement. However, cuts in air passenger duty seem dficult to justy. The Scottish Government wants APD cut by % to attract more business and tourists to Scotland. But Nicola Sturgeon is going to have to bite the environmental bullet here. The optics are wrong. It looks too much like a middle-class subsidy, even though many working-class people swear by Ryanair.Then therersquos the nuclear conundrum. Scotlandrsquos nuclear power stations account for % of electricity generation ndash a large proportion of our nominally clean energy. But they are old and unreliable and in need of replacement. However, nuclear power stations are regardedas a safety issue following Fukushima. They are also ruinously expensive and damage the environment by producing toxic waste which needs to be stored for thousands of years.The nuclear industry leapt upon last weekrsquos CCC report as a vindication of nuclear as part of the de-carbon equation. Big money is going into painting the atom green. But the prospect of the Scottish Government commissioning a new nuclear plant, given the explosive cost of Hinkley Point C, Englandrsquos first new nuclear power station in decades, seem remote. Renewable energy is much cheaper, joule for joule,it can be brought to grid fast enough. We are in a race against time to seeTorness and Hunterston can be made redundant before they fall apart.There are other issues too. Homes need to be insulated, gas boilers are going to have to go. Wersquore told to keep our home thermostats at  degrees, when most of us donrsquot have them. Itrsquos all expected to cost -% of GDP. But what was remarkable about last weekrsquos much-anticipated report was how doable it all appeared. By comparison with the apocalyptic forecasts of the climate Cassandras, like -year-old school striker Greta Thunberg, the CCC sounded like a walk in the environmental park. Nicola Sturgeon insists that cutting carbon will improve our health and wellbeing and the quality of le. Wersquoll all be happier, cleaner and probably working less in our new habitable planet.I hope shersquos right. There was an air of wishful thinking about last weekrsquos pronouncements. But therersquos nothing wrong with accentuating the positive. The problem with the more alarmist forecasts of Extinction Rebellion, who want net zero by , is that they induce not willingness to change, but a sense of futility and public apathy. If addressing climate change is going to involve banning travel, eating no meat, digging for vegan victory and plunging the economy into a biblical recession, as we close down whole sectors of industry, then people will not buy into it. The Yellow Vest movement was ignited by an environmental tax.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeIt may well be that the climate change targets are still too conservative. According to the UNrsquos International Panel on Climate Change, CO emissions need to be cut faster to prevent the planet warming by more than .C ndash the new tipping point. But the Scottish and UK governments have consistently outperformed their targets since they started making them seriously over a decade ago. They can do so again.Much of climate hygiene is self-evident. The public are morally signed up to it, and while abandoning their petrol and diesel cars may seem a grim prospect now, in practice it is likely to be a liberation. Most cars spend their lives sitting near a pavement losing value through depreciation. With proper public transport and urban alternatives, everyone wins.Vested interests are always a block on progress, but there is now a remarkable consensus, from the CBI to the GMB, BP to the NFU, the BMA to BMW. Addressing climate change need not take us back to a pre-industrial world of squalor, disease and hardship. The human race isnrsquot over yet."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9923486.jpg?type=article-full","title":"edinburgh-airport-drama-as-plane-lands-just-two-seconds-after-another-takes-off","story":"The Norwegian Boeing  from the US was given clearance to land at Edinburgh Airport even though the easyJet Airbus A, bound for Luton, was still on the runway.An air accident investigation branchreport described it as a ldquorunway incursion, adding: ldquoThe  was over the runway surface when the A was still on its takeoff roll.The incident happened while a trainee air traffic controller was being supervised.An air navigation service review has included examining on-the-job training instructor competency and resulted in the introduction of refresher training.It also led to the introduction of higher chairs so instructors have a better viewof the trainee, the screens and theinteractions with the equipment.The rules state: ldquoA landing aircraft shall not be permitted to cross the beginning of the runway on its final approach until a preceding aircraft, departing from the same runway, is airborne.The report said there had been a \"loss of separation between the aircraft at a critical phase of flight\" between the Norwegian Boeing  which was at the end of a transatlantic flight from New York and the EasyJet Airbus A which was about to take off.The incident happened at :am on August ,last year.:Edinburgh Airport posts further passenger growthThe Norwegian crew were told to maintain a speed of at least  knots on the approach, rather than a specic speed.As a result, the Boeing approached faster than normal.The report says: A combination of factors, including brief delays to the departure of the A and the speed of the Boeing  being higher than normal, led to the reduction in separation before the controllers became aware of the closeness of the aircraft.ldquoThe trainee controller lacked the experience to resolve the situation in a timely manner and the supervising On-The-Job Training Instructor judged it safer to let the  land than to initiate a go-around in proximity to the departing aircraft.\"The incident report stated the Norwegian pilots had seen the EasyJet aircraft and checked with air traffic controlwhen they were just under a mile from the runway whether they should abort the landing.It said: \"When they received an instruction to continue their approach, they interpreted this to mean that ATC were fully in control and they followed the instruction accordingly while continuing to monitor the situation.The report said the trainee controller heard the call made by the Norwegian plane over whether to \"go around\" rather than land, \"but did not hear what they said and so turned to the training instructor who advised to respond in the negative.The trainee controller transmitted \"negative\"and \"continue approach\"to the Norwegian flight crew.The AAIB said the training instructor became aware of the situation a few seconds before the time that Norwegian crew called.A spokesman for Edinburgh Airport said: ldquoSafety is absolutely paramount in our operations, a priority shared by ANS, and we have discussed this incident in depth with them.\"We are satisfied the remedial measures put in place are robust and continue to regard safety as the number one priority.A Norwegian spokesperson said: ldquoOur flight crews are trained to the highest standards and the safety and security of our customers remains our number one priority.\"The AAIB report concluded that a number of factors led to the loss of separation between aircraft and as such the air navigation service provider has taken necessary steps to mitigate this event occurring again, at no time were Norwegianrsquos procedures questioned or the safety of our passengers compromised.An EasyJet spokesperson said: ldquoeasyJet is aware of the report and fully assisted the AAIB with its investigation.\"The safety of our passengers and crew is always easyJetrsquos highest priority."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9925582.jpg?type=article-full","title":"the-herald-launches-free-online-access-to-students","story":"Kate

Despite its size, it is so light it can be balanced on a childrsquos index finger.Visitors to his Monmouth home in Wales are often intrigued by the wooden ornament. According to Mr McGruer, they are even more fascinated to learn how it has a very special place in world aviation history. For without it, that first non-stop crossing of the Atlantic, might not have taken off.The nished wood, he explains, is a replica of one of the Vickers Vimyrsquos wing struts. Its incredible lightness ndash a crucial factor in aiding the plane as it battled across those , miles ndash was made possible due to a remarkable invention patented by his Glasgow-born grandfather, Ewing McGruer, in .The eldest son of the well-known McGruer boatbuilding family, he was known for his innovative methods in yacht construction and design, particularly the use of spars in masts and booms for racing yachts.Mr McGruer said: ldquoBy carefully examining the end grain of a thin plank of sawn Sitka spruce, he found that where the angle of the grain was # to each side of the plank, it could be placed on a metal spindle, heated on one side and with water applied to the other the wooden fibres would contract and expand respectively. The thin wood could then be bent or rolled around the spindle. Waterproof glue would be applied to each edge and planed off.The ldquorolled hollow spar could be adapted to dferent degrees of strength using wooden tubes and laminated coils. And its discovery would help revolutionise all manner of items.A McGruer rolled hollow spar boom measuring ft long was fitted to King George Vrsquos royal yacht Britannia, while the War Office commissioned London-based McGruer Hollow Spar Company to churn out scores of wing struts for fighter and bomber biplanes deployed in France.Hollow spars arefound in wireless masts, organ pipes, walking sticks, billiard cues and even the rugby posts at Twickenham.

The wind-driven electrical generator failed leaving them without radio contact, intercom and heating, while a burst exhaust pipe caused a deafening racket.But they landed after  hours in the air and were instant heroes, knighted by the king.Mr McGruer adds: ldquoI and my family take immense pride in the achievement of my grandfather."},{"url":null,"title":"jeremy-hunt-press-freedoms-must-be-defended-at-all-costs","story":"Jeremy Hunt, Foreign Secretary, will be speaking at the World News Media Congress in Glasgow today and is highlighting the need to pressurise other countries to value the role of the media.Mr Hunt is expected to tell the conference that however inconvenient media scrutiny is, it is necessary for a free society.Media executives and journalists from around the world are gathering in Glasgow today for the three-day event, highlighting the challenges facing journalism around the world.The economic challenges facing the media, issues of trust in reporting, the importance of local news and press freedom will all be discussed.Delegates from the UK will be joined by colleagues from several countries including Brazil, India, Philippines and Saudi Arabia at the event.The Foreign Secretary is one of  MPs who have declared they will be standing as a candidate in the Conservative leadership election and will be subject to close media attention.Mr Hunt is to say: ldquoDemocracy and freedom of expression mean nothing unless independent journalists are able to scrutinise the powerful ndash and discover the stubborn facts ndash however inconvenient this might sometimes be for politicians on the receiving end.ldquoIf we want to embrace the opportunities of a free society, encourage the open exchange of ideas, and pass informed judgement on our leaders peacefully through the ballot box, then we must defend the institution which enables all of this.In April, Northern Irish journalist, Lyra McKee, , was shot and killed in Derry while reporting on rioting in the Creggan area of the city.Mr Hunt will tell the conference it is a reminder that the UK is not immune to the dangers facing journalists more commonly associated with other parts of the world considered more volatile and dangerous.He will say: ldquoLast year,  journalists were killed and another  locked up by governments.ldquoIn April, Lyra McKee was murdered by dissident republicans in Northern Ireland.ldquoThe senseless killing of a talented young journalist showed that here in the United Kingdom, we have no cause for complacency.He will tell the conference that the UK and other western nations can play an important role in making the world safer for journalists and to make it dficult for regimes who are obstructive.As Foreign Secretary Mr Hunt will host a conference in July to bring together global leaders, shine a spotlight on media repression with the intention of building a coalition of governments committed to a stronger diplomatic response when media freedom is curtailed.He will say: ldquoWe cannot physically stop journalists from being locked up for doing their jobs.ldquoBut we can alert global public opinion and make sure the diplomatic price is too high.Burmese journalists Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, gained international support for their reporting of a massacre in Rakhine State for Reuters News Agency.Mr Hunt will use their case to highlight the power that the international community wields in holding those who act against journalists to accountHe will say: ldquoFrom their cells, Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo won the Pulitzer Prize for International Reporting in April.ldquoThen, last month, they were freed after the President of Burma granted a pardon and the countryrsquos civilian leaders wisely acted to correct a grave failure of due process.ldquoThe generals gained nothing from their actions because the facts emerged anyway.The World Media News Media Conference takes place at the SEC in Glasgow today until Monday."},{"url":null,"title":"more-women-and-girls-playing-football-in-scotland","story":"The total registered with the Scottish Football Associationhas risen from , in   to , in  .The figure has been rising each year, with the latest total showing , more women and girls registered with the SFA compared to the previous year.Morning!Want to watch the highlights of #SWNTs -

Westminster result in , losing the fight for our EU membership would be the final nail in our coffin.And why, they said, was then leader Tim Farron already calling for any deal to go back to the

ran a clear, honest and unambiguous campaign to stop Brexit.The result was huge gains across the country.That success followed on from our best-ever gains in English local election results at the start of May.That big, bold call we had made in  to put the Brexit deal back to the people and to campaign to remain in the EU paid off as we increased our number of MEPs from  to .So, the question now is, what next for the Liberal Democrats Well, the first thing on our to do list is elect a new leader.After two years expertly leading us in our fight for a more open, tolerant and united Britain, Sir Vince Cable has announced he is to stand down.Whoever wins that contest, they will bring in a new style of leadership to take us forward and build on our electoral revival.Our renewed strength in Brussels will also allow us to demonstrate what a dynamic and unashamedly pro-European delegation of British MEPs can do for the country.Ironically one of the advantages of the outgoing Prime Ministerrsquos refusal to compromise is the fact that, well, we havenrsquot actually left the EU yet.Three years after the referendum, we still have access to all the rights and benefits that membership brings, and our  new MEPs will be working hard to push through the reforms we can make from within the EU, including an EU-wide ban on fracking, and protecting freedom of movement.Back here at home, wersquoll continue to stand up for an outward looking country, and for our young people and their future.Whoever becomes our next Prime Minister, the Liberal Democrats will do everything in our power ndash in Parliament and out ndash to prevent him or her from taking us over the clf-edge with a catastrophic no-deal Brexit.The two big parties have been lost to their extremes, and so as the only true social democratic voice left in the UK, we will welcome all those who want to see a political party that fights for whatrsquos best for the country, and not just its own internal interests.And in Scotland, as we look towards the Holyrood elections in , we will continue to be the only pro-EU and pro-UK party.We know that Scotland is better off staying in the UK, and for that UK to remain in the EU.As the SNP Government continues to put the nationalist agenda before the problems in the NHS, our education and transport infrastructure which affect us every day, we will fight

However, this type of work would be unnecessaryeveryone took their litter home with them. We are therefore asking road users to consider the safety of workers, not to mention the environment, before throwing litter from their vehicles.“The benefits of this project are expected to be wide-ranging, including reducing congestion, improving journey time reliability and enhancing safety, as well as attracting new business and tourists to the area. “The new trunk road gives everyone a snapshot of how beautul the north east is, so keeping it free from litter will create a good impression for visitors and give everyone the chance to see the North East at its best.”Malcolm Findlay, General Manager, Aberdeen Roads Limited commented: “We would like people to take all of their litter home with them, instead of discarding it on the new trunk road, so we don’t have to ask our road workers to clear it up. Our workers are already busy patrolling the new road to ensure it is operating as it should, as well as helping road users who need assistance.“In addition, litter-picking in certain areas of the road will require temporary traffic management to be implemented, which has an impact on road users by reducing the number of lanes available.”Inspector Steve Manson from Police Scotland said: “Littering is an offence which is thankfully unacceptable to the majority of people. However, it is becoming an issue on the new road.“Workers have to be located in close proximity to fast moving traffic to remove litter and these works can themselves be a distraction to road users.

The Forum was established in January  to promote the cause of Fair Trade in Scotland and secure Fair Trade Nation status for Scotland.The SFTF is encouraging other local authorities and public bodies to recognise the International Fair Trade Charter as a common reference document for the global Fair Trade movement.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"The Junior Doric Verse competitors\"  Society hosts Strichen Festival viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"oor wullie big bucket trail to visit inverurie","story":"Cartoon favourite Oor Wullie will make his way to Inverurie this summer as part of his charity Big Bucket Trail.The town and local area will house seven sculptures as part of the first ever nationwide trail raising money for The ARCHIE Foundation, the official charity of Royal Aberdeen Children’s Hospital.Across Scotland,  Oor Wullies will be found on the streets of Aberdeen, Inverness, Dundee, Edinburgh and Glasgow.A portion of those have been allocated to Inverurie thanks to the help of local businesses.GPH Builders Merchants, Inverurie Precast, ANM Group, Tarmac, Barra Berries, the Inverurie panto and the town’s Business Improvement District have each sponsored a sculpture, with funds going to benefit sick children in Grampian.Six Oor Wullies will be found in the town, while one will be ready to discover in Oldmeldrum.Derek Ritchie, manager of Inverurie BID, said: “We are absolutely delighted that the town will be hosting a number of sculptures this summer.

When Samaritans first started, for example, homosexuality was illegal.“But people still face the same challenges they did when that first call came in.“When there is no-one  to talk to, we’re there. That’s what is at the heart of the Samaritans – the power of human connection.”Founded on the principle that trained volunteers should answer calls, that has not changed either.And it’s something that strikes very many callers who use the service.In Scotland, volunteers were contacted more than , times last year and spent more than , hours providing emotional support to people in distress.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Members of Aberdeenshire Councils Sustainability Committee: Cllr Martin Ford, Cllr Iain Taylor, Cllr Victoria Harper, Cllr Isobel Davidson , Cllr Sarah Dickinson, Cllr Colin Pike , Cllr Sandy Wallace, Cllr Anouk Kloppert, Cllr Neil Baillie\"  , Cllr Sarah Dickinson, Cllr Colin Pike , Cllr Sandy Wallace, Cllr Anouk Kloppert, Cllr Neil Baillie\"  Council pledges supportto International Fair Trade Charter viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"That’s the equivalent of  days of listening in one year alone. James said: “I’ve spoken to numerous people who have used the service. “Many of them have said that knowing a volunteer is giving up their time to help them at their lowest ebb is incredibly powerful.“When people are struggling, eventhey have family and friends close by, it can be hard for them to open up and talk about what is troubling them.“That’s particularly true of Scottish men who have a reputation for being stoic and unlikely to talk about their emotions.“However, that is also now changing and the ratio of men to women calling the Samaritans is almost  .“Men are more inclined to pick up the phone nowthey are worried or sad about something as they know that they can talk to someone at the Samaritans in the strictest confidence.“When callers phone in, it’s completely anonymous. “We can’t see your phone number or where you are calling from and you don’t even have to give your nameyou don’t want to.“All of that means people can have conversations in a way they wouldn’t normally.”Men and women contact Samaritans for a wide range of reasons including isolation and loneliness, problems with mental or physical health and worries about family and relationships. Just under a third of callers also express thoughts of suicide.Volunteers also run hundreds of community events and awareness sessions, working with a wide range of organisations including schools, colleges, foodbanks, community centres, support groups, youth groups and health and emergency services.These events help spread the message that Samaritans is there for everyone.The charity also works with a range of national and local partners to ensure suicide prevention is a priority. Samaritans runs a Prison Listening Scheme, training inmates to become listening volunteers and provide peer-support.And through its work with National Rail, it has trained thousands of rail staff in suicide prevention.Of course, operating  hours a day,  days a year means the charity needs ever more volunteers to help provide its services, which now include email and text messages too.So in this diamond anniversary year, James is hopeful of recruiting an additional  volunteers.“We have up to  volunteers, more than  of whom answer calls, emails text messages and letters,” said James. “What our volunteers do is pretty demanding – when you pick up a phone, you’ve no idea what someone is going to say to you next.“Being non-judgemental is the most important quality we look for in volunteers.“Many of our callers thank us for our advice but our volunteers don’t actually give advice – they are trained in active listening, encouraging people to share their story and work through their own problems.“We are often referred to as the fourth emergency service and demand across the UK is substantial.“That demand is not going to go away and we want to make sure we’re here for people now and in  years.“But there’s a natural turn-over of volunteers so we always need to recruit more.“We could be there for even more peoplewe had more volunteers.“So we’re looking for people of all ages and from all backgrounds to get on board.“We’d love to hear from younger volunteers as we’re looking at new technology, such as webchat, to respond to people too.“In the s and s, most people came to our branches for face to face chats now almost  per cent of our contacts are via the phone and you don’t need credit on your mobile to call us.“We can’t do online chats now but we want to make sure we’re accessible to future generations so we hope to set them up soon.”John Lawrie has been a volunteer at the Edinburgh branch for  years and has witnessed many changes.As long as his hearing remains intact, the -year-old plans to continue.Initially, though, the retired investment manager had his doubts.He said: “I never thought I’d be able to do it. But in the early s, a mini series was on TV about the Samaritans and I started wonderingit was something I could do.“So, almost on the spur of the moment, I applied. “After an initial chat, I was invited to do the training.“The intervening  years have been immensely rewarding. That might sound strange but speaking to someone in a terrible state and them ringing off  minutes later, feeling better, can be really rewarding.“I’ve not changed their le they are still in the same boat as when they first called. But talking to someone  can often help them see a way forward.“It’s a privilege to be the person that they’ve opened up to.”Some calls are, of course, harrowing but volunteers are there for each other and also debrief their manager at the end of each sht.John said: “I have spoken to people who are suicidal – we’re not there to talk them out of it. “However, we do ask them to talk about why they’re feeling so bad. “The fact they’ve called the Samaritans might mean they’re not quite as certain as they say they are.”John also enjoys visiting schools. “I often worry they’ll think I’m terribly old, which I am!” he said. “But I like to think they get on better with their grandparents.“I always end my talk by saying: “I hope you never need our service but,you do, I hope you never hesitate to use it.”Someone contacts the Samaritans every six secondsToday Samaritans has grown to become the leading charity for suicide prevention with  branches across the UK and Ireland. Someone contacts the charity every six seconds.In Scotland, volunteers were contacted more than , times last year and spent more than , hours providing emotional support to people in distress and crisis.People can contact Samaritans by phone, email, text, letter or by visiting their local branch. And in the coming years, the charity will be introducing new methods to provide emotional support including webchat.Today – just as  years ago – every call for help is answered by a volunteer. And to meet demand, the charity needs to recruit at least  volunteers in Scotland in . Anyone can contact Samaritans for free,  hours a day,  days a year. The service is anonymous, confidential and non-judgemental. You can get in touch by calling   or emailing Jo@samaritans.org or write to Chris, Freepost RSRB-KKBY-CYJK, PO Box , Stirling, FK SA. Alternatively, you can find your local branch at samaritans.org branches.There are  across Scotland including Stornoway, which had  contacts last year answered by  volunteers Aberdeen , Dundee ,

The proposal is within the flexibility granted by the Scottish Government to examine a retention allowance for ATCOs.“We requested that Prospect suspend further dates for strike action to allow consultation on our offer to take place. It is extremely disappointing that the union has chosen to ignore our request and announce a further day of strike action on June “Our aim is to resolve this dispute as soon as possible and we will, of course, continue to engage with Prospect to consult on our proposal.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

While football fans cheered Scotland’s qualication for the World Cup in Italy, at CERN in Geneva, Tim Berners-Lee was sharpening his pencil. It would be a further year before the computer scientist’s idea for an information sharing system came to fruition and he would be mulling over whether to call it The Mine of Information, The Information Mesh or just the World Wide Web. However, back in , in a horseshoe-shaped building at Heriot-Watt University known as the Origo Centre, another idea was rapidly evolving. Years ahead of its time – and possibly unforeseen by the handful of staff working there – it would go on to stake a claim as one of the UK’s first fintech businesses and – perhaps most surprising of all –continue at the forefront of the rapidly evolving sector for the next three decades. This year marks the th anniversary of Origo, the fintech powerhouse behind countless financial transactions and a key component in ensuring the nation’s financial services sector can interact faster, with less fuss and more security to bring a fluid, seamless service to its professionals and their customers. What started with just three people brought together as the s drew to a close with a vision for a behind-the-scenes framework which would enable financial service providers to communicate electronically, has now ballooned in scale,and expertise.Today, Origo employs  fintech experts. Its initial innovation, Open Standards – devised to enable the financial services to securely operate using a common set of protocols, technical details and data – is now just one component in a suite of innovative products that raise efficiency and improve outcomes for a range of businesses, organisations, financial advisers and their clients. But it’s not every day you’re . So how does the nation’s original Fintech celebrate  According to Anthony Rafferty, Origo’s managing director, there is just one way for the business that laid the foundations of Scotland’s burgeoning fintech sector to mark the occasion – and that’s to work even harder. “Origo is going from strength to strength,” he says. “We are probably the UK’s and certainly Scotland’s longest-established fintech, but we are definitely not complacent.”The MD may be considered something of a new-start compared to ‘employee number one’, Laura Reed, who turned up for work as a personal assistant on that first day in  and remains with the firm three decades on as executive assistant, but he is far from a stranger to the business. Rafferty arrived in January  with a solid career behind him in financial service businesses – among them RBS, Bank of Scotland and latterly Aviva – that make every day use of Origo’s backroom technology to ensure smoother, smarter transactions. It was a bit like coming home for Rafferty – he was raised in Wester Hailes, a stone’s throw from that Heriot-Watt building where it all began. And it should be borne in mind that Origo was established a year before the first web browser was launched. Rafferty reflects: “Pension and le insurance companies must have been bemoaning the fact that doing stuff electronically was expensive and for the financial advisers they were interacting with, it was very inconsistent, because each company was doing it dferently.”Initially, four financial services businesses were on board with Origo. Two operators seconded from Standard Le and Norwich Union were charged with establishing common processes which would ensure that everyone involved spoke the same technical language, so issues such as getting quotes and sending data became so much more simple and secure. Before long the operation’s original name, Open Framework for Intermediary Services, was changed to Origo and its first portal – its ground-breaking Open Standards – was launched  months after. Flick the calendar forward dramatically and Origo is now based at Edinburgh Park and owned by  UK financial services shareholders – among them Aviva, Scottish Widows, Aegon, Prudential and Standard Le – whose priceless input ensures that its products are precisely what the industry needs and wants. The scale of Origo’s contribution to the financial services sector is impressive its fintech solutions provide secure access for eight-out-of-ten UK financial advisers to a wide range of financial businesses, enabling them to authenticate themselves instantly and carry out fuss-free, fast transactions on behalf of their clients. At the same time, Origo engages with a range of industry bodies, s, portals, software suppliers and government bodies to seek out ways to increase efficiency and reduce costs. Among its most signicant products is the Origo Transfer Service. Launched in , it has smoothed the passage of £ billion worth of pension and ISA transfers, providing a faster and safer system which benefits financial advisers, their clients and financial services business.At last count, the innovation was being used by almost  financial service companies. The transfer technology means that a transaction that might oncehave taken several weeks to carry out is cut to a few days and, in some cases, hours. Nevertheless, it is just one of a range of Origo services. And with  years behind it, Rafferty is clear on what the ‘magic formula’ is for the fintech’s success. “We have been quite canny in how we have done things,” he says. “Because we’re owned by  dferent financial service companies, we have access to the users of our services. “We have great focus groups with key users of potential services who help to influence development plans. We research things well with our customer base – we tend to get things right.”One example is the Origo Integration Hub. Designed for s and adviser software systems, users just plug in once to open up connections with every other hub party. It helps protect against risk, lowers costs and takes care of any operational or legislative changes.  In the spirit of constant evolution, Origo has now launched a new tracking element, so financial advisers can follow clients’ transfers online in real-time, eliminating the prospect of chasing for progress updates. “We stay very close to customers,” Rafferty adds. “Our second key ingredient is that our staff are world experts in fintech. That’s really important. “Thirdly, we are creative and flexible. We try stuff out and we are not afraid to fail. We check out ideas, but we don’t test stubbornly and continueit’s not working.”Launching soon is a highly-secure e-mail service, which Rafferty describes as a “game changer”. “It’s relatively easy for fraudsters to read someone’s e-mail as it goes over the internet,” he explains. “It’s no safer than sending a postcard with your bank details through the post, and even encrypted e-mails have problems. “We are launching Unipass Mailock for securing e-mails. Unipass is already well known –  per cent of financial advisers use it every day.”Unipass Mailock features world-class encryption so users can be confident their message is only read by intended recipients with an automatic read receipt as standard. It also removes the terror of an accidental ‘send’ users can recall an e-mail and remove all trace of it. Rafferty is full of praise for FinTech Scotland and Scottish Financial Enterprise’s efforts to nurture new businesses, support the more established and recognise their efforts. It’s a source of pride that Origo was among five businesses shortlisted for Scottish Financial Enterprise’s  Scottish Financial Services Award.And, of course, he is constantly looking forward – blockchain technology is just one area being scrutinised by Origo – keen to broaden the fintech’s horizons, perhaps to an international level.“I’d like to think that in  years’ time we’ll be celebrating  years of Origo all over the world,” he adds. “There’s huge potential to do what we do in other countries.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"div","story":"A DIVE vessel with  women on board was escorted into port after she began taking in water off Shetland on Sunday. issued a mayday call in bad weather soon after midday when she was approximately eight miles east of Sumburgh Head.

Fishermen will always need a market for their landings and remote farmers and crofters know Europe tries to look after them even though nationally agribusiness seeks to pocket too much subsidy. Overall a victory for hope not hate. Lest we forget what international solidarity and cooperation sounds like:Love it. What a wonderful man and what a great work – one of Europe’s greatest composers and one of Europe’s greatest poets – a sublime combination. Here’s to Europe and Europeans: Wo dein zanfter Flügel weiltThis has always been my favourite stanza, but I’ve yet to find a satisfactory English translation – one that conveys the humanity as well as the poetry. Would you happen to have one Peter as ian says your discount the exit tories and labour. and best for remain itsa draw at worse its a good win for leave.In Britain, the total Remain vote was larger than the total Leave vote :. you claim that is not true.O dear me, Peter, you have absolutely forgotten both the Tories and the Labour voters. What you have counted was the Leave without a deal of any type vote  and your figure of  includes voters who may care nothing about the EU but are considering a host of other reasons for casting their vote.LOL The London Liberals’ view of democracy:“Dear plebs, we’re honouring you by asking your advice on which of two options # Leave or Remain # you want us to adopt .” 🙂Alternative description of London Liberals:They made it % clear that they want to withdraw Article  and remain in the EU.They expressed this view in language that was so clear that not a single person could misunderstand them.Millions of London plebs agreed with them and voted Liberal, so they won the election.If you saw anything dferent John, I suspect your moving picture wireless needs re-tuning.Would you say the same about the SNP in Scotland, Malcolm Liebe Rosa, you’ve fairly thrown down the gauntlet there!I agree, each translation has issues, but happily help is at hand within Shetland culture. Schiller was surely making a typically Enlightenment-era appeal for people everywhere to enjoy brotherhood or solidarity, irrespective of the irrational isions imposed on us, saying that joy in this reunites us. He knew it was chance that saw us on one side or another of any nationalist driven war, and wanted to emphasise the need for healing and togetherness.It’s a concept of course that also is captured by Robert Burns ten years after Schiller in: For a’ that and a’ that, or Trotz alledem und alledem, as it also became in . The final lines guaranteed translation into many other language too:Shall brithers be for a# thatSchiller would also have recognised the romantic sensibilities which informed Shetland’s Up-Helly Aa, or unserer feuer-trunken Faschingsdeinstag, ob du wilst. I think these lines from the closing verse of The Galley Song capture Schiller’s intention perfectly:O’er stre the curtain drawHappy to see Europe inspiring Shetland still!#Schiller was surely making a typically Enlightenment-era appeal for people everywhere to enjoy brotherhood or solidarity, irrespective of the irrational isions imposed on us#Unless of course they#re English eh Peter. You want to separate scotland from the rest of the UK yet come out with the PC BS above. just who are you trying to kid I wondered when the anti- English racist rhetoric would raise its ugly head on here. Rule Britannia was actually written by Thomas Arne a Roman Catholic who was proud to be British. He’d get short shrt on the so called Liberal Shetland Islands.The first  notes of Beethoven#s Fth. Lest we forget how Europe became free.And there is a big world out there we don#t need EuropeIt wasn’t of course ever a one way street. Garve, a contemporary of Schiller and Goethe, did a great to broadcast the gains of the Scottish Enlightenment by translating and accrediting the works of Smith, Hume, Ferguson, Hutcheson, Reid and others, to the extent that Goethe himself, though perhaps before his heyday, said there was nowhere in Europe that could hold a candle to what was happening in Scotland. It would be unreasonable to suggest Burns did not become familiar with the thoughts of Kant, Rousseau, Locke, and other European philosophers, directly or indirectly, in the salons of Edinburgh. It would similarly be a nonsense to suggest that Haldane had no exposure to all this. His inspiration cannot be orced from the earlier flourishing of inspirational ideas of brotherhood and equal worth that happily live on yet. Shetland, after the Napoleonic era, seems to have been quite a radical place to a degree, as the later broken-promise legal challenges possibly demonstrate. There was also a legal challenge related to a whale grounding in Sandwick which seemed fairly radical in intent. The underpinning ideas don’t appear to respect the random lines drawn on maps that seem to dominate some people’s thinking.Some lines are more equal than others eh Peter The modern Labour movement of course grew out of the earlier Liberals, with many older ideas and values broadly held in common. Opening the debate, crossbencher, Lord Lisvane saw a problem where Scotland and Northern Ireland, as two of four parts of the United Kingdom, backed Remain, yet could be dragged out of Europe against their will. He identied #a sort of imperial condescension from the centre—from Westminster and Whitehall# and sought #a devolution settlement properly owned by its participants# that would #include something perhaps missing from the present arrangements: the R word—respect.#Most Scots voted to continue their solidarity with Europe, whilst a signicantminority of English and Welsh voters would apparently risk sacricing their older union with Scotland in order to Leave. Schilleradvocated seeking broadminded and warmhearted company. Should the UK falter, will it be those who sought to continue to enjoy the benefits of the wider degree of solidarity who are really to blame .."},{"url":null,"title":"spurs thrash celtic in madrid cup final ","story":"The Spurs team celebrate their big win in the Madrid Cup final.

They were among the first pioneers in planting English and Scots settlers in Ireland. But by , Smiths settlement failed and the lands reverted to the crown.On  May , King James I granted the Ballymena Estate to another native Irish nobleman, Ruairiacute Oacuteg MacQuillan. The estate passed through several owners, eventually passing into the possession of William Adair, a Scottish laird from Kinhilt in southwestern Scotland.The estate was temporarily renamed Kinhiltstown after Adairs lands in Scotland. The original castle of Ballymena was built in the early th century, situated to take advantage of an ancient ford at the River Braid.In  Charles I confirmed the grant of the Ballymena Estate to William Adair, giving him the right to hold a market at Ballymena on every Saturday. He hired local Irish as workers on the estate they served as tenant farmers for much of the next two centuries and more.And from those early days, Ballymena became a commercial hub for central Co. Antrim, steadily growing in prosperity through the years of the linen boom in the th century.Until recent years, the traditional market had been held at the area known as the Fair Hill on lands bordered by upper Broughshane Street, William Street and Thomas Street.When the area was sold for the development of what is now the Fair Hill Shopping Centre, the Saturday market was moved to its current venue near the Seven Towers Leisure Centre.And that is pretty much where the whole tradition kicked off nearly  years ago as the site is pretty much right in the front garden of what used to be the Adair familys residence in Ballymena!Mid and East Antrim Borough Council is urging you to come enjoy, explore and love your local market this May as part of UK wide campaign to support our local traders. ‘Love Your Local Market’ runs from - May.

They get to meet the young ones and they’ve prepared lunch for the kids so they’ll get to sit down and have a meal together where the young ones can learn about the service provided here.”She added: “The garden is looking impressive with all the dferent colours.

They’re also developing teamwork skills and communication skills. They’re able to help the community, but it’s also part of their qualication too.”He added: “One of the residents came in one day and spoke to the young ones about the choices that he made that led him here.

Once the recommendations are adopted, they will be dficultnot impossible to change for at least the next election, which may affect how inidual constituents are represented for several years.

Given the very signicant effects of any legal error on the part of the Commission – and the essentially irreparable nature of those errors, the Court quite correctly exercised an intense level of scrutiny and arrived at the correct conclusion that the Boundary Commission had fallen into legal error and acted in a procedurally unfair way in this instance.”A further hearing on the th June  will decide on the final remedies and order in the case."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"largest tv in ireland on sale in west belfast electronic store","story":"CUSTOMERS in Noel Grimley Electrics did a double take on Wednesday afternoon as the latest in TV technology was unveiled.The ” Samsung QLED, the first in the north, was unveiled – just in time for Saturday’s Champions League final between Liverpool and Spurs.“It’s great to see the TV displayed in the store,” said owner Eamon Grimley, “we are a big Samsung dealer and were the first in the north to sell the K TV.

In April, he took up the head chef post at the Malone Lodge Hotel, where he had previously worked as a Senior Sous Chef before a seven-year spell working abroad. Although his new role may be viewed as a veritable homecoming, it could well be his most exciting challenge yet.Liam first started his career in the industry working as a waiter in the Europa Hotel – a summer job that would soon see him step behind the line in the kitchen. Reflecting on those early days, the Clonard man said: “The passion of the chefs had for food, the flavours and the way they were plating stuff up really inspired me. It was good to see that buzz in the kitchen.“Yes, it is a stressful environment, but the guys all have fun. They all work towards one goal and they’re all one big family. It doesn’t matter what kitchen you go into, they’re all family –one person goes down they all go down, which just shows the teamwork. When I first watched the guys in the Europa it just bit me and I wanted to be a chef after that.”Liam’s flair for cooking and his desire to learn inspired him to gain chef’s qualications, and garnered further opportunities including the chance to work at the inimitable James Street South.He later went to work at the Malone Lodge Hotel, where his skills brought critical acclaim in  he became one of six finalists in prestigious European Chef of the Year Awards. Liam was the only chef in the finals from a non-Michelin starred restaurant and eventually picked up a bronze award for his five-course menu that showcased the best local and seasonal produce. His passion for seasonality and high-quality produce is something that has stuck with him to this day.“I like to stick to the classics,” he explained.“Classics are classics for a reason. Sometimes I’ll twist it as best as I can, but I always try to keep the flavours clean and seasonal. It’s basically just good food that everybody can enjoy. It doesn’t matter what your dietary requirement, we can cater for it.“We’ll always try to make a dish that is gluten free or dairy free so that we don’t have to tell people they can’t have it. We’ll twist a classic dish to more clean or refined flavours so that everybody can enjoy it.”When Liam left Belfast for Guernsey seven years ago he felt it may well have been for good. His move brought success, of course – he headed the team at Guernsey’s most popular restaurant, the Slaughterhouse – however, when the Malone Lodge offered him a new opportunity it was a challenge he could not pass up, and one he is meeting with his typical enthusiasm for food.“I’ve been bringing seasonality back into the restaurant. I’ve been making Macklin’s Bar back into a bar where people can come for a few pints and have chicken, ribs – bringing back real pub grub,” he said.“We’re making sure the lobby is buzzing again with people enjoying scones, teas, coffees and paninis – just having a bit to eat and drink and relaxing.“We’re bringing the restaurant back to what it was a nice hotel restaurant that is there for families, kids, and everybody so that they can have a nice sit down meal. It’s not just for customers who are staying in the hotel – it’s for the people of the area, people from all over Belfast, or people just visiting.”He continued: “The response has been very very good. I’ve come in at a crazy time with tour groups coming in, we’ve had holy communions coming in, but the feedback has all been positive. People like what they see happening and what they’re getting, and they like that they are getting good value for money.”Although Liam felt he might live in his home city again, he insists hiswas the right move. With Belfast’s ever growing food culture and tourism industry, it could not have come at a better time.“Belfast has always been a booming city – it’s basically like a mini London,” he said.“It is always evolving and the food is always evolving. We have some amazing chefs. You have people like Stevie Tolman, who is a Michelin starred chef at OX – I worked with him in James Street South – I think it’s amazing what he does. Every chef bouncing off each other is the whole point of it.“I think it’s brilliant for Belfast’s tourism and the city as a whole. We’re able to show how we’re moving forward to a better place. You can actually go out now and enjoy a nice meal. When I was younger you maybe went out for your communion and you were luckyyou got a steak. People are now trying dferent things, they’re experimenting with food, and they are opening their minds to the dferent things you can eat. There are a lot of Asian restaurants and a lot of other multicultural restaurants in Belfast, which brings a lot of passion and a lot of enjoyment for everybody.”He continued: “I’m happy that I’ve been asked to come back and take over the kitchen. It brings a lot of pride because I was here when it was the old restaurant and then I was here when it got done up.“It’s good to be able to show these guys in the kitchen where hard work gets you and what we can do together. I want to give a bit of guidance and teach them things that I’ve learned and the stuff that I’m still learning. I’ve been away for seven years, but I’m proud to be back. I would have come back maybe once a year, but I’ve always missed Belfast and I’ve always been a West Belfast boy, so I’m glad I got the opportunity.”"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38163421.ece/9197d/AUTOCROP/w620h342/plaza.jpg","title":"belfast benefit centre staff spat out of windows and hurled objects onto the street below","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsEU Elections Top  CompaniesNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The parties are currently engaged in talks attempting to restore devolved government with civil servants responsible for running the country.Asked about her message to the local politicians, Baroness Paisley said they needed to \"lay aside their baggage and face facts\".\"So many petty things, they dont see the big picture,\" she said.\"So many people are crying out for help and they are failing them by not taking responsibility.\"It is going to get worse and that leaves us open to all sorts of trouble.\"She added: \"I would say to them cut out the petty things and dwell on things that matter - think of the people.She said she was \"aggrieved\" the  MLAs were still taking a salary and it was not fair on civil servants to be doing the job of elected representatives.\"It is abominable for people to take money for nothing,\" she added, \"they are not doing the job they were elected to do.\"Baroness Paisley also said the parties needed to be more open with the public, adding: \"There is nothing in the open, what goes on is hidden.\"We are all sinners no matter who we are or what we are.She was asked about the DUP fielding its first openly gay candidate, Alison Benningtion and the subsequent resignations from the party after her successful election, including her late husbands brother in law and how some have said the late Ian Paisley would be \"turning in his grave\".\"We are all sinners no matter who we are or what we are.. that girl may not know Christ died for her,\" she said.\"I do not hate Ms Bennington, I dont know the girl. I dont hate anybody no matter who they are or what they have done against me.\"But we have to love Christ first and what He says we have to obey his word. These things are written for our benefit.\"Baroness Paisley said she hoped the party was not making a move away from the ethos her husband established the party under.\"It was a decision taken at the time and I think it was taken as a defiance to see what would happen.\"And I think it should be put to the whole party and a proper decision made on what should be done.\"Turning to Brexit and Arlene Fosters comments on leaving the countrya united Ireland came about, Eileen Paisley said it would take an \"awful lot\" for her to move saying so long as their was freedom of religion she would remain.\"I would not like a dictatorship or someone whatever their religion was to be persecuted because of that.\"It is a big question. If we go right back to the beginning, the iding of Ireland. The people or Ireland, north, south, east and west, I think are a great people.\"No matter what part of Ireland a person is from.. they are a fellow country man or woman.\"I just wonder why it had to be ided at that time and I think that was the wrong ision. It is too big an issue for me to ponticate on.\" I dont want my mind and soul to be poisoned with an unforgiving spirit.Baroness Paisley said she missed her late husband more, and more every day and she was told many times by others across the political ide and the communities his leadership was missed.She recalled how her husband wanted to be a farmer when he was a young boy and it was when sowing corn he heard the call from God that it was not he seed He wanted Ian to sow.She said in his first sermon in Sixmilecross in Co Tyrone he spoke for only  minutes before running out of material and immediately vowed to never speak again.\"And the man that was taking him told him youll speak all right, and so his words were fulfilled,\" she said.In his final years the Free Presbyterian Church ostracised its founder. Baroness Bannside said it was \"very callous\" but pointed to Jesus and how despite all he had done for his people, was crucied.Baroness Bannside said she no longer worships at the Free Presbyterian Church as it would \"leave her open\" instead going to her granddaughters husbands baptist church.\"I just put it away, I dont bother... I live my own live with my own family and I am content to do that,\" she added.\"It was dficult to forgive them but I have to get on.

Notwithstanding their success at the polls, the Brexit Party and fellow travellers only managed to equal the number of votes gained by remainers. And in Northern Ireland the election merely underlined that a majority of people here want to remain in the EU.Read MoreMEPs to earn £, plus expenses for four months’ work...Brexit happens in OctoberEilis OHanlon: Why we should celebrate Northern Ireland having three female MEPsAlban Maginness: Old political certainties well and truly swept away by historic Euro electionEU election results: Diane Dodds, Naomi Long and Martina Anderson are Northern Irelands MEPs amid Alliance vote surgeThat is not to dismiss either Brexit or Alliance who performed magnicently, chiefly by giving voters a clear message on where they stood. For Alliance it showed there is a middle ground between the DUP and Sinn Fein and that it is best placed at this moment to occupy it.Now the action switches to Westminster and the backstabbing free-for-all that will pass as a Tory party leadership campaign. Up to  candidates could take part but it seems inevitable that any winner will have to be a committed Brexiteer.That will be music to the ears of the DUP who will continue to hold the balance of power in Parliament and one Tory leadership candidate, Jeremy Hunt, has already promised to include them in his negotiating team, although why they had not insisted in being on Theresa Mays team in the first instance is a puzzle.The problem for any potential new Prime Minister is that none of the candidates has come up with a feasible alternative to the border backstop which has always been the stumbling block in finding an acceptable exit agreement. Brexit is like Northern Irelands devolution impasse. Everyone knows what the problems are but no one is prepared to compromise to break the logjam. The worry in parochial terms is that the current Stormont talks will run into the ground through lack of interest from Westminster, the DUPs pivotal position in Parliament which will demand a lot of the partys energies, and Sinn Feins soul searching after poor election performances in the Republic and a less than glowing effort on this side of the border.Meanwhile, the UK has to leave the EU by Halloween at the latest, a ghoulish prospect given that many of the Tory leadership candidates are avowed leave at any cost purists."},{"url":null,"title":"full recount ordered for ireland south european parliament constituency","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsEU Elections Top  CompaniesNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I know that many of them do not agree with the stance that I have taken to our future relationship with the European Union,” he told LBC radio. “It’s very important in this competition that there are candidates expressing clearly the view that we must have a negotiated settlement and that we must have a close future trading partnership with the European Union.“But I think it’s probably better that somebody less isive within the party than me is making those arguments.”Mr Hammond, in a speech to the Resolution Foundation think tank in Westminster on Thursday morning, said one of the central tasks for the next prime minister would be to demonstrate the benefits of a “properly regulated market economy”.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Philip Hammond at the Resolution Foundation Leadership contenders are already setting out plans to cut taxes in an effort to appeal to the grassroots Tory members who will decide on the next occupant of Number .Dominic Raab has pledged to cut income tax by a penny a year – p over the course of a parliament to just p in the pound for the basic rate – which critics have claimed would cost £ billion.Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has also adopted a tax-cutting approach, although he suggested slashing corporation tax to Irish levels of .%.The Chancellor said: “Whoever the next prime minister is, one of his or her central tasks will be to show a new and sometimes sceptical generation that a properly regulated market economy remains the most powerful force available to us for unlocking aspiration and raising living standards.On the right the argument for radical tax cuts, deregulation and smaller government is gaining ground.Philip Hammond“And bold, decisive action on the national living wage, sustainably delivered, will be an important demonstration of the power of that argument and a necessary step to rebuild confidence in the politics of the centre ground.“Because that centre ground is under threat. On the left, the Labour Party characterises business as the real enemy. On the right, the argument for radical tax cuts, deregulation and smaller government is gaining ground, just as our population demographics are making them harder to do.“And as we look to rebuild the case for centre ground politics we should take a bold step in writing the next chapter in the story of statutory minimum wages in the UK. “A story which began under the Labour government of  – but which took a giant step forward under the Conservative government in  – so that we demonstrate once again that the well-regulated market delivers for all our people.”He said a gap had opened up in Britain and other developed countries between the “theory of how a market economy and free trade creates and distributes wealth and the reality experienced by many ordinary people”.“We ignore that gap at our peril becausewe do not address it, it will be filled with the reckless promises of the populists,” he warned. “But that doesn’t mean we should abandon our economic model.“So, for those like me who believe passionately that harnessing the power of market economics is the only way to deliver progress… it is imperative that we take decisive action to show that the regulated market model can deliver higher wages and higher living standards.”Mr Hammond earlier hinted that he would support a second referendumParliament cannot resolve Brexit. He told BBC Radio ’s Today programme: “If we do get to the point where Parliament does admit that it cannot resolve the situation, then it will have to be remitted back to the people.“I am not sure that a general election can resolve the question for the simple reason that both the main political parties are ided on the issues. This is a ision that runs not between the parties, but through the parties.“We need a period of calm now before contemplating the possibility of a general election.“My strong preference is for Parliament to resolve this butParliament can’t resolve it, then Parliament will have to decide how we remit it back to the people, whether it is in the form of a general election, or a referendum.”"},{"url":null,"title":"catherine of aragon leaves twitter users puzzled as the former queen trends","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsEU Elections Top  CompaniesNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It is definitely an iconic part of the lough.In the late s, maritime archaeologist Thomas McErlean and a team from Ulster University stumbled upon the worldrsquos earliest known tide mill during an excavation at Strangford Lough.Discovered close to the remains of Nendrum Monastery on Mahee Island, Thomas recalls the signicance of unearthing this medieval tide mill.Thomas says: ldquoThis was a site we got so excited about, we knew we were changing the course of Irish archaeology and indeedhellip industrial archaeology. We were breaking new ground and it was absolutely wonderful.In recent times, Strangford Lough has become an important site for tidal energy research and in  the worldrsquos first commercial tidal turbine was built near Portaferry.The turbine is now being decommissioned and local marine expert Simon Rogers, who is working on the removal, reveals the impact the tide has on operations.

Based on a five acre site at Kennedyrsquos Lake, the retreat has been visited by disabled groups who abide by the ethos of lsquofishing for funrsquo.No lead weights or barbs are allowed. Once a fish is caught and photographed it is released back into the lake.Robert explains that with the help of his close aide and fellow veteran, Nigel Cree, who is a director of Letrsquos Do Veterans Support, the net has been widened and that an invitation is being extended to anyone within the local community who wants to try out fishing.While battling to overcome his disability, Robert discovered there was little or no help for disabled veterans available in his community.Facing an interminable series of bad news on his journey to recovery he viewed the opportunity to be given a role in the British Limbless Ex-Servicemenrsquos Association as his saving grace.Robert said: ldquoWhen I got involved I saw people much worse off than myself. Some veterans had catastrophic injuries. I began to gain qualications in helping other people in the same situation as me. This helped me with my own recovery and give me a focus.ldquoMy house is down by the lake. One evening I was sitting observing how peaceful it was and it got me thinking about how I could put the lake to good use. In hindsight, the idea saved me from myself.ldquoI got a small team involved and before we knew it we had been successful in attracting funding to construct a car park, create fishing stands and a foot bridge, stock the lake with indigenous course fish and install an eco-toilet with disabled access.ldquoThere was no stopping half way through and the gamble has paid off with a successful opening and an encouraging demand for bookings growing each day.Robert describes himself as ldquonot being a lsquotea and biscuits man and doesnrsquot like to stand on ceremony.He continued: ldquoI have been helped by a devoted team of helpers and I would like to pay tribute to each of them and I dedicate this achievement to them and the three other veterans I started with who gave me great encouragement.ldquoIrsquod also like to thank Alpha Concrete, Hamilton Brothers and Cunningham Stone who were exceptional in their work with memorial plaques which have been erected.Robert said he hopes to provide fishing workshops in the near future and to get more people using the retreat.He added: ldquoA lot of time and money has been invested and when strangers visit we would ask them to adhere to the rules. They can contact me to book a session and pay a minimum day fee.For more information on Clough fishing retreat and for other initiatives which Letrsquos Do Veterans Support carry out, visit www.letsdoevents.info or contact Robert on  ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Event marking Men’s Health Week  ","story":"THE St Patrick Centre in Downpatrick is hosting a special event next month to mark Menrsquos Health Week.Between June  and June , the centre dedicated to Irelandrsquos patron saint will feature an exhibition of art, craft and woodwork by members of the townrsquos Menrsquos Shed.The shedders are busily preparing for the exhibition with visitors welcome to view the work on display and learn about the work of the organisation in the community.The Menrsquos Shed aims to promote positive mental health and wellbeing to men over the age of  with the organisation offering a sizeable, well-equipped workshop at its Ballydugan Road industrial estate.There, shedders make wooden items to order such as garden seats and planters and they also produce items for community and conservation projects, like bird, bat and owl boxes for the National Trust.The Menrsquos Shed also offers opportunities for people to learn new practical skills including art, wood carving, clay, copper and leather work.

He instigated the tournament and hopes his successors will continue with it.He continued: ldquoDuring my year we had the opportunity to salute Dermot Curran, one of our long standing councillors mdash in fact the longest serving in Northern Ireland mdash with whom we enjoyed a fantastic night.ldquoIt was also a pleasure to lead our St Patrickrsquos Day parade in my home area which was really special for me.

As a district, this is something that we need to take seriously, and not necessarily just rising sea levels.Mr Murnin believes that increased rainfall is going to make a dramatic dference to the way buildings and roads are designed, also highlighting the need to look at alternative energy forms.He added: ldquoBuilding for the future and how a modern city should look like will also be important. One thing that struck me looking out from the observation tower at the One World Center in New York was that the city is surprisingly green as so many of the buildings have roof top gardens and trees.

Those that are successful are provided with financial support for one year only.It is a system that the chairwoman of the Bishopscourtrsquos playgroup is keen to see changed.Mrs Patricia Curran, who revealed that Tiny Toons recently missed out on Pathway funding by a narrow margin, said playgroups did a ldquomagnicent job, particularly in rural area where working parents rely heavily upon them.She said playgroups look after children at the most critical time in their development and need to be provided with financial certainty.A number of playgroups across the district revealed recently that they were organising additional fundraising activities to generate income and were appealing for donations of everyday essentials including toilet paper, wipes, photocopying paper and even bin bags.Mrs Curran revealed that Tiny Toons only found out about the strategic support fund by chance and while pleased the cash will pay staff wages over the summer, fresh funding applications will have to be made at the start of next year to cover costs.ldquoWhile we narrowly missed out on Pathway funding, we have secured other support from a fund which we knew nothing about, she continued.ldquoThe money we have secured will keep us ticking over. We are not saying everything is hunky dory as a result of this particular finance. We have money to pay for  childrenrsquos places from next September which is good. The money secured under the strategic support fund will pay our staff over July and August.Mrs Curran said that had the playgroup not been made aware of the strategic fund it would have been a ldquovery dferent story.ldquoWhile securing funding comes as a relief, it does not provide us with any degree of certainty. We will have to make a fresh application for Pathway funding at the start of next year and go through this process all over again, as we and others do every year, she continued.Mrs Curran said Tiny Toons and other playgroups across the district were operating in a ldquochallenging financial climate.ldquoThe provision of ring-fenced funding is vital for us, she declared. ldquoWhile things are fine for now, we know that come the New Year we will have to start filling in funding application forms again.ldquoRing-fenced funding for a two or three-year period would provide certainty and help playgroups operate in a climate where there would not be a cloud hanging over them.ldquoThe funding issue affects all those in the education sector and I read recently that one headmaster warned that his school could be forced to only open four days a week as it did not have enough money.Mrs Curran said that while strategic support funding has provided Tiny Toons with short term relief, guaranteed ring-fenced financial support would provide certainly and allow future planning.She added: ldquoGiven the current funding model, there is always uncertainty hanging over us. We are voluntary workers and we should not have this pressure on our heads. That said,we did not do this work, who  is going to do it ldquoNot many people want to do voluntary work any more because of the pressure involved. We in Bishopscourt were worried about paying our staff and have been provided with some relief.

They set off, quickly deciding to start the race on the green paddock below the lodge .The decision to start there had far-reaching consequences for just adjacent to the chosen start location, come Thursday at pm, a camping couple decided to cook dinner on a makesht stove - they must have been planning a quiet romantic evening with stunning views and just as they had sat down, Frank Morgan, the perennial starterwith his flags and tape followed soon after by hundreds of runners and spectators gathering beside them - no need for them to put on the TV, they had all the live entertainment they needed.Back to Monday evening and the lsquocourse recce crewrsquo followed the Trassey river, crossing it before the hard climb up Slievenaglough, then following the green shoot up to the first check point at its summit.Then it was the technical descent down and up to the summit of lesser-known Lukersquos Mountain and from there making their way home.Mountain leader and rescue stalwart, Ian McCracken fell not once, but twice going over on his ankle badly mdash thankfully, no need for the mountain rescue as the lsquoProphetrsquo was there to guide him home safely mdash poor Ian, after all the winter preparation there would be no Thursday evening race for him.As the runners milled around , Pete Grant, who was surprisingly wearing his club vest for a change, must have had a category win on his mind, as he moaned and groaned about the long, sharp start, delaying the time before he could get his shoes properly mucky.Later on, however, that would be the least of his worries as for some reason he decided to leave his car keys somewhere out on the open mountain at a grid reference that to the present time only God knows.As Frankrsquos whistle was blown at ::the  runners charged off up the track and onto the open mountain.The route, mostly on sheep paths, took them directly onto the craggy summit of Slievenaglough that is part of the Mourne Wall route - a mountain that meant something on Thursday evening rather than just being an anonymous part of the route from the Harersquos Gap to Commedagh.Positively, pretty much everyone successfully reached the cut-off point of  minutes for the first mile that included around  feet of climbing.Newcastle ACrsquos Seamy Lynch had established a comfortable lead early in the race, clear of his club mate Mark Stephens with Newry ACrsquos Esther Dickson also comfortable in the womanrsquos race, ahead of Karen Wilton from Lisburn and Mourne runner Sarah Graham.It should have been plain sailing for everyone, but as often happens, the low cloud rolled in onto the ridge between Slievenaglough and Lukersquos and the summit of Lukersquos disappeared from view. We are still not sure that everyone made it there, but what is certain is that everyone made it back.Legal counsel Higgins lives le in the fast lane, balancing defending the indefensible in one court room or another with le on the farm and a Viking love nest in Tullybrannigan.If therersquos controversy in a sport not known for its controversy, Higgins perhaps will not be too far away - gamekeeper turned poacher  On the way home he chose his own line and clearly there had been some pillow talk, for she did too - slightly dferent, but both probably crossed the moral line, but probably not far enough to be eligible for a criminal conviction.His talk of bringing his finely honed orienteering skills to the table was not convincing the lsquoBroken Wing Commanderrsquo, but despite his protests supported strongly by the lsquoHenrsquo, the directors have no appetite for years in court ending in the European Court of Justice, no doubt, so the results stand.A fine run from Ballydrain junior Jared Martin to come home in third - a big star for the future  Many of the runners remarked this was the best HD course in years and it was great to freshen the series up with a new route - food for thought for the organisers for  Many thanks to all at Meelmore Lodge for the use of their facilities in this beautul location, the marshals, time keepers and people behind the scenes who keep the series running smoothly each week.Thanks also to the Avoca Hotel  Spa on their excellent food and beverages, by order of Jack OrsquoHare.Tomorrow night sees theto Millstone with full body cover required.

But the solution employed back in  during a major inspections backlog caused by industrial action – issuing temporary certicates to allow motorists to continue to use their vehicles – appears to have been ruled out.Asked by the News Letter whether any consideration is being given to issuing some form of exemption for drivers caught up in the backlog, the department simply said it is “generally an offence” to use a vehicle without a test certicate unless it is being taken to or from either a “place of repair” or a testing centre.Another local businessman, Terry McWilliams of McWilliams Car Sales in Craigavon, said his employees are spending at least an hour on the phone every day to find appointments.“I am having to get them to spend an hour to an hour-and-a-half on the phone looking for a cancellation every day,” he said. “That’s time that could be spent doing other work.Omagh bomb: fourth man pursued for damages declared bankrupt Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“My big problem is thatyou have a car and someone is buying it, and it only has four or five months MOT, they want to buy that car with a full year’s MOT. “My cars are sitting ready to go but I just can’t get them tested.”Mr Hamill said: “We have our own workshop and my customers are coming in and saying ‘my car is due for the MOT before the end of June’ and I’m having to tell them there’s no way we can get them in before the end of June.“The earliest I’m getting at the minute is the nd of July. So it’s not only my car sales, it’s my ing customers. I’m unable to facilitate them and there’s nothing I can do.“At this present time I have  cars up on my board and another seven still to write up that I can’t get booked in for a test.”He urged the department to consider issuing a certicate of exemption for vehicles awaiting a test.“The last time there was a big backlog like this they printed out exemption certicates,” he pointed out. “But because Stormont’s not sitting I think they can’t do that. “It’s not fair for people who are doing everything right, they’re booking their test as much as a month in advance, and they still won’t be able to drive it because they can’t book the test.”Asked what message he would give the Department of Infrastructure, he said: “Get your finger out. I’m not being funny. They need to get it sorted.”A spokesperson for the department said: “The main factor that has given rise to the current increase in MOT booking times has been the unprecedented increase in applications for tests.The volume of applications between January and March of this year has increased by .% when compared to last year – that’s almost an additional , tests in the first three months of this year.”Asked what action it is taking, the department said: “In response to the recent increase in demand for vehicle tests, a number of measures have been taken to increase capacity, including the recruitment of additional staff, both permanent and temporary, and opening on the Bank Holiday Mondays in May. Urgent consideration is being given to the possibility of opening on Sundays for a limited period of time to address the current backlog in applications.“In the longer term, a new additional Belfast test centre, located at Hydebank, is at an advanced stage of development and will be built by the end of .”try catch  TrendingPolice searching for missing N.I. man Ryan Smyth find bodyTT : Ian

He said that a single unionist party would merely gt , votes to Alliance. Yesterday Mr McGimpsey, who recently lost his Belfast council seat, was part of a BBC Talkback discussion on the matter, alongside me and Claire Sugden MLA.She put forward a plausible argument for the opposite to a single party, rather a liberal unionist one, saying that she wanted to register both her support for Northern Ireland remaining part of the United Kingdom, while espousing liberal values such as same-sex marriage.For many years I was an advocate of such a liberal unionist option. In  I wrote an article about the utter failure of unionism to reflect the fact that many, perhaps most, unionist voters were irreligious. And even those voters who are practising Christians at least as likely to be moderately so as to be evangelical or fundamentalist.It has taken a long time for this to be accepted by unionist leaders. It first became apparent to me at a referendum in Castlereagh in  on whether to open leisure facilities in the borough on a Sunday.I was aged , left leaning politically and strongly opposed to Sabbatarians imposing their will on wider society. We all need guidance on ‘rights’ issues, particularly Christians Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Given that Castlereagh was then a DUP dominated council, and had a large number of Free Presbyterian residents, it would not have been surprising for the matter to have been narrowly decided. It wasn’t. It was a crushing defeat for the fundamentalists. I cannot find a web link to the exact result, but have a reasonably clear memory of it — something like , in favour of Sunday opening, and , opposed .At most, % of Ulster Protestants are Free Presbyterians .The DUP, understandably, has been reluctant to alienate a church that was one of its founding pillars. But its vote is now so large, and so much wider than that original base, that this has long been unavoidable.It is almost certain to continue to liberalise and it is no surprise that the high command accepted Alison Bennington, the recently elected gay councillor, as a DUP politician.It is, perhaps, self serving for some of its members to advocate an unequivocally liberal Ulster Unionist party, because they can then hope to be by far the biggest party .There is a risk that a liberal unionist party could descend quickly into confusion.Note how NI changed its mind on whether or not to designate as unionist. Or how Tina McKenzie, once a leading light of that party, later advocated joint authority — a relinquishing of UK sovereignty that even moderate unionists should view with contempt.In recent years massive threats to the Union have arisen, which liberal unionists have either endorsed or been mute about.The literary and cultural academic Professor John Foster Wilson, drawing on his experience of living in bilingual Canada, recently wrote on these pages about how an Irish language act would be a long-term threat to the Union.Meanwhile, the Brexit backstop, by in effect placing Northern Ireland on the Irish-EU side of the trade ide forever, will ultimately lead to a full border in the Irish Sea for goods and is a step towards limited joint authority.And it is at least arguable that the mooted structures for dealing with the legacy of the Troubles will, while attempting to improve the shameful status quo , nonetheless ultimately assist the IRA narrative on the past. Certainly Sinn Fein is so happy with the plan that it is demanding its implementation before it will allow Stormont to .If respected politicians such as Claire Sugden or Sylvia Hermon or John McCallister support all or some of those sorts of policies, then so be it. They can reasonably argue that such reforms ultimately secure the Union.But it is hard to see how such a worldview erges from that of the Alliance Party, except that it includes a specic endorsement on the Union .The Ulster Unionist Party did have a chance to develop a dferent sort of unionism in tandem with the Conservative Party a decade ago, but it abandoned that after  .If we were building parties for Northern Ireland from scratch, few people would choose the current set-up. But even a completely new party system would have similarities to the existing one. Given the ision on the constitutional question, there would be at least one unionist party and one nationalist party. There would also be a non-aligned, cross community party.Beyond that we would perhaps have a Green movement, a traditional Christian one and maybe a socialist or pro-business party.But we are not starting from scratch, and I am no longer sure a liberal unionist party makes much sense, particularlyit means repudiating key planks of what it means to be part of the UK.• Ben Lowryis News Letter deputy editorJPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Disclaimer  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"people","story":".... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast Newsletter and agreeing to JPIMedia Ltd#s Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". s  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+ initInArticleOnlySiteText, initArticleSiteText, isInArticleOnlyTemplateReady. s isArticleTemplateReady. s addCustomTextToSiteTemplate addSiteName.html  People   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business#jp #login-widget #login-flip.flip RegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News People Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Politics Business Education Health Opinion Read This News Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Politics Business Education Health Opinion Read This Sport Football Rugby Union Motorcycling More Sport Sport Opinion Whats On Arts  Entertainment Things To Do Nightle Lestyle Retro Cars Homes Must Read           People      Near two-month wait to book MOT test anywhere in Northern IrelandDrivers are facing waiting times of up to two months to book an MOT anywhere in Northern Ireland, the News Letter can reveal.

Especially being Cameroonian, living in a culture that isnrsquot mine, and with my kids growing up between two heritages.ldquoI didnrsquot want them looking down on one half of their heritage. I wanted to pay them a fuller narrative.No major publishers have picked up the books yet. ldquoI was disheartened early on in the process. One publisher advertised themselves as being very inclusive.ldquoI reached out to them but was disappointed by their feedback ndash all they said was a childrenrsquos book is  pages long. It felt like you can only be a BME authoryou conform to these standards. Really,yoursquore trying to promote ersity in publishing you should look outside the box!The books use the personal experiences of the boys as inspiration. ldquoTwo years ago we travelled around Europe. We found a caravan and went exploring, and the books have been inspired by our adventures ndash the first being Charlie the Fearless and Tancho the Brave.ldquoTheyrsquore all about courage, and being brave enough to admit when something scares you. They focus on looking out for one other, and how love makes you brave.ldquoA Place to Call Home deals with the anxiety of moving, and the unknown, as we travelled and settled in Penarth.ldquoTheyrsquore about making the best of situations ndash there are little anecdotes in every story, like the time we broke down in north France. It was the boysrsquo optimism that helped us through situations like that and I wanted to reflect that.The books are carried in Grfin Books on Windsor Street, Penarth on Amazon. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them.

The only way forward out of this mess is to let the people have the final say on any deal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

And under my leadership, a Conservative administration will proudly put the people of the Vale of Glamorgan first.ldquoNaturally, we are open to working with other councillors who share those ideals.ldquoOthers - including those who resigned from the Conservative party - will have to explain to voters where they stand on these issues - and I would urge them to back us, rather than propping up a Labour administration that was rejected by the Vale at the last election.Cllr Bailey said he had a six-point plan for the Vale.He pledged to deliver the Dinas Powys bypass stop inflation-busting council tax rises scrap proposed parking charges review the local development planto curb inappropriate development protect rural schools and oppose the Barry Biomass plant.Cllr Bailey said that he was also keen to improve engagement with the public, after a series of hugely unpopular decisions taken by the existing cabinet.He said: ldquoDuring the elections in , we promised to build a stronger relationship with local residents by consulting them on key decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, too many people feel that their views are simply being ignored and that Vale consultations are just tick box exercises. Take the proposals around car parking charges, or the closure of Llancarfan School. I donrsquot think anyone outside of the Civic Offices believes that those decisions werenrsquot already done deals, and thatrsquos simply unacceptable.ldquoAnother good example is the councilrsquos failure to listen to the public over Penarthrsquos original Victorian lamp posts.ldquoIrsquove been criticised for wanting to listen to the people who elected me, and I make no apologies for that. Under my leadership, thatrsquos exactly what would happen and whilst I do accept that there are dficult decisions to be taken, we have to take the public with us - not ignore their legitimate concerns. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

People should be able to disagree with each other without resorting to abuse.Devolution is a journey not a destination. I am proud of what we have achieved over the last  years, making a real dference to peoplersquos lives. I look forward to what we can achieve in the future.As ever, I would be interested on hearing your views on this, please do get in touch. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

People should be able to disagree with each other without resorting to abuse.Devolution is a journey not a destination. I am proud of what we have achieved over the last  years, making a real dference to peoplersquos lives. I look forward to what we can achieve in the future.As ever, I would be interested on hearing your views on this, please do get in touch. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We have a business that has very much enjoyed its own expansion and we want to shine a light on our next generation of young professionals”.According to Susan Dunlop, that’s a well refined mantra at GMcG Chartered Accountants. Susan is one of seven directors at GMcG, having joined the firm more than  years ago and who now heads up the firm’s Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Part of planning for the future has been the recent appointment of a new director in Audit and Business Advisory Services, together with an associate director who will head up the firm’s Corporate Finance department. Both are signicant investments at management level and a reflection of the firm’s growth and ambition across its three offices.“As a leading independent accountancy firm, many of our key strengths lie in our ability to get things done, through local decision making, management and accessibility of our people” Susan says.Accessibility is regularly acknowledged as being of great value to the firm’s clients and has become a key component of how the firm does business.“Business owners know they can lt the phone and speak to any of our directors, at any time of the day. For us, that’s just part of our client service, but our clients expect it and they know it can make a huge dference to getting an issue resolved quickly and effectively, allowing them to get on with running their business.”As local businesses face uncertainty and challenges across many fronts, Susan and the management team recognise the importance of being positioned as the complete business advisor and having the expertise, understanding and experience to deliver. “Businesses evolve through dferent circumstances and with dferent requirements. We need to be one step ahead, providing the right expertise at the right time. GMcG can offer this expertise through our service lines which include Audit and Business Advisory, Tax, Forensic Accounting and Investigation, Corporate Finance, GMcG Digital and International liaison, through our TIAG membership.” The firm delivers these services though a team of more than  employees across three offices in Belfast, Lisburn and Portadown. Having initially operated as independent firms in each locationthe GMcG evolution was completed in  when the three firms merged completely under a single GMcG brand. This was a signicant investment and transition for the firm.Gill Johnston, director at GMcG Portadown, says: “It was vital that we didn’t lose focus on the profile and client relationships we had developed over many years in each location. “So we are delighted with the success of the transition and how the shared systems and expertise are adding real value to client service delivery across each location”. GMcG services a broad client base from sole traders to large corporates, including a erse range of businesses and private iniduals, public and not-for-profit sector entities, as well as legal and other professional services practices.For Susan and the rest of the team, the firm’s independence and longstanding client relationships are what bolster the firm’s success.“We have a loyal and growing client base and are particularly proud of the fact that many of these relationships go back decades or transcend generations. We advise many of these clients on succession planning, helping them develop their business through the next stage of its journey. “In our experience, all of this is underlined by the importance of investing in client relationships, getting to know the client’s business, their issues, opportunities and the type of expertise they need.“It can be a long term effort and something that often demands dedication beyond a nine to five working day. But we always view it as a rewarding investment, especially when we see our clients thrive and grow.”As part of the firm’s growth and expansion, GMcG has undergone major investment in its overall strategy, its people, IT systems and recruitment.With no shortage of drive and ambition, it’s very much a case of ‘been there, done that’ for GMcG, having themselves undergone restructuring, appointed new directors, undertaken signicant investment, experienced dynamic growth and transitioned seamless succession planning.“We have done it ourselves, and been through it all,” Susan says. “We have grown our firm and understand many of the challenges and opportunities facing SME clients with real aspirations or plans for business development we have that insight and experience that has really proved valuable in advising many of these clients.”Building on these foundations, the firm today has a strong focus on developing the next generation of its service team. A younger generation of professional advisors are moving up the ranks in the firm, with other new faces joining the expanding management team.Nigel Moore, who started with the firm back in  as a trainee, has been appointed director in the Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Director Stephen Houston also started his career as a trainee and heads up GMcG’s Lisburn office. Robbie Milliken, who has more than  years’ experience across corporate finance and business banking, has also joined the firm to head up its Corporate Finance department.Susan is keen to acknowledge that GMcG is a firm that is proud of its working environment, and that career progression is part and parcel of its ethos.“We give employees every opportunity to progress through the ranks and be rewarded for their success, and we can point to two of our directors who commenced as trainees. We feel this is testament to the experience and environment we offer, and to our commitment to ensuring employees reach their full potential”. “Importantly, achieving the right work-le balance is something we facilitate and promote as much as possible across all grades. We are very aware of the importance of mental health and wellbeing and are delighted to have partnered with a mental health charity for the last two years, with mental health programmes delivered across GMcG’s offices.”GMcG also has the global reach to serve clients wherever the growth of their business takes them, through its membership of The International Accounting Group .Lyn Canning Hagan, who heads up GMcG Tax Services and is one of the firm’s TIAG liaison directors, says:“TIAG, together with its sister alliance TAGLaw, provides GMcG and our clients direct access to accounting, tax and legal expertise across more than  countries worldwide. “This is hugely beneficial to businesses with international markets or operations and many of our clients have already benefited from this global expertise across numerous jurisdictions.”Looking to the Ulster Business Next , which features in this edition of the magazine, Susan Dunlop says many of those small and medium-sized Northern Ireland businesses making the list are exactly the type of clients GMcG is working with.“We’re proud of our track record of helping SME clients across all sectors achieve success through growth, restructuring or expansion, drawing on our own experiences to make a real dference in shaping their future plans.”So, it goes without saying that the future is more than bright for GMcG – a firm with decades of experience, but one which is always looking forward.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/sto1.jpg","title":"ni business rates to undergo full review","story":"Posted on Thursday May  by John Mulgrew There will be a full review of Northern Ireland’s business rates system, a top civil servant has revealed. Sue Gray, Permanent Secretary of the Department of Finance, announced the full review into the taxation system for companies here, during a Local Government conference, with Retail NI and law firm DWF, at Titanic Belfast. The reform and re-examination of business rates has been one of the core concerns among the retail and hospitality sectors for the last few years. It’s one of several key business issues which had been kicked down the road due to the ongoing impasse at Stormont. The news has been welcomed by Retail NI and Hospitality Ulster. In a joint statement, the groups said: “Both our organisations are delighted that the Department of Finance have announced this review into non-domestic rates. We have consistently lobbied for this over a number of years and are pleased that our joint call has been heard” “While this is not an end in itself, it is a means to an end. This review provides us with a roadmap for radical change to an antiquated and not fit for purpose system of business rates which is a major burden for our members “In this review we will be outlining signicant changes to rates, including our proposals for a targeted approach to small business rates relief, a revamp of the rates hardship fund, green rates rebate for business who invest in carbon neutral technology and greater relief for new start businesses. “At the last UK Budget, the Chancellor gave independent retailers and hospitality businesses a third off their rate bills in England. We want nothing less than this for our members in Northern Ireland.\" Ms Gray says that \"in recent years signicant changes have taken place in our high streets and town centres. It is critical from a business perspective, as well as a government funding perspective, that our rating system is capable of responding to this wider process of change. That’s why today I am announcing a full and comprehensive review of business rates. “We must create a rating system which generates the funding our public services need while supporting businesses in all sector and enabling economic growth right across Northern Ireland. “In an environment where we are working without ministers, there are limitations to what we can do by way of policy change. But we need to be ready with updated advice for incoming ministers for theirto office. This fundamental review is therefore a critical part of this process.” And Aodhán Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, said: “We wholeheartedly welcome the announcement of this review and it is a credit  the Permanent Secretary’s drive to make positive change. “The fact that retail is % of the economy and pays a quarter of all business rates is simply not sustainable especially give the seismic structural changes going on in the industry. “We have some of the highest business rates in Europe and they are a disincentive to investing in Northern Ireland. We are already playing catch up to the rest of the UK on business rates reform where our businesses pay p in the pound more than the UK average. “This review must look at all aspects of the system. There must be equity in any new system that allows for a widening of the tax base and an audit of the plethora of exemptions some of which have been in place since the s. “If we don’t get business rates right, we risk further shop closures which will  not only cost jobs  but leave a gaping hole in NI finances.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/js_1.jpg","title":"could a new dawn boost ni business development","story":"Posted on Friday  May  by Ulster Business While Brexit is still upon us, John Simpson says the business sectors finances have proved stronger than predicted and lending could be boosted on the outside as the veil of uncertainty lts The darkest hour comes just before the dawn: an apt reference to the prospects when Brexit is finally taken out of the daily diet of news, concern about business disruption, and foreboding about dficult trading prospects. Brexit is proving to be a slow departure. This year the economy has proved more resilient than many feared. Employment has remained at high levels, jobs for skilled employees are available, and with less certainty personal incomes have been maintained.Political uncertainty and efficient business management are an uneasy mix. In the recent winter and springbusinesses have had to live with an intense series of destabilising influences. For over  years, businesses in Ireland and the UK have grown accustomed to near frictionless EU market conditions. customs duties had disappeared on all internal EU trading. For businesses on this island, the memory of cross-border customs duties had all been but forgotten.   Looking at the lending performances of some of our own banks, the numbers seem to be adding up. In its full year accounts for , Danske Bank posted pre-tax profit of £.m, while new lending rose % and overall business lending increased by %.Across Donegall Square, Ulster Bank saw its income rising from £m to £m during , while profit after impairments stood at £m. There was a % rise in new corporate lending, while small business rose by %.Meanwhile, across the UK as a whole, Barclays has announced a £bn lending fund as part of a series of initiatives to help small and medium-sized businessesto succeed and flourish through Brexit and beyond.Only older colleaguescan remember the perils of railway journeys interrupted by a one hour stop at Goraghwood station, close to Newry, while all passengers were asked by customs officersthey had ‘anything to declare’. More affluent older travellers would more likely recall the cross-border queuing requirement for the predecessor of the ‘green card’ for cars. Today, the challenge is of how to deliver the political agreement that the border on this island should be either frictionless or non-existent as the UK plans to leave the EU. In the new era there will be redefined relations between NI and the Republic, within the framework of UK-EU relations. The important part lies in negotiations on working arrangements that have not yet officially started.For the remaining part of  and going into , the business scene might be described as getting ‘ready for le after Brexit’.In the last three years the business community which forms the core of the private sector in Northern Ireland has been trading successfully.  The evidence from local reviews of the larger profit making businesses has been encouraging. Year-on-year turnover has been increasing faster than inflation and, even more critically, profitability has been maintained and often improved.Work to identy how well locally owned and controlled businesses have performed has been reassuring. To be included in the review of the Top  more profitable Northern Ireland business, which will be published in more detail, the cut-off point has risen to just on £m annual pre-tax profits. In a further reassuring feature and in contrast to the preceding year, during the year  the number of business casualties fell to a very small number.While the overall performance of businesses in the private sector has been better than is sometimes appreciated, there is a mixture of features in the complex matrix of business performance. The evidence is often from personal subjective sources but the elements do point to a consistent pattern. Businesses have been trading, in general, with improved profits but with turnover rather less buoyant. Employment has been increasing, now more slowly, but pay rateshave not fully recovered from the fall in real earnings in the past decade. Interestingly at a regional and national level, changes in wage rates have not shown the boost of an inflationary increase that might have been expected when unemployment levels have fallen to near record lows.Bargaining in the labour market has been restrained, probably influenced by the siren voices of emerging problems as the Brexit withdrawal agreement has dominated the political and economic policy agenda. This points to the emergence of a contrast between the trend in overall business profitability, which has improved, alongside the trend for inidual personal incomes to lag behind the real levels of the past decade. To a modest degree, business profitability may have improved relative to changes in the costs of the payroll.While the scale of the dference should be treated with caution, as business evolves during the rest of , business finance may be better placed to activate improving investment plans.The post-Brexit business scene should be pointing to reduced uncertainty, even with some predictable new business obstacles, and a helpful change in government economic policy to incentivise faster economic expansion. That prospect, alongside a business sector that has a stronger capacity to invest and grow, makes the months ahead more encouraging than many experts expect.In summary, the business sector is understandably anxious to see aof greater business stability and, for a mixture of reasons, may now be more likely to implement more ambitious investment programmes. Add to this combination the possibility that official Government economic policy will be more flexibleand there is a hope that, out of the recent grey clouds of possible recession, there will be incentives leading to a more buoyant economy here.Just one moment of caution: the brightness of a new dawn in  may be dimmedthe political processes constrain the application of improved economic policies through a refreshed local administration. Business has been performing well, despite the huge levels of uncertainty. However, the political environment could drown out an improving economy. That challenge has not changed.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/5g1.jpg","title":"belfast to get superfast g mobile broadband this month","story":"Posted on Wednesday  May  by John Mulgrew Suzanne Wylie, Belfast City Council with Karen Dundas, EE Victoria Square store manager Belfast is to become one of six UK cities to get superfast G mobile broadband later this month, it has emerged. EE is bringing the connectivity to the city from May , alongside London, Edinburgh, Cardf, Birmingham and Manchester. While still at an early phase, with further roll-out a longer term project, EE says it expects customers in Belfast to “experience an increase in speeds of around -Mbps even in the busiest areas”. “Some customers will break the one gigabit-per-second milestone on their G smartphones. The fastest speed possible when EE launched G in  was just Mbps.” Marc Allera, chief executive, of BT’s consumer ision, says: “This is the start of the UK’s G journey and great news for our customers that want and need the best connections. We’ve started with G in some of the busiest parts of the UK, the widest range of G devices in the UK, and plans that give customers the best mobile connection and great benefits. “We’re adding G to the UK’s number one G network to increase reliability, increase speeds, and keep our customers connected where they need it most.  “G will create new experiences with augmented reality, make our customers’ lives easier, and help launch entirely new businesses that we haven’t even imagined. We’re upgrading more than  sites to G every month from today to connect more places to what G can enable.” Suzanne Wylie, chief executive of Belfast Council, said: “Digital connectivity is at the heart of our strategy for the growth of Belfast. G is key to making our ambitions a reality. It will drive our economy forward and enable Belfast to thrive in the fourth industrial revolution. Being one of the first G enabled cities in the UK is an exciting prospect for us, and will bring our businesses and citizens the best mobile connectivity in Europe. “G connectivity will ensure our city remains competitive, indigenous businesses grow and big global brands continue to build their businesses in Belfast and support our ongoing digital advancement.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/sign_1.jpg","title":"across the borderline export focus","story":"Posted on Friday  May  by Ulster Business The export market is booming in cross-border areas in and around Newry, but how will things change post-Brexit  Pavel Barter checks out the pulse of businesses in the region As the morning sun illuminates the shores of Carlingford Lough in Co Down, a team of workers carry bags of oysters from the water to the beach. They toss, turn, and grade the shellfish according to size, before ing them to the seabed. Across the Lough we can see the Cooley Peninsula and Co Louth. In the Brexit border debate, this is ground zero.Growing oysters takes three years, says Darren Cunningham, owner of Killowen Shellfish, and he exports stock every week. “It leaves on a Friday evening at around pm, and % is exported to France. It goes through Dublin and Rosslare to the top oyster buyer in Europe. The oysters are in purication tanks in France by Sunday evening. That’s how quick it is.” Carlingford Oysters then travel to restaurants in Paris and other European capitals. How is business  “Very good,” Darren says. “We sold nearly  tonnes of oyster last year. Two tonnes went to China and the rest to France.” Is there much competition  “Not for us. We’re the talk at the minute. We have the best stuff.”Darren and his team work next to Ballyedmond Estate, the family home of the late Edward Haughey, founder of Norbrook, one of the world’s leading veterinary pharmaceutical companies. If you travel further up the lough – past Warrenpoint, home to Northern Ireland’s second largest port – you will reach Newry, where Norbrook is based.Killowen Shellfish and Norbrook, which generated an operating profit of £.m in the year to August , are very dferent businesses, yet both speak the common language of exports. There are around , VAT registered businesses in the greater Newry area and many of them are accustomed to criss-crossing the border.“We have a number of major global players based here in Newry who supply goods across the world,” Colm Shannon, chief executive of Newry Chamber of Commerce and Trade says.He name-checks MJM Marine, a leader in the global marine industry, which employs  people in three offices across Europe. “Equally, we have a number of smaller companies who are involved in north-south trade. That’s usually the first step into the export market.”Exports are the essence of business for Re-Gen Waste, a Newry firm established in  by five siblings. Re-Gen began by recycling paper, cardboard, tin and plastics, before graduating to municipal waste and black bin waste. The family developed their own purpose-built facility in Newry, creating a business that generates millions. Its work is spread across Northern Ireland, the Republic and rest of the UK.According to John Doherty, a director at the business, Re-Gen “exports hundreds of tonnes across the border every day. We’re the fourth largest recycler in the Republic.” Its recycled products are exported to almost  countries around the globe. Re-Gen is not alone. Other successful Newry exporters include FM Environmental Group, which has offices in Malta and the Middle East. In , Newry’s BM Steel landed new business, in a deal worth £m, in the Netherlands and Great Britain. Around Noon, a producer of high-quality sandwiches, employs  people and has made acquisitions in Dublin and London. Newry-based construction firm mac-group is another all-island operation. In , it completed a £m refurbishment of River House, a -storey building in Belfast. Simultaneously, it was working the new Barclays headquarters in Dublin. “We employ over  people, across four dferent offices,” Brendan Moley, group interiors managing director at mac-group says. “The Newry office has  full time people. A lot of those staff members support projects in Dublin, London and Birmingham. There’s a lot of commuting back and forth across the border. We are trading in cross border services on a daily basis, but we’re also heavily involved in products and goods.”Although GB is Northern Ireland’s biggest external market, businesses in the Newry region are accustomed to cross border trade due to their geographical location. “We’ve always looked at Newry as being half way between Belfast and Dublin,” Brendan says. “You can get to Dublin Airport in  minutes from here. The talent available within the Newry market, in terms of some of staff, skill-set and knowledge, is extremely beneficial as well.”Some businesses fear that a hard border, in the event of a ‘no deal’ Brexit, will cause delays. According to Darren Cunningham, only a few hundred lorries crossed the border every day in . That number is around , today. “A minute delay can knock everyone back hours,” he says. “My oysters can’t hold their breath forever. They’re a living creature. They only have a certain amount of time. The quicker they get to France, the better condition they’re in.”Re-Gen operates its own transport department. “Currently we send a lorry to Dublin twice in a day to collect materials,” John Doherty says. “If there is a delay at the border, you are likely require a second lorry. The cost of taking everything from the Republic to the north doubles.”Technology, such as unmanned border posts equipped with cameras, would be unlikely to solve the problem, suggests Brendan. “Any type of border control will impact business. Being from the border area myself, knowing how many crossings there are, I think it would be absolutely impossible to police it in any sensible way.”Newry businesses fear they will face mountains of costly paperwork post-Brexit. There may also be compliance issues, such as food traceability dficulties for food producers like Killowen Shellfish, construction product regulations for mac-group, or paper work for Re-Gen’s haulage drivers, whose Certicates of Professional Competencemay not be to be recognised in a post-Brexit EU. The Government has suggested imposing zero tarfs on goods from the EU in the event of no deal. Newry businesses believe this would put them at a competitive disadvantage. “The business community has expressed concerns that Northern Ireland will become a back door into the UK market for goods coming from the EU,” Colm Shannon says. “History tells you when you have iation of tarfs on the border, that’s an opportunity for smuggling.”Staff recruitment is another concern at Re-Gen, which has a -strong workforce. “We’re already finding it dficult to recruit staff,” John says. “Often, the people we’re hiring are seasonal and foreign workers. It’s the same for the agricultural industry, hotels...”But what about the arguments that a managed no-deal could be good for business  Firms would still have access to EU markets under WTO rules. Furthermore, the UK might strike lucrative trade deals in the years to come. Businesses around Newry are not buying this. Certainly not Norbrook, which has “an integrated supply chain, with a global supply base, which relies on frictionless trade,” according to Liam Nagle, the company boss.Uncertainty reigns for export businesses in the Newry area. “The chaotic nature in which this has been managed has restricted companies like ourselves from planning for the future,” Brendan Moley says. “It’s one  dawn after another.”Darren Cunningham, looking across the water to where Co Louth is starting to feel very far away, says: “A lot of people are in complete disbelief and don’t think it’s going to happen. I can’t get my head around it at all. That’s the truth.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/jannine_1.jpg","title":"my day jannine waddell","story":"Posted on Friday  May  by Ulster Business Name: Jannine Waddell MBE Position: Managing director at Waddell Media .amMy alarm goes off and I instantly check the weatherand have a quick look at emails that have come in overnight.
