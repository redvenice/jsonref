Sophie Griffiths, market analyst at OANDA, says the pound is outperforming its G10 peers following the results of last Thursday’s UK elections, and Friday’s weak US jobs report. That’s due to vaccine rollouts and huge stimulus spending by the US, as well as signs that businesses have been more resilient through the latest lockdowns. The immediate economic effects of the virus, which have been concentrated in the low-waged service sector, are expected to wane, while remaining “negative consequences of Brexit” will impact over the long-run and largely in sectors less affected by Covid-19, NIESR says. NIESR also flags that Covid-19 will have a greater permanent cost for the UK compared with other major economies.  NIESR also warns that the UK’s “underinvestment in health and social care capacity had “devastating consequences in 2020”. It also led to the relative economic underperformance during the pandemic, it says, adding: Centrica has warned it faced a difficult start to the year, weeks after sacking hundreds of its engineers through a controversial fire and rehire scheme, my colleague Jillian Ambrose explains: FOMO is a difficult emotion to handle in the financial world, it can be risky to pile into a popular, fast-rising asset, especially if everyone else seems to be there already. But for many people, houses aren’t an investment - they’re somewhere to live - and this boom is pushing the first rung of the housing ladder further out of reach. Nigel Purves, CEO of Wayhome (which lets people part-buy a house, and pay rent on the rest), says the market remains unbalanced: The Halifax said almost £20,000 had been added to the average house price since the market came to a standstill during the first coronavirus lockdown in April 2020. Although the stamp duty relief will be phased out in two stages in June and September, the bank said it expected demand for property to remain strong in the next few months. Razaqzada adds that investors should watch Scotland closely, as the push for another independence referendum “could become the next big talking point in the parliament in the months ahead”.Sterling has now gained more than a cent against the US dollar today to $1.409, its highest level since late February, as traders digest the election results. The pound has also gained three-quarters of a euro cent to €1.158, and is also stronger against some other currencies: Steen Jakobsen, chief investment officer at Saxo Bank, says sterling is seeing a “relief rally”. With the SNP finishing narrowly short of an overall majority in last week’s elections, a new Scottish independence referendum is not seen as an imminent threat, he argues. Pro-independence MSPs did secure a majority in Scottish parliament (as flagged earlier), with the pro-independence Scottish Greens winning eight seats in total. But the fact the SNP didn’t get an absolute majority on their own is boosting sterling, agrees Marios Hadjikyriacos, investment analyst at XM,  However... Kit Juckes of Société Générale isn’t convinced that a second Scottish referendum is now off the table. On Saturday, SNP leader and Scotland’s first minister Nicola Sturgeon pledged to press ahead with plans for a second independence referendum once the COVID-19 pandemic was over, which would create a legal and constitutional battle with Boris Johnson.  Research group Sentix’s gauge of investor morale in the euro zone has risen to its highest level since March 2018, increasing from 13.1 in April to 21.0 in May. Sentix’s index of economic expectations reached a record level, suggesting that the acceleration of Covid-19 vaccinations in Europe is helping the region escape the crisis. Its gauge of ‘current conditions’ also moves into positive territory, reaching its highest level since 2019. Sentix also warns that the economy is being “overstimulated”, leading to material shortage and soaring commodity prices (as we’ve seen with record iron ore prices this morning). Manfred Hübner of Sentix explains: Anna Clare Harper, chief executive of asset manager SPI Capital, points to other factors too -- demand for home-working, limited supply, low interest rates, and a ‘flight to safety’. Jonathan Hopper, CEO of Garrington Property Finders, says optimism as the UK economy emerges from lockdown is another factor: Strong demand, short supply, and the extension of the Stamp Duty holiday beyond its March deadline are all fueling the market. Russell Galley, managing director at Halifax, says the average house price has jumped by almost £20,000 since the first lockdown in April 2020, which temporarily froze the market. Galley adds that some buyers are searching for homes with more space which are better suited to home-working. The sub-prime lender will seek to either sell or wind down its consumer credit arm. The cost of either course of action to the company will be as high as £100m, Provident said. The doorstep lending arm – which offered high-cost loans to people with weak credit histories – had been struggling even before the coronavirus pandemic, losing £21m in 2019. However, those losses expanded dramatically during 2020 to £75m, according to financial results also published on Monday. The ision has started consultations with its 2,100 workers over their future. UK bakery chain Greggs has hiked its profit forecast this morning, after seeing sales beat pre-pandemic levels since lockdown measures were relaxed. Greggs told the City that demand for its products (such as sausage rolls, bakes, and buns) has been strong since non-essential shops reopened, and shoppers returned to the high streets.  Since the English lockdown eased in mid-April, sales have been higher than in 2019, it reports. Greggs now expects profits to be “materially higher than its previous expectation”. They could be around 2019’s levels, if further Covid-19 restrictions are avoided. The FTSE touched 7,164 points for the first time since late February 2020, before dipping back. Mining companies are rallying, lifted by the boom in commodity prices such as iron ore, copper, nickel, zinc, coal, platinum and palladium. Commodity prices are surging again today, as the scramble for raw materials continues. Copper, often viewed as a barometer of the global economy’s health, has jumped to a new record high -- hitting $10,639 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange, Bloomberg reports.The pound is rallying at the start of the week, hitting its highest level in over two months. Sterling has jumped nearly a cent against the US dollar, hitting $1.406 for the first time since late February, as traders digest the results of last week’s elections. Over the weekend, Scottish Nationalist Party fell just short of an outright majority in the Scottish Parliament, winning 64 of the 129 seats. This appears to be easing some City concerns about a breakup of the UK.  However, the SNP have still won a historic fourth consecutive victory...and there will be a majority of pro-independence MSPs in the new parliament, with the Scottish Greens winning eight seats. So the issue has not vanished, with SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon pledging to press ahead with plans for a second independence referendum. As my colleague Libby Brooks writes: Jim Reid of Deutsche Bank tells clients: Optimism over the unlocking of the UK economy may also be lifting the pound some support.  From May 17, pubs, cafes and restaurants will be able to host customers indoors for the first time in months -- for groups of up to six or two households. Cinemas, galleries and the rest of the accommodation sector will also reopen, as hospitality restrictions are lifted due to the fall in Covid-19 infections. This should underpin hopes of an economic recovery this year. The pound is also benefitting from the weaker dollar, which slid on Friday after a surprisingly weak US employment report. The news that just 266,000 new jobs were added last month has dampened some optimism over the pace of the recovery European stock markets are set to rally this morning, with investors calculating that weaker jobs growth means central bankers won’t be rushing to end their stimulus measures.

For a bite-size section, head to pretty Perros-Guirec, two hours’ drive from Saint-Malo, being sure to try traditional galettes at Crêperie du Ranolien, before hiking the Pink Granite coast, with its rosy boulders reminiscent of Seychelles. Alternatively head for the Crozon peninsula, a three-hour drive cross-country from the port, for lovely swimming creeks and imposing headlands jutting into water the colour of mouthwash. The island loop one: Belle-Île-en-Mer, BrittanyWho knew there was a tiny island paradise so close to home, where white sands meet turquoise waves, lighthouses decorate promontories and sweet seaside cottages are painted candy colours. A little like a French take on the Isles of Scilly, Belle-Île-en-Mer has long attracted creatives such as Claude Monet, who painted its imposing Port Coton needles, and one of the early stars of the screen, the bohemian actress Sarah Bernhardt, who moved into the military fort here in 1894, hosting glamorous parties, with Edward VII among her guests. The fort is now a little museum, in a beautiful spot on the Pointe des Poulains, one of the highlights of the 51-mile coastal path that circles Brittany’s largest island. The path threads together the sheltered coves of the east, steep cliffs in the south, dunes for children to tumble down, and Le Palais harbour. Le Palais, the island’s main town, is where you’ll arrive if you take the hour-long ferry ride from Quiberon on the mainland. Ride the bus to different sections of the path and be sure to have an evening cocktail at Le Grand Large hotel, overlooking the sea. The magical forest one: Brittany’s mythical forestHolidays to Brittany are very often all about the sea, but there are magical walking routes too in the interior’s marshes, forests and hills. Brittany’s once-vast forest of Paimpont, west of Rennes, is thought to be the one referred to in medieval folklore and myths as Brocéliande, an enchanted, fairy-filled forest associated with Arthurian legends. Today, themed trails and a museum at the Château de Comper bring the stories to life, adding an ethereal slant to family walks on the forest’s network of fern-lined trails. Your closest base could be Brittany’s vibrant capital, Rennes, an hour’s drive south from the ferry port at St Malo. The dramatic one: Normandy’s Alabaster coast on the GR21For anyone yearning to tackle one of Europe’s mammoth GR hiking trails there couldn’t be a handier starting point than that of Normandy’s iconic GR21, which begins in the city of Le Havre, arrival port for the Brittany Ferries crossing from Portsmouth. Whether you ditch your car immediately and strike out to walk the full 115-mile route north to the fishing village of Le Tréport, which usually takes seven to 10 days, or drive to stroll shorter sections, is a matter for you and your thigh muscles to decide. The geology of this stretch echoes that on the other side of the Channel, with dramatic high white chalk cliffs earning it the moniker the Alabaster coast. While the beaches of Normandy might still be associated with the noisy barrages of D-day, now only the wind tussling the leaves and the odd gull call will prick your ears, leaving mental space for contemplation on a peaceful route voted best hiking trail in France in 2019’s annual French Hiking Federation survey. The path doesn’t always follow the coast due to the fragility of the cliffs, but descends often to beaches and villages tucked into ravines where rivers meet the sea, such as Fécamp, with an abbey, and Dieppe, with wonderful seafood restaurants. Look out too for second world war sites and Delacroix’s painting subject, St Pierre-en-Port. Just a little past Le Tréport, the lovely belle epoque seaside resort of Mers-les-Bains, with quaint bathing huts on a lively seafront, is a fabulous place to finish up. The boozy one: Normandy’s cider routeWhether you stagger it, swagger it or dart along like a teetotal hare, the 25-mile cider route is a beauty, connecting more than 20 cider farms in the lovely Pays d’Auge region of lower Normandy. Densely wooded hills, villages of colourful timber-framed houses, chateaux and farmland comprise a gorgeous backdrop for immersion in the appley booze-making expertise of the area. You’ll learn to appreciate the slightly bitter flavour of local ciders – neither sandpaper dry or juicy-sweet – perfect for quenching the thirst of parched hikers. Calvados (apple brandy), sometimes mixed with apple juice to make pommeau, has to be tasted along with perries and cheeses. Where should you base yourself? Try any of the characterful hotels in ancient towns such as Cambremer. The cultural one: the Loire estuary The Loire river may be most famous for the beautiful chateaux that decorate its banks, but many other interesting features lend it character as it wends its way west to the Atlantic. At its finale, a wide estuary forms a fascinating natural and semi-industrial environment that’s fun to explore on foot. A 37-mile trail through the estuary from Nantes to the ocean, takes in fishing villages, nature reserves and a fantastic art trail, the Estuaire Nantes\u0026lt\u0026gtSaint-Nazaire, featuring 33 mind-bending sculptures, dotted along the water’s edge. Picking out one section for a day’s walk, you might opt for the lively 11-mile stretch from Paimbœuf, a village of brightly coloured houses, to the seaside resort of Saint-Brevin-les-Pins, on the southern side opposite Saint-Nazaire. It offers sandy beaches, fishing huts on stilts and the art trail’s “Serpent d’Ocean” by Huang Yong Ping, a huge skeleton of a sea serpent submerged in the breakers that’s thrilling for children. Alternatively there are dozens of other shorter walking trails of a few miles throughout the southern estuary area, which are easily doable for little legs. The hilly one: the Alpes MancellesFor not-too-tough hiking challenges in a mountainous region that resembles a mini version of the Alps, head to the pretty Alpes Mancelles in the Atlantic Loire. The mountains here top out at only 200-400m, bless them, so are relatively easy to conquer, but will still earn you the kudos of having summited some of the highest peaks in western France. Le Mont des Avaloirs, at 416m, is the big boy of the region, providing wonderful views of the Sarthe river from a Brutalist-style concrete lookout point at the top. Across the unspoilt massif, hundreds of kilometres of paths explore wooded slopes and valleys, and loop from authentic villages such as Fresnay-sur-Sarthe, a medieval town on a rocky outcrop with a ninth century chateau to visit. There’s tons for families to do too, from hiking with donkeys to high-ropes courses in the trees.

Willie Sullivan, ERS Scotland’s senior director, said: Sullivan also said that, despite talk (from the Alba party) before the election of voters “gaming the system”, in practice the voting system “has done what voting systems should do: represented the preferences of voters fairly”.The Local Government Association has that, if there is indeed nothing substantial in the Queen’s speech, that will be “a bitter blow”. In an open letter to the chancellor, the LGA chair, James Jamieson, and the leaders of the Labour, Conservative, Lib Dem and independent groups on the LGA, say: Starmer also said he would spend the summer speaking to people who do not vote for the party. He aims to accelerate previously announced plans to bring buses in the region back under public control by three years, in what would be the first reverse of Thatcher’s deregulation of the bus industry in the 1980s. Burnham said he plans immediate talks with the government to bring the scheme forward to 2024 and compared the high costs of travelling by bus and tram in the city-region to costs in London. He plans to launch a bike hire scheme in November, after a short-lived bike sharing scheme was abandoned in 2018. Burnham also promised 95 new electric vehicle charging points by the end of the year, more cycling and walking routes and to negotiate full accessibility to rail stations in the region. In a statement, Burnham said that people in Greater Manchester have made it clear that they won’t settle for second best any longer, in terms of having access to an affordable travel network. Level 4 means “a Covid-19 epidemic is in general circulation transmission is high or rising exponentially”. Level 3 means “a Covid-19 epidemic is in general circulation”. The four chief medical officers issuing the statement are: Prof Chris Whitty (England), Dr Michael McBride (Northern Ireland), Dr Gregor Smith (Scotland) and Dr Frank Atherton (Wales). Prof Stephen Powis, national medical director for NHS England, has also signed the statement.This morning Khan signed the official declaration of his acceptance of his new term of office at a ceremony at the Globe theatre in London. He also announced plans for what he described as the “biggest domestic tourism campaign the capital has ever seen”. Emily Thornberry, the shadow international trade secretary, said this looked like a “catastrophic blunder”. But the government has denied that. A government spokesperson said: UPDATE: In a thread on Twitter Anna Jerzewska, who runs a trade consultancy, says that this is not a blunder because these arrangements are standard for freeports.

Spending as much time indoors as we all have lately, setting it up is something that would improve my life immeasurably. A competent friend of mine helped me get the projector up in my last place. But between lockdowns and just plain asking too many DIY-related favours from the poor guy, I realised if I wanted to put something up on the wall, I was very much on my own. So I did what all humans do in times of need: I turned to the internet. Being an older millennial, I’d assumed that TikTok was beyond me. It’s the place where young people mime to music, right? Could the TikTok community really help? I have to confess, I was sceptical. To test the water, I decided to see what help I could get for putting up a picture – using hashtags to search TikTok for relevant videos. The picture I sought to hang is a wonderful illustration of my beloved cat Itzi, to serve as a constant reminder of who’s boss in the house. So it wasn’t something I wanted to mess up. To start with, I find a top tip from Kim, a home decor blogger who posts TikTok videos under the handle @clippercityhouse. She suggests filming myself holding a picture at different heights to decide on where I should place it. This is a great idea if you’re working on your own – as I was.I put the hook in the wall, and move on to the fiddly part of trying to get the hanging wire over. After struggling for a bit, @goodleyearth comes to the rescue with his tip to use an unexpected item of cutlery. Under calm tutelage, I place a fork upright on the nail and use it as a guide to get the picture on – I get it right the first time. Now this is the stuff I’m here for! I discover that DIY videos on TikTok are like having access to countless experts sharing learned knowledge, saving hours of misery, frustration and unnecessary holes in the wall. No more skipping through long, painful videos trying to find the relevant 30 seconds. After some nervous tea drinking, the picture of Itzi remains vertical. And so bolstered with caffeine and perhaps too much confidence, I set my sights on the shelf for my projector. After a quick search, I find that @haizzly has a useful video about prepping and priming wood. Soon the board is sanded, primed, sanded again, painted (is it starting to sound like I know what I’m doing yet?) and left to dry overnight. Woodshop Diaries – under the handle @woodshopdiaries – shows me how to drill wood without splitting, and even takes me through the basics of how a drill works in a cheerful and straightforward way. While it’s not necessarily essential for this particular task, it was a nice touch I really appreciated. And @constructiontips proves to be a treasure trove of, well, construction tips. Most of them are for tasks far above even my most lofty ambitions – however, there is a nifty trick I can see myself using in the future. It’s actually intended for picture hanging, but works well enough for a small shelf. Using tape and cardboard, I mark the drill points and have a template of where to drill the wall. Minimal fuss and no scrawling. Next, I check out @mcp_thats_me, who gives a brilliantly efficient overview of getting screws in the wall. Once this is done, I’m finally able to mount the shelf. The other useful thing about these TikTok tutorials is that they play on a loop, which is particularly handy if your hands are covered in paint, or you’re holding something heavy.A few days later, the shelf is still standing, the projector is working as it should and the wall is looking more interesting than it has in a long time. As I sit, I start to think about other projects that could now be possible. Revarnishing a coffee table? My previous doubts abated, I fire up TikTok to find out.

Since then, over 250,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and more than 4,900 people have died.Globally, over 150 million people have been diagnosed and over 3\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Jannsen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspis also in talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th.\u0026nbspHow many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and reported positive results from these initial phase 1 and 2 trial in\u0026nbspApril 2021, while announcing it was entering\u0026nbspphase 3 trials on 4,000 people.On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?The HSE is currently vaccinating people in the top five cohorts:\u0026nbsppeople aged 65\u0026nbspand older who live in long-term care facilities (cohort 1), frontline healthcare workers (cohort 2), people aged 70 and older (cohort 3), people aged 16 to 69 who are at very high risk (cohort 4) and those aged 60 to 69 (cohort 5).\u0026nbspThe next groups to be offered a vaccine after this will be\u0026nbsppeople\u0026nbspaged 16 to 64 who are at high risk (cohort 7).

More than the actual shopping, it is the return to normality that I am loving.’ Photograph: Dara Mac DonaillIt was almost as if someone somewhere had flicked a switch and turned a light on over Dublin. The gloom that has shrouded the city centre since the start of the year lifted overnight with the seemingly endless despair of the lockdown months suddenly replaced by optimism, joy and mountains of cheap knickers.While retail across Ireland will not fully emerge from its depressingly mothballed state until next week, shopping by appointment is the new “new normal” and the novelty of booking a slot in Penneys coupled with a desperate need for clothes saw queues forming outside the Mary Street branch on the hour every hour from 7am.Under the new rules of engagement, Penneys is allowing 100 shoppers through its doors every 60 minutes from dawn to dusk. There are 45 minutes allowed for shopping and 15 minutes for paying and leaving the shop. The public address system ominously alerts everyone to the unstoppable march of time each 15 minutes.Given the pressures all Monday’s shoppers were under, The  was just a bit afraid when making our approaches that we would have the heads bitten off us. Or worse. Who were we to be standing in the way of clothes?Our fear was entirely misplaced and everyone we spoke to was delighted to take a 60-second break to talk about why they were there.“I’m here for the socks, the pyjamas, the leggings and the knickers. You’d really miss Penneys, even for the little things for birthday presents. It is just so nice to be able to physically hold things,” said Aoife O’Connor from Clondalkin. “It is brilliant, there is hardly anyone in here and no queues. I’m delighted now I booked appointments for everyone I know.”Laura Johnston from Ringsend was weighed down by two large Penneys bags and one small baby. “I have knickers, pyjamas, leggings, shorts and loads of clothes for the baby,” she said. “I missed it so much, I missed it terribly. My baby is one and a half and he hasn’t had a sock to his name for months. He has loads of them now.”Another baby, one by the name of Frankie, was staring up at his mammy, Gillian Duggan from Clonsilla, as she piled clothes high on every available surface of his buggy. “I’m very excited to be back, it’s like a supermarket sweep,” she said.Even though Frankie came into the world just 10 weeks ago, his mam was full of beans and can-do spirit. “We have loads of appointments today,” she said. “Next there is Zara and then JD Sports and Bershka and Straarius at 2pm. I am really getting the steps in today, that’s for sure. I’ve missed it, it has been a very hard year so far.”If anyone needed proof that shopping is as much an emotional experience as it is a means to acquire stuff, it was on the faces of all the happy shoppers as they went through the racks with one eye always on the time.Not even a face mask could hide Aisling Walker’s smiles. The woman from Oliver Bond Street said she was “delighted to be back, absolutely delighted. I have underwear and pyjamas, but really it is just the thought of being in Penneys. And the appointment thing is great, I’ll be in and out before you know it.”Michelle Brady from Donard Avenue in Dublin 7 was equally thrilled. “You’d miss Penneys terribly, it’s like a magnet so it is. Before all this, on Saturdays I’d come in with my three grandchildren and we’d go shopping. It was a little treat. I am buying stuff for them today and for my husband. I might take a little spin up to Dunnes now too.”Aisling Alcock from Coolock was on her second Penneys appointment of the day having spent an hour around the corner in the O’Connell Street branch just after dawn. “I wasn’t sure I’d get Mary Street so I booked there first and then I got here too so I took both appointments,” she said. “So far I’ve spent three-fifty so I might have to budget a bit now.”When asked if she meant €3.50, she laughed: “G’wan out of that.” Then she disappeared, but minutes later was back, having scored a gold elephant and other bits and pieces for her beauty salon. Her sister was in tow this time.Tracy Alcock was shopping with her 10-week-old daughter, Ruby. “It is her first trip to Penneys but I think she is going to be a fan just like her mam,” Tracy said. Ruby said nothing but she looked intrigued by the world around her. “It is brilliant to get out a bit and to buy some clothes for her.”The staff manning the tills were full of smiles too. “It’s great to be back,” one told this newspaper as it queued with an armful of socks, t-shirts and baby clothes bought for, um, research purposes. “You’re the first man we’ve seen in here all day,” her colleague added.Outside Penneys, the city was suddenly alive with people. It was almost like Dublin in the rare auld times. There were people carrying bags, talking and laughing as they went about their days. There were scores of people waiting for appointments outside Zara and JD Sports and other shops along the stretch from Mary Street to Henry Street.Outside Arnotts, the queue was being policed by a woman dressed in super-cool black. As people approached her she checked their names on an iPad and in they went.Caoimhe Byrnes from Artane was wandering the cosmetics hall with a couple of bags already under her arm. “I am delighted to be back out shopping,” she said. “Shopping online is just not the same, there is no atmosphere and you have to wait for the stuff to arrive but this is instant retail therapy.”Aideen Dune was almost as thrilled. “It feels like Christmas here today. More than the actual shopping, it is the return to normality that I am loving. The last lockdown was the toughest but I really think we are getting there now and the summer is going to be great. Hopefully this is the end of it now.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"ireland reopens inter county travel resumes as hairdressers and non essential retail return","story":"Shoppers in Dublin after an appointment at clothes retailer Penneys. Non-essential retail has opened for click-and-collect and appointment-only shopping as part of a major easing of lockdown restrictions. Photograph: Dara Mac DonaillA major relaxing on Monday of Covid-19 restrictions after five months of strict lockdown sees the return of non-essential retail by appointment, hairdressers and barbers, an easing of the rules around outdoor meetings and the resumption of religious worship in churches.Taoiseach Micheál Martin urged people to be “vigilant about personal behaviour” and to continue to take precautions against the spread of the virus as the country begins its largest reopening since last summer.Inter-county travel for non-essential reasons is now permitted.Mr Martin, who received his own first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine in Cork on Sunday, predicted a “psychological uplift” from this week with retail starting again.He also cautioned: “The natural instinct is to get out and meet people... but that does not mean we drop our guard in terms of personal behaviour.”Non-essential retail opened for click-and-collect and appointment-only shopping on Monday ahead of a full reopening next week.It comes as the HSE prepares to vaccinate 250,000 to 270,000 people this week, the highest number yet in the rollout.An estimated 240,000 people were vaccinated last week, including a record 52,000 on Friday.HindranceAs reopening commences, Mr Martin rejected suggestions that the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) is proving a hindrance to the retail sector recruiting staff because people can get more by drawing the State support.He said he had heard retailers say they were finding it difficult to get staff in advance of reopening, but he disputed such difficulties were due to the PUP proving too attractive for workers.He said 100,000 people have come off the payment since February, “which kind of gives the lie to that notion that people are going to stay on PUP because it’s better than getting a job,” he said.Retail Excellence managing director Duncan Graham said: “Now, it is critically important that once we reopen, we stay open.”He said it was too early to tell if the PUP rate is discouraging people from returning to jobs, but it “could be an issue further down the road” as hospitality reopens later in the summer and both sectors compete to hire from the same pool of potential workers.Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys on Sunday night offered no indication of when the Government intends to begin tapering the payments.She told The : “At the end of May, we will set out the future of PUP post-June 30th taking account of the trajectory of the virus, progress on the vaccine rollout, and the continued impact of the pandemic on the economy over the months ahead.”Tánaiste Leo Varadkar said about 12,000 businesses are expected to reopen their premises or resume normal trading this week, with 100,000 people due to return to work this month. He said this is happening after the longest lockdown since the pandemic began, and “I am determined to do all we can to ensure that it is the last”.Digital passportMr Martin, meanwhile, signalled that foreign travel will be possible later in the summer as he confirmed Ireland will participate in the EU’s planned digital vaccine passport regime once it is finalised.He said the EU’s timeframe is from June to the end of July in terms of the digital passport being in operation.He also indicated that he supports the use of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (J\u0026ampJ) jab for under-50s.The J\u0026ampJ vaccine was recommended for use in the over-50s by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) amid links to very rare blood clots in younger age groups.However, the Government is reviewing HSE proposals for changes in the vaccination programme which would include use of the J\u0026ampJ vaccines for younger people.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons may 2021","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2020 by clicking here or call 0844 871 1514. To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Coronavirus latest news: UK lowers alert level to 3, meaning \u0026#39epidemic in general circulation\u0026#39Anger as Chinese safari park kept leopard breakout from the public for three weeksMinke whale spotted in Thames after escaping rescue attemptWhat is Prince Harry trying to tell us with his new series The Me You Can’t See?More than 300 injured in clashes between Israeli forces and Palestinians at Jerusalem\u0026#39s al-Aqsa mosqueCovid lockdown roadmap: the rules that could change from May 17What to expect from Boris Johnson\u0026#39s roadmap announcement today - and what might not be answered Prince Harry says most people \u0026#39carry some form of unresolved trauma, loss or grief\u0026#39 as he launches mental health seriesIndian coronavirus variant unlikely to slow down lockdown releaseComment: By appointing a shadow minister for everything, Starmer looks a foolMyanmar poet dies while detained by juntaWatch: Israeli car hits Palestinian amid chaos of clashes at al-Aqsa mosqueComment: The London commentariat is still giving the SNP an easy rideGiant eagles to be released over Royal Sandringham estate in 200-year firstComment: The hand-wringing over Angela Rayner is exactly the problem - Labour must move past identity politicsWatch: Sir David Attenborough warns of ‘crippling problems’ as he\u0026#39s made People\u0026#39s Advocate of COP26 Where has it gone wrong for Labour and Sir Keir Starmer?  readers have their sayNicola Sturgeon must publish advice on legality of Indyref2, says Gordon BrownTomatoes and lavender at risk of decimation by foreign pests, RHS warns gardenersThe Queen recalls working \u0026#39very hard\u0026#39 in 1941 for a life saving badge which she thought was \u0026#39very grand\u0026#39Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"search monuments slavery links church england tells parishes","story":"The Church of England is this week set to tell every parish and cathedral to review historical items like memorials and monuments for slavery and colonialism links.The country\u0027s 12,500 parishes and 42 cathedrals will be told that ignoring items where evidence shows “contested heritage” will no longer be an option, in new CofE guidance to be issued on Tuesday.Local residents should be consulted if concerns are raised by churchgoers and members of the public, the 28-page document is expected to say.This could include removing statues and plaques deemed offensive, or adding plaques to declare their history, the Observer reported. Gravestones are slightly more complex, because permission might have to be sought from consistory courts to make any adjustments.But a backlash is already growing, led by Bishop Michael Nazir-Ali who said the church has “a history of campaigning for abolition of slavery”, while a vicar branded the move “eerily Orwellian”.The guidance comes after Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury, called for the church’s statues to be reviewed to assess if they “should all be there”, in the wake of last summer’s Black Lives Matter protests.One of the guidance authors, Becky Clark, the CofE’s director of churches and cathedrals, told The : “Although this guidance will be issued by the national Church it focuses on what actions can be taken locally, and how parishes can understand and respond to their own histories.“Churches are not museums they are living places of worship shaped by the faith they proclaim and reflecting those who worship there, their communities and wider society. So inevitably they have been adapted again and again, often over centuries.“Local churches are already engaging with the issues raised by contested heritage and the national church will continue to support them in that process. We can\u0027t and shouldn\u0027t try to erase the past but neither should we ignore it.”Some churches have already acted, including Bristol Cathedral which has removed a window dedicated to Edward Colston, the 17th century merchant who traded in slaves. Instead, a notice will explain the CofE’s links to slavers.St Margaret’s church in Rottingdean, Sussex, has removed two “deeply offensive” grave headstones which contained racial slurs, while St Peter’s in Dorchester has covered a plaque commemorating a plantation owner.Last month, a CofE anti-racism task force set up following George Floyd’s death called for all church shortlists to have at least one ethnic minority candidate, one of 47 recommendations.But ahead of the fresh guidance, Dr Nazir-Ali, who was Bishop of Rochester from 1994 until 2009, warned against “blanket judgements” on figures connected to the Empire, and said supporting cash-strapped congregations reeling from the pandemic was a higher priority.“The Church of England is fixated on the dark and the bad side of the Empire, the church has a history of campaigning for the abolition of slavery,” he said.“Why not celebrate these positively virtuous parts of our history rather than constantly looking at the darkness?”Daniel French, the vicar of Salcombe and Malborough, in Devon, added: “Although the motives may be well meaning, I can’t help but feel really uneasy that there is something eerily Orwellian in ‘cancelling’ statues and monuments.“Do we know enough about our ancestors to second guess their motives, can we imagine that a potential candidate for this repented later in life? Once you begin on this process where do you stop?”A CofE spokesman said: “Guidance will be published shortly to help churches, cathedrals and communities think through issues of contested heritage. It will not tell people what to do but offer a range of considerations together with ideas for framing local discussions.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"balcony gardens feature chelsea flower show tries relevant young","story":"Balcony gardens will feature at Chelsea Flower Show for the first time as curators try to be relevant to young renters.Following the decision to postpone the RHS Chelsea Flower Show until September for the first time in its 108-year history, designers have been tweaking their plans for the later show, and new exhibits have been planned.He added that the new show will appeal more to renters, who can take their prized plants with them when they move house.People who rent their home are planting up their balconies and patios so they can take the containers when they go, he said.There is certainly a younger audience that is interested in gardening and have very different ideas of what they want around house plants.

This farm is a ten-minute drive from the estate. The birds of prey became extinct in Britain by the early 20th century due to persecution, and there is not yet a breeding population in mainland England. They were reintroduced to Scotland from the 1970s, with the first reintroduction in England, where the species was once widespread in southern and eastern areas, taking place on the Isle of Wight in 2019. There has been some opposition to the releases from sheep farmers, who are concerned the eagles could snatch lambs.Wild Ken Hill had to receive permission from some of their neighbours for the scheme to go ahead, and it is believed Sandringham Estate did not oppose the plans, despite Prince Charles\u0027 organic sheep farm at Sandringham.During the consultation earlier this year, a spokesperson for the estate told The  that they welcome attempts by neighbours to improve the natural environment.They said: The Sandringham Estate is committed to supporting a wide range of birds and wildlife. We always welcome the opportunity to contribute to the conservation work in the area.Wild Ken Hill said they were given the go-ahead after a detailed feasibility study and a public consultation which showed high local support, with 91 per cent backing the scheme, and 63 per cent of farmers indicating support for the proposals.As a result of the current Covid-19 situation\u0027s impact on international travel, the first birds are likely to be introduced in 2022.Dominic Buscall, manager at Wild Ken Hill, said: We are delighted to have the go-ahead to bring back white-tailed eagles to eastern England, and overwhelmed by the support we have received from all sectors.We have also carefully been listening to concerns where they have arisen, and we are now committed to delivering this important conservation project and working with all of our stakeholders to ensure its success.Six of the birds released on the Isle of Wight have spent time in Norfolk in the past year, but conservationists say it would take a long time for the species to increase its population and recolonise East Anglia without help.The aim is to establish a small breeding population of about six to 10 pairs, which will take some time to become established as white-tailed eagles do not usually breed until they are five years old, the conservationists said.Roy Dennis, who was behind the re-introductions in the Isle of Wight and is helping with this project, said: The breeding biology of white-tailed eagles means that although young birds range extensively in their early years, they usually return to their natal area to breed.However, if, in the future, young birds from other populations encounter a small breeding population of white-tailed eagles in East Anglia, they may be encouraged to stay.Dave Slater, director for wildlife licensing at Natural England, said: Our experts have carefully assessed the project against guidelines for the reintroduction of species, as well as the potential environmental, social and economic impacts.And we are satisfied that there are no significant risks associated with it.We\u0027re content that the applicants\u0027 experience, as well as our expertise and licensing process, ensures the project will be carried out in a responsible, well-managed way that takes account of concerns and makes a positive contribution to both people and wildlife.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"inside americas cold case revolution new super effective dna","story":"Convicted killer Ledell Lee protested his innocence up until his death in 2017 by lethal injection at an Arkansas county prison.Lee was accused of strangling and fatally bludgeoning a 26-year-old woman in 1993, but his prints were never found on the murder weapon and testimony putting him at the scene was later discovered to have been flawed.Four years after his death, the state agreed to allow a new test of the DNA evidence from the crime scene that used sophisticated genome sequencing.What it showed was conclusive - they had executed the wrong man. The DNA was not a match for Lee, but another - still unknown - killer.“The investigation into the case remains open due to the possibility of a future database ‘hit’ to the unknown male DNA or unknown fingerprints from the crime scene,” Nina Morrison, Senior Litigation Counsel at the Innocence Project, said in a statement last week.There was no match found in the FBI’s national database, but Lee’s family is hoping that a relatively new forensic technique - which identifies suspects through DNA similarities with relatives - will help finally clear his name.Investigators in the US have had considerable success with it so far. Since identifying in 2018 the so-called Golden State killer, who murdered 13 people and raped dozens in the 1970s and 80s, they have solved more than 50 other cold cases.While the development has been welcomed by the Innocence Project and those fighting for justice for the accused, others have serious concerns about the implications for privacy.Some of the more rudimentary DNA testing is being done by generating a subset of key markers from a person’s DNA code, like an abridged version of a book.But increasingly, investigators are turning to private companies for whole-genome sequencing, which reconstructs a person’s entire DNA code and gives investigators the tools to solve cases much quicker and easier.They then compare the DNA code with data from ancestry sites such as GEDMatch and FamilyTreeDNA.Unlike state and federal criminal databases, theirs are enormous, including millions of people who have voluntarily uploaded their own genetic information.Many, such as Ancestry and 23andMe, opted not to make them accessible to law enforcement.But data from GEDMatch, a popular website for tracking down lost family members, has helped police find a suspect in a case that reached trial just last week in Florida.Former sailor Thomas Garner, 61, was arrested in March 2019 for the 1984 killing of 25-year-old Pamela Cahanes, his fellow classmate at the Orlando Naval Training Center, after genetic firm Parabon NanoLabs re-tested a semen stain found on Miss Cahanes’ underwear. Further testing on the DNA sample allowed experts at Parabon to create the unknown suspect\u0027s “family tree,” which ultimately led the authorities to Garner.He has now been linked to a second cold-case killing in Hawaii around the same time, in 1982.GEDMatch changed its access policy not long after Garner’s arrest, requiring users to explicitly “opt in” to law enforcement searches. Ethicists said the decision ensured that users would be properly informed about how their profiles would be used.“People using genetic genealogy databases for their own purposes never anticipated this kind of access to their genetic information or that information being used to identify people they’re related to,” said Amy McGuire, director of the Center for Medical Ethics and Health Policy at the Baylor College of Medicine.There is “a genuine tension between wanting to protect consumers and be respectful of their wishes and recognising that working with law enforcement provides a social benefit,” she said.A recent Baylor College of Medicine survey last year found 91 per cent of respondents favoured law enforcement using consumer DNA databases to solve violent crimes, and 46 per cent for nonviolent crimes.The UK Government has conducted studies looking at how such DNA sequencing would work in Britain, but a decision on the controversial technique is yet to be made.In January of this year, GEDMatch adapted its policy to allow its entire database to be used for forensic searches related to unidentified remains.This gave scientists from the DNA Doe Project their break in identifying the body of an unknown woman in Indiana, thought to have been the victim of a serial killer who was prolific in the 1980s.They had a tiny biological sample, which contained only 0.3 nanograms, or 300 trillionths of a gram, of genetic material.It was first matched with just a handful of distant cousins, but when GEDMatch policy was changed the scientists suddenly found much closer matches which enabled them to identify her as Jenifer Noreen Denton, a 24-year-old mother-of-one from Illinois. They are now working on trying to find her killer.In Lee’s case, the Arkansas State Crime Laboratory has not yet searched the state database, despite being pressed to do so by the Innocence Project and Lee’s family.“We are glad there is new evidence in the national DNA database,” said Patricia Young, Lee’s sister. “We can only remain hopeful that there will be further information uncovered in the future.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to

Ministry of Defence declined to reveal the date of the incident.In an organisation as large and complex as the MoD such incidents can occur, but we do not take matters lightly, and thoroughly investigate all losses, a spokesman said.A freedom of information request also revealed that in the same financial year the Royal Navy lost sonar equipment worth £792,000. Officials said the sonar system, known as a flank array, had been trailing behind a submarine when it was lost at sea.The disclosures came after it was revealed that the MoD wrote off £450 million in the 20192020 financial year in contract wrangles, lost equipment and ditched projects.Harry Fone, of the TaxPayers\u0027 Alliance, said: With the tax burden at a 70-year high, defence chiefs can\u0027t afford to waste a single penny. Ministers must fall into line and get a grip on public sector procurement.The MoD said: We are committed to delivering value for money and ensuring lessons are learnt to minimise future incidents.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"thousands dying home traumatic final days without proper palliative","story":"Nearly 15,000 people are likely to have died painful and undignified deaths at home when hospitals were closed to them last year, experts have revealed.A major new report warns of a palliative care crisis brought on by the pandemic, which has seen a huge shift in the number of people dying outside of hospital without the necessary support.Cancer patients and those with severe heart disease are among those who have been left to manage their final days without expert care, according to the Institute of Public Policy Research (IPPR).The organisation will warn on Monday that the shortcomings are likely to become the “new normal” due to the NHS backlog built up since the start of the crisis.It found that there was a 36 per cent rise in deaths in private homes in England in 2020 and a 23 per cent rise in care homes.Health chiefs have for years been trying to increase the proportion of patients who die at home, recognising that it is often a more humane experience, provided the right community care is in place.However, the report reveals that the shift has taken place without the corresponding support, leaving many patients and their loved-ones feeling “abandoned”.It also warns that the one-off yearly increase in deaths caused by Covid will become standard by the end of the decade, due to the ageing population, exposing palliative care services to the same pressure every year. Whereas fewer than 600,000 people died across the UK in 2018-19, projections suggest that the annual death toll will increase 20 per cent between that year and 2031.Chris Thomas, senior research fellow at the IPPR and the report author, said: “The pandemic showed the consequences of trying to tackle a huge spike in deaths without the right, proactive funding, workforce, training and coordination.“In too many cases, it meant traumatic final days for dying people – and for their friends, family and loved ones, too.”The IPPR report pointed to the use of non-consensual “Do Not Resuscitate” orders used in the early days of the pandemic as an example of the worst form of end-of-life care. The Care Quality Commission has identified at least 500 cases where the decision was taken without conversation with the dying person or their family.The report calls for the hiring of 2,700 care champions who would coordinate end-of-life services for patients, as well as £2 billion omre investment in community care a year to ensure “hospice quality” care in all settings, widely seen as the gold standard of care.It is also calling for the establishment of an “end-of-life academy” open to all workers and carers to improve training.Mr Thomas added: “The grim reality is that total annual deaths will reach pandemic levels by the early 2030s and without proactive planning, this risks an eternal 2020 in end-of-life care. To prevent this, the government must put in place hospice quality community care across the country to guarantee a dignified death for all.”The new report has drawn support from Marie Curie, a charity that provides support to people suffering terminal illness.Ruth Driscoll, its head of policy and public affairs, said: “We share the concerns that the IPPR has raised today about the need to learn lessons from the rush to community-based end-of-life care during the pandemic, which left too many people dying in private homes and care homes without the care, support and dignity they deserved.“Demand for palliative and end-of-life care is set to increase rapidly as our population ages. Ensuring everyone is properly cared for at the end of life must become an urgent priority at both a national and local level.”An NHS spokesperson said: “Since the beginning of the pandemic the NHS has offered care to everyone who needed it as well as urging patients and where required, their families, to continue to access the treatment they need – whether they are a care home resident or in the community. “All decisions around care and access to treatment, including end-of-life care, are made on inidual basis with patients, their families and clinicians and this continued to be the case throughout the pandemic.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"brits need show photo id","story":"NewsBrits will need to show photo ID to vote in general elections under new lawGovernment plans to force Britons to show photo ID such as a passport or driving licence have been slammed as \"pointless\" as critics worry it will deter thousands from votingmirrorShareCommentsByChris KitchingSenior News Reporter:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video keir-starmer-reshuffles-cabinet-following-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:bjjF,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : #

But former Tory cabinet minister David Davis has called the multimillion-pound plan pointless and unnecessary, describing it as an “illiberal solution in pursuit of a non-existent problem”. Civil liberties groups and race equality campaigns have also expressed concerns about the proposal, which they fear could deter thousands of lower income and ethnic minority voters from voting. Rules will also be tightened on absent voting and voter intimidation.What do you think of the proposal  Join the conversation in the comments section below.The photo ID proposal was first raised by Mr Johnsonaposs Government in October , but it so far has not become law.It is expected to be included in an Elections Integrity Bill during the State Opening of Parliament on Tuesday, the Independent reported.

And it will be expensive… for nothing.” Shadow democracy minister Cat Smith said the proposal addresses a problem that does not exist. In , police investigated  cases of alleged voter fraud, according to the latest figures from the Electoral Commission.  Of those cases, four led to a conviction and two people were given a police caution. Two years ago, the Electoral Commission concluded the UK has “low levels of proven electoral fraud” and there is no evidence of large-scale electoral fraud”.Critics of the plan say about a quarter of voters - often younger people - do not have either a passport or driving licence, thereported.Previously, the Government said people would be able to obtain a voting ID card from their local council before an election.

Your information will be used in accordance with ourPrivacy Notice.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeThe Hartlepool defeat for Labour was upsetting, but it didn’t surprise me. The pandemic squeezed the politics out of the campaign with people in forgiving mood towards the Government following last year’s bad mistakes. Freshly vaccinated voters were showing little anger, just a desire to pull together and get through it all. I say little anger, butI am honest, where I did detect this, it was directed more at Labour than the government. As I revisited areas where I used to receive strong political support, I was told that Labour had lost its way. What do you think  Have your say below Jeremy Corbyn still casts a long shadow. A woman voter in Chaucer Avenue told me: “I cannot believe I am telling you this but I voted Tory because of Corbyn.” When I told her Keir Starmer is very dferent, she snapped back: “You will have to prove it – you can earn my vote before I come back.” There was more like this. The message was clear: Labour needs to get its act together. Locally too, they were disillusioned with Labour councillors who were aloof from them, speaking a language that owed more to far-left platitudes than their everyday lives.  Despite the disappointment of the by-election loss, we are now going to see the re-building of Labour’s reputation locally, and similar fightbacks are taking place in many former Labour strongholds as Starmer supporters gain the upper hand over Corbyn’s army of zealots. ButI take away one abiding impression, it is that in towns like Hartlepool the political kaleidoscope has turned and Labour is not going to recover by attempting to bring back the past. A new model Labour party is being demanded by voters, who themselves have moved on.  In smart and proud former council houses now occupied by their owners, voters want a Labour party that understands their aspiration, believes in social justice, knows this has to be paid for and will ensure that fair rules apply to all – from hard-working welfare recipients to the rich and privileged. They want to be heard, not talked down to, and they want to get behind policies they feel are genuinely useful and relevant to improving their lives. Labour has not spoken to these voters for over a decade since Tony Blair and Gordon Brown were prime ministers.

The Prime Minister is expected to announce that England can enter ‘Step Three’ of the roadmap he first set out in February. That means reopening pubs and restaurants indoors, letting family and friends stay overnight and reopening foreign travel. Hugging between friends and family also looks set to be allowed for the first time in  months, while steam rooms at spas can reopen. Final details were being signed off on Monday morning followed by a call with the Tory Cabinet. While nothing has been confirmed yet by Downing Street, we know the broad picture thanks to the roadmap itself and previous government announcements. So here’s our best guess of what you might be able to expect.  Hugging allowed Family and friends from dferent bubbles are expected to be allowed to hug again for the first time since March . With more than half of Brits having at least one vaccine dose, the PM is expected to say people should use their common sense. Broader social distancing rules, including in public venues like pubs and restaurants, will remain until at least June .But Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove confirmed the plan is to restore hugging from May  between friends and family - as first reported in The . “Friendly contact - intimate contact - between friends and family is something we want to see restored,” he told the BBC.  Overnight stays permitted If all goes to plan, Step Three will allow people from dferent bubbles to meet indoors from May  for the first time since the turn of the year. Groups of up to six people or two households - whichever is larger - will be allowed to meet in an indoor setting. This means that for the first time since the January lockdown, you can visit family where in England and stay the night . It’s likely government guidance on sensible social distancing, cleaning and ventilationwill remain.   Pubs can open indoors The rule of six indoors applies equally to hospitality venues such as pubs, restaurants and cafes. This indicates they will be allowed to open indoors from May  for the first time since the New Year. As with private homes, there will still be a maximum gathering size of six people or two households. Pubs will also be table service only, although there is no need to order a “substantial meal” with a drink any more.   Up to  people can gather outdoors The current limit of six people or two households on outdoor gatherings is likely to be removed at Step . Instead, there will only be a legal limit of  people for outdoor gatherings, except for some organised events as outlined below. This will mean large groups are once again allowed to gather in parks like last summer.  Domestic holidays can resume Currently, only self-contained holiday accommodation can open in England - and people can only stay with their own bubble. Now that you can stay overnight with people from dferent bubbles, hotels, BBs and other holiday venues like hostels are expected to reopen. This essentially means England’s domestic tourism industry is allowed to be back in business.   Foreign travel can resume From May , the legal ban on taking a holiday outside the UK is set to be lted and travel will be allowed. However, Brits ing from the vast majority of countries will have to isolate on their , either at home or in a £,-a-head hotel. Only ‘green list’ countries will be exempt from this and there are currently only a tiny handful of countries on the list, including Portugal and Israel. Most of the countries on the UK’s green list still require Brits to isolate when they get to that country, making holiday plans worthless. However, restrictions are widely expected to ease quite quickly as we move into June and July.  No cap on mourners at funerals The cap on mourners at funerals is set to be axed ahead of schedule when England enters Step Three from May . Currently funerals can only have  attendees while wakes are limited to  - a limit that was maintained for Prince Philipaposs memorial service. This limit was set to be reconsidered in step four of the roadmap, but the government has brought it forward. Instead of a -person limit, venues will decide how many people can attend safely while still keeping up social distancing rules. That means two metres between mourners, or one metre plus mitigations like masks, screens and ventilation. The new rules will apply to both indoor and outdoor services - but not wakes .   Larger events can start going ahead Fans canto sports fixtures in Step Three, with outdoor venues permitted capacities of , people or half-full, whichever is lower. In the largest outdoor seated venues, where crowds can spread out, up to , people will be able to attend, or grounds can be a quarter-full, whichever is fewer. Fans can attend larger performances and sporting events indoors, with capacities of , people or half-full, whichever is fewer. Other events have already been taking place - with bigger crowds and no social distancing - but theyaposre part of a special pilot scheme and people must get negative tests to enter.

And  of them are Labour.  The one MP Boris Johnson has just added to his Commons majority will have little power or influence unless she is promoted to a ministerial role. Even then, she would be expected to toe the line, and will be under more financial pressure to do so with whips threatening her with the loss of a government salary. Inidual MPs can cause headaches, make a noise, and fight for their constituents. But their votes are, generally, in the bag for any party leader.Mayors are dferent. They get to spend money. And they can stamp their name on all sorts of things, as the aposBoris bikesapos that were Ken Livingstoneaposs brainchild can attest. That branding has a huge impact on public perception and who voters will put their future faith in.The aposmetro mayorsapos who control more than one local authority have up to £.bn each to spend on capital investment, plus in most cases a right to levy council tax for pet projects. That can buy a lot of votes. There are  such jobs with control over planning, transport, and economic development in their regions, and  of them are held by the Labour Party.  Thereaposs another  elected mayors with power in just one local authority - places like Bedford, Copeland, Lewisham, Mansfield, Middlesbrough and Watford.

Rachel Reeves is in after Anneliese Dodds was demoted from Labour ’s second-most-important job after only a year.Many in Labour are furious about the botched shake-up - which the party leader was forced to strip back after a backlash at his bid to remove Angela Rayner as party chair. Ms Rayner now has a -word job title, allowing her allies to claim she was not demoted after all. But all the drama risks overlooking the characters who are now at the top of the party - with Ms Reeves first and foremost. The -year-old has an intriguing political record that enamours her to her fans but angers some on the left. Brought up in Lewisham, south London, she attended a state school and her parents, Sally and Graham, were both teachers. She was the UK’s under- girls’ chess champion and has claimed the game is the perfect preparation for politics. The Leeds West MP did, however, admit in  that she’d played very little since leaving school. Labour runs through her blood - literally. She joined at  and her sister and brother-in-law - Ellie Reeves and John Cryer - are both Labour MPs. She wrote a biography of Labour politician Alice Bacon, published in .  Ms Reeves studied at Oxford and holds a Masters in Economics from the London School of Economics. Fresh out of university she joined the Bank of England - turning down a Goldman Sachs job despite the generous salary. “I believed in public service, and I thought the Bank of England was the best training for an economist,” she has said. She did though move away from the job, working also at Lloyds Banking Group before she became an MP aged  in . “I am one of the few people entering politics to be going to a more popular profession, she joked at the time. She didn’t have a perfect start, mixing up the debt and the deficit in a TV documentary in her first few months.also named her as advertising for unpaid interns in .  But having backed Ed Miliband for leader she enjoyed a quick rise, becoming Chief Secretary to the Treasury after  months. By  she was Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary - where she vowed to be tougher on benefits than the Tories. In comments that still anger the Labour left, she said: “ We would be tougher… If they donapost take it [the offer of a job] they will forfeit their benefit.” She added: If you can work you should be working, and under our compulsory jobs guaranteeyou refuse that job you forgo your benefits, and that is really important. She insisted Labour would scrap the “pernicious” Bedroom Tax but for some her card was marked. Despite enjoying a quick rise, Ms Reeves spent five years in the wilderness of the back benches after the  election.  Having backed Andy Burnham for leader, she did notfrom maternity leave to Jeremy Corbyn ’s Shadow Cabinet.She later backed fierce Corbyn critics Owen Smith and Jess Phillips for leader in  and .Her views on Brexit could be a headache for the leadership.In  she backed a second referendum on the final Brexit deal. But she also said there must be “restrictions” on the free movement of labour. Keir Starmer said in his leadership bid that he’d bring back EU free movement after Brexit. Matt Zarb-Cousin, a former Jeremy Corbyn staffer, said: “Our almost immediate response to losing Hartlepool is to make a Blairite remainer who wanted to stop Brexit the Shadow Chancellor. Wish us luck in Batley [a new by-election] we’re gonna need it.” But her supporters will point to her industrious time holding the worlds of business and government to account. She used her time on the back benches fully, heading up the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy committee.

The mum-of-two feared was told her crippling stomach pains could be oian cancer and was forced to make an agonising decision that would change her body forever.Rebecca, , had suffered in agony on and off for  years and was told by GPs she had irritable bowel syndrome, but doctors then advised her to have her oies and fallopian tubes removed.Fearing for her le, she sobbed to her husband Adam after getting back from the hospital then spent hours writing emotional goodbye letters to her daughter Ella, , and son Addison, . On what Rebecca refers to as the worst day of my le in November , the part-time HR officer underwent surgery which immediately plunged her body into surgical menopause at the age of . She was completely unprepared for debilitating hot flushes, night sweats, insomnia and crippling fatigue that followed and felt abandoned. However, a month later she was dealt another devastating blow that turned her world upside down once again. Her surgeon called to explain tests showed she had actually been suffering from endometriosis and fibroids - not cancer. I felt as though I had no choice but to have them removed, said Rebecca, who said a newly qualied doctor told her the symptoms could suggest oian cancer. However, he spent less than five minutes discussing surgical menopause. So nothing prepared me for what I was going to face. The day I had my oies removed was the day my world changed forever. It’s been the most dramatic, tearful, terrying and soul destroying time ever. Surgical menopause never ends my bones ache deeply, I get hot like I could pass out andmy HRT patches run out, I can’t get out of bed due to the pain. And now I want to make sure others don’t suffer alone like I did. Rebecca, from Leicester, explained she was advised by her consultant that having her oies and tubes removed was the safest option. I lost my oies to suspected oian cancer but it turned out not to be cancer, she said.  I can’t really think about what could have been, as I can’t live my le that way. I thought I was going to die, I thought I was going to leave behind my kids. My consultant had told me I had complex oian cysts and a high level of CA, which is produced by some oian cancers. Every year , women are diagnosed with oian cancer in the UK, but according to Cancer Research UK there is no test that reliably picks up oian cancer at an early stage. The two tests currently offered by the NHS include for high levels of CA, but this is deemed unreliable as this can be higher for reasons other than cancer. There is also an internal scan, but there is no clear evidence so far that these tests can pick up cancers early and save lives. Rebecca had suffered with painful stomach issues since she was , but GPs told her it was either IBS, cystitis or was being caused by anxiety.  I have been going back and forward to the doctors for decades, said Rebecca, who relied on strong painkillers to ease the pain. I stopped digging and believed what they told me as they kept saying there was nothing really wrong with me. No one mentioned fibroids or endometriosis, yet I was riddled with it. Rebecca fell pregnant at the age of  and then met her husband Adam when she was  in , but she was left in such agony it took over their lives. We moved in together and on the first night, I remember lying on the floor in the house in agony, she said. It got the point that Adam was reluctant to book holidays or special nights out in case I was too ill. He was getting fed up as everyone was saying it was in my head. But as soon as the pain started, I sometimes couldn’t leave the house it was so bad. After falling pregnant with her second child in , Rebecca found herself doubled over in pain and rushed to hospital at eight weeks.  Doctors wrongly told her it was an ectopic pregnancy - but in fact an oian cyst had burst. I’ve never felt anything like it. I was left for  hours believing I’d lost my baby as that’s what they told me. I had to call Adam to tell him. It was horrendous”, Rebecca said. A scan then revealed all the disbursement from the cyst floating around - it had burst - but it wasnapost thoroughly looked into after the birth. Rebecca explained: I was obviously over the moon that the baby was fine, but looking back, I think the fact I had a cyst should have been investigated more. After Addison was born, Rebecca went back to managing her pain with over-the-counter painkillers and all her energy went into looking after her little boy as he was unwell with suspected pneumonia that was later diagnosed as asthma. Rebecca said she had been to the doctors about her stomach pains, but felt as though she was getting nowhere. They kept telling me it was an infection, or I had pulled a muscle but deep down I knew there was something wrong, she added.  Two months before Rebecca and Adam were due to get married in August , she started to experience sharp stabbing pains in the side of her stomach and feared it was her appendix about to burst. I was on the final countdown to my wedding and I was in agony, said the bride-to-be. I had a huge pain in my side, heavy periods and my stomach was huge one minute and down the next. I was worried I wouldn’t fit into my wedding dress, or that I would bleed through it. But my GP told me there was nothing wrong, so I went ahead with the wedding. I was even in pain on my big day. Three weeks later, in August, Rebecca made an appointment to see her GP as she was determined to finally get some answers. A newly qualied doctor told her the symptoms could suggest oian cancer and she was sent for a CA test in September. When the results came back the next day, stunned Rebecca had to make the agonising decision to have her oies removed and she was booked in for surgery at Leicester General Hospital just four weeks later.  I was crying my eyes out on the way down to surgery. I didn’t want to be put to sleep, she heartbreakingly explained. I came round from the anesthesia and was sick and in pain.Then my body went into surgical menopause. I didn’t know anything about it. The HRT was making me really depressed, and I ended up turning to Facebook groups for help.My doctor told me she didn’t know enough about HRT or surgical menopause. I felt abandoned. I had to take my care and health into my own hands. One month later, Rebecca’s surgeon called her to explain tests on her oies had revealed her suspected cancer was actually endometriosis and fibroids. The operation changed my le for the worse, but at least I’m still here. I could have developed cancer next year and maybe it wouldn’t have been caught in time - I can’t think about ‘what s’, she said. Rebecca believes when it comes to aftercare and information about surgical menopause she has been let down by the health system every step of the way. After her devastating ordeal, Rebecca is now raising awareness of what she has been through so other women are more prepared.

Nine years of yo-yo dieting actually saw her gaining st, which impacted her confidence and left her dreading nights out with friends.But after spotting a post from The Munro Method on Instagram Marnie, from Scotland, thought she would give it a go - a decision that has completely changed her le.The programme, which aims to help people lose weight long term with nutritional strategies rather than crash diets worked for Marnie, and sheaposs dropped to st lbs and wears a size . Now , she tells The Mirror: I had just had my twins. Having four kids obviously my body had changed. I wanted to feel a bit better about myself. Other diets didn’t work because they were usually really restrictive, shakes etc, or they taught me nothing about nutrition. So it would be ok for a while when I was doing it but could never stick to it for any period of time and because I hadn’t learned anything then the weight would go back on. It was making me miserable it had totally affected my mental health, I was really anxious and depressed and didn’t really want to go out or see friends. The thought of a night out would me make me anxious all week on the lead up. I was always very sociable, but I started dreading nights out because I was so self-conscious about my weight.  The programme has also seen Marnieaposs entire attitude towards food change, which means sheaposs more confident than ever that it will stick.

Around a third of people with coronavirus show no symptoms, so can infect others without even knowing they’ve been ill. Rapid testing is a vital tool to make sure people know when to self isolate so they break the chain of transmission. Alex, , from Hemel Hempstead, works for JamVans, a removal company that provides Covid- tests for its employees. He was experiencing no symptoms at all when he tested positive for Covid. “We move people’s homes on a daily basis, and also have a delivery contract with a local hospice – it has about  charity stores, and we help them move all the stock,” says Alex. “One morning before work I did a rapid Covid- test outside the hospice, then sat in my van waiting for the results. I’d done a few of these tests, and thought it would be fine as I didn’t have a single symptom – but then the test came back positive.”  “I spoke to the hospice on the phone from outside the building, and they told me I had to go for a PCR test. My company booked me in with a private firm and I went straight there. Our company policy is that we have to wear a mask in people’s houses and throughout our offices, and I stick to the guidelines as much as I can, so at first I thought the rapid flow test must be wrong. But within an hour, I was told I definitely had Covid. I couldn’t quite believe it.” Alex was able to isolate straightaway, ensuring he wasn’t spreading Covid to any vulnerable people he came into contact with. “I stopped working to self-isolate on full pay, and still didn’t develop any symptoms at all,” he says. “Without the test, I definitely would have carried on working, which is why it’s so important to have regular tests, evenyou haven’t got any symptoms. I had the virus and I felt fine, but imagineI’d given it to my parents, my grandparents or my colleagues  “If I’m driving between  charity shops, with three or four people in each shop, I could have been quite a spreader. I would have put a lot of people at risk, who may not be as young and healthy as I am – you never know who you’re passing it on to. It might sound dramatic, but in my case, taking the test could have saved lives. I haven’t had the jab yet, but I will as soon as I can – and I’ll still be taking two tests a week.Get into the testing habit More than half the adults in the UK have had at least one dose of Covid vaccination and lockdown restrictions are beginning to ease. But the virus is still out there and around a third of all the people who are infected do not show any symptoms. Regular rapid testing is vital to break the chain of transmission – now all adults are advised to do two tests a week. Rapid testing kits are free and you can do them at home, with results appearing within just  minutes. If you test positive, you’ll be able to isolate straightaway rather than risk spreading Covid to others. Millions of people have already made regular home testing part of their routine, as secondary school children and their parents have been able get free tests since February, but now everyone is encouraged to play their part. Every test helps to put your mind at rest and helps protect people around you as the country moves out of lockdown. Around one in three people with coronavirus has no symptoms. Rapid Covid-tests are for people who aren’t showing symptoms. If you’re showing symptoms , order a PCR test. Test twice a week, or every three or four days: it’s the best way to catch a case of Covid- at the point it becomes highly infectious.If you test positive you should self-isolate immediately and visit nhs.uk get-tested or call  to order a PCR test that will confirm the result.If you test negative, you must still follow the Hands, Face, Space and Fresh Air rules to minimise the spread of Covid-. Rapid tests are easy to use and give results within  minutes. It’s important to report your results online straightaway, whether the test is positive, negative or even void. It’s easy to do at gov.uk report-covid-result or by calling .More than m rapid tests have been taken since October , and hundreds of thousands of positive cases among people with no symptoms have been picked up. Information from the rapid tests is kept anonymous, and scientists use it to spot patterns and outbreaks more quickly and accurately, helping to reduce the risk of future lockdowns. Even though you might have already had one or two doses of vaccine, there’s a chance you could still give Covid to someone , as no vaccine is  per cent effective. So it’s vital to test twice weekly as well as continuing to follow social distancing guidance, washing hands, wearing a face covering and letting fresh air in. Rapid Covid- tests are suitableyou have no symptoms of Covid .“Remember, around a third of people with coronavirus have no symptoms, but could be spreading it to others without knowing,” says GP Dr Amir Khan. “Rapid testing is effective at detecting people who are infectious and enabling us to find Covid- cases that we otherwise would not know about. This helps us in our efforts to stop the spread of the virus. Testing regularly even when you have no symptoms means we can keep infection levels low and our country safe, and the good thing is they give a result within  minutes.” And, as Dr Khan notes, the tests are very reliableyou do them correctly. “Testing ourselves for coronavirus using rapid Covid- tests is vital in keeping ourselves and others safe from coronavirus and keeping infection rates in our communities low. When done correctly, the tests are at least . per cent specic, which means the risk of  positives is extremely low – less than one in a thousand. This means it is a very good test.”‘All I had was a mild sore throat’ Kim Tobin, from Southend, Essex, works in a supermarket and had a positive Covid- test in January  Routine rapid testing in the workplace helped Kim, , discover she had Covid, even though she was showing no symptoms. Without the test, she could have spread it to her workmates and customers.“I had a very, very mild sore throat, just a little scratch and that was it,” she says. “I didn’t even think anything of it. I was all dressed for work, ready to go. Then I went and had the test, and after  minutes the lady who had done it came up to me and said, ‘You need to go home right now because you’ve got it – you’ve tested positive.’”"},{"url":null,"title":"everything you need know covid","story":"NewsEverything you need to know about Covid vaccine passports - including how to get oneDespite much speculation, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps confirmed at Fridays Downing Street briefing the NHS Covid app will be ready for use from May mirrorShareCommentsByRyan MerrieldReporter:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsCovid vaccine passports are set to be ready for when the borders open on May  after much speculation \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Fancy an escape to the Chill newsletter for weekly inspiration and advice on UK holidays Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.Sign Up!When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

After some doubt, the NHS app will be ready to be used as digital proof a passenger has been inoculated from when borders open on May , Transport Secretary Grant Shapps confirmed on Friday.The minister also revealed the  countries where -day quarantine can be avoided, which included holiday favourite Portugal, leading to a surge in bookings. As such, the appaposs developers NHSX are now racing against time to ensure the finishing touches are added. Downing Street has also confirmed the app would satisfy the entry requirements of multiple countries, including Greece and Spain, which were placed on the amber list. Greece has even said Brits can use the NHS card given out at their vaccination appointments to confirm their status, meaning those who have had two doses wonapost need a negative PCR test.This is despite an investigation finding almost identical fake cards are being sold online for as little as £, sparking fears travellers could use them to cheat their way on holiday. Below is everything you need to know about Covid vaccine passportsHow will the digital passport work  The Transport Secretary was adamant the NHS app could be altered in time to add a vaccine passportby next Monday. He said: If needed, people in England who have both vaccine doses will be able to demonstrate their Covid vaccination status via the NHS app from May . How exactly it will work is not been made clear - but there are two smartphone-compatible prototypes that could give us an idea. First is the Travel Pass, created by Iata, the International Air Transport Association. Second, is the EUaposs Green Certicate, which has already been agreed for use in multiple European nations and includes a QR code - though is still in the development stage. The NHS passport would work similar to a boarding pass, though whether a code would be scanned like the EU version has not been confirmed. Mr Shapps would not comment on whether the UK would be joining up with the EU and or Iata and it remains unclear how each app would integrate data. However, a Transport spokesman later said: We are working on a solution to enable residents to prove their Covid- status, including vaccination status, to other countries on the outbound leg. We are working on this as a priority and intend to have the solution ready as soon as possible.  WhatI donapost have access to the app  Mr Shapps said: Those without access to the app can request a letter from the NHS proving their vaccination status by calling , from  May. Such a document would likely be similar to a physical Yellow Fever vaccine certicate. But it appears it canapost be accessed prior to the day the border re-opens and how long it would take to arrive by post is unclear. Both the Iata and Digital Green Certicate will also offer paper versions.  How do I get a vaccine passport  If all goes to plan and you have a smartphone, you should be able to just download the NHS app or download an updateyou already have it. It would presumably then gain access to your NHS profile and number to determine whether youaposve had a jab or not. There has been some speculation that those who have been vaccinated and given a physical card may need to input a number into the app as a way of downloading medical records securely. The Iata and EU versions are both also free to download. The former has been trialled by at least  airlines, including British Airways, Singapore Airlines and Etihad, and appears to be the global choice.

The -year-old became emotional as she said: “I screamed and Bobby said, ‘What’s wrong with nana ’ “We told him I had stubbed my toe. “Then Bobby sat on his bed with his McDonald’s watching telly.  “This morning, I realised we will never see her again. “We will never speak to her. “You just think to yourself, why did she have to go  Why didn’t she just stay at home  Why didn’t they go in the van  “But you could question everything.” Her inconsolable family have since come together to pay tribute to the “stunning” mum-of-one, who they say had a “heart of gold”. “Le has been horrendous.

Bobby was meant to be travelling in the car with Natalie at the time of the crash but wanted to stay at his grandmother’s house instead. Andrea continued: “He’s six – his dad told him mummy is an angel and that god only takes the good angels. “I’ve never seen a bond like the bond with her and Bobby they were absolutely inseparable. “She said she would pick Bobby up but he wanted to stay with his nana, thank God. “We didn’t hear anything because she usually rings to FaceTime with Bobby. “We didn’t hear anything and we just knew. “It got to pm and we knew something wasn’t quite right.

I wholly support this initiative. With my own Asian background, I have experienced first-hand the devastating affect mental health has on people when it is a taboo subject – misunderstood, ignored and brushed under the carpet. We cannot allow this situation to carry on because not recognising the importance of mental health has a wider impact on all society. My parents and countless other first-generation British Pakistanis grew up in a culture that doesn’t acknowledge mental health. I remember my own trauma when I realised I might be made to marry someone my parents chose for me. What do you think  Have your say in comments below  It consumed my thoughts as an -year-old. I couldn’t talk to my parents about it because they would have been ashamed of me, and I couldn’t talk to my teachers and friends because they didn’t understand my culture. So I had no outlet for those feelings of fear, anxiety, anger and helplessness. Shockingly, in Pakistan, families often turn to spiritual healers, who associate mental illness with supernatural forces such as witchcraft, possession and black magic.  A child showing signs of misbehaviour or a woman not adhering to the cultural norms would be taken to one of these healers to rid them of the “gin” or evil spirit. The UK has accessible mental health services with more than , registered therapy professionals. Yet many in the UK’s Pakistani communities don’t reach out for help for fear of judgement. In one UK study, middle-aged Pakistani men and older Indian and Pakistani women reported signicantly higher rates of depression than white people. It angers me that the western-educated Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan has not used his  to address the mental health of his population, which could in turn have a positive impact on the Asian community here in the UK.

Dean Moffat, , bet £ on a greyhound race less than two minutes before ploughing into Ric Mboma, from west London, on the A near Winchester at :pm on November , . Mr Mboma, , was with his two teenage kids at the side of a dual carriageway when the crash occurred and he was instantly killed. His car had broken down and he was seeking to replace a tyre when Moffat smashed into him, causing his car to spiral through the air, Winchester Crown Court heard.Army veteran Moffat, of Peterlee, County Durham, had almost continually used his iPhone during his long journey across the UK by as he took to Facebook  times, read  emails and five WhatsApp messages, took two calls and made another.He also frequently used his firmaposs tracking app and placed four bets amid a flurry of activity on betting apps, placing £, £ on greyhound races. Dashcam footage revealed Moffat could have seen Mr Mbomaaposs hazard lights  seconds before the crash and had seven seconds of unobstructed vision before his MAN lorry smashed into the Toyota Corolla at mph. Other vehicles had braked and changed lane to avoid Mr Mboma but Moffat - who was on cruise control and repeatedly veered onto the rumble strips - took no evasive action.  The HGV driver - who brazenly told police using his phone does not distract him - deleted betting apps Sky Bet and Bet  minutes after the crash in a bid to cover up his crimes. Moffat, who claimed to have a gambling addiction, initially told police he deleted the apps so he didnapost see the football scores coming through as notications. Mr Mbomaaposs children, Heaven, , and Witley,  both suffered lasting physical and mental injuries. Judge Jane Miller QC condemned Moffat, an Royal Logistics Corps Sergeant with  years service, and jailed him for seven years. He said: This was driving that decided to ignore the rules for a prolonged time. There was a total disregard for the great danger that was caused to others on many occasions.  You took no evasive action whatsoever and cannoned straight into Mr Mboma, causing his death instantly. You were uninjured, your phone was not seized immediately, and you knew exactly what you were doing when less than  minutes later you uninstalled betting apps. The dascham footage shows exactly what happened,you had not been looking at your phone you would have had ample time to take evasive action. You were on your mobile phone for a signicant amount of time on your journey that afternoon. I have no doubt your failure to realise your own danger constituted an extreme risk to other road users, especially as when you were driving what is essentially a lethal weapon.  Using your phone meant you were seriously distracted. You continue to make excuses by pretending not to knowyou were placing bets. This was a prolonged, persistent and deliberate case of bad driving, using a phone is a gross and avoidable distraction. Mr Mboma was unavoidably on the road and was vulnerable and so were his children. Mr Mbomaaposs daughter Witley, now , read out harrowing victim impact statements on behalf of her traumatised family. She suffered a double break in her arm while her brother suffered a broken leg and has lasting joint pain. Witley, who had to drop out of university due to the trauma, said: I canapost help but blame myself for my fatheraposs demise and suffer with survivoraposs guilt.

The prisoner has always denied committing the killings of mum Lin, , and her youngest daughter Megan, six, as well as the attempted murder of her sister Josie, then nine. The latter was found with le-threatening head injuries but miraculously survived. The three were attacked on a country lane as they walked home from a swimming gala on July , . Stone was arrested the following year before being convicted at Maidstone Crown Court.  Barrister Mark McDonald told The Sun: For  years police have been denying they had the lace, and now at long last they’ve found it.Michael Stone is hopeful the DNA tests will lead to the real perpetrator being found. The bootlace had been used to tie up one of the girls and left at the scene by the killer.  In , six segments of the lace were used for DNA testing but results came back inconclusive. In , Stone, of Gillingham, was convicted for a second time during a retrial after a prisoner who gave evidence retracted his statement. After a further appeal was rejected in , Stoneaposs lawyers requested the remaining section of lace be tested in , with DNA techniques having progressed considerably.  Mr McDonald said the legal team waited three years for police to respond and said they didnapost have the lace, claiming it hadnapost been ed by Forensic Science Service in .

In , Kent Police said the lace wasnapost lost but only fibrous strands remained after testing. In October , Mr McDonald was then told by the CCRC the lace had been found at a police station. However, the lawyer said there are concerns it could have been forensically contaminatedit wasnapost kept securely. He said the CCRC are now testing the lace.  The review commission had also previously requested a lunchbox which had been found at the scene and contained a bloody fingerprint. However, it was told it had also been misplaced. A further review had been launched in  when serial killer Levi Bellfield confessed to the murders before retracting it. During the CCRCaposs review, it has previously not found evidence of failures in the way the case had been originally investigated and never referred to the Court of Appeal.

Amy Shaw, , had a huge growth on her leg which turned out to be Ewing Sarcoma – a rare cancerous tumour. She was -weeks pregnant at the time of her diagnosis and was prioritised for treatment because of the risks to her unborn baby, and the fact that pregnancy hormones might make the tumour grown faster – something she believes saved her le. Now, after being given the all-clear, she has hailed her one-year-old daughter, Ayda, as her ‘miracle baby’ sayingit hadn’t been for her, she might not have survived. Amy first noticed a marble-sized lump on her leg after falling over - but she didnapost think anything of it for over  years until, in , the lump started to get bigger and became red and inflamed.  Doctors prescribed her antibiotics but when the lump continued to grow to the size of a mango, she was sent for an MRI and claims she was told it was nothing to worry about. Amy already had a little boy Arthur, six, with her fiance, Wayne Edwards, but was delighted when she fell pregnant with Ayda in May . In October that year however, she received the devastating news that the growing mass was in fact cancer, after a further MRI revealed a misdiagnosis.  The worst part was thinking about my children growing up without me there and me not seeing them do things I should,” said Amy. I look back at photos of my swollen face with no hair that I think, ‘how did I do that ’ - itaposs only just starting to sink in properly.” Despite being pregnant, Amy needed emergency treatment to save her le at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham. She was put forward for urgent surgery because of her condition and, despite there being a risk to her unborn baby, the operation was a success. Amy was then induced at  weeks and Ayda, now one, was born on January  , weighing a healthy lb oz.Two months later Amy began nine rounds of chemotherapy and six weeks of radiotherapy at Royal Stoke Hospital before she finally got the all clear five months ago.She is now thankful that she was pregnant during the time of her diagnosis because she believes faster treatment prevented the cancer spreading.At the start I was in shock but the first thing that was on my mind wasAyda would be okay,” Amy, from Leek, Staffordshire, added. Doctors said there was a risk I could go into early labour or even miscarry during the operation.I went into survival mode and just got on with what had to be done - I hoped we would both wake up okay but I was thinking about her more than myself.Thankfully the operation was a success and a midwe checked on the baby as soon as I woke up from the operation and she was okay.Aydaaposs my little miracle baby - she meant that I got surgery as fast as possible and stopped the cancer from spreading.Amy had to undergo chemotherapy during lockdown so she wasn’t allowed to bring anyone with her to her appointments.“It felt like I was going through it on my own, but the thought of going home to my kids kept me going,” she said. Doctors described the type of cancer like a sunflower with seeds that can blow in the wind in the same way the cancerous cells can spread - Iaposm very lucky that it hasnapost.

Until last week she had no idea or had forgotten that she had been a trailblazer. “I didn’t realise I was the first one,” she said during a video call with the society released today. “I just did it, and had to work very hard for it.

Smiling and looking in good spirits so soon after Prince Philip ’s death, she recalled those days during the Second World War in a conversation with members of the Royal Le Saving Society, which works across  Commonwealth nations to eliminate preventable drowning.When Clive Holland, deputy Commonwealth president of the society, told her: “Your Majesty, when you say it was a long time ago, it was in fact  years ago, the -year-old monarch laughed and said: “That’s terrible!” Sarah Downs, , a student who saved a little boy’s le when she was on duty as a leguard at a swimming pool in Exeter in , asked her for her memories of achieving her award.  She said: “I did want to ask, Ma’am, because you obviously completed a le saving award when you were younger, what was one of the memories that stuck out for you when you did it ” The Queen replied: “Well, it’s a very long time ago. I do remember it was of course all done in the Bath Club in the swimming pool. And I suppose I didn’t really actually realise quite what I was doing, you know , because I think I must have been  or something,  or  or something like that. “But it was a great achievement and I was very proud to wear the badge on the front of my swimming suit. It was very grand I thought.”  She asked Sarah, a physiotherapy student at Manchester politan University, about her own experiences of leguarding and how she came to win the society’s Russell Medal in  for resuscitating a boy at Middlemore Pool in Exeter. The Russell Medal is awarded annually to someone under  years of age for displaying bravery and quick-thinking under pressure. Sarah explained that while on duty as a leguard she was getting arm bands for a boy. “Whilst I was grabbing the arm bands, one of the children actually had a silent fit under the water. So when I came back to the shallow end, being notied of this child under the water and then getting him out of the pool, I completed CPR on him to resuscitate and bring him back around,” she said.  She told the Queen she was still doing leguarding. “You are. How splendid,” the monarch said. “Do you do it at a swimming pool ” “Yes, I still do it at a swimming pool. I don’t hold my beach leguard qualication just yet,” Sarah replied. “But you’re trying, are you ” The head of state also praised the bravery of another young lesafer, Tanner Gorille from Cape Town, South Africa, who won the Russell Medal in  after performing resuscitation on a young woman at one of Cape Town’s tidal pools while on volunteer leguard duty. “That was splendid work you were doing,” she said after he told his story.  “Yes, I will be soon,” she told the Queen. The Royal Le Saving Society was founded in London in  in response to hundreds of preventable drownings happening in the UK. Drowning remains one of the biggest causes of preventable death in the world today, with an estimated , fatalities every year. Around  per cent of those deaths occur in poor or middle income countries. During the video call on WebEx the Queen also virtually presented Dr Stephen Beerman from Nanaimo in British Columbia, Canada, with the King Edward VII Cup, awarded every two years in recognition of outstanding contributions to drowning prevention.

The pictures Lily found for her new Gothic-inspired room were amazing, but when I started to search for items to buy I quickly realised I was going to have to get creative to make her dream come true. Lily chose an all-black and grey room but I was able to talk her into a little purple which she loved in the end. Finding what my daughter wanted on eBay for just under £, made an upcycle a necessity rather than a choice. I started scouring Facebook Marketplace for old furniture I could pull mouldings from and took inspiration from upcycle websites and the Frenchic Fan Forum.Elizabethaposs first big bargain was the bed frame, bought on Facebook Marketplace for £, reports the Liverpool Echo.She spent a week cleaning the bed completely, before sanding it down, priming it and applying three coats of Frenchic paint in the shade Blackjack. She added: Finally, I gave the bed a spray over with silver glitter sheen spray and several coats of clear nish. Once the wood work was finished I had to reupholster the bed head in pure velvet using a staple gun. I watched lots of video tutorials on Youtube to get ideas and finished the whole thing with a beaded trim to hide the fact Iaposm not a master craftsperson! I also added some more roses to soften the overall look.  The bed had been a cherished piece of furniture previously and I was nervous about such an extreme change especially as the seller had asked to see the finished piece. Luckily she thought it looked fantastic and was thrilled it had gone to someone who would love it. Soon Elizabeth was able to move onto her next project - the wardrobe. Elizabeth said: Originally a Facebook Marketplace find, it got a new lease of le with some wallpaper  and upholstery pins to give it some character. I then added the skulls, which were only £ for the lot. Theyaposre for decorating your car!

Lisa Clarke, from Blackpool, cannot move out of the property because the local authority says it has a shortage of large council houses.The furious mother says the six-bedroom is too small, has a broken boiler and suffers from several leaks, LancsLive reports.However, her local Tory MP Scott Benton claimed Ms Clarke refused to accept council help over the leak and was aposunwilling to engageapos with the authority. Ms Clarke is a mum-of-, who lives at home with  of her children, some of who have special and complex needs. Catrionia is currently the oldest at age  followed by Mackenzie , Kiania , Lucius age , Jaidan , Princess age , Lachlan , Riley and Corey twins  and Malaki  months. The Mirroraposs newsletter brings you the latest news, exciting showbiz and TV stories, sport updates and essential political information.The newsletter is emailed out first thing every morning, at noon and every evening. Never miss a moment by signing up to our newsletter here.  Lisa also has two grown up children who live away from home who come and help out their younger siblings. Youngest Malaki has started having seizures and recently had an  minute episode where he had to be hospitalised. The twins have been diagnosed with autism and have complex needs as well as Lachlan and Jaden who have learning dficulties. Princess is partially sighted and is also incontinent and Lucius is autistic and has severe ADD. Kiania is autistic and Mackenzie has emotional and behavioural dficulties.  Catrionia has anxiety and is currently unable to work due to childcare commitments. Lisa said she is struggling to cope and has also been diagnosed with autism and has severe asthma. She said the six bedroom house they live on Bairstow Street has become unbearable and has several leaks in the top and middle floor which have not been fixed. The mum also claims there are problems with the boiler meaning that the house is cold a lot of the time. According to Lisa, the sharing of rooms and the use of bunk beds has also become unhealthy and so many children in one room can mean something such as an open window can become quickly dangerous. The property they have lived in since , owned by My Blackpool Home, has no outdoor area meaning there is no respite for Lisa and her children.  She tries to take them to the park when she can, however she does not often get the chance. She claims she has asked the council to be re-housed but was told that there arenapost enough homes large enough for families of this size. Lisa said: I was told there is a shortage of large affordable houses however I have tried to search privately too and there arenapost any. It makes me really angry that so many large buildings become available and immediately get turned into flats. I have known families who because they have eight or less members have been re-housed in weeksthey have an issue.  I would have to wait years before a few of my children can move out. Itaposs absolute discrimination, why donapost we matter  This isnapost about benefits as I am up to date with my rent and bills, this is about a safe house where we can sleep at night. My children have several complex needs and we need a house that meets our needs. We canapost live like this any more. The family was referred to social services to seethey could help in anyway however the outcome was that there were no parenting issues at play however the problems they faced were from where they lived. A Complex Needs officer went to see Lisa who says that the familyaposs biggest issue is health. The officer also stated the option of safe beds, where the children canapost climb out, is usually available however in this case there is no physical space to put the beds.  Lisa feels the only barrier to help is the fact that theyaposre a big family - and she contacted her local MP Scott Benton for help but felt like the answer was to leave Blackpool in order to re-housed. Mr Benton told Lancs Live: My office contacted Housing Options at Blackpool council on behalf of Ms Clarke. Unfortunately, Ms Clarke has not yet been placed on a priority list yet due to a backlog caused by assessing cases. We also raised her concerns regarding a leak with Housing Options. They offered to contact the landlord, My Blackpool Home, who are also council run to remedy this problem. Sadly Ms Clarke has refused their help and is unwilling to engage with them. Housing Options have advised that there is a lack of + bedroom houses in Blackpool, private or social. At no point did my office suggest moving out of Blackpool.

She didn’t believe me at first until I showed her the winning scratch card. That night we went out for a meal, I ordered a bottle of Prosecco and we celebrated an amazing day of both a lottery win and a first date. You could say I’d won twice in one day.” Luke bought the scratch card at an Asda store in Brierley Hill, Dudley. He had to rush to the shop as he fell asleep on the sofa before picking up his groceries. Luke, who works as a security guard for TK Maxx, said: I had the day off from work and even though I was supposed to go food shopping I fell asleep on the sofa.  When I woke, I dashed to the supermarket because not only had I got to get the groceries, I had my first proper date that evening with a girl I’d recently started seeing. “Even after my daytime nap, I was still tired, so I bought myself an energy drink and while at the counter I bought a couple of National Lottery scratch cards.” Luke, who studies criminology, checked the scratch cards when he got back into his car. He added: “I scratched one with no luck. I then tried the second and scratched a diamond, then a win symbol - I saw £, but wasn’t sure whether it was a full stop or a comma. When I double checked and saw the amount and I had won the top prize my heart was thumping and I literally started to shake.

Patty Hernandez, , from Charlotte, North Carolina, continued the unusual family tradition by naming her newborn Clayton. She named all of her children with the same first letter in honour of their -year-old dad Carlos. But Patty revealed that she and her husband had struggled to think up a new name beginning with aposCapos before their latest son was born. She told The Mirror: We couldnapost figure out a name and then Clayton just popped into my head. All the kids have names beginning with aposCapos and we wanted to keep that going. My husband is called Carlos... itaposs a tribute to him.

Patty, who runs her own cleaning company, said she feels like her huge family is a aposblessingapos from God. She added: God has blessed us with all these kids, I know some people donapost agree and there are nasty comments online but for us itaposs a big blessing. I never thought I would have a big family until I started having babies. Then I thought aposthis is cool, why not apos Itaposs really fun.  If God wants us to have another child we will have another one. Carlos was by his weaposs side on May  when she delivered Clayton, who weighed lbs and  ounces. The mum was  weeks pregnant when she gave birth - her longest pregnancy yet - and she is still in hospital now. All my other births have been before  weeks. He just didnapost want to come out, she said.  The other children are anxious to meet their little brother. Iaposve been in hospital since Tuesday. They induced me on Tuesday and he came out on Wednesday. Patty said most of the nurses at the hospital recognised her when she went in for the delivery. They were like aposyou were here last year, we see you every yearapos, she said. Patty and her husband currently spend an eye-watering £ on food for their children every fortnight, however she stressed they do not receive any government support.

This happened surprisingly often in my section, Georgia said. She explained: I worked at Primark and there are some stories that still haunt me to this day and this is one of them. I worked in the bra section and one day I had to take out the bras that were in the fitting room and put them back on the shelves. I did my usual, I grabbed a chunk of bras from the fitting room and started putting them out, and as I was walking around I smelt something really, really bad. Georgia continued: It smelt like stale cigarettes and I was getting worried in case someone complained and complained I wasnapost doing my job properly, so I started trying to find what was making this smell. Iaposm still trying to put the bras back really quickly because I didnapost want anyone to complain about the smell until I reached one of the bras in my hand that I had never seen before. Then it clicked, she said. I realised, this was the source of the smell.  Someone had gone into the fitting rooms and switched their own bra out for one of Primarkaposs and the fitting room people did not notice. Here was this bra that wasnapost ours in my hand. Georgia joked: So please always wash your clothes because you donapost know whether theyaposre from Primark or not. I threw the bra away by the way. But she did assure viewers that the old bra would never have been sold. She said: Donapost worry Primark physically cannot sell a product that doesnapost belong to the store. In the comments, Georgia later added: I know not everyone can afford access to clean clothes, the point of this video was to show how easily clothes were switched!!

Unfortunately, some people find themselves getting too involved for their own good. One woman was left shocked after a jealous girlfriend contacted her to complain about a review she had left for her waiter boyfriend. The woman, named Antonia, shared what happened at the restaurant on TikTok, where it went viral. So we were all just at a restaurant and the waiter asked all of us to write a review on Yelp and mention his name in it, she explained. So I did, it was pretty funny, I wrote aposthank you, Ira our kingapos. But then I get a message on Yelp twenty minutes later. The review said: Love the atmosphere. Pretty good drinks, nice food menu. Ira  My king. Love you. Xoxo Iraaposs unimpressed girlfriend then sent her a message on the app, asking her to remove the inappropriate review. aposI saw your review for my boyfriend Ira and I donapost really appreciate what you said calling him your king etc.  I felt like it was inappropriate and a comment about his services would have sufficed. I donapost knowhe gave you some kind of impression or was flirting etc but Iaposd like to know. If not, thenyou donapost mind editing the review or writing a new one that would be great. Thank you. The woman replied, assuring her that there was nothing to worry about and that staff were having a competition to see who could get the most reviews that night. The woman apologised, as she responded: It wasnapost about writing one, itaposs about how it was written and perceived. Butitaposs nothing, I apologise and enjoy the rest of your night. In the video, Antonia said: This is the rest of our conversation, I didnapost want to be like...youaposre f****** crazy. Imagine going on Yelp to look at your boyfriendaposs restaurant and messaging someone from a review within  minutes.

It shares how much they love you, and want you to be involved with one of their biggest days. So to threaten to remove a friend from the event is a big deal. Naturally, a guest would have had to behave pretty badly to deserve that, right  Well, not always. In fact, one bride threatening to eject a friend from her wedding has not received the reaction she hoped for. Talking about the rejection on Reddit, the fed-up guest wrote: I have long, blonde hair in very good condition. It took me years to learn how to care for my hair so they look their best and to keep them in this condition. Basically - lots of time, effort and money for hair products were invested. But ahead of the wedding, things have turned sour as the bride has made a - frankly ridiculous - request about her hair. Now my friend, who has almost identical hair colour to me, but pixie haircut and in worse condition, asked me to cut my hair before the wedding or at least dye them, the post continues. She says thatI stand near her on wedding photos, she will look bad in comparison and that it should be her day. I understand that guests shouldnapost overdress and I really do love her, we had many years of close friendship, but as silly as it sounds, I also love my hair. I know hair can grow back and I could lose the friendship foreverI donapost listen to her. But the idea of cutting my hair or dyeing and worsening their condition, having invested so much, just saddens me. I told her I need to think about it, but she saidI even need to think, tells her how little she means to me and she needs to think againI should be invited in this case. Am I the a***ole for wanting to keep my hair as they are  Edit, for clarication: The bride has already rejected the idea of me putting my hair in an updo braid.

It shows new reported cases and deaths in the last day, as well as the total cases in each area since the pandemic began. After a second wave over winter, most areas of the country are starting to see figures fall again.The proportion of people who test positive every day was trending downward since December.The chart below shows local positivity rates. This is now a key metric that is considered when putting each area into tiers. The colour scales refer to the potential levels recommended by the World Health Organisation.Another key metric is the rate of cases per , people. The chart below shows the seven day rate in each local authority. Similar to the chart above, this chart is also colour coded by the potential levels as recommended by the WHO.In the early stages of the pandemic, cases were more concentrated in older generations. In the last few months this has shted towards cases being more prevalent in younger people – however, cases are declining in the more vulnerable age groups as the vaccine rollout progresses.As the number of daily new cases reduces, the cumulative totals for the health board areas become less important. The heatmap below shows the number of new cases by health board area.The chart below shows the daily number of deaths after a positive test as well as the cases where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certicate.The heatmap below shows the age demographics of the people who have lost their lives to the virus. The chart below shows a daily snapshot of the number of people in hospital and ICU with Covid-. Use the dropdown to navigate to your health board. The chart below shows the number of new tests reported each day. This figure shows all tests carried out, regardless of the result.In October, Public Health Scotland released testing data at a regional level.

to Celtic.It was the first time in the club#s proud -year history Aberdeen had failed to score in six successive games.As striker coach with the England squad Russell will be working with world class stars Harry Kane , Raheem Sterlingand Marcus Rashfordat this summer#s Euro  finals.Under his guidance the Reds have rediscovered a goal threat # netting five in the last four games.Russell was quick to praise the efforts of McInnes and his coaching staff for performing #exceptionally well# over their near eight-year tenure.Aberdeen are scoring again and Russell states the fundamental reason behind that new attacking edge is getting more players into the opponent#s box.Yet that is not as simple as it sounds as Russell insists the team structure must be right to allow that to happen.For Russell it is all about the #intricacies of finding space in limited areas# and key to that is building from the first phase by playing out of defence.On how the goal threat has ed, Russell said: #I don’t want to decry the efforts made by the coaching staff who were in here as they have done exceptionally well.#We put more focus first and foremost on getting players into good areas and what that takes.#It takes a team structure, it’s not just players arriving in the box.“It is how you press and build the first phase and second phase which affects the final phase of the game.#That whole process was based on how we can get more bodies in the box and then how we operate in there the intricacies of finding space in limited areas.#Russell has been impressed with how the Aberdeen squad have taken, and acted upon, the advice he and Glass have delivered during training sessions at Cormack Park.He said: “They are an ambitious group, they’re hard-working and intelligent.“They want to learn and be successful.#Russell and Glass may have the Dons firing in front of goal again but their focus during the summer transfer window will be to sign goalscoring centre forwards.No senior striker is signed for next season as the loan deals for Callum Hendry , Florian Kamberiand Fraser Hornbyall expire at the end of the campaign.The squad assessment by the new management team is ongoing but Russell recently confirmed the door has not shut on any player being part of the squad next season,  including the three loan strikers.Hendry is the top performer of the three loan centre forwards having scored three times, including the opener in the - defeat of Livingston.Kamberi has netted once whilst Hornby has yet to score although the Scotland U international has struggled with a thigh problem.Aberdeen#s only signed striker Bruce Anderson is currently on loan at Hamilton and his Pittodrie contract expires at the end of this season.It is understood Glass is keen to retain Anderson.Although the attack is firing again Glass and Russell suffered their first set back in the Dons dugout when losing - to Dundee United in the Scottish Cup quarter-final at Pittodrie recently.It was a hammer blow as the tournament is wide open following the exit of Premiership champions Rangers and cup holders Celtic.However Aberdeen rallied from that set-back to overcome Livingston to secure qualication to the Uefa Conference League second qualying round.The defeat of Livingston also kept the fight to finish third in the Premiership alive.Aberdeen now trail third placed Hibs by just three points and will face the Edinburgh side at Pittodrie on Wednesday in a must win clash.Russell, , said: #We have given ourselves a chance of third and we challenged the players at half-time against Livingston.“It was important for everyone to go into the last two games with something to play for and we will be doing our utmost to get that third place.“We want to finish the season positively.#Should Aberdeen defeat Hibs on Wednesday the fight for third will go down to a showdown with Rangers at Ibrox on the final day of the season on Saturday.Rangers boast a % record in the Premiership at home with  wins from  and have scored  goals whilst conceding four.Following the completion of the season Russell will join the England squad at their training base in preparation for the Euro  finals.The Dons No. has been a key component in England manager Gareth Southgate#s coaching staff since being appointed in .When he does meet up with the England squad he is confident the Dons# rebuild will already be well on the way in time for the new season.Glass and Russell have already secured three signings in Motherwell captain and Scotland international centre-back Declan Gallagher, Celtic skipper Scott Brown and keeper Gary Woods.Oldham Athletic keeper Woods is currently on loan at Pittodrie until the end of the season and has started the last two games as No. and club captain Joe Lewis is out with a rib injury.Woods# deal with Oldham expires in the summer and he has agreed a pre-contract to join Aberdeen permanently in the summer until .Russell said: #I think us coming in for this last month or so will bear fruit next season.#It helps us to assess the environment, to assess the players and to put in our processes and principles, based on the outcome of our assessment, really.#It will give us a head start going into the summer.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 16 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Each route takes visitors on a real pilgrimage to ancient Christian landmarks, through remote and impressive landscapes.#Whilst Faith in Cowal is a Christian organisation, the routes are open to people of all faiths and none and provide the perfect way to connect with the wild beauty Cowal has to offer. Some of the sites that book-end each trail date as far back as the th and th centuries as well as more ancient landmarks such as Auchnaha Cairn that are thought to be Neolithic in origin.#The walks take in locations close to the major settlements and population centres of Cowal including Strachur, Dunoon, Kilfinan and Colintraive but they#re unlike any other path you#ll find. These are not all neatly manicured and waymarked trails. We have deliberately kept them dynamic and wild by making use of forestry roads and ancient heritage paths. Many of the routes require short, improvised hikes between paths so you#ll feel like a real pilgrim forging your way through the landscape.#There are detailed guides on our website as well as downloadable GPS tracks. We hope as many visitors to Cowal as possible will take this opportunity to step in the footsteps of ancient pilgrims and travellers, enjoy the wonderful scenery of Argyll and explore fascinating sites of genuine spiritual and religious importance,# added Dan.PICS:A map of the routes. no_aFootstepsFaithPhotos: subtlesensorHistoric Kilmun church, on the shores of the Holy Loch. no_aFootstepsFaith_©subtlesensor_Kilmorich graveyard, Cairndow. no_aFootstepsFaith_KilmorichGraveyard©subtlesensor"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor april 16 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Of course, this has generated a massive amount of data which will help our scientists with important conservation work, but it also shows how many of us have turned to nature after what has been a very dficult  months.We need every voice raised to stand up for nature. The wildle that brings us so much interest and solace is now just a fraction of what should be there.Big Garden Birdwatch has shown that people across Scotland have a real passion for wildle.

One of the highlights from last year’s event included celebrity supporters dressing up as much-loved characters to recreate tea party scenes from the world of film. Phyllis Logan was Mary Poppins, music producer Naughty Boy was Jay Gatsby, Emma Barton was Holly Golightly and Jess and Natalya Wright were Alice in Wonderland and the Queen of Hearts.Families with dementia have been adversely affected by the lockdown for just over a year. Care home visiting restrictions, the closure of support and respite services and the resulting social isolation and loneliness has disproportionately affected people living with dementia and their family carers.Whilst Time for a Cuppa will be slightly dferent this year, we know dementia support is needed more than ever.

Retailers in Scotland have invested tens of millions of pounds on safety measures including plexiglass screens, queue management systems, social distancing signage and floor markings, better ventilation, cleaning and hygiene. Shop workers have ensured the nation was supplied and fed throughout the past  dficult months.The reopening of non-essential shops and ability of food-to-go retailers to resume welcoming customers in-store will mark a crucial milestone for Scottish retail and the wider supply chain. Retail is Scotland’s largest private sector employer. So-called non-essential stores have been compelled to close in Scotland for  consecutive days. The SRC and Usdaw encourage shoppers to:Across Scotland, thousands of shops which have been shuttered for four long months are looking forward to getting back to doing what they do best, serving their customers.Re-opening is good news for our economy, for jobs and for our local communities. It has never been more important to play our part in keeping our towns, cities and retail destinations vibrant.Every purchase from a shop helps to support jobs in local retail and throughout the supply chain.Retailers and their colleagues continue to work around the clock to maintain a safe shopping experience, so customers can have the confidence toto their favourite stores.If we all follow the necessary physical distancing and hygiene measures and show consideration to those around us, including shop staff who are doing a dficult job, then everyone will be better off.David Lonsdale, director of the Scottish Retail ConsortiumThe reopening of stores on Monday offers a leline for many retailers. That is good news in terms of helping to safeguard jobs, but the virus is still out there.We expect employers to conduct full risk assessments, follow the agreed guidance and ensure that customers are fully informed of the necessary safety measures.Shoppers need to play their part in helping to limit the spread of the virus and avoid further lockdowns by following the rules and respecting staff.Regrettably, throughout this appalling pandemic, incidents of abuse towards shop workers doubled and Covid safety measures have now become signicant flashpoints.Abuse should never be part of the job and shop workers – who played a vital role in getting food and medicine into our homes during the pandemic – deserve our thanks and respect.In January, the Scottish Parliament unanimously voted for a ground-breaking new law to protect shop workers.Usdaw campaigned for many years to secure these legal protections and we will continue to work hard to ensure that shop workers are protected and treated with the respect they deserve.Tracey Gilbert, Usdaw deputy isional officer for ScotlandSir,Oxfam’s shops in Argyll and Bute have an urgent need for volunteers to help deal with an anticipated deluge of donations as they prepare to re-open from Monday April .Sales from the first day of trading following the re-opening of its English and Welsh shops were up  per cent on  figures, with it being the most successful Monday ever sales-wise for the organisation outwith Christmas periods.Money raised by the dedicated staff and volunteers in Oxfam#s shops in Dunoon and Rothesay helps fight poverty and injustice around the world providing people with lesaving essentials like clean water and soap as well as the hope of a better future.We know from the last lockdown that people will have taken the chance to have a good declutter and we’re anticipating a deluge of generous donations.Volunteers are asked to give as little as a few hours a week of their time and can take up a range of vital roles, from serving customers to sorting donations and arranging window displays.Each shop typically relies on a team of  dedicated volunteers and one or two staff, with more than , volunteers required across the country.As well as volunteers, Oxfam stores are also appealing for good quality donations.Protecting staff, volunteers and customers from Covid- remains Oxfam’s priority, with shop teams continuing to implement strict protocol, including social distancing, readily available hand sanitiser, masks and gloves for staff, screens at tills, regular and frequent cleaning, closed changing rooms and encouraging contactless payment.In advance of shops re-opening, people are invited to register their interest online via www.oxfam.org.uk # just click on #get involved#.Tom Richardson, Oxfam interim head of retailSir,The demands placed on Scotland’s health service by the pandemic have intensied pleas for an increase in funding for Scottish NHS.NHS funding in Scotland comes from the block grant from Westminster. If huge sums of Scottish taxpayers’ money were not being used to pay Scotland’s share of renewing and maintaining Britain’s nuclear submarine fleet, there would be funds available to properly support the Scottish NHS. This will only be possible when Scotland is independent once more.Susan Swain, Dunbar"},{"url":null,"title":"self help bike workshop opens in tayvallich","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

So, it’s an easier morning round for us crofters with only the daft pigs to feed, who long ago foraged every root, acorn and pine-cone from their sizeable woodland.Their little forest is perfectly, porcinely ploughed, but they must still be finding some nourishment there as they seem less frantic at feeding-time, pausing their grubbling and guzzling for the occasional scratch and cuddle.The let-up in winter feeding has allowed much-needed attention to be given to the now stuffed-full Polycrub where every speck of soil, every hanging beam has been usefully employed in the mission to feed the family entirely from its harvest.Raspberry canes, lemon, orange and cherry trees should keep rickets at bay, while the plethora of weird and wonderful ieties of carrots, potatoes, asparagus, and squashes will nourish us throughout the season and beyond.Our newbie attempts to live off the land mirror the much more experienced efforts of families throughout theand breadth of this peninsula and in the village beyond. Thanks to those techie neighbours who set up email networks and social media groups there is a fantastic bank of information and expertise shared locally.Whether you want to learn how to plant oak trees, acquire foraging skills or find out how to run your home on renewable energy, somebody local has been there, done it and is happy to point you in the right direction.Over the last few months this valuable mine of knowledge and enthusiasm for environmental projects has been formalised into the Tayvallich Sustainability Plan, a  for sharing information and taking action to create a more sustainable community.The plan has grown organically from a pilot scheme run through the winter months with Keep Scotland Beautul to a website, action plan and monthly activities.Open to everyone with an interest in achieving a healthy, sustainable future for the village and its surroundings, the plan will work on the whole gambit: from food growing to flood mitigation foraging to forestry and heat pumps to bike pumps # a new cycle repair work-stand has been installed outside the village shop.Joining the online meetings throughout the winter, I was amazed to see not just the number of locals involved, but also the extraordinary talents and interests they share.We only entrenched ourselves full time on this wild wee bit of Argyll a month or two before lockdown so we’re not well-kent faces and, likewise, the faces of many villagers I’ve only ever seen strangely pixellated thanks to my dodgy connection to the Zoom meetings.Hopefully the same is true for wi throughout the area and that my, now ubiquitous, Zoom-accompanying glass of wine has stayed safely out of shot."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 30 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

That data is supported by further research, carried out specically in rural Scotland, which additionally showed higher support for onshore wind power among young people.#The question posed by the surveyor should, of course, have been: #Are you opposed to further development of onshore wind #In Scotland today we have , operational turbines# that#s more than the rest of the UK put together.We also have , consented  under construction and a further , in the planning system according to an FOI response from the Scottish Government.These figures change on an almost daily basis as applications continue to pile in unabated.How many people are going to continue to support onshore wind when they witness the total annihilation of this country It would also be interesting to know exactly where the data from #rural Scotland# was collected. Was it perhaps in an area where there were no wind farms in sight of  the local communities which were questioned but where they were still able to take advantage of any community benefit on offer If successful, the public petition recently submitted to the Scottish Parliament by campaign group Scotland Against Spin should help to clary exactly how much support there really is for further onshore wind development in Scotland.Aileen Jackson, Knockglass, UplawmoorSir,I have been contacted by a number of my justiably concerned constituents about the recent removal of a cattle grid on the Isle of Gigha from the road between the ferry jetty and the village.The space has been tarred over but I have been informed by residents that unfortunately the sub surface area was just grit and so the tar has subsided due to traffic including tractors and lorries. The dip now is actually worse than when the cattle grid was in place.To make matters worse, the damaged cattle grid which is now mangled metal has been left on the adjacent roadside verge.It is my strong belief thatcattle grids are damaged the roads department should replace them with new, fit-for-propose cattle grids, not get rid of them all together.Not only should road repairs be made to last, but at the very least the roads department should clean up after itself and remove old damaged materials # such as this # left behind. If a private company or an inidual member of the public left a large amount of scrap metal at the side of the road they would be in trouble.I have contacted our roads# management through member services and asked them to recty this matter as soon as possible.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward Sir,I am a GP in one of Argyll’s rural practices. Last week I was having a busy morning so was a little later than usual getting back to my car, which I had left charging at an electric charge point.That evening I was surprised to see that I’d been charged £ over and above the normal charging rate per KwH. I checked through the Argyll and Bute website and discovered that there is now an overstay charge – hence the surcharge.I had had an email back in April saying that Argyll and Bute Council would now be charging users at its charge points – the cost being p per KwH. Fair enough.However, there was no mention of a penalty for overstaying. Nor is there any notice at the charge points themselves, save a tiny notice stating #charges apply#.Those seeking to charge in Argyll and Bute are additionally confused by the lack of clarity over what type of charge point is being used: is it a  Kw, Kw or a  Kw. There is no notice on the chargers. This is important because the overstay timings y according to the dfering units.When I buy petrol at a filling station I clearly know what the charges are when I buy a ticket at a parking meter, I buy a ticket and know exactly how long I am able to park there.But it seems that for electric vehicles you have to search the internet to find out the rules – and in my village there is no local wi and  I cannot get G on my phone.Dr Carina Spink, MuasdaleSir,Cats Protection would like to advise cat owners to be aware of the risks posed to their cat by the sun.Pale-coloured cats, or those with unpigmented white noses or ears, are particularly at risk from the sun’s rays which can cause sunburn and skin cancer.Those affected can suffer long term damage including, in severe cases, having to have their ear tips removed to prevent the cancer from spreading.Following a few simple tips, owners can help to protect their cat from the harmful effects of the sun.These include keeping them indoors on sunny days between am and pm, asking your vet for advice about suitable sunscreen and ensuring you provide plenty of shade to enable your cat to shelter from the sun’s rays.Dr Sarah Elliott, Central Veterinary Officer, Cats Protection"},{"url":null,"title":"from cradle to grave","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

And their latest distancing act is to #temporarily suspend# public representation on its Integration Joint Board.I am coming to believe that this critical situation has overtaken long-held belief systems that need to be challenged.In NHS values, the first statement is #working together for patients.#That is well out of date increasingly the patient has been a participator in their care, and the duty of obtaining consent means you can’t have treatment without co-operation.This report goes on to make clear that #collaboration# is a key requirement.

Retailers in Scotland have invested tens of millions of pounds on safety measures including plexiglass screens, queue management systems, social distancing signage and floor markings, better ventilation, cleaning and hygiene. Shop workers have ensured the nation was supplied and fed throughout the past thirteen dficult months.The reopening of non-essential shops and ability of food-to-go retailers to resume welcoming customers in-store will mark a crucial milestone for Scottish retail and the wider supply chain. Retail is Scotland#s largest private sector employer. So-called non-essential stores have been compelled to close in Scotland for  consecutive days.The SRC and Usdaw encourage shoppers to:Across Scotland, thousands of shops which have been shuttered for four long months are looking forward to getting back to doing what they do best — serving their customers.Reopening is good news for our economy, for jobs and for our local communities. It has never been more important to play our part in keeping our towns, cities and retail destinations vibrant.Every purchase from a shop helps support jobs in local retail and throughout the supply chain. Retailers and their colleagues continue to work around the clock to maintain a safe shopping experience, so customers can have the confidence toto their favourite stores.If we all follow the necessary physical distancing and hygiene measures and show consideration to those around us, including shop staff who are doing a dficult job, then everyone will be better off.The reopening of stores on Monday offers a leline for many retailers. That is good news in terms of helping to safeguard jobs, but the virus is still out there.We expect employers to conduct full risk assessments, follow the agreed guidance and ensure that customers are fully informed of the necessary safety measures.Shoppers need to play their part in helping to limit the spread of the virus and avoid further lockdowns by following the rules and respecting staff.Regrettably, throughout this appalling pandemic, incidents of abuse towards shop workers doubled and Covid safety measures have now become signicant flashpoints. Abuse should never be part of the job and shop workers – who played a vital role in getting food and medicine into our homes during the pandemic – deserve our thanks and respect.In January, the Scottish Parliament unanimously voted for a ground-breaking new law to protect shop workers. Usdaw campaigned for many years to secure these legal protections and we will continue to work hard to ensure that shop workers are protected and treated with the respect they deserve.The national charity for older people is encouraging people to get moving every day next month as part of a new fundraising activity challenge.Throughout May, Age Scotland is asking people across the country to Spring into Action to help support older people in Scotland.Fundraisers can take part however they choose, but the most important thing is to make sure they are active every day.All funds raised by Spring into Action participants will go towards Age Scotland#s vital services, including the national friendship line, which offers a place older people can turn tothey are in need of support, comfort and reassurance or even just missing a friendly voice.Running and walking events have always been a great way to help raise vital funds and, even with many regular events unfortunately cancelled over the past year, we#ve been overwhelmed by the kindness and generosity shown by fundraisers still going above and beyond.We hope to see as many people as possible taking up our challenge to Spring into Action this May. With nights getting lighter and better weather on the horizon, this is a great excuse to get out and about and support a worthy cause at the same time.#Whether you run one mile, walk five, or design your own challenge, your fundraising efforts will be making a real dference for older people in Scotland.#The money you raise will fund vital services like our friendship line.

Online records showed his birthplace as #Inchial Argileshire#, which turned out to be the parish of Glenorchy and Inishail at the head of Loch Awe.Alexander McNab was born there to Alexander senior and Margaret McNab in  — one of a family of three brothers and four sisters — and moved south to Burnley in Lancashire in the s. In Lancashire in , he married Janet Wardrope, who came from Milngavie outside Glasgow, and they went on to have  children.Going back a few generations, Clare#s research has traced Alexander#s great grandfather, John McNab, born in Kilbrandon in the area around Loch Melfort in .His son Peter, born around , went on to farm in Connel and is recorded in the  census as an -year-old, farming  acres at South Ledaig, though is described as a #smith# in an earlier record.Born in , Peter#s son Alexander grew up to work in farming around Glenorchy. In the  census he is recorded as a ploughman at Barbreck.#Our# Alexander seems to have been a blacksmith when he moved from Argyll to Burnley to start a new le.Sadly, two of Alexander and Janet#s family died as young children.Later, however, they found themselves — like so many other families — caught up in the horrors of the First World War.They lost three sons — Andrew, aged , missing in action,  Alex, , missing in action,  and John, , missing in action,  — during the war.The grief the family must have borne is unimaginable. The boys# names are recorded on three separate First World War memorials in Belgium and France.Clare said: #What a tragedy losing your sons. Andrew, Alex and John were brothers of my great grandma, Grace McNab Bridge.#Alexander died in  at the age of , after being hit by a tramcar in Blackpool during the blackout. He was living with daughter Grace and her family at the time. A short newspaper report from the time describes him as a #retired blacksmith#.Clare was born in Blackpool and moved to Tees-side, via a spell in Dumfries, through her husband David#s employment.Though her great grandmother Grace passed away in , Clare believes she can detect echoes of the past in her own family today.She explained: #My son, who is in army, has just trained in music and learnt the bagpipes.#Little bits keep popping up. My other son is into blacksmithing, which is also in the family.#And while she has never visited Argyll, Clare would love to at some point once Covid restrictions have eased.#I had a look at images of Loch Awe and have been reading up about the area.

A big decision has been swept under the carpet.#The budget was reduced by £,, from £, to £,.Douglas Hendry, executive director of customer services, said: #Our process is not to fund routes where there is alternative transport available or where there are less than , people travelling annually.#TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGOPiper#s march wins prizeThe Campbeltown piper who won a competition to compose a tune to mark a battle in which many of his comrades fought was presented with his prize on Tuesday # the battle#s rd anniversary.Mr George McIntyre from Meadowburn won a competition run by the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders to compose a   march in memory of the Battle of Longstop Hill in .On Tuesday, Longstop Day, Major Hamish Clarkof the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders travelled to Campbeltown to present George with a specially engraved quaich at a ceremony at the Argyll Hotel.Many Kintyre men fought at the battle which was one of the decisive moments in the Second World War against the Germans in North Africa.Major Duncan McMillan, who won the Military Medal at the battle, attended the ceremony along with many of George#s other old army friends.Before he handed the quaich to George, Major Clark said: #I really can#t think of anyone more appropriate to have won the competition than George McIntyre himself.#If George had not been taken prisoner in  he may well have fought at Longstop.#Receiving the quaich, George said: #It gives me great honour to achieve this.#Then Mr Ian McKerral from Kintyre and District Pipe Band gave the first public performance of the tune.FIFTY YEARS AGOThe end of the road for PaulPaul McCartney, who is at the moment staying at High Park Farm, Campbeltown, has just made one giant step forward towards severing all his connections with the other three Beatles.John Lennon, George Harrison and Ringo Starr abandoned their appeal against a High Court order on Monday, putting the affairs of their company, Apple, in the hands of a receiver. The three now face a legal costs bill estimated at £,.Mr Morris Finer, QC for John, George, Ringo and Apple, told the appeal court on Monday that they now considered it was in the common interest to explore ways of allowing Paul to free himself from the partnership by agreement.Mr David Hurst QC on behalf of Paul said: #He will most willingly enter into the proposed negotiations to achieve his freedom from the partnership by consent rather than by court action.#Well, it looks very much like the end of the #long and winding road# to quote a well known McCartney ballad.What does Paul himself feel about the rise and fall of the Beatles Two Courier men drove up to High Park Farm — which has a long and decidedly bumpy road leading to it — to find out what the man in the centre of it all felt about things.Apart from being obviously excited about his latest and most important success, Paul did not like saying anything about the matter.Though very polite and friendly, he made it quite clear that he does not see any point in giving interviews or saying anything remotely sensational.After ten years of being harried and hustled by journalists and photographers never having a minute#s peace to himself always having been the centre of attraction never having been able to pop in to the #local#, is it any wonder that Paul is determined to live as quietly as possible He seemed as happy as a sand-boy, out there in the wilds.When we approached him, he had obviously been brushing down one of his horses because he still held a horse brush in his hand.His we Linda looked the essence of happiness as her golden hair mirrored the warm sunshine. The children yelled and gurgled contentedly and even Martha, the English sheepdog, seemed happy.The farm house itself has been extensively renovated, a new roof having been constructed and the farm work appears to be progressing normally.Paul himself has changed. Outwardly at any rate. Gone is the Beatle mop, the style which was copied the whole word over. Gone is the boyish grin, which once sent screaming thousands into ecstasy.What has taken the place of these characteristics  Paul now sports a beard the hair remains longish but it is brushed back, revealing the full extent of his forehead the smile is no longer boyish.The former bass-guitarist song-writer with the most influential and certainly most famous foursome the world has ever known has changed.Paul will probably continue to compose such brilliant songs as Maybe I#m Amazed and Another Day but to millions of people, from Campbeltown to Honolulu, pop music will certainly never be the same again.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOSparks and flashesThere would be some fluttering this week among the ladies in the town who are liable to serve on a jury, summonses to appear on the occasion of a forthcoming jury trial having been issued to  ladies and  gentlemen.

If you are taking a long-term view then a garden full of reliable flowering shrubs is also an option.Whatever garden you have, watering and weeding are the key watchwords for May. It is essential to water newly planted fruit trees, roses and shrubs regularly to help their root systems get established.It is also the time of year when many plants# demand for water increases as they start their major growth period. Top watering tips include – every time you plant something, water it in well, make a moat of soil round newly planted plants so that water doesn#t run off and goes to the roots, water pots and containers so that water appears right to the top of the pot and get a water butt.If you have a drainpipe, you have a natural water supply so a simple garden solution for May is to ensure that you have adequate water storage. If you buy and fit a water butt, it will provide you with water for the garden in an environmentally friendly way and on a regular basis.Annual weeds will be popping up now, so weeding borders once a week to prevent weed seedlings establishing is a good idea. The problem with the most common weeds such as nettles, dandelions and bindweed, is that they are very, very tough. They can continue to grow in conditions that make most garden plants simply fade away – and they do that, in part, by using the moisture, nutrients and light of the plants around them.A great plant to get you into the summer gardening spirit is the pretty petunia – perfect for containers and hanging baskets and a great choice for instant colour. It can flower all summer long, providing you deadhead regularly, and comes in a iety of colours to suit any garden palette.Petunias are also available in dferent blooms including single, double, ruffled or smooth petals. They can be striped, veined or solid in colour and most sold today are hybrids developed for specic design purposes such as fragrance.They need full sun and can#t tolerate frost but can grow in a wide range of soils and thrive in multipurpose compost when planted in containers.Keeping on top of garden maintenance is crucial in May. The garden is coming alive so there is plenty to keep you busy. Here are some jobs you should be thinking about this month from the Royal Horticultural Society:"},{"url":null,"title":"liveargylls leisure facilities and libraries reopen","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Their father Stephen, aged , is in his th year of service with the crew.His father Robert is now aged  and, before retiring, he served  years and his father, the late Robert Scally senior, served for  years.The sea is in the Scally family blood Stephen senior, who is also the Campbeltown harbour master, was a fisherman, as was his father.#My grandfather was a fisherman and he met my grandmother at Mallaig, where she was one of the herring lasses who followed the fishing fleet as it followed the herring around the coast,# said Stephen senior. #Her family came from Peterhead and all her brothers were fishermen.#None of the latest generation of Scallys to serve is a fisherman.Between them, the Scally family have served on Campbeltown leboats City of Glasgow, City of Glasgow II, Walter and Margaret Cooper and Ernest and Mary Shaw.Stephen Scally senior and Robert Scally are both recipients of the institute#s bronze medal for bravery and both are qualied coxswains.TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGOGerman giant to call in the Wee ToonGermany#s flagship passenger cruise ship is to visit Campbeltown next summer with up to  passengers on board, it was revealed this week.The Hamburg-based MS Europa will be docking in the town for six hours on Wednesday July  next year, during a voyage around the British Isles.The cruiser, owned by German shipping firm Hapag-Lloyd, is  metres high and nearly  metres long.It carries between  and  passengers.It will dock in the loch around midday and leave for Oban at pm. Campbeltown Harbour Office said that the Europa was #arguably the biggest boat to come into Campbeltown for a long time#.The chairperson of Campbeltown Community Council, Mrs Nancie Smith, hoped a special gala day could be organised to mark the ship#s visit.She said: #This is an opportunity we should grasp with both hands. I anticipate there will be some form of civic entertainment laid on.#Mrs Smith added that she hoped many shops in the centre of town would not close for the half day to make the visitors feel welcome.She told the Courier: #It is important that the visitors see the town looking at its best and we hope this will be supported by all the businesses and shops which will stay open for business that day.#The local director of Argyll, the Isles, Loch Lomond, Stirling and the Trossachs Tourist Board, Mr Bruce Urquhart, hailed the Europa#s planned visit as a great opportunity for Campbeltown.FIFTY YEARS AGOFarmer#s heroic effort to save barnFire dealt a cruel blow to a local farmer yesterday afternoon, for the second time in three years.As fire fighting units raced from Campbeltown, a barn at Low Tirfergus Farm near Drumlemble was ablaze from end to end. Flames were fanned by a fresh easterly breeze.And despite a heroic effort by the farmer, Mr Roderick Morrison, son-in-law of the farm#s owner Mr A Barker, the fire had a firm hold by the time the fire brigade arrived.The alarm was raised by Mr Morrison#s we who alerted him.Armed with a pitchfork, Mr Morrison tried to separate the blazing straw, which was being used as feeding, from the rest of the barn#s contents, but it was in vain.Firemen had to jump clear as the roof caved in with a tremendous crash.The straw inside the barn was totally destroyed.The £ barn was erected three years ago after  tons of hay and  tons of straw were destroyed in a blaze at the same farm.It stood on its own, some distance from the other farm buildings.Labour back in control – by one seatLabour retained control of Campbeltown Town Council at Tuesday#s municipal elections, though they lost one seat to the Progressives.The composition of the council now reads: Labour nine seats, Progressive eight seats.Provost Daniel McKinven and Councillor Edward Scragg, who formerly sat under the Independent Socialist and SBP banners respectively, fought the contest as Progressives. Both were re-elected.And -year old William Crossan, of Kinloch Road, Campbeltown, became the youngest member ever to sit in the council chambers.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOCoal strikeAttention should be paid to the announcement in our advt. columns regarding the pressure of gas from the local works, special arrangements commencing on Saturday night with the object of conserving the stock of coal.A coal laden schooner, carrying about  tons of household coal, which arrived here just at the beginning of the coal strike and was prohibited from discharging by the customs authorities, had the embargo removed this week, the cargo being transferred to one of the local coal merchants.One hundred tons dished out in half-cwt lots, which is the household allowance for a week, will help a bit to keep the home fires burning.The coal fight drags on without the smallest sign of either side giving way. Apparently the nation will have to suffer much more before a settlement is reached, and unfortunately there is no very clear guarantee that even a settlement of the coal dispute would restore us to anything like prosperity.Every minute of the clock-round stocks are being reduced, andthe dispute lasts much longer, the miners will produce a general lock-out of their fellow-workers, which will have all the dire effects of a general strike without any of its heroics.

The dip now is actually worse than when the cattle grid was in place.To make matters worse, the damaged cattle grid, which is now mangled metal, has been left on the adjacent roadside verge.It is my strong belief thatcattle grids are damaged, the roads department should replace them with new fit-for-propose cattle grids, not get rid of them all together.Not only should road repairs be made to last but at the very least the roads department should clean up after itself and remove old damaged materials such as this left behind.If a private company or an inidual member of the public left a large amount of scrap metal at the side of the road they would be in trouble.I have contacted our roads management through member services and asked them to recty this matter as soon as possible.I am a GP in one of Argyll#s rural practices. Last week I was having a busy morning so was a little later than usual getting back to my car, which I had left charging at an electric charge point.That evening I was surprised to see that I#d been charged £ over and above the normal charging rate per KwH.I checked through the Argyll and Bute website and discovered that there is now an overstay charge – hence the surcharge.I had received an email back in April saying that Argyll and Bute Council would now be charging users at its charge points – the cost being p per KwH. Fair enough.However, there was no mention of a penalty for overstaying. Nor is there any notice at the charge points themselves, save a tiny notice stating #charges apply#.Those seeking to charge in Argyll and Bute are additionally confused by the lack of clarity over what type of charge point is being used: is it a  Kw, Kw or a  Kw. There is no notice on the chargers. This is important because the overstay timings y according to the dfering units.When I buy petrol at a filling station, I clearly know what the charges are when I buy a ticket at a parking meter, I buy a ticket and know exactly how long I am able to park there.But it seems that for electric vehicles you have to search the internet to find out the rules – and in my village there is no local WiFi and I cannot get G on my phone.As a responsible democrat I thought, when this election was called, that I would write to the candidates to ask them a few questions before deciding how to vote.We had no hustings this time, even in Campbeltown, and our MSP has not visited the town for ages. So election time seems to be the only opportunity to enter into dialogue with those who want to represent us.Last year I published a book about the uncertain future for the rule of law in Scotland. The irreducible basis of a rule-of-law society is reciprocity between those who make the laws and those who have to obey them. Without dialogue, that is impossible.Only two parties sent me a leaflet with enough time to allow an exchange of emails: first the SNP and then the LibDems.I started by asking the SNP candidate, Jenni Minto, for a CV. That was initially refused, then a redacted one sent. Next, I asked about the Hate Crime Act. I got a long answer ending with a quotation from the English philosopher, Karl Popper: #In order to maintain a tolerant society, the society must be intolerant to intolerance.#I wrote back quoting Bertrand Russell, who said that enforced morality is not morality at all it is pure obedience. Likewise, enforced tolerance is not tolerance, just obedience. I asked what she thought of the criminalisation of dinner-time conversations and other aspects of the Act. It was at that point that the dialogue broke down.I changed the subject to independence. This time I did get a reply, but it was evasive.For example, I had asked what the most important features of the UK were that made her want Scotland to leave it. Ms Minto replied that an independent country would get the government it votes for. That implied thatScotland and England voted for the same party, there would be no need for independence. So, by extension, whatArgyll wanted a dferent government from that in Holyrood  Should it declare independence from Scotland, as Orkney and Shetland have said they willthe UK breaks up  I wrote for clarication, but Ms Minto did not reply.I also wrote to Alan Reid of the LibDems. He sent a CV, but when I replied to that with questions about LibDem policy, I heard nothing more.That, in Scotland, appears to be the limit of dialogue between the rulers and the ruled. Perhaps that explains something about the parliament itself.With Sun Awareness Week taking place this week, Cats Protection would like to advise cat owners to be aware of the risks posed to their cat by the sun.Pale-coloured cats, or those with unpigmented white noses or ears, are particularly at risk from the sun#s rays which can cause sunburn and skin cancer.Those affected can suffer long-term damage including, in severe cases, having to have their ear tips removed to prevent the cancer from spreading.Following a few simple tips owners can help protect their cat from the harmful effects of the sun.These include keeping them indoors on sunny days between am and pm, asking your vet for advice about suitable sunscreen and ensuring you provide plenty of shade to enable your cat to shelter from the sun#s rays."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week may 7 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Yet, at the same time, we are becoming increasingly suspicious that the label on freedom has been switched.For some people appear to be devaluing freedom. They seem to think it means no constraints on their behaviour. They have the right to do whatever they want, evenit causes damage to themselves, to others and to the environment.Jesus makes it clear that freedom is something quite dferent. It is being set free from the tyrannical oppression of our own self-centredness – what the Bible calls sin – empowering us to be free to love God by willingly obeying his Word and to love others by humbly looking out for their best interests.Not only did Jesus tell us in his teaching and show us by his example what label freedom should have, but by his real death on the cross, his physical and historical resurrection and the gt of his Spirit, he made it possible for us to experience it.We must not be conned by the switch that has been made to freedom#s label.Instead, let us restore its label back to its correct, Jesus-defined and le-changing setting, and through faith in Jesus alone, value and enjoy the freedom he secured by his death."},{"url":null,"title":"happy lockdown birthday joanne","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Any forward player will tell you that. If you have a terrible game and score a goal or play fantastic and not score ndash you are judged on your goals as a forward.ldquoHopefully, I will get another goal but I need to make sure I am in the team. I would love another goal and I love the Scottish Cup. I loved it with East Kilbride and Gala Fairydean Rovers ndash it is great and you love those big moments in competitions.Paton moved from Dublin to East Lothian after signing for Hibs around his th birthday.He lived with Helen Leslie and her two sons, Darren and Jonathan, off Tranentrsquos Waterloo Road and attended Ross High School, where he studied physical education, English and sports leadership.The striker was quick to praise both the family and the school for helping him develop. He said: ldquoThey took me in asI was part of their family.ldquoThey were absolutely fantastic to me and made me feel so welcome.ldquoI went for dinner with them and they were brilliant.ldquoIn my first year, I spoke to Sean McPartlin, education and welfare officer, and he askedI wanted to do something. I agreed to it and they said I would train some days.ldquoIt is the best thing I ever did.That saw Paton ide his time between attending school and training at Hibernian Training Centre at East Mains on the outskirts of Ormiston.The -year-old spent two years at the secondary school and told Courier Sport how much he enjoyed the experience. He added: ldquoIt was brilliant ndash the best thing I ever did, honestly.ldquoI was not too keen going to school at that age with football andI had not then I would not have made many friends. The amount of people I met through school was unbelievable.Paul Reynolds, headteacher of the Tranent secondary school, said: ldquoNot only was Ruari a standout footballer, he was a true gentleman.ldquoHe was always extremely polite and his positive attitude was infectious.

Itrsquos named after Saint Fillan and the healing pool associated with him was their next destination. Izzy pulled Bess into a minor road and found a parking place.ldquoItrsquos not far, she said, pointing to a sign that said Holy Pool.Finn raised his eyebrows, giving her a sceptical look her concept of not far was dferent to his!ldquoNo, really, this time it isnrsquot, she assured him. ldquoThe pool is just over there, a very short walk through the trees.The morning was lting and Izzy wandered to a nearby small hillock to take in the view. The mountain tops were still mostly hidden under blankets of mist, but small breaks in the cloud were giving tantalising glimpses of Ben More and Ben Lui.Finn joined his aunt.She spoke to her nephew while looking out to the landscape: ldquoA strath is a river valley, Finn, and the river here flows to Loch Dochart. This is Strathfillan, itrsquos named after the saint of that name who came and settled here to preach his religion, before Scotland even existed.ldquoYou mean the saint whose magic healing stones we saw at the mill in Killin Izzy nodded with a very pleased smile, happy hersquod remembered.ldquoYes, thatrsquos him. This part of the river is called Fillanrsquos Water, itrsquos where the healing pool is.Finn was impatient: ldquoLetrsquos go there now, I want to swim in it!They walked through a small wood of twisted birch trees, their leaves lightly touched by the yellow of autumn. The moment Finn entered the wood, he could sense the place had a mysterious air to it. The path zigzagged down to the river and within a couple of minutes they reached the edge of the pool.It wasnrsquot quite what he had expected: a bulge in the river, where the flow of the peaty water slowed, making a deep and calm natural basin. Finn stared at the deep brown water, it was too dark to see anything underneath the surface. It had an almost eerie feeling to it, yet at the same time was quietly inviting.ldquoThis is a place of myth making and history, Izzy said as she sat by the riverbank to set up her stove. Soon its hissing filled the air. She sipped her coffee, waiting for Finn to join her. He took an apple from her rucksack and sat next to her. He wanted to know about this place.ldquoIt was probably a sacred place even before St Fillan and Christianity came here, she said. She explained how the early Celts venerated water and places such as this were associated with their gods and of the spirituality within nature itself.Then she told him stories about St Fillan of how his ox was killed by a wolf, but that afterwards the wolf ed. The saint forgave the creature and to make amends it agreed to be yoked and pull the plough that had been the job of the ox.Finn spoke up: ldquoBut the wolf didnrsquot do anything wrong, surely  It was a wolf after all and the ox was prey, itrsquos what wolves do.ldquoThatrsquos true, Finn, but it is a tale made to show how miraculous his god was. There were many of them. Another was that St Fillan had a bell that could magically fly and also his left arm could shine in the dark, giving him light to read and write at night.ldquoHe sounds more like a superhero, remarked Finn.Izzy chuckled: ldquoYeah, I suppose that was the idea, it was a way of showing people the power of god and of course people at the time really believed these stories. St Fillanrsquos arm bone became a relic called the Mayne, and there is a story that it was taken to Bannockburn on the orders of Robert the Bruce to help him win the battle.Finn knew about Robert the Bruce and wanted to hear the tale of the Mayne. Izzy told it with humour, how the arm bone appeared miraculously, to the surprise of the abbot, who had been afraid to bring it in case it got lost.Finn looked at the pool: ldquoSo according to these stories, he used his powers to make the water here magical ldquoYep, said Izzy, drinking the last of her coffee. ldquoItrsquos mostly forgotten now, but for hundreds of years this was a place of pilgrimage where people came to be cured. The water was said to cure people of mental health problems. She explained the bizarre ritual of how people were submerged in the pool and given the task of finding stones from the river bed, then spent a night tied up in the nearby priory.Finn laughed out loud at the image of it all.Well, I donrsquot believe the stories, said Finn, ldquobut Irsquod still like to swim in the pool and seeI can find some stones.Izzy knew she would have to go in with him. She had brought their swimming gear and towels just in case, and soon they were howling and shrieking as they lowered themselves into the cold water. Within a minute, their bodies numbed to it and they began to swim.Trees lined both banks and they got a good view of the modern bridge further up the river. Finn watched as cars, tour buses and campervans sped over it, passing without a glance.He stayed in the water longer than his aunt, swimming in circles, then exploring the far side of the river. He managed to get three pebbles from the shallower section of the pool on its eastern edge. As he emerged shivering, the sun suddenly broke through the clouds, giving welcome and timely warmth as he dried himself.ldquoI get it now, said Finn, laughing. ldquoYou actually have to be mad to go in there in the first place!He studied the stones in his hand, then looked up: ldquoI know a story about Robert the Bruce.He told his story wrapped in a large towel, his hair still wet and dripping. It was the story of Bruce and the spider, and he told it beautully, under the shade of the birch trees next to the ancient healing pool. The only interruption was birdsong. Now Izzy was the listener and Finn the storyteller. It was an incredibly special moment.ldquoItrsquos a story about not giving up, explained Finn after hersquod finished telling it. ldquoMaybe it didnrsquot happen exactly that way, but itrsquos still got truth in it. He gave his aunt a big smile.His words spoke directly to her, in a way he wouldnrsquot understand. She glanced towards the trees for a moment, then ed Finnrsquos big smile.ldquoFantastic telling, Finn. And you know what  One of the battles he was defeated in took place just over there, at a place called Dalrigh, the field of the king. She pointed to beyond the bridge. ldquoHe was being hunted by his enemies and nearly got killed in the battle. At least he escaped with his le to later meet the spider! According to legend, he threw his sword into a small loch as he fled. His followers did the same and itrsquos been called Lochan nam Arm ever since, which means loch of the weapons. Some say Brucersquos sword still lies in the mud there, which is why people also call it the Loch of the Sword.Finn was excited by this connection. He wanted to see the loch, maybe he could even find the sword! Hersquod once been to Bannockburn visitor centre, it had been a fun day out. But here, history felt so much closer, more real, although he couldnrsquot put into words why.Izzy agreed they could have lunch at Lochan nam Arm. As she packed up, Finn stood by the waterrsquos edge and dropped one of the pebbles back into the pool. He watched as the circular ripples expanded on the calm surface, finally vanishing. He did the same with the second pebble, again watching the ripples the splash had made.Then he spoke, while still studying the water.ldquoMy dad once told me that le is a stone thrown into the water: it leaves ripples long after it has vanished.Izzy froze, saying nothing in case she chose the wrong words.Finn looked at the third stone still in his hand. Instead of throwing it into the water, he hurled it into the wood. It bounced off the trunk of a birch tree, then fell into the undergrowth.ldquoBut he was wrong because some stones just vanish, like that one, thatrsquos all they do, because they are not worth anything. Finnrsquos mood had suddenly changed.ldquoI hated that stone, he said with anger in his voice.Izzy stood up. ldquoFinn, she said softly, holding out her arms, offering a hug.He just turned and walked up the path towards the car, picking up a stick and hitting the trees with it.ldquoI hate him, I hate him, he screamed.Izzyrsquos stomach sank. Her mind raced over what had happened, what had been the trigger, was it something she had said Then she realised.She walked up the path and found Finn by the car, looking out to the mountains which now framed the near horizon all around them.ldquoYou OK, sweetie  You want to talk Finn shook his head.ldquoI want to phone my mum, he eventually replied.ldquoOf course, therersquos a phone at Tyndrum, just down the road. Letrsquos seewe can get hold of her, it will be nearly lunchtime where she is, so maybe she will be free.Finn noticed the sign for Dalrigh, then minutes later they arrived at Tyndrum.Luckily, Finnrsquos mum was able to come to the phone.As Finn spoke with his mum, Izzy saw Ewen pull up at the petrol station. He was in a dferent car and wearing a jacket with a hood half pulled over his face, but she knew it was him. He was being very careful, as shersquod asked him to be. She didnrsquot know how much hersquod seen and heard by the pool.How to tell him shersquod decided it may be best to abandon the whole trip, take Finn back home and wait there for his mum and stepdad to . It just felt too risky and she was worried about Finn. She knew Ewen would be devastated.Finn hung up and seemed happier after the call.ldquoI was thinking we might head back to your home today, Finn. You know, with lights and TV and normal stuff, said Izzy with a smile and a wink.Finnrsquos reaction wasnrsquot what she expected.ldquoWhy, aunty  Irsquom sorry I got angry, but Irsquom OK now. You promised me an adventure to Loch Ness, why are you giving up and breaking your promise So they walked to Lochan nam Arm. Izzy told the story of Brucersquos escape from the MacDougalls and they both made lunch together by a patch of late flowering foxgloves. Some walkers on the West Highland Way passed them, but mostly they had the loch side to themselves.Finn didnrsquot find the sword of Robert the Bruce, of course.

If there is an opinion that this is a good idea then it could be brought forward at a better time.Musselburgh councillor Stuart Currie agreed there would be other ideas worth considering.He said: ldquoThere are always lots of ideas that come from the House of Commons some make sense and some donrsquot.ldquoYou have to be careful of the costs of having to rename a trunk road going through Scotland to England it would be hugely costly.ldquoObviously, in terms of the trunk road network, as soon as you cross the Border it changes responsibility.

We cannot manage what we cannot measure, which is why it is often left out of the carbon equation.:Claire Taylor: Indyref and a blinkered green agenda could harm Scottish farmings futureThis could all be about to change. Last week saw the launch of a global farm metric ndash a common benchmark to measure the sustainability of food and farming. I attended a TEDx event hosted by the Sustainable Food Trust which is leading a new coalition to establish a standardised approach for assessing the sustainability credentials of dferent farms. A common toolkit which will be rolled out internationally and will allow us to present a harmonised approach to measuring and managing agriculturersquos global emissions.Finally, the role our grasslands play in storing carbon will be properly recorded and recognised for their valuable contribution towards our journey to net zero emissions. It is now up to the next Scottish Government to embrace this global farm metric and start recognising farming as part of the solution.Farming practices will have to change to be part of this journey and I believe from speaking to farmers and reading the manestorsquos of dferent farming organisations that they are ready and up to the challenge, but this sht in production will require long term commitments over future funding.If farmers are going to be tasked with producing more environmentally friendly food which comes with a higher price tag, this has to be reflected in the value of food or  farmers will continue to need subsidies in order to keep food affordable for the public.Farmers today are producing food which is sold at the same price as it was  years ago. The same certainly canrsquot be said for the price of clothing, petrol or house prices.If we as consumers really value a future where low carbon produce becomes a staple in our shopping baskets, then we might have to start footing some of the bill.We all go into our local supermarket with the moral intentions of choosing food which supports good animal welfare and boasts environmental protections, but % of us go in and buy based on price.Food is cheap and we are so disconnected from the way it is produced that we often donrsquot value it and think nothing of throwing it away. Why  do we allow % of UK food to end up in the bin But are we lazy consumers with a disregard for seasonality and the origins of our food, or is it simply that we are overwhelmed by too much choice on the shelves that we canrsquot begin to understand the impact of our purchases :Claire Taylor: Blue Peter has no right to push an anti-meat agendaWe all might recognise a free-range egg label or red tractor assurance mark, but do we really feel equipped to make informed choices on the sustainability of our purchases  I back the proposals by the Scottish Greens and the SNP to introduce carbon labelling, but will it not all ultimately come back to a case of price During the TEDx event, the Chief Executive of Morrisonrsquos explained: ldquoChoice often means the balance between price and quality, price and provenance, price and healthier ingredients, but it always comes down to price.Morrisonrsquos have a clever solution to remove the pressure from consumers and place the onus on themselves to provide sustainable produce on their shelves. In March they announced that they would only be supplied by net zero carbon farms by  and will be working with their  farmers and growers to produce affordable net zero carbon meat, fruit, vegetables, and eggs. This takes away the uncertainty and ambiguity for its customers.As a nation emerging from a pandemic with rising levels of poverty and social inequality, we cannot expect the public to be putting sustainability at the top of their list, but longer term the responsibility will have to be shared by consumers.We as the public need to play our part in tackling the climate emergency and committing to responsible food choices is a good place to start. We need to start valuing the produce on our shelves and nipping in the bud the throwaway culture which has resulted from our disconnect.There is an urgency to rebuild our relationship with food and our understanding of how it Is produced. All roads lead back to education, and by introducing sustainable food production as part of the national curriculum will equip the next generation with the knowledge to make responsible food choices.Constitutional issues cannot be allowed to dominate and ide discussion over the next five years. A collaborative approach is needed to properly address and tackle the looming climate emergency and how our food is produced, purchased, and consumed has to be front and centre of policy decisions."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12582710.jpg?type=article-full","title":"skye-kate-spiers-islands-charms","story":"Where is it Skye.Why do you go there Ive only ever been there for work and once with a friend for a quick overnight trip, but from my first visit I fell in love.

His success in photographing these notoriously shy creatures lies partly in his ability to blend silently into the seascape, becoming indistinguishable from a rock or clump of weed.Yet on a subliminal level, Howard appears to speak the animalsrsquo language. ldquoYou have to think like an otter to succeed in photographing or spending time with them, he says.The Highlands-based naturalist has just published The Secret Le of the Otter: a book filled with astonishingly intimate images of the creatures at rest, at play and at war. Getting close enough to capture them fighting, gambolling and even mating is incredibly rare.Of Howardrsquos three wildle photography books, this is the one hersquos proudest of because it was the hardest to produce. ldquoOtters are elusive in the extreme, he says. ldquoTheir incredible shyness combined with hyper-aware senses and natural camouflage has made them successful survivors.:Line of Duty proves appointment TV is not deadOtters have inhabited Scotlandrsquos lochs, shores and rivers for at least , years, yet their nocturnal habits and wary natures have made them shadowy presences, often accorded magical qualities in myths and legends. At one time, people debated whether they were fish, canines or amphibians: early clerics are said to have argued over whether or not their flesh could be eaten during Lent.And although they were hunted for sport and for their pelts until the practice was banned in , these enigmatic creatures seem always to have been regarded with affection. They were once trained to catch fish or turn fireside spits for their human masters, and there are records of them being tamed like puppies during the th century.Andy Howard treats them with respect rather than amiability and having spent a day on the hills watching him photograph mountain hares, Irsquom struck by his contrasting approach to the two mammals.With hares, he maintains a constant, low chatter as he looks them in the eye and clicks the shutter, sometimes addressing them fondly by name. ldquoWhen photographing hares, you want them to see you, hear you and be aware of you, he says now. ldquoWith otters, you donrsquot want them to know you are there at all.There are no pet names in his new book, in which he describes his relationship with the animals as one of ldquokinship. What does he mean by that  ldquoThe thing I like about spending time with otters is that I have to be as secretive as they are, in a way. I have to be furtive and become part of their environment to succeed with them. So I find myself quite often behaving like an otter.:Northern Ireland at : Growing up in a land of dreams and terrorHe prefers to work on stormy days, when ldquothe wind masks the sound of my shutter, and hersquos not afraid to immerse himself in brine in order to catch the ldquosuper-low, otterrsquos-eye perspective that brings the viewer right into the animalrsquos watery world.Rapt in concentration while photographing a mother and her cubs, he once lost his footing and tumbled backwards off the rocks and into the sea. ldquoI remember looking upwards to see green bubbles racing to the surface, only just managing to struggle ashore.His subjects ndash whose likenesses were obliterated by the salt water ndash seemed unperturbed by the dripping cameraman flailing around trying to retrieve his equipment. That day, Howard appears to have completed his transmogrication into a sea creature.An otter once got close enough to snf his boots another dosed happily in his presence after hersquod spent five or six days quietly observing it while camouflaged among seaweed. ldquoIt had grown to take me as a part of the landscape and would walk past quite nonchalantly within a couple of metres then roll about or curl up and sleep. I actually started talking to it ndash just whispering to see its reaction. It seemed to accept the fact that I was gently talking to it.When I catch up with Andy Howard, Covid- restrictions mean I canrsquot join him in his preferred, Hebridean snapping ground. So this morning, keen to observe an otter in the flesh, I preceded our phone interview with a mini-safari along Glasgowrsquos White Cart.:Celebrating Archie Brennan, innovator, pop artist, adventurer and former Mr ScotlandPrevious generations of Glaswegians would have been unlikely to see otters on rivers flanked by factories, mills and engineering works. Otters prefer clean waters and during the s, over-use of pesticides combined with industrial pollution and other factors drove them out of many British waterways. Some died as a result of toxins in their food chain and their numbers plummeted by %.Since the s, however, the ban on agricultural pesticides such as DDT, along with de-industrialisation and legal protections against culling, have led to a healthy resurgence and there have been several recent sightings along the now decontaminated White Cart.Unfortunately, however, my morning wildle-spotting expedition gleaned nothing but some ducks and an old fox scratching its fleas. Where did I go wrong  ldquoYou didnrsquot go wrong at all, Howard reassures me. ldquoItrsquos the luck of the draw. Otters have a great ability to blend in with their surroundings, whether it be the bank of a river in Glasgow, a peat hag in Shetland or some seaweed on the island of Mull.The fact they often float with just their eyes and nose above water makes them virtually invisible. ldquoWhen they are in the water, especially a river, they almost become liquid themselves, says Howard. ldquoAnd the way they move makes them very dficult to spot unless you have a really well-trained eye.Because they hunt mostly at night, their black, tarry droppingsalong with half-eaten fish, crabs or lobster, are often the only signs of their presence and ldquothe best opportunity to see them is when theyrsquove actually caught something and theyrsquore sitting on a rock or on the foot of a bridge, eating their dinner.Another trick, says the otter-whisperer, is to listen. Having determined that an environment is ldquoottery, hersquoll sometimes drive around with the windows open. ldquoI often hear otter cubs before I actually see them, he explains. ldquoTheyrsquore quite vocal.:Teddy Jamieson: Do we really need a Festival of Brexit Can he describe the noise they make  ldquoIrsquom not good at impressions, he laughs, ldquobut itrsquos a very high-pitched whistle thatrsquos designed to cut through the air. The natural sounds surrounding otters are quite low-frequency ndash waves crashing, trees rustling. A cubrsquos high-frequency whistle pierces through all the other sounds, giving the bitch otter a chance to catch up with it or find itthe family becomes separated. They are very good at communicating with each other.Late one evening, Howard was startled by a pitul screeching and followed the sound to discover a distressed mother otter whose cubs were being summarily killed in front of her by a male. Otters are territorial with males guarding a range of up to km. And while females often live together in family groups, dog-otters are solitary, communing with others only to mate.On this occasion, a marauding male had apparently taken over anotherrsquos territory and was ensuring the survival of his own genes. In his book, Howard explains that ldquobeyond her terrible trauma, the bitchrsquos body would respond by ing rapidly into heat, and the dog would be close at hand to impregnate her.Howard got no pictures that day ndash partly because the light was poor but also because of the emotional impact on him. ldquoIrsquod read about it happening but never thought Irsquod be in a position to witness it, he says now. ldquoAnd in a way I felt privileged to have seen such a raw, brutal element of the le of the otter. People that have studied otters for their le and work have never seen that happen.ldquoNature is quite cruel at times, he adds. ldquoItrsquos all part of the process ndash and yes, it was an upsetting thing to witness.Hadnrsquot he been tempted to intervene  ldquoI didnrsquot really know what was going on until it was too late, he says, though in any case, approaching a frenzied otter could be dangerous. For all their cute faces and ldquohumanlike qualities, these are wild animals with strong jaws and teeth designed to crunch through shell and bone. Howard once met the late TV naturalist Terry Nutkins, who in boyhood had lost two fingers to one of Gavin Maxwellrsquos otters while working as his assistant in the western Highlands.Maxwell did much to popularise the image of the otter as a cuddlesome, furry friend. In his bestselling  book, Ring of Bright Water, he described sharing his home, his bath and even his bed with the creatures. ldquoIrsquom not sure that sits comfortably with me, says Howard. ldquoMuch as I appreciate Gavin Maxwellrsquos writing, Irsquom not an advocate of people removing animals from the wild and keeping them as pets.In fact, the photographer takes the opposite approach, interfering as little as possible with the animalsrsquo natural habitat and presenting readers with a privileged insight into a world in which the human presence has ostensibly been obliterated.Most of the Secret Le images were captured around sea lochs and he often visits a location several times before taking any pictures. ldquoThat way you get to know the animalsrsquo inidual characteristics:they fish at low tide, high tide, where they like to sleep. It means I can be in position, waiting for the otter to come in.Howard conducts wildle photography tours and his top tip for clients is to be patient. ldquoThe more time you invest, the bigger the reward. With otters especially, the moment often comes towards the end of the time you allocate to spend with them. If I just bide my time, it should reward me in the long term and usually that does happen. Otter karma is something I teach my clients: donrsquot push itit doesnrsquot happen itrsquos not meant to be. If it is supposed to happen it will happen and therersquos always another day.And when the stars align, clients have sometimes been moved to tears. ldquoItrsquos such an emotional thing, to have a close encounter with an otter, says Howard. ldquoThatrsquos what drives me ndash itrsquos like a drug. Delving into the secret le of an otter is almost voyeuristic. So highly tuned are the animalrsquos senses that managing to get close enough to take nice pictures without it having any sense of being watched, gives you an adrenaline rush. Therersquos no doubt that my clients and I get high on it. Then you crave your next fix.The Secret Le of the Otter is not intended as a scientic text but a ldquocelebration of the species. Howardrsquos first book may well have been influential in bringing about a parliamentary ban on the mass culling of mountain hares and he hopes this one will have a similar legacy in terms of awareness-raising, so that people will ldquofall in love with the animals ndash thereby helping to ensure they are respected and protected.Of all the beautul images in his book, Howardrsquos favourite features a pair of white-tailed eagles, swooping down on an otter that had just landed its catch. ldquoTo get one eagle with an otter is fairly unusual to get two is pretty special.Inevitably for the photographer, as for the fish-hungry otter, there is always the one that got away. He dearly wanted to include an image of an otter eating a lobster and one evening, he watched through binoculars as one surfaced,  metres offshore, with a pair of distinctive red antennae hanging from its mouth.Howard made for the otterrsquos most likely landing ground and switched on his camera, only to find that the battery was dead. ldquoSo I had to sit and watch that otter eat that lobster ndash one of my dream images. It was lovely to watch but I could have almost cried.ldquoWhether it will happen again for me I donrsquot know. Crsquoest la vie, though. You canrsquot stress out or get angryyou miss a shot. You just have to hope itrsquoll come round again or something similar will come along.ldquoAnd inevitably, it does, he says, demonstrating his carefully honed otter karma.The Secret Le of the Otter by Andy Howard is published by Sandstone Press, pound.FAMOUS OTTER STORIESCuthbert and the OttersOtters are referred to as ldquowater dogs in Celtic folklore, and generally portrayed as helpful, friendly creatures, providing fish or firewood to people in need and even warming their feet, as in the story of St Cuthbert ndash patron saint of otters. A Celtic monk living at Lindisfarne during the seventh-century, Cuthbert was reputedly fond of taking nocturnal walks along the seashore. One night, a curious colleague secretly watched as he waded into the sea right up to his neck and began singing psalms. As dawn broke, he ed to shore, whereupon two otters came up and warmed his cold wet feet with their fur. Cuthbert blessed them, and they ed to their holts.Ring of Bright WaterGavin Maxwellrsquos celebrated  memoir describes his le in a remote cottage at ldquoCamusfearna , and the two imported otters he kept there as pets. He sourced his favourite ndash Mij ndash in Iraq and brought him to the UK during an eventful plane journey that saw the creature chewing its way out of its box and running rampage around the cabin. Maxwell fed the animal on bucketloads of collected eels, walked it through the streets in a custom-made harness and allowed it free rein of his London and Scottish homes where it frequently pierced visitorsrsquo ears with its teeth. The story was partially fictionalised in a  film adaptation and for a generation of children, the scene involving Mijrsquos brutal dispatch, at the end of a road-diggerrsquos shovel, was a tearjerker on a par with the shooting of Bambirsquos mother.Tarka the OtterThis  novel by Henry Williamson recounts the le story of an otter cub that becomes separated from its mother and wanders the North Devon countryside alone, until it eventually fathers a family of cubs of its own, before being killed by the local otter hunt. As a boy, Andy Howard watched the  film version and was ldquoterribly upset by Tarkarsquos demise, ldquoas most children should be."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12582787.jpg?type=article-full","title":"ultenic-u11-cordless-vacuum-cleaner","story":"A budget vacuum cleaner with clever features and plenty of accessories.Good points Costing almost pound less than similar models from other manufacturers, the U provides enough cleaning options to be comparable with premium brands.Among its most notable features is the Ultra Carpet Boosttechnology which automatically detects the type of surface being cleaned and adjusts power accordingly.UCboost means you no longer need to turn off roller brushes when transitioning from carpet to harder floors or having to press a boost button when moving to a thicker pile rug.

Surrounding me were local women heading to the nearest market town. Clutching baskets on their knees, they were dressed in much the same way as their grandmothers and maybe even their great-grandmothers.I sat silently in my corner, pretending to read. We were only a few miles from Bath and yet, as the other passengers talked among themselves, I might as well have been in Bulgaria. I could not understand a word.Their speech was a rolling burr with a treacly intonation, but I will never knowthey were discussing Coronation Street or the Common Agricultural Policy. In terms of communication, it was a verbal hawthorn hedge, keeping eavesdroppers at bay. ROSEMARY:Is it time for a Jilly Cooper-style Holyrood bonkbuster Much has been said about the decline in regional accents and dialects since the First World War, butthese women were talking in a diluted version of an older tongue, God help incomers who moved to these shires before the days of the Somme.I was reminded of this the other day when the painter-decorators were in our loft. Making the best of a rainy week to get on with indoor jobs long-postponed by lockdown, they rollered on the matt emulsion at lightning speed, despite having to stoop beneath the eaves.This pair have known each other since they were boys. As they worked, I occasionally heard them chatting. The sound was a breath of pure Borders air, as blown from the direction of Galashiels.For such a small region, the iation in accents is pronounced. If you have a linguistic ear ndash sadly I donrsquot ndash therersquos no mistaking someone from Jedburgh with a native of Selkirk or St Boswellrsquos.As with so much of Scotland ndash and the rest of these isles ndash many folk are bi-lingual, speaking conventionally when theyrsquore with those like me who are from where, and the rest of the time in their natural voice. The Scottish education system can take much of the blame for ironing out peoplersquos range of expression, but thatrsquos another discussion. ROSEMARY GORING:Dont let politicians kill the dream of a place in the countryAll this was on my mind when reading Rory Stewartrsquos travelogue, The Marches. His account of walking -odd miles along the English-Scottish Border in  was an attempt to understand the mood of the region and the make-up of those who live here.Since previously he had trekked across Afghanistan in winter, this venture was relatively untaxing. Despite its once formidable reputation as a lawless no-manrsquos land, the present-day Marches were unlikely to pose a mortal threat, unlike that which he faced from suspicious and sometimes trigger-happy Afghanis.Walking is Stewartrsquos default state. This is a man who, when getting off the train in Dunblane, thinks nothing of hiking the final  miles to his family home. On the page he is great company, even though I donrsquot always agree with his conclusions. What he found in the Borderlands, however, was curious. In his view, there are three distinct localities: the area south of Hadrianrsquos Wall, the territory between the wall and the border, and the land immediately on the Scottish side of the line.Reluctantly, he reached the conclusion that in the Scottish Marches, not only can very little be found of the traditional way of le, but also few iniduals whose roots go far back. ROSEMARY GORING:Its not just the squirrels who are coming out of hibernation, we are tooldquoI didnrsquot meet a farmer in Roxburghshire whose family had been on the same farm for more than three generations. Many had moved there relatively recently, from Lanarkshire or the edge of Dumfries a hundred miles away. Despite the efforts of voluble local schoolteachers and antiquarians, it was dficult for me to feel any organic links here between the modern population and the distant past.As he trod the hills, moors and dales, Stewartrsquos focus was on the land. He concluded that a distinctive personality remains in the two English districts abutting Hadrianrsquos Wall ndash tourism in the Lake District, and remote, small-scale farming by families whose lineage in the area goes back centuries in the zone known as Bewcastle.The Scottish Borders, in contrast, were ldquodramatically modern. Farming was large-scale, mechanised and, by implication, soulless. The overwhelming impression he took away was that agriculture here was a commercial business, not a calling or an inheritance. Something similar, in terms of size, greets visitors to Dumfries and Galloway, where Irsquom always surprised by the industrial-scale dairy farms. These massive enterprises ruin the fond illusion of countryside filled with pocket-sized farms using age-old techniques.Should you ever want to learn the reality about the past half-century of upland hill farming in Britain, James Rebanksrsquos memoir English Pastoral is an unbeatable guide. Having taken over the family farm in Cumbria, he is now working to revive and restore acres almost destroyed by pesticides and over-production. It is a laborious and precarious enterprise, yet rewarding on many levels so long as he doesnrsquot hope to get rich. ROSEMARY GORING:Lockdown spirits lt at the sight of spring lambsWhile Stewartrsquos take on Borders farming might well be accurate ndash I donrsquot know enough about it to contradict him ndash the communities around Hoolet are filled with people whose forebears have been in these parts for ages.Whatrsquos also noticeable is how porous this society is. Newcomers are welcomed, despite our accents. Indeed, half or more of Hooletrsquos residents originated from far away. Even so, there is still a bedrock of rootedness, a sense of todayrsquos Borderers holding a direct connection to yesterdayrsquos.I was struck recently by a journalist who was writing about ldquoold families such as his. By this he meant wealthy, landed, entitled. But every family in the world is old. Itrsquos just that most of us have not traced our ancestors, or inherited a gallery of portraits to remind us of them.Nevertheless, in the Borderlands the old and once feared surnames are still all around: Grahams, Armstrongs, Kerrs, Ridleys, Elliots, Taylors, Homes, to mention only a few.

Again, urgently, Ms Sturgeon will seek to revive a four-nation UK deal.Why four nation  Because it is simpler to explain and administer, it deters Scots from heading south of the border to get round Scottish rules: and, bluntly, it provides additional protection for the FM against complaints from Scots who might be super-angryEngland gets a more open deal.In tandem with action on the virus, Ms Sturgeon willto Ministerial briefing boxes brimming with information about the economy. Here is a hint: the data will not be universally positive.No doubt her attention will be drawn to a report from the Bank of England forecasting that the UK economy will enjoy record economic growth in , perhaps around . per cent. That is founded on expectations of higher confidence among consumers, happy with the vaccine numbers.However, Nicola Sturgeon will need no reminding that this possible uplt follows a calamitous slump last year, when the economy shrank by nearly ten per cent the most precipitous drop in three centuries.She knows too that the voters will expect delivery of the spending promises made in her manesto: more money for health, education, housing and social care. All within a balanced budget, constrained still further by a pledge to freeze Scottish income tax rates and bands.That promise, mirrored by other parties, was designed to reassure fretful voters. Starting today, it too has to be delivered.Then there is the related issue of securing Parliamentary support for budget proposals. That depends on the final Holyrood numbers.If she gains an overall majority, then she has only to sustain discipline in her own ranks. However,she is dependent once more upon the Greens for budgetary support, there could be some trouble ahead.The Greens tend to push for radical fiscal change for example, arguing during the campaign that Scotland should seek ways to tax wealth as well as income.They will also press Nicola Sturgeon to support swter curbs on the extraction of North Sea oil. Ministers back a move away from fossil fuels but worry about the immediate impact on jobs, arguing for a justtransition.If it comes to it, they may have to remind the Greens that big parties have rights too.Then the fundamental contest.

One or two Tories mutter privately that such an initiative might have been handy before the election, not after.The Prime Minister will also face pressure to spell out whether he would consent to indyref.

There is also input from the likes of the Scottish University Air Squadrons, Air Cadets and the RAF Museum with the Scottish Regional Air Museums and aviation enthusiasts from around the country.And it is hoped the trail will eventually be hosted on the main RAF Museum website with veterans, enthusiasts and members of the public being encouraged to contribute to the site to help it develop.One of the intentions of the site is that famous Scots involved in aviation, the holders of gallantry awards and the role of Scottish industry and academia in creating cutting-edge technology, will be recognised.Read more: Glasgows Cail Bruich has second Michelin star in its sight as it prepares to reopenAmong those likely to feature is Sir Robert Watson-Watt, widely considered to be the inventor of radar. Born in Brechin and educated at University College, Dundee, Sir Robert pioneered the technology that helped win the Battle of Britain. It was developed as the threat of the Second World War became more acute to warn of enemy planes on the move.During the conflict, radar arrays gave the Royal Air Force a crucial edge in detecting and repelling the Nazi Luftwaffe.Through his work as a meteorologist, he used radio waves to locate thunderstorms from his base at the Royal Aircraft Factory in Farnborough in Hampshire. In , Sir Robert was already using radio technology to provide advance warning to airmen.And while it might be the site of luxury hotel Trump Turnberry with its own helicopter landing pad, itrsquos time as an airfield dating back to the First World War could also be documented.RAF Turnberry was used in the First and Second World Wars, and reverted back to a golf course and hotel in between. It was initially used by the Royal Flying Corps and the RAF from  to . In the Second World War, the base was also used for training Bristol Beaufighter and Bristol Beaufort crews. Testing of Barnes Walliss \"Highball\" bouncing bomb was also performed by  Squadron, flying from Turnberry.Air Vice-Marshal Ross Paterson, Air Officer Scotland, said: ldquoWe are delighted to be launching the Aviation  STEMTrail and really hope it will be of interest to many people of all ages, celebrating Scotlandrsquos key part in the development of aviation. Scotland has a wealth of aviation history and continues to play a key role today in protecting our nation. Hopefully, schools and young people will not only find our STEM material fun and informative but will also be inspired to look at the huge range of STEM careers that are needed for our future world. The site also promotes our Flying Aces Scheme, offering flight experience to disabled and disadvantaged Scottish youngsters, so we hope we can encourage more to take part in this too.AVM Paterson believes aviation is still a relatively young science.ldquoIt is only  years since the first ever powered flight ndash yet today we talk easily of space travel and each of us use satellites and advanced technology every day, he added. ldquoBy linking the past with the future, we hope that people will want to learn more, adding their own family stories via the lsquoRAF Storiesrsquo link and then visit and support the Scottish Regional Air Museums as part of this.Details of the historic aviation sites and the trail across Scotland can be found on the site which also highlights some of the possible trail stops for people to visit including the National Museum of Flight is Scotlands national aviation museum, at East Fortune Airfield, in East Lotian the Morayvia Sci-Tech Experience Project formed in May  to preserve the last remaining Nimrod at RAF Kinloss ndash XV the Dumfries and Galloway Aviation Museum located in and around the Second World War-era watch tower at the former RAF Dumfries, and the Montrose Air Station Heritage Centre in Angus.

James Tytler was the first person to fly in the UK and Lunardirsquos achievements seemed to overtake that somewhat. With Lunardi you can visit the site where he landed to this day.ldquoYou could argue that it was Scotlandrsquos role in aviation which played a part in the history of the D-Day landings.

So cheerio doorstep debating, rallies, walkabouts, all the usual fun and games, and hello masks and Zoom.The battle began in routine fashion with the dissolution of the Scottish Parliament.

Or,you were a Scottish Labour candidate, to prepare your excuses.

Yes sir, he can boogie.Willie Rennie continued his quest to stage the most ridiculous photo op ever, with shots of the LibDem leader at a penguin parade, in a giant deckchair, and boxing. Not wishing to be left out, Scottish Conservatives leader Douglas Ross continued his partyrsquos tradition of clambering on to the nearest military vehicle, in his case an armoured personnel carrier. And he wasnrsquot even campaigning in Castlemilk.Mr Ross received a lot of help from his predecessor, Ms Davidson, who even fronted the party political broadcast. Her omnipresence contrasted with the complete absence of Boris Johnson. Having said that wild horses wouldnrsquot keep him away, the Prime Minister preferred to stay in London and dodge questions about gold wallpaper rather than take his chances with rebellious Scots .Try as the parties did to generate excitement, the campaign was proving as empty and devoid of interest as Celticrsquos trophy cabinet. Then it happened. Cue movie trailer voice guy: ldquoThe sky darkened. Birds ceased singing. Jaws dropped. HE was back. And this time HE had brought a whole new party with him. After the initial shock of Alex Salmondrsquos , observers turned to more serious matters, like how to pronounce the Alba Partyrsquos name. Some said ldquoAlapa others ldquoWallopers. Mr Salmond came bearing the promise of a ldquosupermajority of independence-supporting MSPs who would make Johnson an offer he could not refuse.The media was delighted to see theof Mr Salmond, and reporters were soon asking SNP leader Nicola Sturgeonshe would work with her predecessor. Ms Sturgeon gave the impression she did not wish to be on the same continent as her old boss, never mind in coalition with him.The SNP leader conducted a lot of her campaign from her by-now-famous conservatory. FDR had his fireside chats, Nicola has natters in the greenhouse. Consensus had it that the election was in the bag for her. It only remained to be seenshe would win a majority, and which party would take second place to the SNP, the Conservatives or Labour.The TV debates gave voters a chance to see the party leaders in action. Not all the leaders, however. BBC Scotland and STV limited participation to the five largest parties in the Scottish Parliament, which meant no podium for Mr Salmond or George Galloway, the leader of the All for Unityparty.Mr Galloway tried to whip up interest in a mano a mano with the Alba leader, moderated by Andrew Neil. Viewers might have been interested had David Attenborough not featured extensive scenes of walruses fighting in his last televisual masterpiece.So five went off to debate, with Sarah Smith and Glenn Campbell holding the jaikets for the BBC, and Colin Mackay doing the same for STV. Channel rsquos Krishnan Guru-Murthy came all the way from London town to show us he was as familiar with Scottish politics as Donald Trump was with third-wave feminism.The televised debates were missing a live audience in the studio, and turned out to be horribly dull in consequence. Scottish Greens co-leaders Patrick Harvie and Lorna Slater ided the debate work between them, though Steve Arnott-dress-a-like Harvie hogged more of the limelight.Anas Sarwar adopted a ldquoWhy canrsquot we be friends approach to the debates, albeit the offer clearly did not extend to the Conservatives, who were the focus of everyonersquos attacks. Douglas Ross seemed spectacularly cross in most of the encounters, while Ms Sturgeon tried hard not to look humongously smug or bored.Election day arrived, and with it the chance to exercise that age-old right to take a photie of the dug at a polling place and post it on Twitter.The one million Scots who had registered to vote by post had already done their bit, quietly and without fuss, in keeping with the mood.

People would soon get used to them rather than view them as something to be avoided, just as they are becoming used to the names of \"newer\" generations of Scots originally from dferent cultures.The good work done to give Gaelic names on street signs, town signs and public vehicles are not, as some people would have it, confusing, but of real interest to all Scots as well as our tourists. The everyday usage of peoples Gaelic names would add to this. Likewise, many Scottish dialects are also threatened through \"homogenising\" our language. As a consequence, we lose so many words that provided colour and local identity. Some local authority schools may be more accepting of language ersity, but private schools perhaps not.Those who do not take an interest in Scotlands cultural history and the preservation of it, should broaden their minds and start to have a bit more respect for the positive role that the languages and dialects have, rather than head towards a \"monoculture\".Andrew Turnbull, Perth.TIME TO LISTEN TO RURAL SCOTSWHILST your Letters Pages are full of concerns from those living in the Central Belt, why is it that the vast array of wind turbines and HV pylons that desecrate rural Scotland receive no attention  The First Minister may well criticise Boris Johnson, but at least Westminster has extended democratic rights over wind farm applications to rural England. Why then do Central Belt politicians refuse to grant the same rights to those in rural Scotland A good move by Holyrood in listening to rural Scots would be a decision to run the HV cables in the GlenKens of Galloway underground, closely followed by a decision to set up two National Parks in southern Scotland to balance those north of the M.Ian Moir, Castle Douglas.GREEN CLAIMS DONT STAND UPGREEN electricity should be electricity that is generated  per cent from renewable sources, not fossil fuels. Several major companies claim to supply \" per cent green electricity\". This is impossible since fossil fuels generate a large percentage of the electricity sent to the grid.A report by consultancy firm Baringa in partnership with ScottishPower and Good Energy shows that as little as three per cent of the power supplied by green providers is \"genuinely green\" they have asked the Advertising Standards Authority to investigate. Could the claim of \" per cent green electricity\" be termed \"greenwashing\" which is similar to \"whitewashing\", but used exclusively by the green brigade Clark Cross, Linlithgow.* JOHN Flemingclaims that I am unaware that wind power can be used to electrolyse hydrogen. He is obviously unaware of the sheer cost and unviability of this idea in the context of trying to power a huge industrial economy like the UK.Other people in his shoes claim that batteries are the answer.

Add into the mix the two most prominent politicians in recent Scottish political history fighting like ferrets in a sack where one faced criminal charges and the other, the current First Minister, found by a parliamentary committee of having misled parliament.Therefore and unsurprisingly perhaps, the SNP put independence front and centre of its campaign rather than its failed domestic policies which simply do not stand up to the slightest level of scrutiny. Further, the eternal promise of independence and the land of milk and honey galvanised SNP support and made it a one-issue election.It has become clear that the supposed unionist parties, Conservative, Labour and the LibDems, were taken in hook, line and sinker by the SNP tactics and got continually dragged into the constitutional question rather than providing any focus on the SNP domestic record and the solutions that an alternative government might provide. Nicola Sturgeon must have a huge smile on her face at the lack of any real and meaningful interrogation of her record.Therefore the oppositionrsquos other opportunity to rein back the SNP was to adopt some sort of agreement around tactical voting, but even with that opportunity, personal party politics triumphed and yet again they looked inwards rather than working together for the benefit of the Scottish people.There was a little evidence of tactical voting where the Dumbarton constituency was held by Jackie Baillie for Labour benefitting from Tory votes and Galloway and West Dumfries was held by Finlay Carson benefitting from Labour votes. However the real question and indeed the failure of the three unionist parties is why they did not do more to blunt the SNP  It is worth looking at just a small number of constituency results to evidence this point.In Ayr, the sitting Tory MSP John Scott lost to the SNP by  votes. Labour and the LibDems could not even finish second here but polled , votes. Angus Robertson won Edinburgh Central by , votes. Labour and the LibDems polled , votes with no chance of winning.

East Lothian went to the SNP by , votes with the Tories and Lib Dems polling , votes. Aberdeen South goes to the SNP by , votes with Labour and the Lib Dems polling , votes with no chance of winning.Douglas Ross, Anas Sarwar and Willie Rennie have simply and contemptibly denied the supporters of the Union any chance to hold the SNPrsquos feet to the fire in sorting out the domestic issues, of which there are many, facing the Scottish people. They should be ashamed of themselves for their feeble and inept campaigns and their defence of the Union.Richard Allison, Edinburgh.JUST WHO WAS TELLING THE TRUTH SINCE the turn of the year I have received six election statements from the Conservative Party, all of them assuring me that the only way to stop indyref was to vote Conservative. These were all in the name of Douglas Ross and, sometimes Ruth Davidson. At the same time I occasionally heard the UK leader of that party assuring me that, under no circumstances, would he agree to a second referendum.I could not decideMr Ross and Ms Davidson did not believe that their leader was telling the truth orthey were just wilfully misinforming the electorate. I concluded that I could not entrust them with my vote.Ken MacVicar, Lesmahagow.I CAN FORGIVE THE SNP NOTHINGIRONIC, is it not, that the SNP has a landslide victory when it cannot stop landslides on to the A  I find the post-election triumphalist display by the SNP, of an increasingly-defeatist attitude to the duty of maintaining our Treaty of Union, is demoralising on many levels.The unceasing lack of thankfulness to the UK Government for organising both Covid vaccine sourcing and the emergency job-saving furlough scheme are just two instances of what I see as the insipid nature of the SNP belligerence and misappropriation of praiseworthy responsibility.As a unionist I can forgive the SNP nothing, for I have now witnessed everything from its fiscal incompetence to an education policy which Victorians would endorse. Those who would shatter the UK seem to forgive it everything, for I believe they have selective blindness like a fawning lover.I consider that the SNP has promoted stress, anxiety and ill health among those of us who again fear we may loose our citizenship of the UK with its embracing family of nations.The possible loss of Scotlandrsquos security which is implicitly underwritten and assured by the Act of Union has only one international trade effect ndash it puts investors off.

The cracks in Labourrsquos foundations were there even at its electoral high-water mark in . Soon after Tony Blairrsquos landslide that year, there was a by-election in Paisley South and three of us from Stirling Labour went through to help Douglas Alexanderrsquos campaign.We teamed up with a minibus-full of students from St Andrews University to canvas Foxbar. From a distance, the housing reminded me of the area where I grew up, Mastrick in Aberdeen, but close up it was clear that it had been allowed to deteriorate very badly some of the students were visibly shocked to see such conditions in the UK. There were no Labour posters in windows in Foxbar, but there were for the SNP.Over the next decade, I campaigned for Labour in some of its other strongholds. I was struck by the number of housing estates, managed by Labour councils for decades, that were run-down and depressed. I hoped that Labour governments at Westminster and Holyrood would launch a housing programme to provide decent, warm homes for families and to create jobs but Labour was more interested in playing Cool Britannia and building white elephant aircraft carriers.Sir Keir Starmer, a London lawyer and knight of the realm, talks about Labour being the party of ldquoworking people, which doesnrsquot wash any more. ldquoWorking people, or the working class, is no longer one relatively homogenous group. There arenrsquot great hordes of men rushing out of shipyard, mine or factory gates at the end of their sht, and few private sector workplaces remain unionised.Labourrsquos dficulties are largely self-inflicted. After decades of dominance in its strongholds, Labour assumed that people would continue voting for them even when it demonstrated that, in power, it really didnrsquot care about their priorities. Eventually people tired of being ignored, their welfare overlooked, and decided that they might as well take their vote where.New Labour was a fantastic concept: with a solid working-class core, all it needed was support from a relatively small number of centrist and middle-class voters to win a landslide. But in moving to the centre it lost its core voters, who expected rather more than crumbs from the table, drted away and arenrsquot inclined to .

You donrsquot want VAR do you It was a mature response to a bitter disappointment ndash the striker and his Fir Park team mates had fought back from being - down to level and taken the last eight match to extra-time and then spot kicks - and a definite injustice.The former Airdrie, Celtic and Hearts forwardrsquos viewpoint is shared by many players, coaches, officials and fans in this country. Those who have witnessed how VAR has adversely impacted on the game in England are vehemently opposed to its introduction here.Atmospheres have, pre-coronavirus when grounds were full at least, often been killed by the innovation. There have been interminable delays as officials have deliberated over rulings. The excitement has been sucked out of many matches as dramatic goals have been chalked off minutes later. There has been controversy and confusion over the consistency of the decisions.There was another almighty stooshie surrounding the technology at the weekend when Manchester City played Cha in a Premier League match at the Etihad Stadium on Saturday evening.City winger Raheem Sterling was adamant he was fouled in the Cha area by centre half Kurt Zouma with three minutes of regulation time remaining. Television replays clearly showed contact had been made three times. But referee Anthony Taylor took no action after consulting with his colleagues.ldquoI couldnt get a shot off because hes put his knee on the back of my hamstring,\" Sterling told Sky Sports later. \"I dont know how its not a penalty, I dont know how its not been reviewed properly. The ref said it had been reviewed. I thought the VAR was here to help.Marcus Alonso netted in added on time to give the visitors a - triumph that increased their chances of finishing in the top four as their hostsrsquo title celebrations were delayed.Yet, Sterling was only on the park in the first place because VAR had ruled that his foul on Timo Werner wasnrsquot worthy of a red card. His studs had been up and he didnrsquot look completely in control. He was fortunate. It is an almighty mess and no mistake.But the Scottish Cup semi-finals between Hibs and Dundee United on Saturday and St Mirren and St Johnstone yesterday would have both benefitted greatly from the use of VAR.Jack Rossrsquos men were worthy winners at the end of their encounter with Micky Mellonrsquos charges. But for the second round in a row they scored an offside goal which should have been disallowed.Christian Doidge was a yard beyond the last United defender when Martin Boyle played him through. A quick review of the incident would quickly have shown that beyond any doubt and match official Bobby Madden could have chalked the strike off immediately.Then in the second semi-final of the weekend yesterday Willie Collum ignored a blatant foul by St Johnstone defender Jamie McCart on St Mirren forward Kristian Dennis in the first-half and a potential hand ball immediately afterwards. Jim Goodwinrsquos men ended up losing -.It is to be hoped there are no similar incidents in the final on Saturday week. They will mar what has been an excellent competition.UEFA use VAR in the latter rounds of both the Champions League and the Europa League. But it is only deployed in four obvious match-changing situations when there is evidence of a clear and obvious mistake - goals, incidents in the penalty area, red cards and mistaken identity.It is a less pedantic system which causes far less angst among protagonists and onlookers. Scottish clubs have certainly had few complaints in the past when it has been called upon in Europe.Copenhagen were awarded a spot kick after Ryan Christie of Celtic handled at a corner last season and Rangers centre half George Edmundson also gted Bayer Leverkusen a penalty. There were no arguments on either occasion.VAR can, when used sensibly, aid match officials, improve the quality of decision making and even enhance a game as a spectacle. It is needed in the modern game, when every flashpoint and flare-up is filmed from numerous dferent angles and pored over endlessly by online agitators, despite what its detractors claim.The Video Assistant Referee is far from perfect. But it is a work in progress and should not be dismissed while it is being perfected. The International Football Association Board have asked officials not to be ldquotoo forensic after listening to complaints from across the globe in the past few seasons. Hopefully their advice will be heeded.Many feel that bringing VAR into Scottish football would be a waste of money which could be better spent where, not least at grassroots level. The game here is hardly awash with cash. But it will, at some stage in the not-too-distant future, get the go-ahead. Used correctly, it can benefit referees, improve games and protect the overall integrity of the sport."},{"url":null,"title":"mark-smith-nicola-sturgeon-won-now-need-changes","story":"You got that  Itrsquos about the people. Of Scotland. The people of Scotland.But who are the people of Scotland and what did they say exactly  In her speech, Ms Sturgeon said the SNPrsquos re-election for a fourth term was extraordinary and she was right. All the precedents tell us that, after  years or so, people get fed up with the party in power and give the other guys a try, and yet the SNP, after  years, and a persistently poor record in office, has attracted nearly half the vote. Itrsquos not supposed to happen this way, and yet it has.However, in acknowledging the SNPrsquos achievement, we should also look a little closer at what the First Minister said in the speech because thatrsquos how we can compare it to what actually happened in the election. The dferences between the two ndash what Ms Sturgeon said, and what happened ndash reveal some of the linguistic techniques the First Minister and the SNP use. But they also reveal what needs to changewersquore ever going to break the current deadlock.First, the ldquopeople of Scotland stuff. Irsquom assuming Ms Sturgeon bases her right to speak for the people on the pro-independence majority at Holyrood. As the First Minister pointed out, the SNP won a record number of the constituency seatsand, even after the adjustment for the list votes, the SNP and the Greens have  of the parliamentrsquos  seats, or % ndash a majority.However, the SNP and the Greens have a majority of the seats based on a minority of the votes. The SNP won .% of the constituency vote and the Greens took .% ndash or % combined. The Tories, the Lib Dems, and Labour, on the other hand, took .%. You might see this as just nit-picking over a clear win for the nationalists ndash and they did clearly win under the current system ndash but the result means two things. First, when Nicola Sturgeon claims to speak for the people of Scotland, shersquos really only speaking for .% of them at most. And second, we need a better system, based on how people actually vote.The need for a better system, I hope, would be obvious to any fair-minded voter. For a start ndash although it ultimately failed ndash at one point Alba looked like it might be able to do a bit of jiggery-pokery with the list vote to articially boost pro-independence representation. But the other lesson of the election is that many pro-UK voters felt they had to vote tactically, and many did so with positive results. Some unionists see that as good news, but unionists shouldnrsquot have to vote tactically to get fair representation. It is another argument for a better, more proportional system, ideally single transferable vote.Similar problems apply to Ms Sturgeonrsquos remarks about another referendum. A referendum, she said, was the will of the people and anyone who tried to stop it would be standing in direct opposition to the people . But the assertion is based on the same logical flaw that .% represents a settled will . You might also assume the .% that voted Tory, Labour or Lib Dem do not want a referendum. In any case, the idea that another vote on independence is the will of the people is a distinctly dodgy claim.Perhaps the change thatrsquos needed here ndash on top of a better system ndash is a referendum that ensures the result does actually reflect a settled will rather than the SNPrsquos version of it. The SNP is demanding a referendum on .% and would claim a victory in the referendum on .%, but both, to some extent, are a distortion of whatrsquos going on. One way to stop it would be to require two-thirds for a referendum win ndash at least, that way it would ensure talk of ldquowill of the people had a better basis in reality.But even thatrsquos not the end of the changes we need because Ms Sturgeon also talked a lot about the Tories . Scotland, she said, was facing many more years of right-wing Tory governments and could choose a more progressive alternative. These are familiar comments and part of an attempt to portray the border with England as an unbridgeable gulf. The Scots, she says, are utterly dferent from the rest of the UK, therefore the SNP, therefore referendum, therefore independence.But the SNPrsquos argument runs into the same old ldquopeople of Scotland problem. Ms Sturgeon speaks about anti-Tory Scotland in the same way she speaks about the will of the people, asScotland were one entity that speaks with one voice. But Scotland is Liberal Caithness where my mother grew up and Tory Aberdeenshire where I grew up and itrsquos old-school Labour Ayrshire where I live now. Yes, the SNP dominates, but perhaps Ms Sturgeonrsquos speech could have acknowledged that Scotland is not one thing and that half of the country didnrsquot vote for her. Such an approach would have shown more subtlety, reality, and ndash dare I say it ndash humility.But what did we get instead  A speech based on a logical flaw and fuelled by anger, arrogance, and, I suspect, a bit of disappointment that she didnrsquot get an outright majority. But then maybe thatrsquos the last thing that needs to change: Nicola Sturgeon herself. The talk before the election was of building momentum and an SNP majority that Boris Johnson couldnrsquot say no to, and the SNP certainly needs such momentum before it can achieve another referendum and win it. A stand-still election like the one wersquove just had will not do.But to achieve such momentum, Nicola Sturgeon will need to convince voters who didnrsquot back her ndash the .% ndash and they are unlikely to be chuffed by talk of the ldquowill of the people. They might be impressed, though, by something more realistic and honest. There is no ldquowill of the people, there is only a people ided, andNicola Sturgeon acknowledged that, and started talking about it, maybe she would have a better chance of changing it.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

In the  and  elections, the Labour Party won the most seats and obtained the most votes, but they did not get an overall majority as a result of the voting system. Indeed, in the history of the Scottish Parliament, Scottish elections have only ed a majority once, when the SNP effectively broke the mould in .Scotland is ided into  constituencies and each constituency elects one MSP. The way that this MSP is elected is the exact same method as elections in Westminster - using First Past The Post .The Additional Member System , based on the German mixed-member proportionalsystem, is used in Scotland and is signicantly more proportional than FPTP. Such an election system is known as a hybrid electoral system. AMS means that the overall number of MSPs elected for each party is roughly proportional to their electoral support.The second vote is used to elect  additional members that will complete the political landscape of Holyrood. Scotland is ided into  parliamentary regions and each region elects  regional MSPs.DHondt method in Scotlandrsquos Additional Member SystemRegions are elected by proportional list via the DrsquoHondt formula.Scotlandrsquos system is designed to limit the winning party using the DHondt method in the additional member system. It is sometimes described as the highest average method. The principle of this idea is that a partys vote total is ided by a certain figure which increases as it wins more seats. Thus, as the party becomes bigger in the parliament, the partys total in succeeding rounds gets smaller, allowing parties with lower initial totals to win seats and effectively make establishing a majority much harder.In Scotland, the list vote is ided into the number of constituency wins in the region +. This means that by winning more constituencies, you need a signicantly larger list vote.In simple terms, the more constituency seats a party wins, the fewer list seats it will win.:Gordon Brown launches pro-Union campaign aimed at middle ScotlandA proportional system The Scottish Parliament typically works in a proportional way using the DrsquoHondt system, with the share of the votes aiming to closely mirror the share of the vote. And it has been relatively successful in doing this once again in .The SNP obtained just under half of the vote, and has just under half of the available seats. The Scottish Conservatives, who campaigned on the List vote, or peach vote mainly, secured .% of the vote and won % of the seats. Labour had a list voteof % of the regional vote - which translated into % of the seats. The Scottish Greens won % of the vote and obtained % of the available seats in the chamber.SNP fall one seat short of an overall majority in Scotlandrsquos parliamentary elections - in a system designed to make majorities all but impossible - but with the Greensrsquo  seats, a clear majority of MSPs are in favour of Scottish independence pic lneEcBdXAThe list vote is arguably a better indicator for proportion of the parliament given the increase in tactical voting at a constituency level, with voters effectively lsquolending their votersquo to the party with the best chance of stopping the SNP.In  the SNP won a majority for the first and only time so far in Scottish Parliament history through losing out on more constituency votes but being propped up by regional votes. The party won  of seats at a constituency level but a high regional vote saw them obtain  list seats.  years on they have upped their constituency wins to  but only picked up  regional seats as a result.Do Westminster Governmentrsquosmajorities General elections are exceptionally likely tomajorities for one party, but once again this is due mainly to the voting system and not due to the percentage of the vote.For example in the  General Election, the Conservatives won a majority and a mandate for Brexit with .% of the vote - however as the system was less proportional they obtained % of the seats in parliament.To further simply, the majority voted against the party which won the election and ended up with the majority in the House of Commons.Does a majority indicate a mandate for independence The constitutional battle raised by the Scottish election is one for the politicians to argue over - however, early indications seem to imply that Westminster will rely on the constituency majority backing the union and the failure to secure a majority to oppose Indyref.Judging the Scotland results by whether @theSNP wins a majorityseems a rather unionist prism. Scotland looks set to have clearly voted for an even more pro-independence parliament than before.In a host of interviews over the weekend, Michael Gove said the failure to secure a majority meant that the UK Government was not considering a second independence referendum. He said ldquoThe majority of people who voted in the constituencies voted for parties that were opposed to a referendum with the SNP obtaining .% and Scottish Greens obtaining .%.\"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Michael Gove: Scottish independence referendum would be a massive distraction\",\"description\": \"Michael Gove: Scottish independence referendum would be a massive distraction\",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer v media RyJPmQ poster.jpg width\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests RyJPmQ.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": Looking at the regional vote share, while the SNPrsquos list vote fell by .% to .%, the Scottish Greens obtained .% and Alba obtained .% given pro-independence parties a .%at the regional list level.Many critics have also pointed out that the Conservatives used the  election as their mandate for Brexit but secured less than half the vote.

I have been encouraged, though, by the new five per cent deposit mortgages the government are backing. I hope that could be really helpful.“Lenders are also starting to offer mortgages at five and a half times buyers’ earnings as opposed to four or four and a half times, so that will also help with how much people can borrow.”He added: “Because of the proximity to the schools and Portree it is not going to appeal to people who are looking to buy a holiday home. They want to be in the middle of nowhere.“I think it is going to appeal to people who are looking to buy it as their main home and want access to the schools and decent internet so they can work.”As an extra incentive the developer plans to connect all the houses via a full fibre GB broadband connection to the nearby BT exchange.“This connection will be provided by us completely free of charge for the first five years,” he added.“This is possible because the capacity we will have for the hotel is well beyond what we will need. This is still subject to BT surveys, though, but it is a realistic aspiration.”The housing scheme, which Mr Garton Jones describes as “an amalgam of Highland and Scandinavian culture” has been designed by Plockton-based architect Olli Blair, who caught the eye of the developer with his work on the Raasay Distillery building.Mr Garton Jones said he hoped to get on site by September October this year.The Bracken Hide Hotel is scheduled to open in April .If anyone is looking for more information on the homes or to register an interest they can contact Mr Garton Jones via charlie@gartonjones"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/WATERNISH-CYCLE-1.jpg","title":"waternish youngsters raise more than 7000 with","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoinePat Matheson from Halistra lost her husband Campbell to the illness, and her family thought it would be a good idea to raise funds for the charity in memory of Campbell and to raise awareness of AMMF.

There was a huge amount of rope and all sorts of litter.“Beyond that there was general litter such as Coke bottles, beer cans, and a few face masks. The only odd thing we found was a massive oxygen tank.”Highlighting the volume of rubbish encountered during the clean, he added: “Nearly everyone who came along was from the community and they had seen this litter building up over the last two years.“The beach clean is an annual event we tend to do in April but we had to cancel last year’s so this year is basically two years’ worth including two winter storms’ worth.”When asked how much of the responsibility for the mess he believed lay with local people, he went on to say: “Some of the litter will certainly be from local industry but so much of it will be dropped from people on the island – whether locally or swept in.“The problem is not just local to here, it’s a UK-wide issue.”Addressing the challenges facing the village more broadly, Mr Watson said: “On Friday one of our contractors pulled up two trailers of fly-tipped metal down the side of one of the bridges away from the beach.“That has been years’ worth of local people dumping bikes, climbing frames and all sorts of bits and pieces. Both the Woodland Trust and the Uig Community Trust were speaking today about how we can make a bigger impact through this event, and how we can cover the whole of the community.“There is real potential for the event to be an Uig clean as a whole and not just a beach clean.“A lot of people were saying that it was the first event that they had been to in well over a year, while some of the older people hadn’t seen anyone for months.“It was a real feel-good event from that side of things.“There was a mixture of working-age parents through to retired folks.“It was great to see the kids there and have a chat with their parents.

Personally I would think social housing should be a priority.”While Helen Grianan said: “Will these houses be £, or under  If not, they are not affordable housing for locals or key workers.”Calum J Morrison from North Uist was in favour of the scheme saying: “Sounds like a good type of thing in my opinion, the dude seems to know what he’s doing, good luck to him I say!”Annie B Campbell, meanwhile, highlighted broader issues with housing on the island, stating: “Key workers, like some NHS and teachers, are being outbid for most of the houses that come on the market in Skye.“They are not ‘officially’ homeless so do not have enough points to qualy for council housing.“Some are forced to skip between illegal short term lets. This is not simply a locals versus incomers issue.“Key workers coming to fill essential jobs on the island and local families need somewhere to live. There is a very real housing crisis.”Mr Garton Jones said the price of the houses could not be confirmed until planning permission was obtained.However, in the last few days, he took to social media to try to address worries that people on the island will be priced-out of buying the properties.“There has been a lot of focus on the larger family house we are hoping to build but  of the  houses we are building are smaller, three bedroom, houses,” he commented.Kevin McMahon simply asked: “Will there be a first refusal for locals and the children of local families ”In response, Mr Garton Jones said: “I am happy to confirm that the properties will not be sold via the Scottish ‘sealed bids offers over’ system but will be sold at a fixed price on a first-come, first-served basis.“Obviously until we have planning, we cannot sell the houses, but we have opened up a ‘waiting list’., which is the only place the houses have so far been mentioned or advertised – have emailed me to express their interest in the houses.“Many of them do, indeed, appear to be locals, although we will not be checking birth certicates as part of the sales process.”He added: “There are  houses in total, soyou would like your name added to the list, please email me via charlie@gartonjonesChisolm talked about his own chances of finding a home, questioned the effectiveness of the Highland Council in its current form, and underlined the importance of investing in smaller communities on the island.“I am living with my parents, and with my work I am fortunate to still live on Skye,” he said.“Saying that, I haven’t taken any steps to purchase a home as the prices do not justy the property, or are just too expensive.“I know people who have taken steps to purchase but were outbid either at the start or last minute.”Chisolm has worked for CalMac since  and says he has thought about moving to the Western Isles due to his poor prospects of finding a home on Skye.He said: “I have strong family connections to Lewis and Harris, and I might have the possibility of moving across as house prices haven’t been affected as much as on Skye in terms of second homes and holiday homes. However, it is now on the rise as on other neighbouring islands.”Chisolm believes a revamp of the local authority is needed to force meaningful change.“Skye is facing issues linked to the lack of investment and communications. That makes me question why are we governed by people in Inverness and not the people of Skye and the surrounding islands.“I look at the Western Isles, and I’m seeing housing developments across the islands in dferent areas with the goal of helping local people stay where they are from, sustaining school numbers — including Gaelic communities — and helping small areas grow.“That should be critical here and not just developing in Portree. Roads, housing, harbour investments are just a few aspects that link together and time is critical.”He added: “It’s very important for young people and young families to stay on the island with the support of affordable housing, whether that’s purchasing or renting.”Chisolm said he had been encouraged by responses to Iomairt an Eilein’s call to action.“Political responses ahead of the election have been very welcoming and we are grateful for the support,” he added. reported on plans to build a new -home private scheme on the outskirts of Portree.Commenting on the merits of the proposal, Chisolm said: “I welcome the new development in Portree, I’m sure many young people and families from Skye will benefit from thesethey are available at an affordable price.“That being said, I do question why we’re only developing in Portree. I can name many schools in surrounding communities that would benefit from even a half of a development like this.”Painting a stark picture of the dficulties facing townships such as Staffin, he said: “Smaller communities are missing out and our school numbers and Gaelic communities are suffering. This should be a wake-up call to our government and ‘our’ council that more housing investments in rural areas will have more of an impact and better outcomes.“We all have a right to articulate our viewpoints and opinions. Not everyone will agree but that’s what makes a community – having dferent voices for the benefit of our island.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3787297.jpg--.jpg?1620288585000\n","title":"seth raises 1340 for great cause","story":"A Ballymena teenager has raised more than pound for Macmillan Cancer Support after completing a half marathon at the weekend.

Ralph HewittTwitterEmailMay   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailTV personality and priest Richard Coles has apologised to Irish fans on Twitter for using ‘Eire’ instead of Ireland.Church of England parish priest Reverend Coles was responding to a Tweet from RTE FM’s Dave Fanning, who was promoting his appearance on his radio show to talk about his new book on Sunday, when he said: “People of Eire I am among you.”The former member of s band the Communards came in for criticism and asked his , followers: “Oops!

Yep it’s murky. I wouldn#t lose much sleep over it though.”Stephen Blott stated: “Eire was used by a certain class in England who refused to acknowledge Irish independence, and hence can now leave a bad taste when used in English.”Joe Harbinson believed using Eire was seen as a “political statement”.“The Irish constitution states that country’s name in English is Ireland but there’s an impression that the British don’t want to use that because it doesn#t dferentiate between ‘their bit’ Northern Ireland and the Republic,” he replied.Ending the debate, Reverend Coles, who regularly appears on QI and Have I Got News For You , tweeted: “For ‘Eire’ please substitute Ireland .”For âEireâ please substitute Ireland .— Richard ColesMay , Belfast Most ReadUVF tip-offs lead PSNI to ponds close to where Lisa Dorrian disappearedGlenmore Manor: Luxury Lurgan family home on sale for £kRory McIlroy pays tribute to we Erica and mum Rosie after Wells Fargo Championship win ends  month title droughtTUV face online backlash after UUP gay pride tweetAdrian Dunbar and top Orangeman Mervyn Gibson split over Ireland in Top VideosPlayVideo: Lewd footage filmed outside a Comber barPlayVideo: X-rated footage of woman stripping outside a Comber bar branded #disgusting#PlayVideo: Burning car left on Northern Ireland railway trackLatest Northern IrelandBBC NI closes three Radio Ulster programme Twitter accountsPoots vows to end party culture of policy-making ‘on the hoof’UUP: Aiken resignation in stark contrast to DUP ‘nastiness’ Beattie to take soundings over UUP leadershipBelfast art fair to feature largest collection of sculptures on islandLatestJohn McGinn left frustrated as Aston Villa let things slip against Man UnitedLandlords lose legal battle against New Look restructuring dealChris Kamara urges people not to suffer in silence with their mental healthOfficer who complained over changed statement ‘told nothing sinister happening’Ole Gunnar Solskjaer says Man Utd schedule makes it impossible to go ‘full out’,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

In both quarters, and reflecting typical patterns, % of those were filed by wives.The NI High Court bulletin also shows that in the second half of , there were , petitions filed, up % from , in the same quarter of .But in the year overall, the number of petitions filed was down % from , to ,.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseDivorcees by council area:  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueDivorcees by council area: Unreasonable behaviour is the third most common ground for orce in Northern Ireland and encompasses problems such as violence, excessive drinking or drug use, emotional abuse, aggression and inappropriate relationships short of adultery.Lenore Rice cautioned that it was “too soon” to conclude that the rise in petitions was due to the problems faced by couples in lockdown.But she said the practice was receiving more enquiries about break-ups, adding: “Our instructions level is the highest it has been in a long, long time.“We’re getting lots of online and telephone queries. In terms of cases that we’ve opened, it has signicantly increased.“When we look at new files opened, we are seeing quite a few same sex couples and civil partnerships separating.“Predominantly, women are making the initial queries. They want to seek advice, to prepare, they like to get their house in order before they act, which is a very sensible approach.”Ms Rice said lockdowns had put pressure on relationships.She added: “I think before the pandemic, people were not used to spending quite so much time together. The stay at home policy meant people worked at home together, lounged around the house together, then ventured out once a day to exercise with that same person.“While some people appreciated that aspect, it could prove mentally and physically suffocating for others, especiallythere’s any relationship problems. There’s nowhere to run to, nowhere to hide.“Before the pandemic, for example,you had an argument in the morning, you’d usually go to work, get distracted, maybe get a bit of perspective and cool off a bit. By the time you arrive home, it might be easier for you both to calmly resolve the issue and ‘hug and make up’.“However,you’re in the same place together and you don’t even have time or space to think and process your thoughts, you feel restricted and maybe even powerless. It becomes a pressure-cooker environment.“Then when you add to this existing tension, maybe the stresses of home-schooling, maybe restlessness and boredom, with no social outlets, that person or couple don’t really have any space or time to handle the issue.“You could go upstairs to the bedroom to ring your mum and give off about your other half, but it may not do much to change it.”Violence ensued in the worst cases, leading to applications to the court for an order to keep the spouse away from the home, known as a non-molestation order.“People are maybe drinking more. Domestic violence is a big issue.“We’ve had a lot more non-molestation orders and quite a few injunctions brought by men we’ve had to apply for.“Again, there is a lot more stress because of the stay at home policy. Where do you go, where’s open, where can you run to  For example, a mum and her children trying to secure shelter couldn’t even go to her parents or siblings,they were shielding at this time.”She said clients who were facing marital problems and violence in the home came from all walks of le. “It doesn’t matter how much wealth you have, or your family circumstances. If a person’s violent, it affects all aspects of your le.“You can secure a non-molestation order for mental, emotional and physical ill behaviour, and crucially, this extends to the children. It could extend to an occupation order for one of the parties and can extend to exclusion zones.“That alone has been really challenging, in terms of where does the other person go  The first priority will always be the welfare of the children and we always implore that is where the parties focus on first.“Previous to the pandemic, people would go to shelters, Women’s Aid, secure housing, perhaps getting an application to protect the inidual.“Normally the other party who is leaving the house might stay with relatives, but this wasn’t always possible during lockdown as older relatives were shielding. That was the big challenge.”During lockdown, children of orced or separated parents were allowed to visit the non-residential parent.But that sometimes threw up problems. “We had a couple of cases where the we might have health concerns and in lockdown, and was taking shielding very seriously.“Then you might have had a husband posting pictures on Facebook of having lots of family in the house, leaving the mum feeling very exposed. Trust breaks down and that’s when the problems start to happen.“If the relationship has deteriorated to a stage where it’s gone, then it’s gone, and unfortunately in this environment, one party might just take any given opportunity to try and annoy or harm the other. Lockdown facilitated a toxic opportunity for some parents to harass the other.“Realistically, a parent might have to restrain contact with another, which is not ideal for the children,they are trying to stay home with a very serious underlying health concern and the other parent completely undermines their situation.”But she said there could often be space for people to calm down and take the most reasonable approach. “They may even agree to wait until the two years separation is up with consent, and make a pact to stop vocally criticising one another.“They may even come to the conclusion that a contested orce can cost lots of money. They might question the orce in terms of, ‘We should consider our children first, then organise our finances in the short term, because after all, who’s going to pay these bills, maintenance costs, etc ’“Out of all the contacts we would have had over the last  months, that’s generally the approach. Even with people who have come thundering through the door demanding ‘I want a orce!’, once you sit them down and provide them with all their options, they do have a natural tendency to try to exit this chapter as cost-effectively as they can. We advise them on all the steps and issues and they take it from there.”The number of petitions filed on the ground of adultery was slightly lower in the first quarter of , down from nine to six.Wives filed eight petitions for adultery in early , with just one husband going down the same route.One year on, six wives filed on the same ground, and no husbands.Ms Rice said the lack of opportunities for adultery in lockdown could have an impact on petitions made on that basis. She added: “Unreasonable behaviour extends to a much wider area, such as inappropriate relationships online, or it can be tantamount to gambling, drinking, drugs, financial abuse.“Going back to my previous point about restrictions, because people were effectively house-bound, there was an increase in domestic violence and online relationships.”Divorce was a process where trust had to be built between client and lawyer, she said. “You have to think that you are helping someone, caring for them. It’s a journey and it’s about building your relationship with the client.“You have to carefully build trust, helping them focus on the remedies that are right for them and not just take it straight to court. We offer mediation and suggest mediation at first. We’ll try a collaborative approach, I’m a collaborative-trained lawyer.“We’ll try every possible avenue we can first, rather than going into this adversarial and frightening forum of court. With lockdown we were not physically going into court, which for some people, proved an anti-climax.”She said she was not convinced that the petition figures were already reflecting the increased activity in firms.

Not with me, I think you#re a d**k. But do talk about it.”Referencing a recent Stormont vote on gay conversion therapy, he added: “Thanks toyour [sic] not even at risk of being cured!”The TUV Fermanagh account has since been deleted, and the party has yet to respond to a request for a comment.Several other UUP members quickly took to Twitter to say they were more than happy to have attended the event.Doug Beattie, seen by many as the likely new party leader, said: “What a great bunch of people, a lovely day and wonderful picture. We are a union of people.”UUP councillor Michael Palmer, who has previously spoken publicly about being gay, commented: “I and many others joined the UUP for its inclusion of LGBT people. So many unionists wonder why pro-union voters aren#t voting for unionist parties and then make tweets like this. LGBT people will be crucial to maintaining the union. That needs to be remembered.”Read MoreUUP bid to ban conversion therapy in Northern Ireland passes Assembly vote Last month, MLAs passed a motion proposed by the UUP calling for a ban on gay conversion therapy “in all its forms”.The main UUP motion was not supported at the time by the DUP or TUV.TUV leader Jim Allister had said he had no problem condemning gruesome practices historically associated with conversion therapies but said he objected to any attempts to “criminalise preaching in accordance with the sexual ethics that are set forth in holy scripture.Belfast Most ReadUVF tip-offs lead PSNI to ponds close to where Lisa Dorrian disappearedGlenmore Manor: Luxury Lurgan family home on sale for £kTUV face online backlash after UUP gay pride tweetRory McIlroy pays tribute to we Erica and mum Rosie after Wells Fargo Championship win ends  month title droughtAdrian Dunbar and top Orangeman Mervyn Gibson split over Ireland in Top VideosPlayVideo: Lewd footage filmed outside a Comber barPlayVideo: X-rated footage of woman stripping outside a Comber bar branded #disgusting#PlayVideo: Burning car left on Northern Ireland railway trackLatest Northern IrelandBBC NI closes three Radio Ulster programme Twitter accountsPoots vows to end party culture of policy-making ‘on the hoof’UUP: Aiken resignation in stark contrast to DUP ‘nastiness’ Beattie to take soundings over UUP leadershipBelfast art fair to feature largest collection of sculptures on islandLatestUK ‘in very good position’ against coronavirus iants – expertA look at the previous Champions League finals to be played in EnglandCovid vaccine maker BioNTech reports £m profit in first quarterNo evidence that Pfizer vaccine needs updating for iants, says BioNTechJohn McGinn left frustrated as Aston Villa let things slip against Man United,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Photo credit should read: Liam McBurney PA WireGareth CrossTwitterEmailMay   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailSteve Aiken#s resignation as UUP leader was his own decision and the party did not move against him, they have insisted.Mr Aiken said he came to the decision after consulting with party colleagues and decided he was no longer the best man for the job.However, the former Royal Navy Submarine Commander has confirmed his decision to remain in politics and continue as an MLA.He appeared at a press conference at Stormont on Monday morning to discuss his decision to resign over the weekend.Also present was UUP Chairman Danny Kennedy and potential leadership candidates MLAs Doug Beattie and Robbie Butler.Both men refused to be drawn onthey were standing for the position, saying they were present only to show solidary with Mr Aiken.Former MLA Mr Kennedy said Mr Aiken#s decision to resign stood in stark contrast of the removal of Arlene Foster as DUP leader.Steve does not stand alone today, he stands with me representing the entire party and with colleagues of the Assembly party, he said.Mr Kennedy praised the leadership he has given and the way he has conducted himself.It#s not for us, the nastiness and the unpleasantness of leadership change carried out in dark corners like the DUP removing Arlene Foster, who frankly deserved better, he said.Nor indeed would we replicate what Sinn Fein did in their purge in Foyle.Mr Aiken said he reached his dficult decision to resign because more than ever unionism and those in Northern Ireland need a clear political voice.Looking ahead I believe there is a place for a strong, progressive, inclusive unionist party, one can that deliver hope over fear and good government rather than endless posturing and bickering, the South Antrim MLA said.Mr Aiken said the UUP always put country over party and pointed to their decision to take the post of Health Minister in the Executive, despite the challenges it posed.He said he was extremely proud of the work of his predecessor Robin Swann during the coronavirus pandemic.I am however, self aware enough to admit, that despite our strengths, our party is not breaking through, Mr Aiken told the assembled press.I am also very aware of my own failings and despite successes over the past  months I realise that a change in leadership is needed.The UUP is a team in which all parts need to work effectively. Quite frankly it hasn#t been working as well as it should be, that is down to me. Rather than being seen to be part of the problem, I want to be part of the solution.Having ben in many command positions before I know and recognise the critical point when a change is needed. For the greater good and for a reinvigoration of the fight.Mr Aiken said resigning was bittersweet, but that a new leader was needed to get unionism ready.Pointing to the Scottish Parliament elections, which resulted in an overwhelming endorsement of the pro-independence SNP, he said we do have a real challenge ahead of us, but we#re ready for it.Referring to the DUP and his own party Mr Aiken said it was time for unionism to get it#s act together.Mr Butler said Mr Aiken would remain an important part of the party.On behalf of the Assembly group I wanted to pay tribute to his leadership and say that we look forward, not only to working with him, but to sitting beside him in the chamber, the Lagan Valley MLA said.Mr Beattie, widely tipped to be the next leader, said he was proud to call his fellow military veteran a friend.I#m standing here to support my party leader, my colleague and my friend Steve Aiken. It was dficult for him going through this process and he#s shown incredible moral courage to stand here today, the Upper Bann MLA said.I will think about whether or not it would be right for me to stand, I will take soundingsthe party want me to be leader andthey want to be led by me and then I will make a decision. I will try and do that as soon as I possibly can.Mr Kennedy said party officers had taken steps ahead of a leadership election and a special meeting of the party executive would take place on Tuesday night, followed by further announcements.Belfast Most ReadUVF tip-offs lead PSNI to ponds close to where Lisa Dorrian disappearedGlenmore Manor: Luxury Lurgan family home on sale for £kAdrian Dunbar and top Orangeman Mervyn Gibson split over Ireland in TUV face online backlash after UUP gay pride tweetRory McIlroy pays tribute to we Erica and mum Rosie after Wells Fargo Championship win ends  month title droughtTop VideosPlayVideo: Lewd footage filmed outside a Comber barPlayVideo: X-rated footage of woman stripping outside a Comber bar branded #disgusting#PlayVideo: Burning car left on Northern Ireland railway trackLatest PoliticsWhat Donaldson could hear in proposed listening tourhe becomes DUP leaderAllison MorrisOpinionUnionism must look to the future when electing new leadersViewpointOpinionUUP needs to offer a real alternativeUUP’s Beattie and Butler in frame to lead partyFth of all EU border checks happening in Northern IrelandLatestMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Confirmed Covid cases in your area and seven day rolling averageIreland and Leinster prop Tadhg Furlong signs IRFU contract extensionLockdown in the UK: What are the latest changes in the four nations Michael Gove refuses to rule out legal challenge from UK to IndyrefAnti-racism activist faces Paris court over statue attack,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The guidelines, spread over two documents, offer bespoke advice depending on the category of care setting involved. “I fully recognise the importance of visiting for those who are receiving care. I hope this guidance will be widely welcomed, said Mr Swann. “It is also important to remember that the threat from COVID- remains very real. Everyone has a vital role to play when it comes to safe visiting. That includes social distancing, hand hygiene and not visitingyou are feeling unwell yourself.      Visiting was only ever restricted because it was absolutely necessary to do so to protect patients and residents from the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV- virus and subsequent development of COVID- infection. Given the progress that has been made against the virus, the time is now right to take steps to carefully re-introduce visiting. I welcome the work completed to draw up these updated guidance documents and hope that by implementing them we will take another step along the road to recovery.”   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Shiels delivered the League Cup, their last piece of silverware. His son Dean was again part of the success in a - victory over Cobh Ramblers at the Brandywell. It wasnt enough to save his job. His tenure as manager coincided with the death of Derry skipper and club legend Ryan McBride, something that affected him badly. Kenny read out an emotional poem, In Your Absence, at Ryans funeral, which was greeted with a rapturous applause. “We lost eight players in the August of the third year,” Kenny states. “They wanted away some of them. I made a couple of bad signings, which you do.” Part of him wanted to stay, but he sensed an element of the dressing room wasnt in his corner. “I felt it,” he admits. “Ive always prided myself in having a good dynamic in the dressing room. In the professional game, you have a term where you are doing well and a term when it is not so good.” The mutual decision saw them part ways. He knows that bad times are inevitable. It could happen in his current role. “It happens to everybody,” Kenny admits. *** Carrick Rangers win over Glentoran was a seismic result in its own right, but one thing pleased Kenny Shiels more, watching his side pass them off the pitch. “I had a style of play and I still have it,” Kenny now states. “We got on the ball and we play, with our passing style and patterns.” He enjoys the tactical side of the game, but taking charge of Northern Ireland women was a dferent preposition. Transforming them into the first side to qualy for the European Championships is top of the tree in a footballing career that is glittered with success. “If you dig deep into it,” Kenny explains. “These girls hadnt won a match in almost four years, prior to us coming in.” Magherafelts Simone Magilland Rebecca Hollowayare the sole professional players. Sarah McFadden, also from Magherafelt, plays part-time with Durham. The rest are amateur. The fallow spell had corroded any bleak sign of confidence. Standing in Greenmount College, with felt tip pen in hand, their new manager steered his sides mentality in a very definite direction. Two words were etched onto the flip-chart...trust and integrity. His two cornerstones. “You cant have one without the other and I told them they were the focal points in their time with me,” Shiels said. “Thats what we work off, in everything we do. They are related to team spirit and teamwork in any sport.” Even now, sitting on his sofa, reciting that first meeting, his eyes are dancing. You can see how he was able to hold a team in the palm of his hand. It wasnt about just trusting each other. The squad needed to believe in the staff, the process of improvement. But, most of all, they had to trust themselves. “You cant get better without trust,” he told them. “The best and most important relationship you can have anywhere in the world, with any person...is the relationship with yourself. “If you dont trust and believe in yourself, and you havent got a strong relationship with yourself, youll never achieve anything in your le.” Shiels had to pick them off the canvas. Unlike a club environment, there is no transfer market. It was a case of building a team from scratch. In the opposite corner, they were pitting themselves against players from Barcelona and Lyon, stars from the top English clubs, Manchester City, Arsenal and Cha. “Wales, who we eliminated over two games, they have a full team, maybe  of them, playing in the Womens Super League,” Shiels adds. Their resolve was tested by two - defeats by former European and World Champions Norway, either side of their two draws with Wales. “My full backs go forward, we play an attacking game,” Shiels points out. “Norway beat us - in Belfast, but in the second half, we had the same or more possession than them and it was a great learning curve.” Northern Ireland finished the group with four wins, twice each against Belarus and the Faroe Islands to book their play-off with Ukraine. Simone Magill and Rachel Furness celebrate Northern Irelands - win over Belarus in the Dinamo National Olympic Stadium, Minsk.As part of the preparations, Shiels accepted an approach to play England in St Georges Park, something seen as a gamble of sorts. After rebuilding the confidence, a hiding, by more than six goals, couldve set them back. Trailing - after facing a stf breeze, Northern Ireland played much better in the second-half but went down - in the end, but Shiels was happy. It was another learning curve. Going into the first leg of the play-off, Shiels had four players out with cruciate ligament injuries, Lauren Wade had an ankle injury and goalscorer Rachel Furness hobbled off minutes with a broken ankle. A Magill goal saw Shiels side come home with a - win from Ukraine before winning - in the second leg, to book their place in the finals. “They have  million of a population and have recently been in the finals,” he said of Ukraines pedigree. Of the  teams in next summers finals, ranked by coefficient, only Scotland from the top  ranked teams have failed to qualy. Northern Ireland are ranked th. “We are in with the big shots now,” Shiels points out. The rankings are based on results, discipline, performances, essentially anything quantiable. “The coefficient we got in the fth year, was twice as much as the other four years combined. That is massive.” He has come a long way from dribbling through the tackles on the tarmac of Beagh Primary School, but Shiels is still leading the way. And hes far from finished.\",\"keywords\":\"free articles,Kenny Shiels,Northern Ireland,Roys Chicks,Maghera,Derry City,Soccer\",\"articleSection\":\"Home\",\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"description\":\"Maghera man Kenny Shiels transformed theNorthern Ireland womens team, without a win for four years, to qualy for next summers European Championships.

Michael McMullan sat down to hear his story...From Kenny Shiels front door, through the hall and kitchen, into the sun-room of his Maghera home sets the scene. A framed Northern Ireland jersey on the wall. Snaps of his son Dean in the colours of Rangers and Hibernian, with three outstretched fingers symbolising his hat-tricks. A glistening picture of Kenny and Dean, grinning from ear to ear, with the Scottish League Cup after Kilmarnocks  success, sticks out from a row of framed mementos. There is no doubt this is a football house. Dean is now the manager of Dungannon Swts. His other son, Jody, manages the local cross community team Upperlands Aces where Kenny is the Chairman. googletag.cmd.push “It is only a title,” he admits. Football is in the blood. “I mark out the pitch, cut the grass...just trying to keep them going.” One of his daughters, Lauren, is married to Coleraine manager Oran Kearney. Armagh City manager Shea Campbell is married to Grace. His we Gwens brothers were footballers. You soon get the picture of the football discussion bouncing around the dinner table. On a Thursday afternoon, on the same day he signed a two-year extension to his contract as Northern Ireland womens manager, Shiels welcome is a warm one. He sips on a cuppa, relaxed, just shooting the breeze. Talking football comes naturally. googletag.cmd.push It was always football, even at the age of two. In hospital for a hernia operation, Kenny cried his eyes out. His mother, Elizabeth, tried to pacy him. But, it wasnt the pain, rather, someone had taken his ball. Once it was ed, the tears stopped. “It must be in my genes somewhere...I was football mad,” Kenny utters. He turned  weeks ago, but the glint remains in his eye. Before Covid- took hold, he was a regular at the nearby leisure centre. The mantra is early to bed, early to rise and practice what you preach. Another passion is music. Tucked in the corner of the kitchen is a record player, with a selection of LPs. Front of the pile is his favourite, John Prine.     “Music is just great,” Kenny offers, painting a picture of the power generated by Labi Sfres Something Inside So Strong. As the Northern Ireland team are about to leave their hotel, the words of the song set the scene. The song changes, depending on the atmosphere. The words and crescendo...they both matter. Shiels gained a degree in psychology along his footballing journey. As he speaks, he picks his words well. An hour in his company gives a taste of how Northern Ireland women, who went four years without a win, will mix with Europes elite next summer. *** Shiels first gig in management came in Beagh Primary School at the age of eight. The nearby, much bigger, Maghera County school came to play a friendly match. “Shiels...pick that team,” bellowed Principal Mr Gillen. “It was a hiding to nothing,” said Shiels of the game, in which he helped himself to five goals in an eight all draw. “There were no tactics,” Kenny laughs. “I got the ball and dribbled. They were trying to kick lumps out of me, but couldnt get near me.” Football was never away from the family home on a chicken farm on the outskirts of Maghera. Kenny was fourth of nine children, which included eight boys. Their father Roy had installed lights in the front yard. Every Saturday night, theyd re-emerge after Match of the Day, singing the tune as they raced outside, playing until after midnight. “My father was a Unionist Councillor...this town was polarised at one time,” Kenny points out. Roy Shiels was able to drink in any of the  pubs in Maghera. One of the few that could. “He got houses for everybody, no matter what creed they were...he was a very popular man.” With a deep interest in football, Roy formed a team comprising Catholics from the upper part of the town and Protestants from the bottom end. “He was bringing communities together to go and compete together in a sporting environment,” Kenny proudly states. “They came together and became friends to this day. Larry Cudden, who played for us, texted me a few minutes ago.” Roy took a cattle trailer, with the whole team in it and sometimes a couple in the boot of the car. It wouldnt conform with todays regulations. Roys Chicks, as they were called, hammered everyone in sight in tournaments across the North. After bagging seven goals in a game, Kenny was accused of being overage. The following year, the Chicks went international, on a five-day trip to France. Seamus Heffron, a French teacher on his year out, helped Roy organise the trip, which was funded by a raffle for a ball signed by the England and Spanish national teams. “Off they went to France, in the late seventies,” said Kenny, now too old to go. “Children got to Portrush for a weekend and that was it.” Kenny was football mad and sneaked away for a fleeting Gaelic football spell with Glen minors in , at the height of the troubles. On the Saturday evening hed leave a kitbag in a lane near his home. The following morning, his mother would have him kitted out in a shirt and tie for Sunday school. “I would change into my ordinary clothes and go on to a game,” he recalls. “Playing Gaelic, when I think back at the height of the troubles, I was mincemeat. It was a brave thing to do.” While his toe to hand wasnt up to scratch as a newcomer to the game, he just dribbled his way through defences. *** An ankle injury at the age of  threatened to end the promising Shiels football career. Medical advice told him to hang up his boots, but he ploughed on. He went on to play for Distillery, Coleraine, Ballymena and Larne in the Irish league. In his third spell with Tobermore United, as player manager, he brought home silverware before a call out of the blue gave him his big break in management. “It was the day of my fathers funeral,” Kenny remembers. “I can still see it. I came home from the funeral, I was hanging up my coat and the phone rang.” Bottom of the table Carrick Rangers were offering him the manager post. The following season, he led them to the County Antrim Shield. After a semi-final win over Glenavon, they defeated then league champions Glentoran in the final. “That was a fantastic giant killing act,” he said of their - replay win. The Glens had taken English professional player Billy Whitehirst for the final, whereas Kenny built a team by dipping into local junior clubs Roe Valley, Dungiven and Magherafelt Sky Blues. Brian Martin scored the first goal, with David Montgomery netting the winner. When Felix Healy resigned as Coleraine manager midway through the   season, a Bannsiders fan like his father, Shiels was headhunted to steer the ship. Coleraine narrowly missed out on a place in the top flight, as the old -team ision split into two leagues for the first time. The following season, with his younger brother Sammy banging in the goals, Kenny got Coleraine promoted and won the inaugural Irish News Cup, a competition for North West Clubs in the Irish League and League of Ireland. After six years with Coleraine, he had a spell with Moyola Park before taking charge of Ballymena United in mid-season. He was unable to save them from the drop to the second tier. After two seasons, which saw them finish as low as fth, Shiels rebuilt the team. His now son in law Shea Campbell was leading the attack when they gained promotion and with ex Nottingham Forest striker Nigel Jemson on board, they finished sixth in the top flight and qualied for Europe via the Intertoto Cup. Following a draw with Danish side Odense, they lost the second leg. After leaving the Showgrounds, Kenny took over at Larne, but at the time, he was appointed as manager of Northern Ireland Us, who he steered to the  European Championships. “That was the only time they qualied for Europe,” said Shiels. “We beat Belgium away and Scotland away to qualy, that was massive.” At the tournament in France, Northern Ireland came up against a Cesc Fagravebregas-led Spain and the hosts that included Karim Benzema. The eight years with the Us helped him secure a job in England, the Head of Youth at Tranmere Rovers, where he stayed for three seasons before taking over as Mixu Paatelainens number two at Kilmarnock. When Paatelainen moved to take charge of Finland, Shiels was promoted to manager. The  season proved to be a fantastic season. He became the first Killie manager to beat Rangers twice in one season. Ally McCoist was looking to equal an -year record by going  away games unbeaten, but Kilmarnock overturned them at Rugby Park. When the sides met in thefixture at a packed Ibrox, Shiels son Dean scored the  minute winner. In the League Cup, Kilmarnock went all the way to their final meeting with Celtic at Hampden Park without conceding a goal. Goalkeeper Cammy Bells inspirational performance kept a clean sheet in the decider. Shiels brought Lee Johnston and Dieter Van Tornhout off the bench, with both combining for the latter to score the winning goal to take the title and cap off a fine season. Kenny and Dean Shiels celebrate Kilmarnocks  Scottish Cup success. The following season, Shiels led Killie to victory over Celtic at Parkhead, but after finishing ninth in the table, triggering a get-out clause, allowed the club to sack him,they ended up in the bottom four. It sparked protests by fans, disappointed with the clubs decision. Shiels had spells at Scottish side Greenock Morton and BEC Tero Sasana in Thailand, before joining Derry City in . In his first two seasons, the Candystripes finished third and fourth, qualying for lucrative spots in Europe, where they beat Dinamo Minsk. “What a result that was,” Kenny said of the win. “It was the first game in their new refurbished stadium and I later took Northern Irelandback there when we played Belarus.” In his third season in charge, Derry City finished third bottom of the table following a poor run of results. Shiels delivered the League Cup, their last piece of silverware. His son Dean was again part of the success in a - victory over Cobh Ramblers at the Brandywell. It wasnt enough to save his job. His tenure as manager coincided with the death of Derry skipper and club legend Ryan McBride, something that affected him badly. Kenny read out an emotional poem, In Your Absence, at Ryans funeral, which was greeted with a rapturous applause. “We lost eight players in the August of the third year,” Kenny states. “They wanted away some of them. I made a couple of bad signings, which you do.” Part of him wanted to stay, but he sensed an element of the dressing room wasnt in his corner. “I felt it,” he admits. “Ive always prided myself in having a good dynamic in the dressing room. In the professional game, you have a term where you are doing well and a term when it is not so good.” The mutual decision saw them part ways. He knows that bad times are inevitable. It could happen in his current role. “It happens to everybody,” Kenny admits. *** Carrick Rangers win over Glentoran was a seismic result in its own right, but one thing pleased Kenny Shiels more, watching his side pass them off the pitch. “I had a style of play and I still have it,” Kenny now states. “We got on the ball and we play, with our passing style and patterns.” He enjoys the tactical side of the game, but taking charge of Northern Ireland women was a dferent preposition. Transforming them into the first side to qualy for the European Championships is top of the tree in a footballing career that is glittered with success. “If you dig deep into it,” Kenny explains. “These girls hadnt won a match in almost four years, prior to us coming in.” Magherafelts Simone Magilland Rebecca Hollowayare the sole professional players. Sarah McFadden, also from Magherafelt, plays part-time with Durham. The rest are amateur. The fallow spell had corroded any bleak sign of confidence. Standing in Greenmount College, with felt tip pen in hand, their new manager steered his sides mentality in a very definite direction. Two words were etched onto the flip-chart...trust and integrity. His two cornerstones. “You cant have one without the other and I told them they were the focal points in their time with me,” Shiels said. “Thats what we work off, in everything we do. They are related to team spirit and teamwork in any sport.” Even now, sitting on his sofa, reciting that first meeting, his eyes are dancing. You can see how he was able to hold a team in the palm of his hand. It wasnt about just trusting each other. The squad needed to believe in the staff, the process of improvement. But, most of all, they had to trust themselves. “You cant get better without trust,” he told them. “The best and most important relationship you can have anywhere in the world, with any person...is the relationship with yourself. “If you dont trust and believe in yourself, and you havent got a strong relationship with yourself, youll never achieve anything in your le.” Shiels had to pick them off the canvas. Unlike a club environment, there is no transfer market. It was a case of building a team from scratch. In the opposite corner, they were pitting themselves against players from Barcelona and Lyon, stars from the top English clubs, Manchester City, Arsenal and Cha. “Wales, who we eliminated over two games, they have a full team, maybe  of them, playing in the Womens Super League,” Shiels adds. Their resolve was tested by two - defeats by former European and World Champions Norway, either side of their two draws with Wales. “My full backs go forward, we play an attacking game,” Shiels points out. “Norway beat us - in Belfast, but in the second half, we had the same or more possession than them and it was a great learning curve.” Northern Ireland finished the group with four wins, twice each against Belarus and the Faroe Islands to book their play-off with Ukraine. Simone Magill and Rachel Furness celebrate Northern Irelands - win over Belarus in the Dinamo National Olympic Stadium, Minsk.  As part of the preparations, Shiels accepted an approach to play England in St Georges Park, something seen as a gamble of sorts. After rebuilding the confidence, a hiding, by more than six goals, couldve set them back. Trailing - after facing a stf breeze, Northern Ireland played much better in the second-half but went down - in the end, but Shiels was happy. It was another learning curve. Going into the first leg of the play-off, Shiels had four players out with cruciate ligament injuries, Lauren Wade had an ankle injury and goalscorer Rachel Furness hobbled off minutes with a broken ankle. A Magill goal saw Shiels side come home with a - win from Ukraine before winning - in the second leg, to book their place in the finals. “They have  million of a population and have recently been in the finals,” he said of Ukraines pedigree. Of the  teams in next summers finals, ranked by coefficient, only Scotland from the top  ranked teams have failed to qualy. Northern Ireland are ranked th. “We are in with the big shots now,” Shiels points out. The rankings are based on results, discipline, performances, essentially anything quantiable. “The coefficient we got in the fth year, was twice as much as the other four years combined. That is massive.” He has come a long way from dribbling through the tackles on the tarmac of Beagh Primary School, but Shiels is still leading the way. And hes far from finished.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In March , Derry City and Strabane District Councils planning committee refusedClanmil Housing Association permission to build a four-storey complex comprised of  apartments at Victoria Road. However, Clanmil appealed the decision and it has now been overturned. Local planning officers had described the location as ‘possibly the most dficult regeneration site’ in the city. However, the officers had recommended that councillors approve the application for the Victoria Road apartments as the application was ‘entirely compliant’. In their report, planning officers stated that they believed it would reinvigorate the riverfront land and put an end to anti-social behaviour at the site. googletag.cmd.push  Among the objections raised by councillors had been that there was no parking provided within the plans for the Victoria Road apartments. At the meeting in March , local councillors said they believed a parking ban ‘discriminated’ against people with disabilities. At last year’s meeting, Hugh Hegarty from the Victoria Park Residents Group said the apartment complex design looked like a ‘horric brutalist East German style eyesore’. Mr Hegarty said pollution and parking problems would be exacerbatedresidents were to park on Spencer Road and Duke Street. A lack of space in the area has already resulted in ‘hazardous parking’ on Victoria Road and he envisaged problems at the site with numerous couriers and taxis arriving. googletag.cmd.push In response, a representative for Clanmil said it is a ‘highly accessible’ location with bus stops and train travel nearby. The housing association claimed that the design respects the history of the site, the city’s shirt factory heritage and complements existing buildings. A report by the Planning Appeals Commission into the matter has now found that the objections were not sustained and overturned the decision to refuse planning permission. The decision to overturn the councils refusal decision has been criticised by local rail campaigners, Into the West. The land at Victoria Road was previously part of the Derry to Strabane railway line which closed in .     Into the West has been campaigning for the line to be reopened and they have described the decision to allow the apartment complex to be built on the site as a disaster. A building there will make it impossible to restore a railway line along that route in future – making it extremely unlikely we will ever see rail from Derry to Strabane or Letterkenny again, said Steve Bradley, chair of Into the West. Without a route to Strabane, there can be no direct rail services form Derry or Donegal to Dublin. And as Derry has a bigger population than every other town on the former Derry-Portadown rail route,our city can no longer be included in that proposed reopening then the viability of restoring rail to places like Omagh, Strabane, Enniskillen, Dungannon and Letterkenny also collapses. In short – building  apartments in that location will destroy any future for rail across the west of Ulster and prevent it being ed to Tyrone, Donegal and Fermanagh.

Dr Glynn said he is hopeful that additional measures will not be required for the county in the coming weeks and he is confident that the situation in Donegal will improve quickly. He was speaking at a press briefing for the media in Donegal on Wednesday following the fallout from comments made by chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan last Friday about the high incidence of Covid- in the county. googletag.cmd.push There has been a backlash in Donegal to the tone of the comments Dr Holohan made when he said there were concerns about things happening in the county that “even the dogs on the street” know shouldn’t be happening. Figures released at the press briefing put the national incidence rate in the county at  cases per , people compared to a national rate of . The highest rates are in the Milford local electoral area at . and the Letterkenny area where the rate is .. The lowest rate in the county is in the Donegal LEA at .. The briefing was told there were  GP referrals for testing in the county on Tuesday, an increase of % on the same day last week. googletag.cmd.push Dr Glynn said the concerns were raised last week so that people can take protective measures and ensure the situation does not get worse. He said there is a bigger number of smaller clusters in Donegal than in other parts of the country. “It was not meant as blame. It certainly was not made as a threat,” he said. “It would be very strange for us to preside over a situation where incidence is very high and increasing in a county and not draw attention to that.” At the briefing, director of public health for the HSE in the north-west, Dr Anthony Breslin, highlighted a number of clusters that have occurred due to events in the county in recent weeks, including awake, a family gathering and an th birthday party.     The events resulted in dozens of cases and infections in workplaces, in families and at a school. One social gathering has been linked to  cases of Covid-, he said. Dr Glynn said that there are concerns about the situation in the county and that some people in Donegal have “pushed the boundaries”. “We are concerned about the current incidence. That is not to say that Donegal has not come a very long way over the past number of months, just as the rest of the country has, and that can only have happened because the majority of people are trying to do the right thing,” he said. “This is not in any way a reflection on the majority but clearly there are a number of incidents where people have pushed the boundaries. “We have seen that in other counties, it is not just in Donegal. But I suppose the dference at the moment versus some other places where we have particularly high incidences, is that there are large clusters driving incidences. “In Donegal, it seems to be a little bit more widespread with a bigger number of smaller clusters which makes it that little bit harder to control. Sowe can continue to emphasise, andwe can get people who have been pushing the boundaries a little bit just to comply that bit more over the coming weeks, we should see incidence drop quickly in Donegal.” He said we can not get away from the fact that the high incidence rates in parts of the county are due to the fact the disease is being transmitted from person to person. “It gets transmitted from person to person when people come into contact with one another and when for whatever reason masks are not worn, distance is not kept, people who are symptomatic don’t self-isolate. “Right now we are seeing a higher incidence in Donegal than we have in other parts of the country and in that regard, it is incumbent on us as doctors to point out our concerns so that people can take proactive actions because there are many people who remain very vulnerable to this disease over the coming weeks,” he said. “All we are asking people in Donegal to do is to protect themselves and their families. We are not proposing any dferent measures for any one part of Donegal as things currently stand, and I would be hopeful and optimistic given the level of engagement over the past number of days that we wont be looking at some sort of additional measures for the county or any part of the county over the coming weeks.” He said the priority for people over the coming weeks is to meet people outside. “As far as is possible at all, do not meet up with friends or extended families or do not have parties inside. Inside gives this virus such an advantage in terms of transmission,” he said. “Last January Donegal had an incidence of , per ,. It is now  per ,.

The owners, the Trufelli family, put the site of the amusement arcade up for sale in October . However, the process has been hampered by the pandemic. In a statement today, the Trufelli family said that as thingsto a more favourable economic environment, it is their intention to re-market the business for sale. “Whilst our hope is that we will be able to sell the business as a going concern, we recognise that it may not be possible to find a suitable purchaser,” the statement said. googletag.cmd.push “As a result, we have appointed Savills and Philip Tweedie  Company to market the site as both a going concern and a development opportunity. “Barry’s continues to remain closed in line with Covid restrictions and will not re-open until the sale process has concluded.” The Barrys site has been placed on the market with a guide price of pound.m. The high-profile seafront site is situated in the heart of the town, between the newly renovated Portrush Train Station and The West Bay Beach. The sale is being handled by joint agents, Savills and Philip Tweedie  Company, on behalf of Barry’s Amusements and is being marketed as a development opportunity but equally would not disregard the potential purchase as a going concern. googletag.cmd.push A feasibility study undertaken by Savills has revealed that the site could be developed for several uses, including a -bed hotel,  residential dwellings or a combination of both, in addition to leisure and recreational facilities. Barry’s Amusements first opened at  Eglinton St. in  and has remained one of the most popular family attractions for visitors to the area.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Trevor Smullen netted for Longford as Derry led - to - at the break. The game was still in its first minute when Bradley took advantage of a defensive mistake to fire the ball into the net. In injury-time Bradley netted from the penalty spot after he was fouled. The gap increased to three early in the second half before Longford hit four points without reply. David Barden wasted an excellent goal chance for Longford and Derry took advantage as Joe Diver pointed. But Longford fought back and edged ahead after three unanswered points only for Paddy Bradley to equalise. Paul Barden had the final say as he sent over a free from  metres in the last minute to send Derry crashing out.

Qualiers RLongford - Derry -Longford earned a dramatic win in a chaotic finish at Pearse Park. There was controversy too. Derrys Barry McGoldrick, who had marauded forward from corner-back to grab two goals, picked up a second yellow card after a melee in the Longford goalmouth in the th minute of injury time. Minutes later, Derry sub Joe Diver scored a goal reminiscent of Joe Sheridans against Louth two previously - this time referee Michael Duffy awarded a free out and Longford were safe. Longford had led by three at the break, - to -, thanks largely to the accuracy from frees of Sean McCormack. Paddy Bradley showed all his class too in the opening phase of the game and was at the heart of anything productive from Derry. McGoldricks first goal levelled the match, finishing coolly, after being set up by Paddy Bradley. His second goal put Derry in the driving seat, despite not playing well. Again McCormack got Longford level and then the home side went in front and on their way to victory.

Thatrsquos not the same as having a formal British Irish Intergovernmental Conference with officials and an agenda, he said.ldquoI have no objectionthey want to talk every day. Thatrsquos a good idea, but I think the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement should be followed and that means there should be a BIIC on a regular and frequent basis. That is what was signed.Speaking weeks after street violence by loyalist protesters erupted in Belfast over issues related to Brexit and the NI Protocol, Mr Ahern said BIIC meetings were very important.ldquoIt does concern me that we havenrsquot had a British Irish Intergovernmental Conference for a long, long time, maybe a few years.Mr Ahern was interviewed by former BBC political correspondent Martina Purdy and former barrister Elaine Kelly, who spoke to the former Taoiseach about peace-building, faith and St Patrick.ldquoThe two governments, the British and Irish governments are the custodians of the Agreement. They are not meeting to discuss these issues. That clearly is not in line with the agreement.ldquoI am not using any other words than what the Agreement usedhellip The agreement says that there must be frequent meetings and you know that should be happening.ldquoThey donrsquot have to be for long. They can be on zoom, Microsoft teams anything you like. They should be having these meetings and where there are dficulties they should be dealing with at those meetings.ldquoIn the absence of those meetings, things can drt. Quite frankly I donrsquot understand why those meetings canrsquot take place.ldquoI donrsquot expect the British Prime Minister and the Taoiseach to have a meeting all day ndash they donrsquot have to do that. They could have a meeting for an hour and half. Thatrsquos not going to kill anybody.He said other officials or ministers or institutions within departmental structures could then follow through with the issues.Mr Ahern also spoke about the future of the Catholic Church in Ireland, where he said there must be more involvement of the laity.He said his faith was important to him. ldquoYou donrsquot want to overplay it because you are attacked nowyou do that.ldquoReligion is important to me. I am a believer and I understand it and I read about it and I think itrsquos part of my le and I often think that a lot of people, who have a lot of problems and dficulties - it is because they donrsquot have it. All I can do is pray for them.During lockdown Mr Ahern shared how he went to mass regularly from his kitchen in Drumcondra, sharing masses online from Clonard monastery in Belfast, as well as Derry, Cork and Dublin.He said lockdown had given people time to reflect and enjoy walking, something he really enjoys.He told the podcasters mdash former Sisters of Adoration who are now pilgrim guides on Saint Patrickrsquos Way Downpatrick mdash that ldquohe would love to come and walk the Irish Camino with them.He revealed he had spent nine months of the lockdown reading The Annals of the Four Masters, chronicles of medieval Irish history.Mr Ahern described it as a ldquotough read, admitting he could only manage  pages a day.Asked what he would like to banish from Ireland, in the Spirit of St Patrick, he said ldquoinjustice and violence..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5May2021-Breast.jpg","title":"Breastfeeding is the most beautiful thing  ","story":"WHEN Joanne Masseyrsquos second child, Edward, was born six months ago, she knew she wanted to breastfeed him, but also,possible, donate to the milk bank.Weighing in at just over lbs, Edward fed for  minutes soon after he was born and it seemed like establishing feeding would be no problem.However, a few months before Edward was born, Joannersquos family found out her father, Jim Watson, had cancer.She explained: ldquoEventually we would learn it was terminal. So my stress levels were abnormally high.ldquoI soon felt like I couldnrsquot feed Edward enough, stress got the better of me at times and my brilliant health visitor Maura pointed me to a local breastfeeding group and also another brilliant lady, my breastfeeding peer support worker Aine Jordan-Doxey, who just completely gave me the confidence and support to keep going.ldquoThe peer breastfeeding group is hosted by a midwe health visitor and contains a beautul bunch of souls who are just there for each other. Wersquore all in the same boat and through this group I have received many tips, tricks and even friends.Despite Joannersquos determination to breastfeed Edward, it wasnrsquot all plain sailing.ldquoBreastfeeding is just the most beautul thing.Yes it can be dficult and absolutely frustrating at times but the benefits far outweigh those short blips, she said.ldquoThe best advice Irsquove ever heard mdash lsquodonrsquot give up on a bad dayrsquo.On a rough day, breastfeeding Edward gave me comfort, knowing I was the reason he is full and happy made me feel so good.ldquoAine gave me so much advice, including certain foods to eat to boost milk supply. Oats, theyrsquore your best friend! And you cannot drink enough water.Soon Joanne had more milk that Edward could take so she began collecting extra milk for the milk bank.She said: ldquoThe bottles arrived and I filled the first ml on December  last year. The donation was nearly full in a month but sadly my dad passed away on January  at the age of . There was a few weeks with no donations as my milk supply ped to an all-time low. Itrsquos just incredible what stress can do to your body.ldquoWell, Aine was there again, checking in, keeping me in chat, and keeping me motivated to keep breastfeeding. I am very lucky to have a wonderful, supportive husband, a close knit family and a close circle of best friends who have been tremendous during this very dficult time.Joanne went on to complete her donation of four litres of milk she calls ldquoliquid gold on Motherrsquos Day and wants to thank Aine for all her help and support.She said: ldquoI fully support every motherrsquos choice to either breastfeed or bottle-feed butanyone was struggling to breastfeed I would strongly recommend taking the support thatrsquos available.ldquoPersonally I am continuing to breastfeed because it gives me a little comfort in this time of grief, itrsquos a moment where I just look into his eyes and feel so needed and loved. So not only for the instantly available nutrition and comfort to my son but for those moments of joy I get from it too.Aine says she is so proud of Joanne mdash not only for continuing to breastfeed during the emotional time of her fatherrsquos illness and death but also for contributing four litres of milk to the Trustrsquos milk bank.The mother-of-threersquos own experience of breastfeeding had been rewarding but also not without its challenges.While she was living in England at the time, she recalled a time when one of her children was not thriving while she was feeding them.ldquoMy doctor and my health visitor both told me to stop breastfeeding my son and it was so frustrating as I knew that was not the problem so I continued on and it turned out that there was something  wrong.She began supporting Joanne in November last year when Edward was five weeks old.ldquoJoanne was exhausted and had been through some dficult nights where Edward wasnrsquot sleeping and was screaming through the night.I remember speaking with her about developmental leaps and what to expect at this stage and the normal infant sleep patterns, said Aine.ldquoFrom the beginning I could tell Joanne had so much passion for breastfeeding and wanted to succeed in every way. Joanne began expressing enough to give Edward a bottle and soon after he started sleeping better, just in time for her toddler to stop sleeping through. Joanne never let this stop her and carried on with minimal sleep.Aine said that when Joanne first mentioned to her about the possibility of donating milk, there were only  donors on the Northern Ireland milk bank.She said ldquoI was so proud as Joanne was the first of my mums to donate and it honestly made me smile at the thought. As usual Joanne just laughed and said it was no big deal as she enjoyed it. It was the first time I disagreed with her as I thought she was doing an extraordinary thing.ldquoWhen I opened her message and saw Edward surrounded by four litres of expressed milk for the milk bank, I was blown away again. What an incredible gt for the sick babies in theneonatal units.ldquoNot only was Joanne potty training a toddler and breastfeeding on demand, but she was expressing for the milk bank. I am so thankful to have been a part of her journey. So often there isnrsquot enough support available for mums especially with breastfeeding, and Covid made it more dficult as the usual support groups had all closed. Thatrsquos why peer support is so valuable as it provides one to one support for mums at the most important time.Aine highlighted the need for support for breastfeeding mums. ldquoWe need to be offering all mums support from the very first chance which is the case for a lot, but sometimes mums donrsquot know about us until itrsquos too late. ldquoI am thankful to Joanne for sharing this experience with me and I know we will still be in touch for a long time.ldquoAnd even though Irsquom sure she will downplay what she has achieved, I can honestly say I am so proud of her and all her hard work.Mothers can be referred to the Trustrsquos breastfeeding support worker through midwery and health visiting services..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5May2021-Carlisle.jpg","title":"Carlisle’s staff in charity hike in memory of much loved Pat  ","story":"ONE hundred staff and friends at Carlislersquos in Ballynahinch are each walking five miles this week on a sponsored walk in honour of a much-loved colleague who died last month.Pat Greene, who was from Saintfield, died on April , much to the shock and sorrow of everyone at the business.The  year-old had worked for Carlislersquos for  years, starting off as a coal boy, going on to work in all areas of the business and finishing as a work supervisor.Donna Carlisle explained that Pat loved The Proclaimers song Irsquom Gonna Beand it inspired the charity effort from staff members, past and present, and their partners.ldquoIt was Patrsquos favourite song and it had to be on the playlist at all our party nights when we raised money for ious cancer charities. Raising money for these charities was always important to Patrick as his mother sadly passed away from the disease when he was young, she said.ldquoHe never missed any of the parties and when The Proclaimers came on I always remember Pat taking centre stage and all of us had to follow him and his actions and it was always very important we did it right.ldquoThis is one memory of Pat we will never forget.

However, he did not make it through to show his impressive main course and dessert to the judges.Both chefs threw their all into devising four courses, including an appetiser and pre-dessert mdash based on the theme celebrating British innovation.Hopes were high for East Down given that Dundrum chef Alex Browne Greene, from EIPIC restaurant in Belfast, got two dishes to the national final last year and narrowly missed out on being crowned champion of champions at the banquet.Gemmarsquos starter was a twist on gammon, egg and chips, inspired by Kegomatic from Queenrsquos University students and for her fish course, the innovation shown in the building of the Titanic inspired her sea bass fish dish.She used William Clannyrsquos invention of the safety lamp for miners for her main course of lamb and the influence of astronomer Alice Everett as the first woman to work for the Royal Observatory to inspire her dessert, Out of this World.The dessert was her favourite course and she was delighted to have been scored a ten by chef Daniel Clford.ldquoIrsquom known for my desserts so I was really delighted to have got that score from Daniel, said Gemma.ldquoI also took his advice on my main course as therersquos no better person to take advice from and generally scaled back my dishes and made them more refined as the comments back were that there was too much on the plate.While Gemma was proud to have made it through to the regional final, she said she was not disappointed at not going through to the national judging.ldquoTo be honest, it was a bit of a relief as I did not know how I was going to go up against all the other chefs in the national final as I have only been cheffing for seven years and am mostly self-taught, she revealed.Gemma went into the competition, which was filmed last November, full of confidence and determined to do her best.ldquoI think I just went into a zone and concentrated on my own dishes and not to get too caught up in what the other chefs were doing, she said.ldquoPhelim was brilliant on the day and deserved to win and I remember saying on the programme that the better chef won. I hope that he goes on to get a dish to the banquet.While she has been receiving fantastic customer feedback from her popup, A Peculiar Tea, which she has been operating during the lockdowns, Gemma admitted that cooking was not her first career choice.ldquoWhen I left school I actually went to Queenrsquos University to do a nursing degree but a medical issue I experienced meant that I couldnrsquot complete it, she said.She then studied Bio Medical Sciences for a while before going to Ulster University to complete a software engineering degree.Her love of food and cooking mdash inspired by her chef mother mdash was strictly a hobby until the age of  when she took her first job at Slims Kitchen on the Lisburn Road in Belfast where she cut her teeth for a year while doing a Culinary Masters course.For four years Gemma continued studying and working full-time at a iety of great establishments, such as the Fitzwilliam Hotel in Belfast where she rose to head pastry chef, before moving The Old Inn, Crawfordsburn, where she worked all the sections and eventually became sous chef.She has been in Alexanders for the last two years and got the opportunity to become an owner last year.ldquoIt may have taken my several attempts before I found the right career but I was determined not to do any job that I did not absolutely love and was passionate about.Like Gemma, Brunels chef Paul Cunningham hopes to be invited back next year after his disappointing showing this year.The  year-old had hoped to get to the regional judging to please his six-year-old daughter, Farrah.ldquoFarrah and I are massive fans of the show, we watch every year and of course, I wanted to further than I did but Irsquove got over the disappointment now and concentrating on getting the restaurant ready for re-opening, Paul told the Recorder.Paul is known for only using local produce from within a -mile radius of Newcastle and foraging for herbs and plants.His menu reflected his locality and passion for pioneers including Belfast-born Dame Jocelyn Bell Burnell and Isambard Kingdom Brunelrsquos refloating of the SS Great Britain in Dundrum Bay mdash an incident which led him to name his restaurant by the great engineer.Paul only got to cook his starter and main course on the show but said his main course and dessert were showstoppers, with the main course of lamb called Healthy Heart made without using any salt or butter, inspired by Frank Pantridge who invited the portable defibrillator.He also collaborated with Doran Precision Engineering to create a model of the Titanic for one of his dishes and a special dish to show off his dessert, the Atom Smasher, inspired by Dame Jocelyn Bell Burnell..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5May2021-Condemnation.jpg","title":"Condemnation over Murlough vandalism  ","story":"LOCAL politicians have criticised vandals responsible for setting fire to a gate at the Murlough Nature Reserve two weekends ago as  firefighters were battling a huge blaze in the nearby Mournes.The vandals also left behind a trail of rubbish at the internationally acclaimed area with their actions condemned by South Down MLA Colin McGrath and Mournes councillor Laura Devlin.They say it ldquobeggars belief that while the raging wildfire destroyed  acres of rich habitat across the Mournes, there were people who thought that it was appropriate to start a fire at the Nature Reserve.The politicians also revealed that National Trust staff had to remove  bags of rubbish from the Reserve location on the Sunday the fire in the Mournes was eventually extinguished.Cllr Devlin said as young people drank alcohol and watched the blaze raging across the mountains, they set fire to a pedestrian gate which is also used to prevent Exmore ponies at the Reserve from escaping.ldquoI am really shocked at this behaviour, she said. ldquoBy the Saturday evening, everyone in the locality had an idea of the widespread damage in the Mournes but these iniduals thought it appropriate to cause more damage and potentially risk another blaze.ldquoI have no idea who these iniduals were and how old they are so I am appealing to people young and old.

It didnrsquot sink in until I was driving away from the ceremony and it was a great feeling.The jump jockey star first began his interest in horses after watching the races at Downpatrick Racecourse with his family when he was just eight years old. Since then, he carried on visiting the local racetrack with friends and soon caught the racing bug.ldquoI went to a few point-to-pointers with the McCartan family who we know well.

We have competed a lot together and Irsquove developed my skills with him a lot, we have picked up six or seven wins this season together he said.ldquoThat horse has helped me get to the grade one stage of racing, especially after our massive grade two win.That grade two success was when Danny and Nuts Well secured first place in the valuable Old Roan at Aintree. Nuts Well was picked for an outsider in the race at  , but the talented rider once again showed he was worth his salt as he galloped to glory.This gave Northumberland trainer Ann Hamilton her biggest success to date as they claimed the pound, prize pot.Despite his interest and success in racing, Danny was the first in his family to become heavily involved in the sport.ldquoI come from a sporting background in my family, my two brothers played Gaelic football and soccer growingup, but I was the one who took it upon myself to get into the horses, he said.ldquoOf course my family supported me and helped me achieve were I am today, but I do not come from a racing background.Dannyrsquos parents, Brenda and Denis, were delighted as their son received recognition for an outstanding season and hope that this is just the beginning for the promising young talent.ldquoWe are so proud of him, he has done all of this off his own back, said Brenda.ldquoHe has worked extremely hard to get to this point and I am so glad he is living his dream.ldquoEven though I canrsquot watch his big hurdle races until the final straight as I always have a motherrsquos worry, she added.Danny spent a brief time back with family in Downpatrick but is getting back to business as usual in England.ldquoI just plan on keeping my head down and hope to bring the momentum from this season into the next one, he said.ldquoEverything wouldnrsquot be possible without the help from all of the team at the stables and my familyrsquos support.

He had a rare gt for making everyone feel better about themselves and for knowing they always had a friend in him. Facebook notices of his death drew an unprecedented outpouring of tributes and comments from across the region and demonstrated the levels of affection in which Jim was held.As a footballer he had few peers. His time with Downpatrick Rec was marked with cup and league successes, culminating in lting the Steel and Sons Cup in front of record attendances at the Crusaders Seaview ground for the first drawn match and the subsequent replay.Supporters from Downpatrick travelled in their thousands, marking the event one of the most widely celebrated sporting achievements of that era. The gate receipts were the highest ever recorded for the annual showpiece of amateur soccer in Northern Ireland, so much so that for the first time the income exceeded the VAT threshold, which meant tax had to be paid.On the day the Rec won that Steel Cup replay, Distillery tried to sign Jim as he left the pitch. He turned them down with a typically firm but gentlemanly refusal and stayed with the Rec for another four years, helping them to add to their cabinet of silverware.Jim lsquoCootrsquo Connolly was a player of exceptional talent. A classy and cultured defender, he is remembered for his unique ability to rise above other players, most of whom had a distinct height advantage, but lacked Jimrsquos trademark for timing his runs and hanging in the air for longer than ought to have been humanly possible. Many a spectator were left speechless after matches, shaking their heads in puzzlement at his exploits. Yes, he was that good.Tony lsquoDartrsquo Curran, who was the Downpatrick Rec goalkeeper, said it was ldquosometimes scary playing behind Jim. ldquoWhen I walked with Coot or talked with him or more often had a beer with him, I felt I was in the presence of greatness.So much so that everyone wanted a part of that, and his we Angie and family had to learn to share Coot because he just made you feel good about yourself. For that we as a community are eternally grateful to them. His footballing ability was absolutely extraordinary. I played behind him and said to him on a few occasions lsquoCoot you scare me. The things you do defy the laws of physics and gravityrsquo. He would jump for a ball start to come down and without touching the ground go up again. I swear it.Tony added: ldquoThe world is a sadder place for his leaving but somewhere up there hersquoll be playing with the guys that have gone before him and maybe BFwill be managing. I hope they will keep me a place on their team.Former Rec manager Jim Prior was devastated to learn of Jimrsquos death. ldquoLike all his former teammates I am cut to ribbons that Jim is no longer with us. As a footballer, he was simply out of this world. The other players on our most successful team were in awe of Jim and all loved him. He had star quality written all over him.He could do things that others couldnrsquot do, whether that was on the training ground or in the toughest of matches. I canrsquot remember him putting in less than a five-star performance.The Recrsquos former club secretary, Patricia Murrayremembers Jim as the baby of the Steel Cup team. ldquoMy deepest and heartfelt sympathies to Angela and all his family and friends. His laugh, smile and craic will be truly missed, Patricia said.Jim Connollyrsquos impact with Downpatrick was repeated at his next clubs, Ards and Killyleagh YC, where he suffered a career ending injury. He had been with the club for just two seasons but left an indelible mark. One of Killyleaghrsquos stalwart players, Philip Jennings, posted his own tribute. ldquoGreat memories of watching Jim for the great Down Rec team and playing with him at Ards and Killyleagh. A real legend in local football, but even more than that, just an absolute gentleman.Despite his injury, Jim ed to football several years later to turn out for the Downshire Hospital, with whom he won an all-Ireland medal winner in  under the management of Brian Cheetham.But the question always remained about what could have become of this precocious talent had he been able to stick with one of English footballrsquos premier clubs.His trials there were cut short by homesickness, more particularly an abiding love for his recently widowed mother. Downpatrick was his anchor. Family, friends, and the Stream Street precinct of his youth were too deeply ingrained for the young Connolly to ever contemplate leaving them behind. It was never a regret for Jim. Indeed,anything, the choice to stay reinforced his passion and love for the area. He perhaps never knew how deeply those feelings of connection were ed by those who had the good fortune to know him.Jimrsquos trials were at Nottingham Forest, Newcastle, and Everton, all three organised by local scout Bill Oakes. Everton came closest to getting his signature after pursuing him back to Downpatrick, although it was later learned that Newcastle too badly wanted to bring him on board.Local sports writer Charlie McStay recalled being contacted in later years by one of the Newcastle coaches who was enquiring about what had happened to Jim. ldquoNewcastle knew they had a gem on their hands, but he slipped through the net.All the coaches rated him at the highest level and believed he would have gone on to become a true star of English football, said Charlie.What a journey that would have been. All the way from Dunleath City and Santos in the Downpatrick Youth League to the pinnacle of professional soccer.Although soccer was Jimrsquos first love, he was an accomplished boxer and in his early days was trained by Owen Kerr, a respected coach who was a friend of world heavyweight champion, Floyd Patterson. Coincidentally, Owen was uncle to Cathal Kerr, who married Jimrsquos sister Bronagh. Small world!Jim also played juvenile and senior football for the Downpatrick Russell Gaelic Union, which this week remembered him as ldquomore than just a great footballer.An online RGU statement said: ldquoHe was one of the nicest guys you could ever meet. A true gentleman with an infectious laugh, he will be sadly missed by all who knew him.Away from sport, Jim trained as a mechanic and later became a minibus driver at Knockevin School and the local hospitals. He then joined Ulsterbus as a driver at the Downpatrick depot and rounded off his career as a groundsman at the Delamont estate. Always active, alwaysbusy that was the Jim Connolly way.Throughout his le, Jimrsquos singular passion was his family and friends. He was devoted to his we Angela mdash the couple were together from their teenage days and were rarely seen apart mdash and to his children, Aurla, Blaine and Clare. Nothing brought him greater happiness also than the birth of his grandchildren, Ruby, Darcy, Fianna, Fiachra, Grace and Eve. He is also survived by brothers Pat and Martin, sisters Ann, Marie, Bronagh, and Eilish, by his father-in-law Paddy Teggart, and by sons-in-law Feargal and Jude and his daughter-in-law Megan.Theirs is not a private grief. It is shared by countless hundreds who remember the boy and man who gave so much pleasure and for whom there is always a place in their hearts.Joe McCoubrey.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5May2021-Job.jpg","title":"JobStart scheme to help young people welcomed by MLA  ","story":"THE launch of a new government scheme designed to create job opportunities for young people has been welcomed by local politicians.Department for Communities minister Deirdre Hargey last week launched the poundm JobStart scheme designed to support - year olds facing additional employment challenges due to the impact of Covid-.In addition, the government department has also helped create additional employment opportunities for young people and remove barriers for those seeking employment through the work experience programme and an expanded adviser discretionary fund.Minister Hargey said the Covid- pandemic has had an ldquounprecedented impact on the local economy and labour market and that as part of her departmentrsquos response, it has addressed the anticipated impacts on young people and those who are ready to be re-employed but need help negotiating the process of finding work.ldquoThis has included creating job opportunities and placements for young people providing additional payments towards travel or childcare expenses financial support of up to pound, a year to assist in the removal of barriers to employment and training to help people increase their chances of gaining employment.The JobStart scheme is designed to create opportunities for - year olds by providing positions with employers for a period of six months, increasing to nine months for those who meet additional criteria.An Opportunity Guarantee strand has been added to The Work Experience Programmefeaturing  week placements with the guarantee of an interview for a job or an apprenticeship on completion.Strangford MLA Kellie Armstrong and Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran have both welcomed the new scheme.Mrs Armstrong said the scheme was originally due to start last year, arguing that many young people may have missed out as a result of its delayed implementation.She continued: ldquoThe roll-out of this scheme is welcome as it will help young people climb back from the pandemic financially, while giving the economy a boost.

They met outside Castlewellan Forest Park on Saturday morning and ran into the park to do three laps of the lake. Nicely warmed up, they then headed out the main road to Newcastle and didnrsquot stop till they were in the grounds of the Slieve Donard hotel.They fairly breezed along and were all within sight of each other as they came to a halt. Cathy andMags were at the head of the pack in one hour  minutes with Helen less than a minute behind.Joanne was just a few seconds over the two hours and more than happy with her run and they all agreed that it was a scenic route.Being at the Percy French and the fact that outside hospitality had conveniently opened the night before, it would have been rude not to have an ice cold beverage to celebrate. Well deserved ladies.And so to Sunday, Suzy Smith often meets with friends and family including Kelly her niece for a long Sunday run.They stay close to home in Ballykinlar where the terrain could be described as lumpy. In fact whichever way they go, there are some challenging hills but these girls are well used to it and tough enough to persevere.Suzy had actually only planned to run a few miles with brother Patrick to encourage him on his way to the half marathon distance but she was enjoying it so much that she ran on and on until before she knew it, she had covered the entire . miles.Despite this only being her second time to complete a half marathon, she finished in a very respectable time of two hours and five minutes.Who knows how well she could doshe was participating in an official race Kelly meanwhile had struck a brisk pace from the off and followed her own rhythm easing ahead in the early stages. She has been running very well in training and it was no surprise that despite the gradients involved, she ended up with a personal best time of one hour  minutes.Again there is no doubt on a flatter course with other runners to chase, there will be improvement to come but for now both Smiths were content with their efforts and so they should be, well done..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/7May2021-Leader.jpg","title":"Leader and inspiration  ","story":"FINNEBROGUE Artisan has promised to continue the legacy of founding chairman Denis Lynn who died in a quad bike accident at the weekend.Hailed as an ldquoinnovator and visionary, Mr Lynn died following a tragic incident at his home in Killyleagh on Sunday.Mr Lynnbecame synonymous with his Downpatrick-based firm, which now employs , people over four local sites.On buying Finnebrogue Estate on the outskirts of the town in , the former potato chip seller turned to beef and deer farming and established Finnebrogue as the biggest venison processor and supplier in the UK.He then produced quality sausages, supplying Marks and Spencer and other leading retailers, and developed the nitrate-free bacon brand, Naked Bacon, in .More recently, Finnebrogue has ersied into developing meat-free products.The firmrsquos senior management team will now lead the business with non-executive director David Manning stepping up as interim-chairman and non-executive director Colin Walsh as interim deputy-chairman.A company statement paid tribute to Mr Lynn, who is survived by his we Christine, daughters Kerry, Clare, Tara and Ciara, and his wider family circle.It said: ldquoDenis was an innovator and a visionary with an infectious passion for delivering positive change for the planet and its people.

Local agencies cannot be left alone to pick up the pieces and restore this fragile habitat.ldquoThe environment minister must urgently convene a cross-departmental taskforce that brings together the experience, focus and most importantly, resources, in order to meet the unprecedented challenges in rejuvenating this area.Mr Hazzard said the scenes of environmental destruction left in the Mournes as a result of the inferno show the urgent need to protect precious habitats, especially our peatlands.He added: ldquoIf managed correctly, peatlands play an important role in supporting rich ecosystems, improving water quality and also protecting our communities from the localised consequences of climate change.ldquoFor some time now a draft peatlands strategy has sat with the minister awaiting publication there can be no more delay. Minister Poots must publish this strategy as soon as possible.Meanwhile, the petition urging a ban on the sale of disposal barbecues in shops and supermarkets is gathering increasing support.The resident behind the petition said that every year a number of businesses push the the sale of cheap, disposable barbecues, which are frequently taken to be used in parks and green spaces, often without the landowners permission.ldquoIn many cases, having already scorched the ground below, these barbecues are frequently left, giving rise to wild fires. Disposable barbecues are bad for the environment in terms of use and disposal, said the resident.ldquoThese barbecues are made using unsustainable materials from tropical forests in South Africa and South America.ldquoThey canrsquot be recycled, burn grass and typically result in scattered litter. Just like Chinese sky lanterns which the local council previously took action on and which were also once acceptable, the time has come to ban disposable barbecues.The resident said disposable barbecues represent a ldquohuge fire risk, burn the ground underneath them, are often left as litter and contain sharp pieces that can harm animalstrodden on.She added: ldquoThey are used in beauty spots, wildle reserves and on beaches and are just left smouldering. They make it far too easy for people to be irresponsible by putting them directly on the ground and then leaving them there afterwards.ldquoLiving in an area of natural beauty we have many areas were people see fit to light a barbecue. The recent events have shown us we cannot take the risk. The earth is too fragile and the danger to humans and wildle is too great.

I had a long chat a couple of weeks ago with an old UUP friend who was complaining about a recent interview in which I had said the UUP was still dogging the DUP’s footsteps.By Alex KaneMonday, th May , : pm  \"       \"  I called him yesterday: “So, the DUP has a leadership contest and now the UUP is having one.” There was a pause: “Fair enough, Alex, can we talk about Sherlock Holmes instead ”The news about Steve Aiken came as no surprise. The sheer volume of internal complaints about him suggested his time was up. I’ll join together two comments I heard yesterday afternoon: ‘His removal was properly conducted, unlike the surgical removal of Arlene Foster or the Sinn Fein purge in Foyle.after hard conversations there wasn’t exactly a chorus suggesting he hang on any longer.’ The problem with Aiken – although in almost any other walk of le it wouldn’t count as a problem – is that he was much too nice to lead a political party. Particularly one as dficult to lead as the UUP has been since Terence O’Neill’s era. He is a decent man with a brisk, efficient, managerial approach to problems. But that’s not what the UUP needed this last  months. And it’s certainly not what party members – who do the hard slog of elections and door-knocking – wanted.   \" fill\"#ea\"  to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...UUP members viewed Steve Aiken’s media interviews sometimes with quiet despair and occasionally utter disbeliefThey wanted someone who would land a few powerful blows on the DUP: and particularly on Arlene Foster. There’s still a section of the party which has never forgiven either her or Donaldson for defecting to the DUP and that section has been enjoying a feeling of schadenfreude as it read about her travails this past year. Or, as a -year-old, Trimble-supporting member of the party texted me when he heard that the DUP had thrown her overboard: ‘Slap it up her. She should have known they would turn on her at some point.’Members and supporters voters of a party want to hear the leader do well in interviews. They want to feel buoyed-up and able to punch the air: particularlythey feel the leader they support has acquitted himself well. Aiken’s innate politeness prevented him from having many of those moments. Too often his supporters were just shrugging their shoulders and sighing: mostly in quiet despair, but occasionally in utter disbelief. Reg Empey stood down as leader after the UCUNF projectfailed to deliver any seats at the  general election. Tom Elliott lasted  months. Mike Nesbitt survived for five yearsbut stood down after a terrible Assembly result in . Robin Swann stayed for  months. Aiken, who officially resigns this morning at am, managed  months.Empey and Nesbitt both took risks to try and give the UUP something which could be described as signicantly dferent from the DUP . Both paid the price: but maybe it was more timing than anything . The DUP mocked the UCUNF pact, yet cut their own one with the Conservatives a few years later . In an interview for Brian Rowan’s new book, ‘Political Purgatory’Nesbitt noted: “I judged there was insufficient electoral support for my call for a post sectarian election and rather than try to hang on to the leadership and risk undoing five years of effort to unite my party, I resigned before the counts were even complete, so members could focus on the future. Since then, many people have told me I was too early, ahead of my time. Watching the so-called Alliance surge of , I wonderall I got wrong was the timing.’Nesbitt makes a fair point. That said, I still think he’s missing a key truth about the UUP: it is not – and hasn’t been so for a long, long time – a single, united party. It is still like a collection of smaller parties and competing interests and prone to taking sides when the leadertakes a stand on an issue. Ironically, the DUPis experiencing exactly the same dficulties: and may continue to do so , which seems inevitable, the new leader enjoys the support of just over half of the electoral college.All of which raises the only question that matters: what does a new leader do to give the UUP the something ‘signicantly dferent’ it needs to attract both media interest and new votes  Maybe a second question: , for example, the new leader wanted to widen the chasm between his party and the DUP, would a substantial, convincing majority of party members let him  Many recent leaders have fallen at the hurdle represented by that second question. Crucially, is there someone in the UUP who,he won the leadership, would not be afraid to make his own case and face down both internal and external opponents. Someone who would say: “This is what I want to do. If you elect me as leader then it is what I will do – so don’t pretend to be surprised afterwards when I start doing it.”If that person doesn’t exist, then it won’t be long until the party doesn’t, either.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityVale of Glamorgan council put forward Aberthaw, a recently closed coal-fired power plant, as a potential site for a fusion prototype.The UK government last year called for suggestions for possible sites to pioneer the technology which could generate electricity with low carbon emissions.But opposition councillors on the Vale council have claimed the cabinet has ldquorushed through its decision to suggest Aberthaw as a site.More NewsCardf Tomasz Waga murder investigation sees two more arrestedFour coffee shops in Penarth for meeting a friend outdoorsThings to do in South Wales on May Bank Holiday weekend Plaid Councillor Ian Johnson said: ldquoIt was strange that the council leadership did not consult with other parties or ask a cross-party scrutiny committee to consider issues before making the expression of interest about a possible future use of the Aberthaw plant.ldquoEven though it is an early point, many people will have questions about the technology, the impact of the development and the process, and discussing this in scrutiny would open up the debate and ensure transparency.Fusion technology is still in its infancy and no fusion reactor has ever created more power than it consumes. But scientists say it could be cleaner and safer than fission, the nuclear technology currently used to generate electricity.If Aberthaw is chosen, the council is hoping the power plant could bring lots of high-tech high-paid jobs to the region. Westminster should decide on a site by the end of next year, and the power plant would be built by , costing about pound billion.But the Valersquos cabinet used controversial emergency powers last month to put forward Aberthaw as a site, without consulting the full council or any scrutiny committees. Council leader Neil Moore said this was due to the deadline for suggestions at the end of last month.     However, Westminster made the initial call for suggestions in December last year, meaning the council had four months in total to debate and scrutinise the decision to put forward Aberthaw. The council debated the issue in a meeting this week, after the deadline passed.Conservative Cllr Gordon Kemp said: ldquoThis is being dealt effectively without allowing any proper consideration or scrutiny. Itrsquos an extremely signicant matter, evenwe ignore the issue of public concern over such a proposal.ldquoWersquore looking at potentially a colossal, massive investment in the Vale. It could create many jobs, so I think itrsquos something that should have been discussed.ldquoI appreciate there are always deadlines on this. But Irsquom very concerned and surprised this wasnrsquot put before cabinet and scrutiny committees [earlier].Cllr Moore said the issue was ldquonot a debate, but promised to meet with the leaders of the opposition parties on the council, and to give a cross-party scrutiny committee a chance to consider the plans.He said: ldquoThis is just for noting. We used the emergency procedure because it had to be in by a deadline. This is not a debate about what we can do.ldquoBut Irsquom more than happy to have a meeting with the group leaders, and Irsquom more than happy to ask for an information report to go to the environment and regeneration scrutiny committee. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Since my early twenties Irsquove been interested in the workings of society and how we treat each other, animals and our planethellip and in the process Irsquove come to completely mistrust virtually all career politicians. I believe a new way of doing politics is needed in Wales with a new set of values across the whole system. I donrsquot believe the current political structure and its controllers have the interest of the people at its heart with regard to their mental and physical health, their quality of le and spiritual and economic well-being.     Paul Campbell - UKIPHello Im Paul Campbell and Im standing in the Cardf South and South Wales Central area for UKIP in the Senedd elections on MAY TH.Being. Born in Cardf and lived most of my le there I appreciate the Greatv Potential the pride and the Welsh Identity in Cardf and the Valleys towns. and I have seen how things have changed over the years with parts of the area unrecognizable from the place I remember.Areas of Cardf have become run down and standards have fallen with a loss of community spirit The surrounding Towns have been neglected with. A lack of investment and job creation initiatives.Mass immigration in the UK has put tremendous strains on cities like Cardf Newport and Swansea with wage depression and overstretched public services.. The Conservatives claim to be in control of immigration but they will only ever talk about it and under there watch in the in the last  years  million more people have come to our shires thats  cities the sthe size of Cardf . Increasingly they are choosing to come to Wales as Labour has encouraged them by a making Wales a Nation Of sanctuary.Helen Westhead - Green PartyOur current administration has ignored the climate emergency and has left so many people vulnerable and excluded. As we recover from the pandemic we have unique opportunity to create better ways of working - the influence of an elected Green in the room will be transformative.We see from across the UK, Europe, and beyond the incredible dference Greens make, holding government to account, speaking out against inequality, and representing real people and their communities, not political or corporate interest. Wales is long overdue that representation in the Senedd.We know that the way we recover from this pandemic and build back stronger is through investing in communities and public services, ensuring everyone has access to local facilities, and supporting small business. If elected, one of my main priorities would be better walking and cycling routes, connected to affordable public transport and green outdoor spaces that communities can enjoy. Advocating for a Universal Basic Income would ensure no one is left behind in our bold plan to transform Wales.With the more proportional voting system on the regional ballot in Wales, Labour cannot win regional seats. A Green vote on your second ballot is the only progressive option.Matt Friend - PropelPropel has led the campaigns on two of the most important issues affecting Barry, Penarth and Cardf.Wersquore the only party that has committed not to allow any nuclear mud to be dumped in our waters, including the mud dredged from outside Hinkley nuclear reactor in Somerset.And wersquore the only party that even mentions the scandal of dangerous fire risk cladding on so many of our flats and buildings. Through our Contract with Wales we have committed not to issue new building contracts to any housing developer involved in the scandal, until they have paid to fix the problem they created.Wersquoll also end the way leaseholders are getting rinsed by introducing a service charge cap, linked to the Retail Price Index. That will stop the double digit increases in service charges that leaseholders have had to put up with.Most importantly, wersquoll introduce a Coronavirus Recovery Act to end Welsh lockdowns, save lives and restore freedoms. We canrsquot just hope wersquoll get our freedoms back, we have to vote for them.The ten laws in our Contract with Wales will transform our nation. Wales needs champions. Vote Propel.Alex Wilson, Liberal DemocratsI live with my family in Penarth and I became involved in politics because of the widening isions that seemed to occurring our community. I feel that with the Liberal Democrat core values of tolerance and understanding we can bring people back together. We can cut through the shouting of partisan politics and once again listen to what people want in their community.The next five years is going to be critical and I feel the Senedd must put recovery first. That means recovering from the Covid pandemic, the recovery of our economy, better healthcare services and a happier community which can be achieved by better transport links, saving our environment and ato community values.Irsquove been around long enough to know a political status-quo without a strong opposition can breed complacency. Wersquove seen this in national and local government. If I am elected I will ensure that the voice of the people is heard. If yoursquove ever wondered how we almost lost the Kymin or how they plan to build over  homes on contaminated land at Cosmeston Farm in Sully, well itrsquos because our current political leaders often lack empathy with local communities.Other candidates standing are:Vaughan Gething - LabourAngus Hawkins - Gwlad The Welsh Independence PartyLisa Peregrine ndash Abolish the Welsh Assembly Party Alan Pick ndash Reform UKDavid Rolfe ndash IndependentLeighton Rowlands ndash Conservative article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Otherwise a coalition must be attempted.:Who can vote Anyone over the age of  can vote in the Senedd election provided they are:- registered to do so- living in Wales- not legally excluded from votingThis is the first time  and -year-olds have been eligible to vote. What impact that has on the result remains to be seen.How do I vote There are three ways - in person, by post and by proxy - however, the deadlines for latter two options have already passed.Voting at the polling booth with take place until pm today.Polling stations will be kitted out with hand sanitiser and distancing markers to help voters remain safe from coronavirus.Most crucially, voters are being asked to bring their own pen or pencil.Face coverings must also be worn, unless exempt.How does the voting system work Each voter will have two votes - one constituency vote and one regional vote.Youll be represented in the Senedd by five Members. One for your constituency and four for the region of Wales where you live.Constituency vote - this is for the person you want to represent you and your local area. Wales has  constituencies, with each being represented by one MS in the Senedd. Constituency votes are counted in a first past the post system - so the candidate with the most votes is elected.     Regional vote - This is for who you want to represent your region of Wales - South Wales East, South Wales Central, South Wales West Mid and West Wales and North Wales. There are  regional Senedd Members, elected by the additional member system.When will results be announced As with a lot of things this past year, the election has been hit by Covid restrictions.While voting will happen today, counting will not take place the same night as is usually the case on election night.Instead, the votes will be taken to the counting locations and kept secure until morning.They will then be veried - spoiled ballots removed - and counted.Due to Covid restrictions, this will likely take longer than in normal counts, but results are expected within two days of polls closing.Keep an eye on the Argus website for the latest, and results. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
