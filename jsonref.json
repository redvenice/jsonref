It is a basic existence. We work all the hours that God sends because we have to.\u0027We do not understand things about saving the planet or what is or is not organic. For us it is all about work and survival.\u0027         Malabar Baby was founded by wealthy Indian-American Anjali Harjani-Hardasani in 2014, after she moved from New York to Hong KongMrs Regar\u0027s husband Ram Gopal also works at Nayika where his duties include cutting the organic cotton for the blanket Archie was wrapped in. As a master cloth cutter, he earns more than his wife, taking home around 15,000 rupees per month (£176).The couple start work at 9.30am and finish at 5.30pm, six days per week. They are only given 25 minutes for lunch and are not provided with any formal contracts.Their salaries may seem low by western standards but in Mr Gopal\u0027s case, he earns above the national average monthly salary of 13,000 rupees (£154). His wife however falls below this threshold meaning their combined income is barely enough for a family of eight. Neither of their sons are in full-time employment and have just started their own hand printing business from home. The family survives on a mainly vegetarian diet of rice, lentils and vegetables, which have increased in price in recent times. A kilo of lentils, for example, can cost anything up to 200 rupees (£2.37) while most vegetables are less than half that. The average price of a bottle of beer is also 200 rupees.Mr Gopal, aged 55, said: \u0027Even though by Indian standards my salary is just above average as a family, if you combine our income, we are poor and things are very hard. We do not know about the world of the rich and famous who buy the things we make. We do not even know which countries it is being sent to. \u0027My job is very demanding and requires a lot of skill but it is not very well paid. Sadly, it is all I know, this is the only thing that I\u0027ve done all my life.\u0027When shown a picture of Meghan holding baby Archie in the blanket he helped make, Mr Gopal beamed with pride. He added: \u0027I do not know who these people are but we had heard that somebody very famous was using our dohar. This must be them.

I might be poor but I feel very proud that royal people are using this blanket.\u0027When MailOnline visited the Nayika factory, workers were busy hand block printing reams of organic cotton which form the outer layers of the dohar. These are then stuffed with mulmul, fine, soft cotton and then stitched to complete the blanket. Since Meghan appeared in public with Archie wrapped in it, orders have gone through the roof and around 2,000 are currently being made to meet demand. The hand-crafted blanket has sold out on the Malabar Baby website and is available for pre-order only. It is described as being \u0027simple but chic,\u0027 and makes \u0027cuddle time lots of fun at home or on the go.\u0027Conditions at the factory are better than at many within the Indian textile industry. Workers are paid a fixed monthly salary, as opposed to each item they make, child labour is strictly forbidden and there is a high level of cleanliness. While concerns have been raised over salaries, employees describe the management as \u0027fair.\u0027         Conditions at the factory are better than at many within the Indian textile industry.

We pay them the correct rate and treat them well.\u0027Malabar Baby was founded by wealthy Indian-American businesswoman Anjali Harjani-Hardasani in 2014, after she moved from New York to Hong Kong. She came up with the idea after being unable to find baby wear and accessories that she felt were affordable and of high quality.She named the company after the exclusive area of Mumbai where he family lives.During a visit to the Nayika factor earlier this year, Anjali posted a photograph of herself with Mrs Regar on social media to celebrate International Women\u0027s Day but incorrectly called her Anita. Malabar Baby has been approached by MailOnline for a response. "},{"url":null,"title":"Jack Grealish Connor Wickham separate bust ups revellers exclusive London club","story":"Share this article          It is not known what started the altercation but police confirmed they did not attend the scene         In the photographs, Grealish can be seen remonstrating at someone while other revellers look onA witness said he saw the Crystal Palace striker leave the club when another reveller said something to him \u0027out of the blue\u0027 which kicked off the scrap.Both players had been involved in pre-season matches on Saturday with Wickham scoring past Bristol City and Grealish assisting two against Charlton Athletic. It is not the first time that Jack Grealish has come under the spotlight for his off-the-field antics.The talented star, who has often been linked with big-money moves to top clubs, was pictured passed out drunk in Tenerife in 2015.

I just can’t believe that a fund manager of his long standing is unable to see the distress he is causing. People invested in what they thought was a first-class fund, their money has basically been taken away from them... and to add insult to injury they’re still being charged fees.         It was announced yesterday that Mr Woodford, 59, was a ‘reluctant seller’ of shares in his Woodford Patient Capital Trust to settle personal liabilities, including a tax bill‘And then Mr Woodford is suddenly able to get £1million without a problem. It just seems dramatically unfair.’Mr Woodford sold 1.75million shares in Patient Capital, 60 per cent of his holding with a value of around £1million, between July 3 and 8. He told the trust’s board only on Saturday, three weeks later.Investors including Mr Woodford can still buy and sell shares in Patient Capital.He has a separate holding in Equity Income, which he will be unable to sell until it reopens. Mr Woodford refused to go into detail about the tax bill he sold the shares to pay.His problems began when he pumped billions of pounds of savers’ cash into risky investments that were hard to sell in a hurry. At the start of June, he was hit with a demand by customer Kent County Council to repay £263million but was unable to sell enough shares.Equity Income was forced to block withdrawals and start a massive sell-off.Link Fund Solutions, an independent company tasked with making sure Equity Income follows the rules, has now told investors this suspension is likely to last until early December for Mr Woodford to complete ‘a measured and orderly repositioning of the fund’s portfolio of assets’.In a defiant update on his website, Mr Woodford apologised but insisted he will be proved right. He said his investing strategy is based on a view that the world economy is heading for the rocks.‘Admittedly, this strategy has not delivered the returns we had anticipated over the past couple of years,’ he said.‘I understand the frustration, inconvenience and anxiety the continued suspension of the fund will be causing.’"},{"url":null,"title":"NSPCC More 200 000 secondary school children groomed online","story":"Share this article The NSPCC said that there are around 5,182,045 young people aged 11 to 17 in the UK, and estimated that therefore around 201,696 had sent, received or been asked to send explicit messages or images.The charity has warned that paedophiles contact large numbers of children on social media and then encourage the ones who respond to move over to encrypted messaging or live streaming.Those who are tricked into sending images, often after being threatened, can then be blackmailed into sending more.

He doesn\u0027t quite realise how negative it is.\u0027I\u0027ve got a teacher friend who said that if a child is struggling, they do this and name positive things about the child and then they try and talk to the child to work on those positive things.\u0027However it appears to have been done in the reverse with my son.\u0027Caien had watched his grandmother\u0027s illness worsen in an intensive care ward before she died, and his father was horrified to find he had been told to \u0027control his emotions\u0027.   Mr Lightoller, who works in C-commerce, said: \u0027It was done just four months after his grandmother passed away so he was going through a very difficult time in his life as well.\u0027His grandmother had been in intensive care for five weeks with multiple organ failure and Caien had been to see her a couple of times, which is obviously not an easy thing for a 10-year-old to go through.

Haven’t we seen that movie before?“Which 22 artists have you selected to negotiate the slippery slope between Elon Musk and Sun Ra? Which 22 artists could capably and competently reflect on what it means to dream of colonising the universe (à la entrepreneurial oligarchic capital) AND simultaneously manage to compellingly take on the great and visionary legacy not only of Sun Ra and his Arkestra, but also of Afrofuturism in general?”The group pointed out that of the 22 artists involved in the show, 18 were white men and three were white women, and there was one person of colour, the Singaporean artist Song-Ming Ang, who represented his country at this year’s Venice Biennale.“We can only congratulate you heartily on managing to successfully man your mission to outer space with a list of artists that deftly marginalises all artists other than white men,” the group said.Afrofuturism has influenced artists including Kara Walker, musicians such as Janelle Monáe and Erykah Badu and authors including Octavia Butler and Ishmael Reed. The Afrofuturist author Ytasha Womack has described the movement as “the intersection between black culture, technology, liberation and the imagination, with some mysticism thrown in too. It can be expressed through film, it can be expressed through art, literature and music.

There was a minor injury to his pinky finger.He needed 11 hours of surgery to reattach the severed finger, which is no longer functional.Farriss is seeking special damages – which aren’t quantified – for loss of earnings and future loss of earnings, as well as out-of-pocket expenses.Montana Productions – which is owned by Farriss and his wife and controls his publishing rights and royalty income – is also seeking damages.“I find my reattached ring finger to be an annoyance and unsightly. I have considered having it amputated,” Farriss said.“I am no longer able to play guitar other than a few beginner-level chords.”The plaintiffs on Tuesday sought to amend their statement of claim in the supreme court but the defence opposed the move.Associate Justice Joanne Harrison reserved her judgment with directions to be issued on Friday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd7d53f50ba9f968715e66ab391a26f137a505ba/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=469ca97674044730cbb12b4b2ef448f0","title":"not the booker longlist vote now to decide the 2019 shortlist","story":"Our initial poll has put more than 170 novels in contention. We need your learned opinions to winnow this down to a shortlist next weekThis year’s Booker longlist has been described as “an absolute gift for bookselling” and seems popular with critics and the book-buying public alike, which is excellent. I hope it’s going to be a vintage year. But still: it isn’t as long as our longlist.This year, a mighty 171 books have been nominated for the Not the Booker prize. That’s an impressive indication of the scale of publishing in English-language fiction and of the enthusiasm you guys have for reading. But now, it’s time to start talking about how good some of these books are. To do that, we need to produce our shortlist.The first part of that process is to whittle down 163 books to a far more manageable three, which we will then add to three more – one selected by last year’s judges and one from each of our two nominated book champions for this year, Storyhouse library in Chester and Golden Hare Books in Edinburgh.And when I say “we”, I really mean “you”. This is part of the competition that you control, because it’s your vote that will help decide which three books go forward into the next round.Voting is easy – or it will be if you read the following instructions carefully:In order for your vote to be counted and comply with our all killer, no filler terms and conditions, you need to choose two books from the longlist below, from two different publishers, and accompany those choices with a short review of at least one of your chosen books. It would also be very helpful if you could include the word “vote”.We’re hoping for a minimum of 100 words in the review. We won’t be counting all that carefully, as there are only so many hours in the day – but at the very least make it look like you care and please give us your honest feelings.That’s it. As I say, it should be easy, but every year a few people get confused and we’re unable to count their votes.

This included £257m of restructuring costs, £64m one-off pension costs and asset writedowns of nearly £90m, partly due to the fall in near-term gas prices.But Conn said the company “has momentum” which should see a return to growth in the second half of the year and into 2020.Conn said Centrica’s new deal with Ford to provide electric vehicle tariffs and charge points was an example of “where we are moving to” in the future.Charles Berry, the chairman, said: “Iain has led the strategic repositioning of Centrica since 2015 and has been the driving force behind our plan to turn Centrica into a sustainable business.”It said the outlook was more positive for the second half of the year and this would continue into 2020. It also stuck to its cashflow and debt targets for this year.Centrica said it would exit oil and gas production to focus on customers, and expects to sell its last major asset, its stake in the oil and gas venture Spirit Energy, by the end of 2020.It lost 178,000 UK home energy supply accounts in the first half, and said it would revamp its home business including further cost cuts."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ebdc46faf392d44c90bd8c654c7f9582588acb3/0_100_4022_2413/master/4022.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0e8fae69cb2eb0ea1a4815aee709d220","title":"mark carney shortlist imf top job christine lagarde","story":"Bank of England governor had been cited as contender to take over from Christine LagardeThe shortlist of European candidates to lead the International Monetary Fund has been reduced to a handful of names – but Mark Carney has not made the final cut.The Bank of England governor had been cited as a contender to take over from Christine Lagarde, who stands down as the fund’s managing director in September to move to the European Central Bank. Despite being a previous bookies’ favourite, Carney is not on a shortlist drawn up by France’s finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, who is organising the process of selecting Europe’s candidate.European countries will face a choice from a list that includes Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the former Dutch finance minister Bulgaria’s Kristalina Georgieva, number two at the World Bank Olli Rehn, the head of Finland’s central bank Portugal’s Mario Cénteno, chair of the Eurogroup of finance ministers and Spain’s finance minister, Nadia Calviño. The French finance ministry on Monday denied reports that Cénteno and Calviño had been cut from the shortlist.Despite reports that George Osborne was interested in the job, one European diplomat said the former UK chancellor and current editor of the Evening Standard had “never been a candidate”.By longstanding agreement, Europe chooses the head of the IMF while the US picks the leader of the World Bank, although that Bretton Woods-era convention is increasingly questioned by the rest of the world. The IMF wants countries to nominate candidates by early September, with the aim of naming Lagarde’s replacement the following month.The IMF lends to troubled economies and played a crucial role in the eurozone crisis, as part of the so-called troika – of the IMF, European Central Bank and European commission – that oversaw bailouts of Greece, Portugal, Ireland and Cyprus.Georgieva, a former European commissioner, is seen as France’s choice. The 65-year-old can only succeed if the IMF scraps an age limit that means its managing directors are appointed before their 65th birthday.Dijsselbloem, an ex-head of the Eurogroup who once said indebted EU countries had wasted money on “drinks and women”, would have to overcome doubts in southern Europe about his economic approach.Rehn, a former European commissioner for the euro, has been Finland’s central bank governor since 2018. He is likely to compete with Dijsselbloem for the backing of north European countries.Cénteno and Calviño complete the list.Carney is Canadian by birth but has British and Irish passports. However, there is doubt whether that will ever be enough for him to be considered as “European” in this race.Europe hopes to unite around a candidate at the end of the summer, shortly before Lagarde’s official departure on 12 September. The outgoing head of the IMF has already ceased to make speeches and policy pronouncements, since her appointment this month as the first woman to lead the European Central Bank. The new managing director will be expected to oversee a change in approach by the IMF, which has been criticised in the past for imposing spending cuts on governments facing financial crises. The Fund came in for particularly fierce criticism during the Greek bailout.However, one of Lagarde’s last acts as IMF head was to announce a shift in policy. She said the IMF would now urge countries to protect spending on health, education and vulnerable groups amid growing concern among its members about excessive levels of inequality."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99bb6296b91f741f06e0c60e322519784a3ad845/0_294_5036_3021/master/5036.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=084903478b4240a390ca43ebd04fb85a","title":"pound holidays prices sterling brexit","story":"Sterling’s Brexit-driven plunge could make imported goods more expensiveFears of a no-deal Brexit have sent the pound plunging this week, with currency markets more alarmed than at any time since the immediate aftermath of the EU referendum.When the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, told BBC Radio 4 on Monday morning that “We must be prepared to give the country the finality it needs, to prepare businesses and people more broadly”, currency traders immediately began marking down the pound.“It appears we are finally seeing the potential repercussions of the UK leaving without a deal,” said currency traders Clear Treasury.What does this mean for you? The immediate impact is on holidaymakers heading to Spain and other destinations in the EU, but a collapse in the currency also has much wider implications for household finances.It’s grim, with rates on offer far worse than the “market”’ rates that traders talk about. At some UK airports, the pound is already worth less than a euro, and the same as a dollar.For example, at Heathrow, customers walking up to Travelex desks on Tuesday morning were being given just €0.91 for each £1, while if they wanted dollars the rate had collapsed to just $1.01.But sensible travellers know to buy their currency in advance online, avoiding the airport bureaux. Travelex is currently giving online customers €1.063 and $1.184 respectively for each £1.Parity with the euro no longer looks unlikely, and history tells us once the currency trapdoor opens, the falls can be painful sterling sank to near parity with the dollar in the mid-1980s, although only for a brief period.Prices of imported goods in the shops – and that’s an awful lot of what we consume as a country – will have to rise. You know those price tags on clothes in Zara, in euros, sterling and other currencies? It won’t be long before they are adjusted again, with the price in sterling inevitably having to rise. There is a lag effect here – so the rise won’t be immediate, but it will flow through eventually.Yes, tourists are the winners – just not British ones.

But is it achievable?The Champs Élysées is one of the most famous streets in the world, but you could say the French were beaten to it by the Mughals. About 15 years before the avenue was laid out in 1667 in Paris, India’s Mughal emperor Shah Jehan built a grand mile-long street in his capital to reflect the glory of the empire at its height.It ran from Fatehpuri mosque at one end to the colossal Red Fort at the other and was lined with trees, elegant mansions, mosques and gardens. Provisions for the Red Fort, the imperial residence, were carried down the boulevard by elephants, camels and horse-drawn carriages.In the centre ran the clear waters of a canal, reflecting the moonlight, or chandni – giving the street its name, Chandni Chowk (chowk means open market space). On hot summer evenings, the Bishti, a tribe of water carriers, would sprinkle water from their goat-hide canteens to cool the street.But while the Champs Élysées has retained its grandeur, Chandi Chowk and the area around it have degenerated into a mess of heaving crowds, dense traffic, decrepit buildings, pavements taken over by hawkers, tangled overhead electrical wires and general mayhem. The area known as the Walled City, or Old Delhi, is probably the most congested place in India.In a cool, tranquil studio in Aya Nagar, far away from the chaos, an architect is working to restore the Mughal splendour of Chandni Chowk. Pradeep Sachdeva’s firm, commissioned by the Delhi government, began work in December. The area has already been dug up and work is under way in an effort to meet the January 2020 completion date.On his computer screen is an image of how it will look. The most striking feature is the absence of cars. His design shows a calm street lined with trees, benches and lights, with wide pavements on either side of a green central lane. The electrical and telecom cables and water lines are buried underground.Since this is one of the busiest market areas in India (the Khari Baoli spice market by Fatehpuri mosque is Asia’s oldest), vehicles have to be allowed in to unload goods – but this will be restricted to the early hours of the morning.“This is one of the most important street designs in the world because few streets are this old and few embody so much urban complexity,” says Sachdeva. “It represents all that is complex about urban India and if we get the transformation right it will become an example for hundreds of such precincts across the country.”He says western designs don’t work in India because they lack the cycle rickshaws, the street hawkers and the high density of people.One of the first decisions he made was to not recreate the canal. “We know from our other projects that we can’t look after bodies of water in India. They get full of waste. So we have symbolised the canal by placing water-like patterns in the central median.”Another tricky decision was where to place public toilets and police kiosks. He settled on placing them in the central strip, rather than on the footpaths where they would have been an obstruction.Sachdeva is acutely aware of how important the redevelopment of Chandi Chowk is for the residents of Old Delhi, the historic old quarter where the majority of residents are Muslim. For decades, they have felt neglected by the authorities who seemed to care more for other areas of the capital over the of part which, ironically, boasts all the heritage.Over the years, affluent Hindu families fed up with the congestion and pollution vacated their havelis – mansions featuring a courtyard, fluted columns and doors high enough for elephants to enter – and moved to modern houses in south Delhi.Many Muslim residents, emotionally attached to the Walled City and its Mughal heritage, stayed on. The Walled City was, after all, the capital of the Mughals until the last emperor, Bahadur Shah Zafar, was deposed and exiled by the British in 1858. In 1911, the British transferred the capital from Kolkata to Delhi and built a new city – New Delhi – on the south side of Old Delhi.Old Delhi lost its status, but residents still derive pride from its historical importance and the fact that Chandi Chowk was once one of the most beautiful streets in the world. Most living here want it preserved as a beautiful historic quarter where visitors can walk without fear of being run over and where residents can enjoy a good quality of life.“It’s about restoring the original beauty of Old Delhi but it’s also about being good for business,” says Santosh Verma, the owner of a stationery shop. “We need a total facelift to create order and cleanliness out of this chaos.”The revamp of the entire area has been discussed for more than 15 years but no government has had the will to push it through. Sachdeva believes the Chandni Chowk project will kickstart the transformation of the whole Old Delhi area, but he has run into his own problems.A group of conservationists and architects have filed petitions in the Delhi high court objecting to one major feature of Sachdeva’s design: the placing of utilities in the central median. They claim this will act as a “wall” between the two sides of the street and destroy the area’s visual integrity.“In redeveloping an area you must respect its heritage, but the spirit of this processional avenue is being destroyed with this design,” says AG Krishna Menon, an architect and urban planner. “You can’t put electrical transformers and public toilets in the middle. It breaks up the whole vista. They need to be somewhere else.”In his studio on the fringes of the capital, Sachdeva sounds weary rather than angry. His design has already been through numerous consultations with multiple stakeholders. While he respects the need for democratic debate, he insists there is no other suitable location for the toilets. As for the transformers, if he had placed them away from the central median and closer to the shops and pavements, the shopkeepers would have been up in arms.“They would have objected. It’s also a safety hazard. Transformers have caught fire in the area. We have to keep them away from the shops and sidewalks,” he says. “Moreover, this is not a conservation project. It is not conserving a monument like the Taj Mahal. This is about re-developing a living street where people live and work. You have to strike a balance between heritage and their needs.”Sachdeva hopes the high court judge will let the scheme proceed. “People here have been waiting a long time for this transformation,” he adds. “We can’t disappoint them.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a3cb43032f8eee5b54fb0b24b4193dfa7cc3b09/0_195_4288_2573/master/4288.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c78332aa38d7fd90f272e41738b2c9c3","title":"roaming cafes and pirate boats readers favourite floating traders","story":"We asked you to recommend canal boat shops, and you did not disappointFrom home brew kits to pirate-themed gifts, when we asked for your favourite canal boat shops, you certainly gave us variety. Lisa Ashwood told us about a floating sweetshop that she was thrilled to discover near the end of a long, tiring run from Buxton to her home village. “We were all flagging and the sudden discovery of a sweetshop canal boat was just too exciting,” she says.Few things symbolise the way our cities have transformed more than canals. Around the world, cities have woken up to the power of their urban waterways: from Milan to Manchester, the former economic arteries of industry are being turned into corridors for walkers, boaters and wildlife. Cafes and restaurants are proliferating and canalside living is newly chic – and newly costly.\u0026nbspAs commercial interests muscle in on the last great undeveloped bit of Britain’s cities,  Cities and the Observer wanted to take stock of a crucial moment in history, when we still have a choice: whether to turn canals into sanitised enclaves of wealth, or preserve them as a precious resource for all.Kevin Hall told us about a boat that sells Staffordshire oatcakes filled with cheese and bacon, which is often moored near Stoke City’s Bet365 football stadium on match days. And several of you got in touch with glowing endorsements of Sam Skinner’s floating bike repair service (a photo of which we included in our original callout). Here are a selection of your responses:“My favourite boat traders are without doubt the Home Brew Boat. They sell all sorts of home brew equipment and are responsible for getting my husband into home brewing. They continuously cruise, mainly in the north-west and Midlands but have a thriving mail order part to their business and Barry is always happy to answer questions or have his expertise tapped.“We love it when we are in their vicinity. Barry and Sandra are such engaging and enthusiastic proprietors that passing the time of day with them is always enjoyable and often leads to us buying yet more home brew stuff. When our supplies run low and we are not nearby we make use of mail order. As a sideline they sell Barry’s greetings cards which are printed with fabulous photos he’s taken (he was a professional photographer for 30 years before taking to the canals).” Helen Tidy, Aldridge“Cake on the Cut is run by Sam Keay on a narrowboat called Squox and Botter. Not only is it a fantastic cafe boat selling lots of yummy cakes and treats, she makes and sells Gangplank Spirits and Preserves which are produced with foraged fruit and herbs. Super tasty! A friendly trader with a very unusual paint job on her narrowboat – both sides are different and depict scenes of nature. She always sets up her roaming cafe with lots of cute tables, chairs, flowers and sometimes hammocks.” Katie lives on a narrowboat in Hertfordshire“The Pirate Boat sells various items, which all have a pirate theme. The last time we visited it was also selling ice cream and hot drinks. My kids absolutely love visiting this boat – the owner is a real character, she dresses like a pirate and interacts with everyone. My little boy was ecstatic when she handed him an inflatable sword and proceeded to have a play sword fight with him.” Anonymous“My favourite narrowboat is based on the Upper Peak Forest canal (and seen on the Macclesfield canal and also the Middlewich to Macclesfield stretch of the Trent and Mersey canal). The boat is called Andechs and an online music school is run from on board. They offer a huge range of live online instrumental music lessons provided by their music teachers who are based all over the world. I love the idea of their use of the latest technology from what was once the latest technology over 200 years ago, when the canals were built for very different commercial use.” Richard Foster, New Mills, Derbyshire“Hekla was in Watford last week, Mile End market this week, and who knows where next week. They’re a very nice couple selling very nice pictures and a very good book all round the network. They embody the spirit of the canals, using the system as it should be, travelling round making and selling stuff, with a friendly face taking your money off you.” John Williamson“Colin and Carole Warring from the Wool Boat sell commercial and indie yarn and dyed yarn, and are generally all round good eggs. In a pretty competitive market they endeavour to bring people together. Their boat reaches people who knit in far-flung communities and they champion English wool.” Cathy Wright, Ormskirk“Floating repairs is a mystical mechanical trip of bicycle bliss with long-legged Sammy making frames soldered in heaven. Makes a good cuppa too while you’re waiting for your ride to be repaired.” Imogen“The Oakcake boat is on the Trent and Mersey canal, opposite a local wildlife area known as Westport Lake. It serves fabulous Staffordshire oatcakes filled with cheese and bacon, plus tea and coffee. This place is a local institution and is very popular along this stretch of the canal. Also moors near Stoke City’s Bet365 stadium on match days. It serves the best oatcakes, our local delicacy that resembles a pancake but is made with oatmeal and is savoury rather than sweet.

I see no sign that you and your office have grasped the seriousness of what is happening, let alone devised or begun to execute a strategy to respond and defeat it. Whatever the denials, Johnson has embarked on a crash and burn strategy deliberately aimed at creating the circumstances for a general election – setting up the EU, parliament and the civil service, in a grotesque perversion of the truth, as the reasons he has no option but to call one.He rightly fears that if the people were given a straight choice in a referendum, “no deal v no Brexit”, no Brexit would win comfortably. But Johnson is confident that in an election choice between him and you he would win, and so get the mandate for the hardest form of Brexit he would otherwise not legitimately be able to claim. It means we could be weeks from an election in which, on any current analysis, you are unlikely to be in a position to win a majority.The future of the country is a million times more important than my membership of the Labour party. But the above situation has developed at a time this has been the subject of some public debate, as well as intense personal reflection.Having spent several weeks trying without success to have explained to me the process under which I was expelled for voting Liberal Democrat in the European elections, I finally informed the party I felt I had no option but to start proceedings. I was recently told that my case had been discussed with senior members of your team and that they saw two ways it might be addressed: 1. By a suspension of my auto-exclusion under cover of the broader possible review of the whole auto-exclusion system in relation to antisemitism and other offences. 2. That I make some kind of public commitment to voting Labour at the next election. On the first, I was not asking for a suspension of my exclusion, but a reversal. On the second, while with the one exception that led to my expulsion I have voted Labour in every election in my life and would prefer to do so for the rest of my days, I did not feel comfortable about making a blanket commitment when politics is in such flux, and my concern about your stance on Brexit still acute.With the distance provided by my being away from the UK in Australia, I have reflected deeply on all of the above. And, with some sadness but absolute certainty, I have reached the conclusion that I no longer wish to stay in the party, even if I should be successful in my appeal or legal challenge.The culture you have helped to create has made the party one that I feel no longer truly represents my values, or the hopes I have for Britain. I see no strategy in place that remotely meets the electoral or policy challenges ahead. On the contrary, in so far as I ascertain a strategy at all, it is one that looks more designed to lose.I fear the country may already have decided that it does not intend to make you prime minister. I do not blame you for Brexit and the mess the UK is in. David Cameron and Theresa May, Boris Johnson and Michael Gove, Nigel Farage, and the UK media, they are all ahead of you in the queue on that one. But I do believe your half-hearted approach to the referendum campaign three years ago had a role in leave winning. Your failure to provide consistent leadership on the issue since then has been a huge disappointment. I do not know at this stage how I will vote at the next election, and I have made this decision after discussing it with nobody apart from family and a small number of close personal friends. It is not part of some bigger plan but a deeply personal decision. What I do know is that this is indeed a moment of real peril. To have any chance of stopping Johnson and stopping a hard Brexit, you need to step up now, and signal leadership of the anti-Brexit, anti-populist cause – though it may be that loss of trust in your approach to Brexit means it is too late to win back many former supporters. I have in the past, in various troubled eras for our party, always argued that it is better to stay and fight from the inside. My fear right now is that without real change, there will be nothing left to fight for, and that your place in history will be as the leader who destroyed Labour as a serious political force capable of winning power. With a government this bad, pursuing a ruinous form of Brexit that will so damage our economy, society and standing in the world, Labour should be poised to win an election.If the public could see that clear, credible and coherent alternative across the despatch box, ably led, we would be. That the country does not see it is, I am afraid, very substantially down to you. I hope that one day I will rejoin a party that genuinely appeals to the many not the few, that can win again the kind of majority needed to improve the life chances of those who will be damaged by Brexit. In the meantime, please, for the sake of the party and especially for the sake of the country, think beyond the messenger, and think seriously about the message.• Alastair Campbell was Tony Blair’s director of communications this is an edited version of an article written for The New European"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/489da9df889c4702ecabdb803b7080f1c674aba1/0_111_5652_3392/master/5652.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cb48be81bee39cfb1f08fff337d65f21","title":"china economic hong kong carrie lam","story":"After another weekend of violent clashes between protesters and police, Hong Kong held its collective breath on Monday afternoon as the Chinese state council’s Hong Kong and Macau affairs office – the cabinet-level office with responsibility for Hong Kong policy – held a press conference to give its views on the “Hong Kong problem”.With official state media over the past week ramping up reports of “extremist elements” and foreign “black hands”, and senior establishment figures openly referring to the possibility of the People’s Liberation Army being deployed, Hong Kongers were braced for potentially paradigm-shifting news. It seemed almost anything was possible, from the resignation of the unpopular incumbent chief executive, Carrie Lam, to the imposition of a curfew to PLA troops on the streets of Hong Kong.As expected, the office’s spokesman Yang Guang expressed support for Lam and her administration, decried the use of violence by protesters, and insisted that Hong Kong’s rule of law should be upheld. But, as with so many messages in China, it was the unspoken that rang loudest.To begin with, Yang acknowledged the peaceful protests that had been held in opposition to Lam’s extradition bill, and further acknowledged that Lam had suspended work on the bill as a result. This in itself was remarkable: it would seem anathema to Beijing to publicly recognise the fact and effectiveness of political protest in Hong Kong, when such a possibility is unthinkable in the mainland.Second, while Yang unsurprisingly expressed support for Lam and her administration, his comments contained veiled criticism. Yang said that there had been “deficiencies” in the way Lam’s administration handled the extradition bill, leading the council to “reflect” upon its governing style. In China, where leaders are universally regarded as infallible (until, that is, they very publicly fall from grace) this is an extremely harsh statement. It also has some historical resonance: following similar mass demonstrations in Hong Kong, then-president Hu Jintao famously advised Hong Kong’s inaugural chief executive Tung Chee-hwa to “identify his deficiencies” in a December 2004 public appearance. By the following March, Tung had resigned, citing ill health. Today’s thinly veiled criticism does not bode well for the longevity of Lam’s administration.The focus in Yang’s prepared remarks on upholding Hong Kong’s rule of law, and severely punishing those who have engaged in acts of violence, was clearly intended for consumption by an international audience for whom Hong Kong’s rule of law is seen as a core value. But alongside this statement, Yang also expressed support for Hong Kong’s police force in its mission of upholding the law. This was a clear indication from Beijing that it has no intention of involving the PLA, however it also signalled Beijing’s assent to the Hong Kong police adopting harsher policing tactics. It is perhaps no coincidence that police also announced today that they would begin road tests this week for three powerful new riot control water cannon vehicles, with a view to deploying them on Hong Kong’s streets by mid-August.Also surprising, given recent rhetoric, was that the malign influence of “foreign forces” did not receive more airtime. Indeed, foreign influence was not addressed in Yang’s initial prepared remarks, and was only raised in a question from official state news agency Xinhua. While Yang did criticise foreign politicians, who he said wanted to make Hong Kong into a “problem” for China, there were no references to “colour revolutions” or ”black hands”, a welcome dialling-back on recent hysteria. This suggests that those in the highest levels of government in Beijing regard this, quite correctly, as a purely domestic problem for Hong Kong. Unfortunately, they seem to continue to be looking to blame it on the wrong targets. Affairs office spokeswoman Xu Luying, speaking of social problems in Hong Kong, focused on economic issues such as youth opportunity, social mobility and housing affordability. This holds out hope that Beijing intends to work with the Hong Kong government and, perhaps more importantly, Hong Kong’s all-powerful tycoons in addressing housing prices and other business and economic issues.However, while these indeed contribute to discontent in Hong Kong, Beijing would be sorely mistaken to believe this to be the root cause. The real motivation bringing Hong Kong people out on to the streets every weekend can be heard in the slogans they now chant: “Democracy now!” and “Reclaim Hong Kong! Revolution of our times!”The extradition bill that originally motivated the present protest movement and the livelihood issues Beijing is targeting are merely symptomatic of what Hong Kong’s protesters see as the underlying cause: Hong Kong’s undemocratic system, under which the people are governed by a government beholden to Beijing and accountable to Hong Kong’s tycoon class, and not governing in the interests of the people. Until democratic reforms are introduced, the protesters believe, Hong Kong will not see meaningful change.With no policy initiatives or specific measures coming out of today’s announcements, one thing is certain: protests in Hong Kong will continue. If Beijing does not realise that it will take more than economic fixes to bring an end to the current crisis, the cycle of protest and crackdown seems likely only to intensify.• Antony Dapiran is a Hong Kong-based writer and lawyer and the author of City of Protest: A Recent History of Dissent in Hong Kong"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bff07d3bd1aae370791acf4211334d9e893838c2/288_48_4032_2420/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da5125c4836f1914e842994f1eeb1664","title":"dont worry prime minister women have got your message loud and clear","story":"We saw it.

He later said he thought she might have been armed.There needs to be no further investigation into Field’s behaviour, according to our new prime minister. The case has been dropped.

With rolling foothills, vast cattle grounds, and sunsets that’ll stop you in your tracks, experience the cowboy lifestyle at one of the numerous working and guest ranches in the region. Saddle up for some cattle driving, help with daily chores, try your hand at horseshoe tossing, or opt for one of the more hotel-like guest ranches, with experiences such as horseback camping trips or even spa services on offer. Either way, you’re guaranteed a warm welcome, a break from the fast-pace of modern life, and an unforgettable stay. There are even half-day horse rides if you’re worried about being saddle sore.Mountain bike in Whistler, British ColumbiaPerfect for: thrill-seekersThe Whistler Blackcomb resort may be known as one of North America’s top skiing destinations, but when spring arrives and the snow melts, it transforms into something else: a playground for downhill mountain biking. Whistler Mountain Bike Park is accessible from Whistler Village by chairlift from mid-May to mid-October, and although the network of trails – ning 50 miles and 1,500 vertical metres (4,900 feet) – may seem daunting, the technical, tighter runs are balanced with smoother toboggan-like beginner zones, meaning you don’t have to be a pro to take on this adrenaline kick of an experience. It’s best to experience the trails yourself in June and September. When you’ve had your fill of two wheels, then enjoy a glass of wine in one of Canada’s largest wine regions.Celebrate Canada Day in Ottawa, OntarioPerfect for: fans of live musicWhere better to celebrate Canada Day than the country’s capital, Ottawa? Settle in at various spots around the city – Confederation Boulevard, Major’s Hill Park or the Ottawa River – and enjoy a full line-up of entertainment, including an air show courtesy of the Canadian armed forces, musical performances from the likes of the National Arts Centre Orchestra, followed by a fireworks display that’s sure to inspire Canadian pride, no matter where you’re from. There’s also free entry to national museums and art galleries.Explore the lakes of OntarioPerfect for: unwinding in the sunWhen the Canadian summer hits, Ontario cottage country is the place to be. Think lazy days gazing out at picture-perfect views, jumping off docks into the cool waters of crystal-clear lakes, boat cruises, kayaking, barbecues out on the deck, and above all, unwinding to the point of total relaxation. Among the many canoeing opportunities, paddling a voyager canoe on the Mattawa River stands out. Pretend you’re a fur trader by joining guides in a 30-foot craft, with the option to visit Talon Chute waterfall. Visiting Ontario is an experience you’ll want to return to again and again. With a wide choice of resorts available, you can ensure a unique stay every time, too.Go on a polar bear safari in Manitoba (and see the northern lights)Perfect for: adventurous animal-loversForget the Big Five – you’re in Canada now, and safari means one thing: polar bears. To see them in the wild you’ll need to head to Churchill, Manitoba – a region perfectly placed for spotting the iconic (and endangered) white bears in their natural environment, as they wait on the shore for the Hudson Bay freeze before heading out to hunt for seals. Several tour operators offer excursions in adapted vehicles out into the Arctic tundra, with one-day trips or longer expeditions available. It’s not just polar bears that make this a once-in-a-lifetime trip either, because Churchill is also one of the best places in the world to see the northern lights. A two-for-one deal, if you will.Spend a night at the Hotel de Glace in QuebecPerfect for: stepping out of your comfort zoneDrive a few hours out of the historic Quebec city and you’ll find a hotel that’s a little on the chilly side of things. Why? Because it’s made out of ice. You’ll need to time your stay within a very specific window though: Hôtel de Glace is constructed in January and melts away in March each year. Because, you know, ice. With 44 rooms, a chapel, ice bar and even slides, this construction is a work of art and engineering as well as a place to rest your head (day visitors also welcome). Don’t worry about freezing in your sleep either – while the various sofas, chairs and tables are carved out of ice, beds feature soft (and warm!) mattresses, with duvets to boot.Catch and eat lobster in Atlantic CanadaPerfect for: foodiesWhen it comes to Nova Scotia, it doesn’t get more authentic than heading out into the waters of the North Atlantic with an experienced fisherman to catch your own lobster, before enjoying an on-board seafood boil. If fishing isn’t your thing, you can still enjoy the rewards without the work – especially if you’re planning to visit in February, which sees Nova Scotia’s South Shore Lobster Crawl festival take place along the shore each year. A lobster-lover’s dream, it includes an abundance of events, including the best lobster roll challenge. Yum.Visit Iceberg Alley on the Newfoundland coastPerfect for: lovers of the natural worldFerryland, an hour south of St John’s, Newfoundland, made headlines in 2017 thanks to a rather unique neighbour, in the form of a giant iceberg. The town is located right on a part of Canada’s east coast known as Iceberg Alley, so-called because hundreds of icebergs that break off in the Arctic float down past the Newfoundland and Labrador from spring to September. And while the behemoth that took up residence on Ferryland’s doorstep was a particularly large example, you can spot these 10,000-year-old glacial giants from many viewing points along the northern and eastern coasts of this province, by boat tour or kayak. You can even track them online.Walk on the ocean floor in the Bay of FundyPerfect for: intrepid explorersFancy going for a walk? How about a stroll along the actual ocean floor? It may sound out-of-this-world, but that doesn’t mean it’s not possible – because in the Bay of Fundy, which lies between the provinces of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, you can do just that. It’s all thanks to the unusual variance between low and high tide in the bay, which can exceed 15 metres. At low tide, the ocean floor at the head of the bay is exposed for around three hours, with towering cliffs and sea stacks creating a surreal backdrop to seafloor exploration – which often yields the discovery of fossils, sea glass, and semi-precious stones. Then visit a few hours later to see how fast the water returns.Fly WestJet from London to Canada’s capital cities and have your own Canadian adventure"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d27db2ed4dbdc2ca8591745ea053df89e9fce7b/0_300_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e881a855aa340d25a1e6f3d32072cb60","title":"only in canada weird and wonderful experiences countrywide","story":"Want to track down the mythical Ogopogo, ice-skate on the Atlantic Ocean or get your hands on a polar bear-shaped number plate?

We can thank Canadian institution Tim Hortons for the doughnut obsession. The shop, founded by the NHL defenseman of the same name, opened in 1964 and became a million-dollar-a-year franchise, outselling most (if not all) fast-food chains. If you’re feeling nostalgic, visit the original in Hamilton, Ontario or take a trip to independent doughnut chain, Donut Monster, also in the city, where yeast-risen rounds are topped with seasonal flavours. Our favourite to date has to be the brownie cheesecake! But if you’re not in Ontario, check out Lucky’s Doughnuts at the 49th Parallel Café in BC or family-owned business, Bronuts in Winnipeg. They use natural ingredients and have been known to offer unique flavours such as roasted garlic and asiago cheese or rosemary and lavender. We have to wonder what Homer Simpson would order!Want a polar bear-shaped number plate? You’ll have to move to, or at least visit, the Northwest Territories to make it happenIn Canada’s Northwest Territories, polar bears abound – in the form of number plates. In 1970, to celebrate the centennial of Northwest Territories, the government introduced a number plate shaped like a polar bear. Sure, some may have thought it was unusual at first. But since then, many have become delighted and wanted one for themselves. Pro tip: we’ve seen some vintage plates sold on eBay.If you want to branch out into road signs, then there are more than 77,000 to be seen at Watson Lake Signpost Forest. Travellers have been bringing signposts from their hometowns since 1942 and you can carry on that tradition with one of your own.Ogopogo is a mythical monster similar to the Loch Ness monster that supposedly lives in Lake Okanagan, British ColumbiaDo you believe in folklore and mystery? Well then, listen up because we have a tale for you. Legend has it that Ogopogo inhabits Lake Okanagan in the BC interior. This creature has been described as a “giant snake” about 50 feet long, lurking in the dark expanse of the lake. While there have been sightings dating as far back as the 19th century, the most recent was in September 2018. From the lake, drive to the Okanagan Spirits Craft Distillery to learn a bit more about western Canada’s oldest craft distillery, and take a whisky tour. Alternatively, check out one of the latest local theatre shows at the Caravan Farm Theatre under the stars. Located on a 32-hectare (80-acre) farm, it’s a hidden treasure and one of the best ways to support local artists. If you want to see if you can sneak a peek of Ogopogo, why not try scuba ing at Fintry provincial park? It also houses a sunken Canadian Pacific Railway barge, should you not get lucky with the monster.Did you know that Santa Claus had a legitimate postal address?

Get yourself to Churchill, ManitobaIf there is one thing you need to know, it’s that Churchill, Manitoba, is known for its abundance of Canadian wildlife. Many belugas migrate through Hudson Bay in the months of July and August, when tens of thousands pass through the area. Thanks to Sea North Tours, you’ll be able to have the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to hear belugas singing through hydrophones – you can listen to their whistles and squeals while observing their majestic beauty from boats that have no moving parts that can harm the whales.The province where Anne of Green Gables was set, Prince Edward Island is just 140 miles long and 35 miles wideFun fact: as one of Canada’s three Maritime provinces, Prince Edward Island is the smallest. Not only can it lay claim to being the smallest in land area, but also in population of the three. The province, however, takes it in its stride, with the motto being “Parva sub ingenti” (The small under the protection of the great). There are few places more unusual than Basin Head provincial park, which is perhaps better known as Singing Sands, because the pure white sands do just that. Due to the high silica content, when heated by the sun, the sand produces a high-pitched squeaking sound when walked across – and endless fun.For a period of time, Canada suffered a shortage of coins. So, while they worked to produce more, playing cards were used as currencyIn the late 1600s, coins arriving from France were in short supply. This meant that as Canada worked hard to get more currency in, playing cards took the place of coins to keep the economy going. The Royal Canadian Mint made a nod to this in 2018 by releasing a special-edition coin set fashioned in the likeness of 17th-century playing cards.Fly WestJet to discover (and enjoy!) the weird and the wonderful things in Canada"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a81d4093f971aa8861ef4a2a21fe79c0c779ff63/778_711_4344_2607/master/4344.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=797ba3ae7098c3768e9dae8aa5709ef1","title":"how to make the most of montreal a locals guide","story":"Music festivals, decadent food and old-world architecture make Canada’s second-largest city, in the French-speaking province of Quebec, a must to explore. Local Heather Vandenengel gives her recommendations for MontrealStarting from the first decently warm day of spring, green spaces across the city fill up with picnickers, pétanque players, and hammockers. Huge murals from world-renowned street artists are splashed up and down Boulevard Saint-Laurent every June, while Place des Festivals lights up with glowing, interactive art installations in winter and musical swings in summer. And of course, there’s the year-round smattering of festivals, highlighting everything from documentary films to up-and-coming music acts to stand-up comedy. The best way to get to know Montreal’s energy and charm is on foot or by bike (if it’s above freezing, at least), winding through its neighbourhoods and streets.“Montreal is great for biking! It’s a great way to explore beyond the mains, to find hidden gems, see the green alleyways, and hop from one neighbourhood to another.” Anne-Marie Pellerin, @am.pellerin, co-founder, Spade \u0026amp Palacio toursDowntown and Old MontrealDowntown is the perfect starting point to discover the traditions and architecture of this vibrant city. And while Old Montreal, with its cobblestone streets and 17th- and 18th-century buildings, evokes the city’s old-world charm, the area has also gained a hipper edge in recent years, thanks to additions such as Lov, a chic, creative vegan and vegetarian restaurant, and Unibar, a tucked-away classic burger spot specialising in natural wines. The Old Port area, overlooking the St Lawrence River, is also an outdoor event hotspot, home to poutine fests, winter electronic music events, and views of summer fireworks.“Poutine is our dish, we’re known worldwide for it. I like the Orange Julep, it’s an iconic landmark in Montreal and their poutine is really exceptional. La Banquise is open 24 hours, but it doesn’t matter what time of the day you go, there’s always a line-up.” Eric Branover, @ericbranover, photographerThe sprawling downtown includes major cultural venues such as the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts and Musée d’art contemporain de Montréal (Mac), both of which offer discounted admission on Wednesday nights and the chance to rub shoulders with locals. You can dig into dumplings, hand-pulled noodles, or Mongolian hotpot in the city’s original Chinatown, marked by ornate paifang gates, or explore the smattering of small, often-packed restaurants in the city’s “Second Chinatown” around Concordia University.

But it has radical plans to pull in the deprived communities to the south and east: starting with a campus on what its management calls “the wrong side of the tracks”.The university was one of the first to introduce “contextual offers” – lower grade requirements to students from a list of schools – back in 2009. Now it wants to go further by introducing flexible courses designed to appeal to people in deprived local districts, even if they haven’t performed well at school.The new Temple Quarter campus will be built on the urban east side of Bristol Temple Meads station, on the site of a well-known local eyesore– a post sorting office that had lain derelict for 20 years. “People on that side of the city don’t have access to the city centre, and many kids will grow up never going there,” says Orpen. “Transport is fragmented and poor. Many young people don’t have a sixth form they can get to. It is just a few miles away from us in the west of the city but it is a different world.”Bristol was the first university to announce plans to expand significantly when the government removed the recruitment cap in 2015. The new campus, which will house 3,000 students, represents a second big expansion. It will be eyed with trepidation by other nearby universities that already accept students – and their £9,250 a year fees – with lower grades.Joanna Holmes, CEO of the Barton Hill Settlement, a community centre offering services from legal advice to bringing people together for barbecues, says that over in Clifton the university is unreachable in more ways than one. “It is symbolically posh,” she says. “This new campus feels like the university coming down the hill to the rest of us.”Holmes’s settlement was actually set up by the university in 1911. The idea then was that Bristol staff and students would live there and spread enlightenment: it was a radically liberal community, supporting campaigns such as votes for women and feeding the families of local workers when they went on strike. But the relationship dwindled and the university hasn’t had anything to do with Barton Hill since the 1970s.That is all about to change. In addition to the new campus, due to open in 2022, the university is planning a “micro-campus” in brightly painted shipping containers within the Barton Hill settlement for people who still find the whole idea of university a step too far.It will have three containers in which to teach its students. Upstairs will be tiny bedsits for people who want to study but need a place with a stable low rent, or time away from complicated situations at home, to make that possible.Holmes says people in her community aren’t short of aspirations. “A lot of our families have two adults working three jobs between them working all hours of the day and night. They get basic qualifications and then drop out of the system because there is nothing that fits their lives. It makes it hard to break out,” she says.“We are saying to local mums, ‘Don’t just do as many cleaning jobs as you can so your kids can go to university. You can go too.’”Tom Sperlinger, professor of literature and engaged pedagogy at Bristol, has been tasked with finding ways of pulling people from deprived communities such as Barton Hill and Hartcliffe into the new Temple Quarter campus. He is working on a business case for a new flexible degree for local people. The plan is that you could take a short course in one of the Barton Hill shipping containers – or in the local library in Hartcliffe – and get 30 credits that count towards a degree.“If you do that in your local library and find it’s achievable and not all that scary, it maybe seems less scary to think about going to the main campus,” he says.Bristol has already experimented with access courses, which are not common in Russell Group universities. Ninety per cent of students on its year-long foundation programme in the arts and humanities don’t have A-levels – and the university says three-quarters of them go on to study a degree at Bristol or elsewhere. The course is publicised widely in local media and the university runs taster courses with community organisations, including Bristol Refugee Rights and the Single Parent Action Network.Myla Lloyd was part of the first year of this foundation course in 2013 and now works for a local MP. “I got good results in my GCSEs, but my Dad passed away and that started a trajectory where everything was knocked off course for me,” she says.She left home at 17 with no A-levels and worked mainly in coffee shops until she started the foundation course at 21, going on to gain a first-class degree in history of art at the university and says the foundation course changed her life.Lloyd hopes Bristol’s new project will open up the university to local people who have found themselves shut out from education. “The university is this big fancy building and it must seem very far removed if you live on an estate in Hartcliffe,” she says. “People often can’t even afford a bus ticket to get into the centre. And if you haven’t ever been to a youth centre, let alone a museum, why would it occur to you to go to university?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf6f2054baaa38512a1ab17b737b369fc0e72fc6/0_468_6091_3655/master/6091.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9884dd3d3798a415f1be8a310762bd7c","title":"patrick starrr its not out of vanity that i wear these outfits","story":"The YouTube makeup artist on the alicious rhinestone outfit he wore for his first Mac campaign and using fashion to break down gender stereotypesThis is the outfit I wore for my first Mac campaign in 2017 – it was fully rhinestone, head to toe. It was a memorable look for me because I bought all the material, all the stones and all the accessories for it and had it made by a drag queen. It weighed 60lb – so it was like having another little person on me extremely heavy, but just so beautiful.Having previously worked on a Mac counter, I never in my wildest dreams thought I would be in a campaign. I wanted to wear the most alicious outfit I could so that I stood out. Because I’m plus size, I prefer to design my own outfits and collaborate with designers. When I started losing my hair, I began wearing head-wraps and then turbans, which I like to have match the rest of my look. I also work with my hair stylist to craft the turbans – it’s beautiful when it all comes together. I find inspiration on Pinterest, watch fashion shows on YouTube and then I put my own twist in it that will flatter my body.I don’t always wear bespoke items: I love Asos, I love Forever 21, I love River Island – but it’s often really hard for me to find clothes that fit. My shoes are from Maya Shoes of Hollywood, which stocks shoes for drag queens and actors … Lady Gaga buys her shoes there, too. It’s my secret weapon.It’s not out of vanity that I wear these outfits – it’s important for me to represent a community. I had an actor approach me with his daughter, who was about four years old, on the red carpet recently. She was just like: “Wow, I like your dress!” I thought it was cool that someone so young could admire a 29-year-old, plus-size Filipino in a dress at a Disney premiere.I use fashion to break down gender stereotypes because I still identify as male. It was hard for me – I used to always wear trousers and I worried about breaking away from that from a branding standpoint. But then I just thought: why not just wear what I want and be the glamazon that I want to be?

You have the perfect profile.” Almost two decades later his then-Arsenal teammate’s prophecy has been proved right. Edu has returned to the club as technical director tasked with restoring the success he enjoyed there as a player, including as a member of 2003-04’s Invincibles.Edu may not be a manager in the traditional English sense but his management and executive skills have earned him three technical director roles since he gave up playing. The midfielder retired while with Corinthians in December 2010 and three months later received an unexpected invitation to take that position at the Brazilian club.“He didn’t know what to do after he stopped playing football,” says Duílio Monteiro Alves, one of the directors who invited Edu to work for the São Paulo side. “However, he had all the qualities to become a great director. He is very different: polite, speaks many languages and has great experience in Europe. It was the best choice.”The first months were testing, though. Corinthians had great players such as Ronaldo and Roberto Carlos but had been eliminated from the Copa Libertadores a month earlier after a painful defeat by the Colombian club Tolima. One of his first aims was to restore calm to the dressing room and explain to the squad how he would operate.“When he took over he was very clear,” recalls Chicão, the club’s former defender and captain. “He said that he was a director but he would remain a friend to the players, that he would work hard to bring peace to our team. We couldn’t bring these problems on to the pitch. He promised this and did it.”Edu formed a great partnership with the coach, Tite. Together they won the Copa Libertadores, Brazilian championship, Club World Cup, Paulista championship and the Recopa. It earned the pair promotion to the national team in 2016, working alongside Sylvinho, a former colleague of Edu’s at Arsenal, and Matheus Bachi, Tite’s son.“Edu knows how to delegate roles,” says Bachi. “The first time I worked with him he asked me to write a report. I did it very well and from then I earned his trust. We were a team. We had a staff to analyse any potential talents for Corinthians. He read the reports, studied all the players and then gave a list to Tite to decide who to sign. Everyone had their input into the decision.”Mauri Lima, a Corinthians goalkeeper coach under Edu, was also impressed. “He was the best at organising everything in the background and creating a good atmosphere for our players to shine. When he won the Club World Cup in 2012 with Corinthians I called him to congratulate him on his amazing work. At Corinthians we worked together for six years. He oversaw a revolution. I’ve never seen a bad relationship between him and any coach. He has the confidence of the president, players and all members of staff.”When Edu left Corinthians to take up the role with Brazil, he was criticised by Andrés Sanchez, the club’s president. Sanchez, when questioned by the Observer about his stance, says: “I don’t talk about him. Let him be happy.”The friendship ended when Edu’s new job was announced a few days after he had denied he was negotiating a deal with the Brazilian football federation, the CBF.As a coordinator for the CBF, Edu was less successful. Brazil’s youth teams underperformed, eliminated early in the South American Under-17 and Under-20 championships in 2019 despite being full of talented prospects. Two years ago the Under-20s failed to qualify for the World Cup. Before Edu the youth teams could call on three technical scouts, whereas now there is one professional. For one year under his control the Under-20s did not have a coach.For the senior team the problems started with the organisation for the 2018 World Cup. Selecting Brazil’s training base in Sochi created a problem because of the long distances to each match. During the group stage Brazil clocked up 7,000km, more than three times that of Argentina.Edu was widely criticised for seeming to pander to their star player, Neymar. At the end of the World Cup Edu said: “It isn’t easy to be Neymar. It’s very hard. He is a little boy. Sorry, he is an athlete. He is an athlete that deserves my praise.” He added: “I feel pity for him in some moments, because what this boy suffers isn’t easy.”Rogério Caboclo, the CBF president, lost confidence in Edu and the switch to Arsenal was timely for both parties. To many the challenge for Edu at the Emirates is harder than at Corinthians and with Brazil, because of the state of the Premier League club. For the third year in a row Arsenal have failed to qualify for the Champions League and they conspicuously lack the financial power of rivals.Yet in Edu’s native Brazil there are key figures in the game who believe he can help create an environment to improve Arsenal. The former Corinthians president Roberto de Andrade says: “Edu knows the business very well, the game and everything around it. I think he can do something different. In Brazil it’s harder than working in England. Like Arsenal we didn’t have so much money and he helped us to form a great team.”Gilberto agrees but calls for patience. “It’s worrying when you can’t compete with other clubs for good players but Arsenal need to sign around three or four players,” he says. “A big difference from the national team, he will now face daily pressure. You play every week and you are tested every day. But little by little he will adapt.”Edu’s appointment has the approval of Arsène Wenger, and Gilberto sees similarities with his former manager. “Arsène doesn’t like to rush decisions. He had his own style, he took care of everything. All was very measured, despite having so many things to consider. I see the same in Edu. He is very careful and calculates every step. I think he will have success at Arsenal.”The job reunites Edu with Unai Emery, the pair having worked together at Valencia in 2008-09. The club then had David Villa, David Silva, Marchena and Raúl Albiol but Edu was one of the most important voices. “He is a real leader,” says the former Valencia goalkeeper Renan. “Because of his history and daily attitude, he has that impact .”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14cbd4b7e3e58e67e7d0aed4ca3c67d7d30edebc/1019_1558_3590_2154/master/3590.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4a61d9b89ecf467580b78b34717161d2","title":"everton agree deal sign moise kean juventus italy","story":"Everton have concluded a deal with Juventus to sign Moise Kean for an initial €32m (£29m) and the forward is due to fly to England on Wednesday to finalise the move.The signing of the 19-year-old Italy international would be a significant coup for Everton, who have also sold the midfielder Idrissa Gueye to Paris Saint-Germain for a fee understood to be €32m.Everton could end up spending €40m on Kean with add-ons and have agreed to pay him £2.75m a year. Juventus had wanted a buy-back clause but instead they will be told of any bid so they can choose whether to match it. The player, who had one year remaining on his contract, scored six Serie A goals in 13 appearances last season and has played three times for Italy.Marco Silva had hoped to keep Gueye at Goodison Park this season but the player was determined to join the French champions. “I wanted to give a new boost to my club career by joining Paris St-Germain, one of the most structured and ambitious sports projects in Europe,” Gueye told his new club’s website.Everton have made a substantial profit on the 29-year-old Gueye, who signed from Aston Villa for £8m in 2016.

In the weeks after the graffiti, which depicted Bruno as a king, the Spaniard retired with his status as a cult hero intact and the manager Chris Hughton was sacked and replaced by Graham Potter. Since then Anthony Knockaert, a catalyst in the team’s promotion two years ago, has departed on loan. But there is calm at Brighton, a feeling that such change represents evolution rather than revolution.Whether it was second-season syndrome, the way things had gone stale, the sense of predictability that seeped through a once-exciting team – or a bit of everything – Brighton felt they needed to freshen things up after nose-ing towards a Championship return after three wins from Hughton’s final 23 league matches. In Potter, who worked miracles at the Swedish club Östersund and, in many ways, at a financially hamstrung Swansea too, they have appointed one of the most exciting English coaches. “The job that was done here was a really good job,” Potter said. “We are now in a different phase, a different stage and everyone has been really supportive to that. But every coach, no matter who they are and what their beliefs are, would want to improve on the previous year. Now the task is to see if we can.”As for Bruno, who turns 39 in October, the former Valencia defender made 14 starts in his seventh and final campaign in Sussex and has assumed the role of senior development coach, which will see him act as a kind of middleman between the first team and staff, and as a mentor to the under-23s and loan players. Lewis Dunk, who is set to take the captaincy full time, has been persistently linked with a move from his hometown club this summer but Potter insists Dunk has been the consummate professional. “He has been top – he has been brilliant,” Potter said. “His attitude has been fantastic, he was the captain last year, he has taken that responsibility on and has grown as a person as a result of that and he has been nothing but exemplary in his work.”As much as Brighton were hardly flawless in defence last season – a 5-0 hammering at home by Bournemouth in April proved humbling, as did the defeat by Cardiff four days later – doing damage down the other end was a struggle. Brighton averaged less than a goal a game last season – Arsenal scored more than double their 35-goal tally – and only the three relegated sides managed fewer. Potter must address the over-reliance on Glenn Murray, who turns 36 in September. The strain on Murray, who scored 13 goals including four penalties last season, has been painfully clear for some time.Maybe that is where Potter, who developed Daniel James from an unwanted commodity at Shrewsbury Town to Manchester United’s first summer signing, comes in. Potter may have had little choice but to throw youth in at Swansea but Oli McBurnie, Connor Roberts and George Byers made impressive strides in a short time. At Brighton, not since Solly March eight years ago has an academy player made a notable dent in the first team.There are also £50m-worth of signings who have so far underwhelmed: José Izquierdo needs to turn flashes of brilliance into something more meaningful and Potter will hope to get more from Jürgen Locadia, Florin Andone and Alireza Jahanbakhsh, who has been freed from the overbearing title as the club’s record signingafter the £18m arrival of Leandro Trossard. Jahanbakhsh has yet to score and Locadia has three league goals in 18 months. Brighton’s lack of business suggests they trust Potter to nurture young blood and eke more out of a flatlining attack. As for the Belgian Trossard, who scored 17 goals for Genk last season, they are confident he will hit the ground running. “He’s a different type of wide man, not something that we’ve got already,” Potter said.The £4m signing of Matt Clarke, whom Potter trailed while at Swansea, is a classy defensive addition, with the former Portsmouth defender comfortable in the back-three system the head coach often utilised at previous clubs. The 22-year-old will compete with Shane Duffy and Dan Burn to partner Dunk in a defensive back four while Ben White, a highly rated centre-back who has spent time at Newport and Peterborough, has joined Leeds on loan. “Matt is open-minded and wants to learn,” Potter said. “He is a player with the attitude and character you would want. Matt has played a really big role with the demands of a big club in League One, trying to get out of the league. The challenge for him now is taking the next step.”Brighton are targeting the hallowed next step that has so far eluded them. Hughton namechecked Bournemouth and Burnley as blueprints to follow but, so far, the Seagulls’ thirst to improve has earned little reward. Their August schedule – a trip to Watford followed by home matches against West Ham and Southampton – will act as an early barometer of the strides they have made over the close season.“We are enjoying playing a little bit different,” said the midfielder Davy Pröpper. “The new coach has new ideas, he wants to know us and we want to know his style and way of playing. It is a little more possession-based for us we try to have a little bit more of the ball and try to find some patterns to create chances. We try to do much better than last year. I think the first year in the Premier League we did really well, everything was new and perhaps that helped us a little bit and last year we dropped a lot in the second half of the season. At the moment, it is a kind of new start.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbeba9df4dc7d55952eecd72daa269e975ea8ad5/47_61_2464_1479/master/2464.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=f7457376c55bcdbb169ecae96e4fcc9e","title":"my message is simple use the toilet tackling open defecation in nigeria","story":"Regular patrols are helping to ensure villagers in Kano state are practising good hygiene, to improve sanitation and cut diseaseWhen Nasiru Ibrahim goes on patrol around his village, he’s not looking out for criminal activities, or the usual community problems. Instead, Ibrahim is making sure people in Yammawar Kafawa, in northern Nigeria’s Kano state, are using toilets.Last October, the villagers agreed to stop defecating in fields, bushes and streets, and instead use the newly-built toilets, as part of the Nigerian government’s drive to end open defecation by 2025.“My message to our people is simple: use your toilets and make sure you wash your hands after,” said 36-year-old Ibrahim, who belongs to a community committee working to create awareness around good sanitation and encourage residents to use and build better latrines.The government has acknowledged the dire situation, with Muhammadu Buhari, the Nigerian president, declaring a state of emergency on water, sanitation and hygiene in November 2018. This was followed by a national campaign – Clean Nigeria: Use the Toilet – launched in April 2019 to jumpstart the implementation of a national action plan to reach the 2025 target.The government is working with the UN children’s agency, Unicef, the UK’s Department for International Development (DfID), the EU, and NGO WaterAid.Ibrahim, a father of six, admitted to practising open defecation until government officials visited the village and explained how the habit endangered health. The visit had an instant effect. Villagers worked as a group to improve sanitation and to encourage families to dig pit latrines. Now, anyone found defecating in the open faces a fine.Hand-pump boreholes were also dug with the support of Unicef and DfID to encourage people to wash their hands after going to the toilet, and villagers built a hand-washing site.In April, Yammawar Kafawa became open-defecation free, a status that state authorities are working to certify officially.Community-led projects like those in Yammawar Kafawa are proving effective elsewhere in Nigeria.A four-year evaluation of WaterAid schemes in 247 communities in Enugu and Ekiti states, by the London-based Institute of Fiscal Studies and Royal Holloway, University of London, found that community-led total sanitation programmes increased toilet ownership by 10 percentage points, and decreased open defecation by 9–10 percentage points.“Our evaluation of the Nigerian programme implies that resources can be used in a more efficient manner by targeting sanitation programmes at poorer rural areas where they are more likely to be effective,” they wrote. “Better targeting of sanitation policies such as CLTS (community-led total sanitation) should take into account the fact that there are no silver bullets and that these approaches may not be appropriate in all contexts.”However, only 13 of the 774 local government areas in Nigeria have been certified as being free of open defecation so far.“We need to take the message to the public, we need to take the message to communities, and to households, so people can buy into the campaign and own it,” said Bayo Ogunjobi, a water and sanitation specialist with Unicef Nigeria.Ogunjobi added that more money and better collaboration between the government and local communities were needed, as was better access to safe water and improved sanitation in markets, motor parks, highways, religious centres, schools, and health facilities.“From all I know, the government is putting important steps into place to improve their strategy and ensure financing for the same,” she said. “And this is important as I believe that business as usual, would not get them to meet their target.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/478b41eebc8dfa7bbc8effceffb0e3c849a60b24/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d0be8d4f8e133744ba53e8908d3dbc48","title":"opti vibrating foam roller im picking up good vibrations in all the wrong places","story":"It is hard to begin this week’s review, because I don’t know exactly what I am looking at. It resembles the trunk of a young palm tree, but is a nauseous yellow. Could it be an elephantine tube of calamari? Or a rotating spit of alien corn? Or a California roll made of rubber bogeys? It looks as if Shrek has attempted to treat some variety of ogre lupus by cutting off his forearm. You wouldn’t feel compelled to rub any of these on your body, but I discover, with a sense of lumbering, Boris-Johnson-like inevitability, that this is exactly what I must do.The USP is that it vibrates. Hard. When I switch on the dismembered croc leg, it starts shifting eerily across the floor. Occasionally turning over, mostly it slides laterally, as if a poltergeist cat is toying with it. It has LEDs that correspond to three strength settings, a mini USB port to charge and … that’s it. I like that it doesn’t tack on any extras: no app that tracks you via satellite no default connectivity that lets it post trash on your Facebook wall. It does what it says on the tin – the tin being a pineapple-textured pipe of lime eyesore.And it does it well, if a spleen-juddering blood-shake is what you are after. Its most powerful setting is so immense that, when I roll my waist over it, my ears feel tickly. Resting my weight on it, the amplifications transmitted through the floor vibrate glasses on a table on the other side of the room. I try thigh rolls and shoulder presses from the handbook. The vibrations travel through my back, rippling the muscles across a large area. The motor keeps pumping robustly under my weight without slowing. It is uncomfortable, and difficult to endure for long, but that is how I feel about exercise generally. One of the exercises details a happy man sitting on his vibrating log. When I recreate the pose, it is an experience I find ... most interesting. I could imagine staying there a while.After I have finished rolling my legs, sides and other parts, my fingers feel tingly and my brain takes a while to regain equilibrium, like a rattled blancmange. I feel less stressed out by the state of the world, which is handy. I could have a long nap. Exercise is great, isn’t it? I try using the roller after a few long swims, but eventually I stop applying it to sore muscles and leave it to slither around on the floor. It is hypnotic to watch it hide under the sofa and jimmy into nooks like a long terrapin.I don’t do enough hard exercise to justify this chartreuse battery. Those who do will find it a balm for the bigger muscles and cheaper than a massage, if less precise. But they could also use a squash ball. Not that I am throwing my roller away, you understand. I don’t have much use for it, but I have enough. It is interesting.Fights sore thighs.

Among those sued include Dr Luke and Max Martin, and rapper Juicy J.Gray’s lawyers argued that the beat of Dark Horse had been copied from Joyful Noise, but Perry and her co-writers claimed they had never heard the track, and were not aware of Gray. But Gray’s lawyer successfully argued that Joyful Noise was a widely known song, pointing to its millions of plays on YouTube and Spotify. “They’re trying to shove Mr Gray into some gospel music alleyway that no one ever visits,” argued Michael A Kahn.Perry’s lawyer, Christine Lepera, countered by saying Gray and his team were “trying to own basic building blocks of music, the alphabet of music that should be available to everyone”.Gray’s lawsuit was filed in 2014, the year after the release of Dark Horse, which became one of Katy Perry’s biggest hits. It was her ninth US No 1 single, was nominated for a Grammy award and became the second-biggest-selling single worldwide in 2014. Its video has been viewed 2.6bn times on YouTube.Although the case focused solely on the beat of Dark Horse, all six of its songwriters were judged to have infringed copyright, including lyricists Sarah Hudson and Juicy J, and all owe damages.Perry testified during the case, and offered to perform Dark Horse in person during technical difficulties with playback of the song.

Wellber is passionate about the composer’s work, and is concerned that “apart from period ensembles, hardly anyone plays much Haydn these days”. “I’m going,” he adds, “to be conducting a lot of Haydn with the BBC Philharmonic.”His enthusiasm was palpable throughout, though his approach had its idiosyncrasies. He directed the performance energetically from the keyboard, using a harpsichord for Part I and a fortepiano, stronger in sound, for Parts 2 and 3. He took liberties with the score. The big recitative for Adam and Eve was spoken rather than sung, as was Uriel’s cryptic pronouncement on the “happy pair” in their prelapsarian state. The latter was delivered in English, as was the final chorus, at the end of a performance that was otherwise given in German – a reminder, perhaps, that the oratorio was originally planned to an English text.Wellber clearly regards Haydn as malleable and far from sacrosanct.Against that must be set the excitement he generated in a work that celebrates the glory of God not only in the act of creation but in the wonder of the natural world. Though the balance took time to settle, the playing was splendid. Orchestral textures and instrumental solos teemed with life as it comes into being, burgeons and grows. The woodwind sounded exquisite and genuinely magical at the start of Part 3 as they ushered us into Eden.The soloists were strong. Baritone Christoph Pohl finely contrasted Raphael’s lofty detachment with Adam’s human warmth. Soprano Sarah-Jane Brandon took a while to get into her stride but sounded lovely both in Nun Beut Die Flur and her duets with Pohl. Tenor Benjamin Hulett delivered his arias with ease, elegance and fervour. The performance’s chief glory, however, was the BBC Proms Youth Choir, whose singing blended enthusiasm and commitment with superb dynamic control and polyphonic clarity. An evening of occasional eccentricities, perhaps, though the best of it was magnificent."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42517d74dc6426e7ac862ed4d3733d21bb9a92f9/0_646_2374_1423/master/2374.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6bcd39a5cf1f99b0b04c173c5ce1d0ca","title":"tommy james shondells tiffany how we made i think were alone now","story":"‘Having a No 1 at 15 was a wild ride. I didn’t realise it was about the prohibition of teenage sex – but we got away with it’When I was a kid I used to sing everywhere – the bathroom, the grocery store. When some musician friends of my parents had a party, my dad suggested I get up and sing. People went: “Wow. That voice. She sounds like a 30-year-old woman.” Before I knew it, I was singing on bills with people like Little Richard and Jerry Lee Lewis.When I was 15, someone told a producer, George Tobin, about this “girl with a great voice”. George helped me get a record deal and things started to roll pretty quickly. I Think We’re Alone Now had been a hit for Tommy James and the Shondells in the 60s. I didn’t know the song, and it didn’t sound so modern. When I came back the next day, they’d remade it as a dance track. I didn’t want to record it, but I took the song home and my girlfriends were dancing around the room. My producer said: “Trust me on this.”I went back to the studio and did the vocals in maybe four takes. I don’t think I realised that the song was about the prohibition of teenage sex, but we got away with it. The lyrics are what teenagers think about: going behind a bush and kissing and whatever. People have since told me: “Oh me and my husband were in the car listening to it and …” And I think: “Way too much information!”The song took off when I sang it live. Because I was too young for clubs, we did a tour of shopping malls and shot some of it for the video. At first, I could go and have a pizza afterwards, but soon there were so many people that I could barely even get into the mall. Having a No 1 hit at 15 was a wild ride. I met Michael Jackson. Girls copied my earrings and my crimped hair. I still have “Children behave” – the first words of I Think We’re Alone Now – on my T-shirts. I love the song now and never tire of singing it.I Think We’re Alone Now was presented to me as a slow ballad by my producers, Richie Cordell and Bo Gentry. I was 19, but I heard the hook and thought it sounded like a hit. We did a quick demo, souping it up and making it much faster. When we played it to Morris Levy, the head of Roulette Records, he loved it, so we went back in the studio to record it properly. I recorded the vocal on Christmas Eve 1966, so we could get the song on the street for the new year.Morris was right out of the movies. At first we had no idea that his Roulette label was a front for the Genovese crime family. He was a mob associate and these mafia guys would hang around Roulette like it was a social club. We soon learned to tiptoe around and not eavesdrop on too many conversations. But Morris could hear hits and if it hadn’t been for him nobody would have heard much more of Tommy James.I Think We’re Alone Now was the first of what became known as our bubblegum hits. Richie and Bo would come to me with these really simple, almost nursery rhyme-type songs. I’d say, “I’m not singing that!” and half an hour later I couldn’t get the tune out of my head. I learned how to make records with I Think We’re Alone Now. We did the bass and drums first and then layered the rest – which we’d never done before – and made the choruses quieter so that the verses would explode out of a radio speaker. It became a signature sound for many other records.Twenty years later, I watched in disbelief as Tiffany’s version of I Think We’re Alone Now and Billy Idol’s version of Mony Mony – another of our songs – flew up the charts together like they were holding hands. Neither of them knew about the other before they were released. Tiffany came up to me at a convention to apologise for covering us. I said: “Are you nuts? I should be thanking you.” She did a great job, and she’s a real sweet girl.• Tiffany plays Rewind Festival South, Henley-on-Thames, on 17 August. Her album Pieces of Me is out now. Tommy James has recorded a new version of I Think We’re Alone Now for the forthcoming biopic, Me, the Mob and the Music."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8800782287458cbc0cc3b258f04671b06b465a70/0_0_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9a49e66ee70820d279abf08520660bb0","title":"amazon 25 powerful jeff bezos podcast","story":"In 1994, Jeff Bezos founded Amazon, the company that has since made him the richest man in the world.

On the contrary, in so far as I ascertain a strategy at all, it is one that looks more designed to lose. I fear the country may already have decided that it does not intend to make you prime minister.”Campbell has been appealing against his expulsion since he was ejected under an automatic process designed to deal with those expressing support for another party. It caused mixed reactions at the time, with Charles Clarke, a former home secretary, revealing that he too had opted for the Lib Dems in the European elections because of their pro-remain policy, and Tom Watson, the deputy Labour leader, saying the move to kick out Campbell was “spiteful”.Others within Labour described the decision to expel Campbell as merely a matter of applying party rules consistently, while Momentum, the grassroots group of Corbyn supporters, celebrated his departure saying that “being kicked out of the party is the least he deserves” for his role in Blair’s government and the Iraq war.In his letter, Campbell said a member of Corbyn’s team had more recently suggested there could be two possible routes to him being let back into the party, one of which was a suspension of his auto-exclusion during a review of the party’s whole disciplinary system, and the other some kind of public commitment to voting Labour at the next election.However, he said he felt unable to give a commitment to voting Labour while his concern about Corbyn’s stance on Brexit was “still acute”.“I do not know at this stage how I will vote at the next election and I have made this decision after discussing it with nobody apart from family and a small number of close personal friends,” he said, adding that this was not part of some bigger plan but a deeply personal decision.“What I do know is that this is indeed a moment of real peril,” he wrote. “To have any chance of stopping Johnson and stopping a hard Brexit, you need to step up now, and signal leadership of the anti-Brexit, anti-populist cause, though it may be that loss of trust in your approach to Brexit means it is too late to win back many former supporters.”Corbyn said at the weekend he was “raring to go” and ready for an election against Johnson, which could come as early as this autumn if the EU is not open to changing the withdrawal agreement and parliament blocks a no-deal Brexit.Labour has changed its policy to call for a second referendum on any deal and to avoid no deal, but some Labour MPs are still pushing for a more unequivocally pro-remain position in all circumstances to head off the threat of the resurgent Lib Dems and win over anti-Brexit swing voters.Since Johnson came to power, his government has enjoyed a modest boost in the polls, with some putting the Conservatives neck-and-neck with Labour and others putting the Tories ahead.Campbell said he did not feel Corbyn’s shift towards supporting a second referendum went far enough, arguing: “Without real change, there will be nothing left to fight for, and that your place in history will be as the leader who destroyed Labour as a serious political force capable of winning power.“With a government this bad, pursuing a ruinous form of Brexit that will so damage our economy, society and standing in the world, Labour should be poised to win an election,. If the public could see that clear, credible and coherent alternative across the despatch box, ably led, we would be. That the country does not see it is, I am afraid, very substantially down to you.“I hope that one day I will rejoin a party that genuinely appeals to the many not the few, that can win again the kind of majority needed to improve the life chances of those who will be damaged by Brexit. In the meantime, please, for the sake of the party and especially for the sake of the country, think beyond the messenger, and think seriously about the message.”Labour had no comment on Campbell’s letter. It comes after Peter Mandelson, another former Labour strategist under Blair, gave an interview over the weekend calling for a new party leader, although he said he would not leave the party.“We are now in a situation where many people will react with horror against what Johnson plans to do – defying parliament to take Britain out of the EU without a deal to safeguard our trade and jobs – but have no faith in Corbyn’s desire or ability to block this,” Mandelson told Alain Elkann for La Stampa and other European newspapers.“Corbyn is not the leader that Labour needs at this time. He cannot deliver. Even his supporters are realising this. We need an alternative who can stand up to Johnson and lead the country against the disaster which is in the making.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ec9e6464b8f367655d0fa7cfcc75fd8e7b37053/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=900d47fb96c9e2bca14984fea8791696","title":"lib dems quiet bollocks to brexit brecon and radnorshire byelection","story":"Party is hoping a byelection win in leave constituency can kickstart its Westminster revivalIt may seem odd to omit what has become the Lib Dems’ defining selling point from the literature of its candidate, Jane Dodds, though in between pledging investment in health and social care and delivering for farmers, she promises to “fix our broken and ided politics” – code for disillusion with the major parties and the failure of Westminster to break the Brexit impasse.Dodds is cautious in the way she talks to voters about Brexit, restricting herself to discussing the perils of no deal and its effect on the constituency’s sheep farming and automotive workers, though she says the party’s stance is hardly a secret.Unlike many MPs, and some of the activists who have come to the constituency to campaign, hoping to help stop Brexit, she says the 2016 referendum made her resolve to listen more.“The referendum result was a shock, it made me think more than anything though that we need to get out more and talk to more people,” says Dodds, the leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats.In Brecon and Radnorshire, she says she has found a deep disconnect between its inhabitants and Westminster politics, often a physical one because of a loss of local services and frustration with issues such as broadband infrastructure. No deal will “potentially decimate” sheep farming, the economic and cultural lifeblood of many communities, she says.“The first thing that I’m clear about is that a no-deal Brexit must be taken off the table,” says Dodds, drinking coffee in the sunshine in Crickhowell before a day of canvassing. “But beyond that, people do know what the Lib Dem position is, though – we aren’t dishonest about that – and they know we are a remain party who will campaign for a ‘people’s vote’.”Though Dodds is keen to keep issues local, the vote on Thursday will have huge national significance. Chris Davies, the ousted Conservative MP convicted of expenses fraud, is fighting again for the seat after a byelection was triggered by a recall petition.In 2017 the results were as follows:\u0026nbspDespite the guilty verdict in court and the successful recall petition, Conservatives\u0027 Chris Davies is standing again and will hope to retain the seat. If he doesn\u0027t, new prime minister Boris Johnson will find his tiny working majority in parliament further diminished.Jane Dodds is standing for the Liberal Democrats, and Tom Davies is standing for Labour. The Brexit Party will be represented by Des Parkinson.In a move intended to to avoid splitting the \u0027remain\u0027 vote in the constituency, the Green party and Plaid Cymru have decided not to stand candidates, urging their supporters to back Dodds and the Lib Dems.Lady Lily Pink is standing for the Monster Raving Loony party.Should Dodds win, the Conservative majority will dwindle to just one seat, just a week after Boris Johnson was installed as prime minister. Conservative campaigning has been low key, though Johnson is scheduled to visit on Tuesday. There are some nerves about a “Boris bounce”, but Lib Dems are outwardly confident of taking the seat, believing that Davies’ reselection as a candidate is a sign that CCHQ wants a convenient excuse for a loss. The Brexit party will also stand, making it more likely the leave vote will split.Nigel Dances, 62, a project engineer in the car industry, is a particularly receptive punter on the doorstep. For him, a no-deal Brexit would be personal, though he is wary about stopping Brexit entirely. “I’ve always believed it was better to stay in and particularly for my business it would be catastrophic if we had no deal,” he tells Dodds. “The extra taxes make a huge difference to the margins of the business. But I do believe we need to respect democracy and people voted to come out. I don’t know if they ever realised the implications, that’s the thing.”Antonia Harrison, an activist who travelled from Portsmouth to campaign, has had to temper her pro-European enthusiasm when speaking to voters. “I’m a European first and foremost: it’s my identity, it made me determined to try and stop this,” she says. “But it is different here, I find a lot of people are saying they voted to leave. Some have said they would vote Lib Dem but because they voted leave, then they can’t this time.”One of the biggest challenges is getting around a constituency the size of Luxembourg mostly crossed by winding country lanes. Dodds says she is walking about 20km a day and driving between districts as much as three hours apart. On election day, activists will need to cover a huge area as turnout could make the difference.The Lib Dems have attracted campaigners from across the UK, as well as two who have flown over from Hong Kong and Toronto. Local organisers claim volunteers include former Tory members from London and current Labour members.On Crickhowell’s high street, opinion is ided. Robin Masefield, 33, the owner of Natural Weigh, which sells food and household products without packaging, is keen for a Dodds victory. “I hope she gets it, I just don’t support the Conservatives’ political views whatsoever,” he says. “Boris is a character, there’s no doubt about that but I do think he is likely to keep his promises. I think he’s for us: Britain will come first.”Many residents are amused, more than anything else, that the media circus is now making its way to Brecon. Marianne, a pensioner travelling down Crickhowell high street, said she had been surprised to find the former Lib Dem leader Tim Farron ringing her doorbell. “I couldn’t believe it,” she says. Though it is local issues that will affect her vote, she says many people have found Davies to be personable and effective. “Local people are so fed up about Brexit I think they won’t want to think about it and will vote for whoever they would usually vote for. It is local things that matter more.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6267b913b2b60563707fbb38990e6e5633c7c97c/0_288_5048_3028/master/5048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c66c40d040dd651b596e3d2b3f4b0df3","title":"they could end up kingmakers again readers on future liberal democrats","story":"Readers share their hopes for a new movement in the UK, while others can’t forget the party’s part in austerity in the coalitionA week on from Jo Swinson’s election as leader of the Liberal Democrats, we asked readers to share their views on the future of the party.People from across the UK told of their hopes for the party under its new leader and the strength of the Lib Dems’ clear anti-Brexit line. While many readers were hopeful for an invigorated movement, others can’t forget the party’s involvement in the coalition and its support for austerity and other policies when in government. Below is a selection of your views.The Lib Dems are in the most promising position they have been in years, but they’ll have to resist the urge to rely on their anti-Brexit USP to win back disaffected ex-voters like myself. I would have to see a huge white flag in respect of their role in austerity, and a comprehensive set of ambitious policies to address inequality and environmental catastrophe. I switched my vote to Labour after the Lib Dems seemed to drink too much of the neoliberalausterity Kool-Aid in coalition with the Conservatives.Jo Swinson has energy, youthfulness and goodwill in her favour. She does not have a convincing record of progressive voting. I’d be willing to let sleeping dogs lie with regards to the coalition missteps if they come out strongly in favour of truly progressive economic and environmental policies. James, 27, LondonI was a paid-up member of the party from 2010-2017 but couldn’t vote for Tim Farron due to his equivocation over gay sex as a sin. Jo Swinson is a brilliant force for change. She’s intelligent, articulate and experienced for someone who’s yet to turn 40. She will challenge both Boris Johnson’s bluffing buffoonery and Jeremy Corbyn’s hard-left idealism. With her at the helm there is genuine hope for a new liberal movement to rise again in the UK. For a younger woman to strike out and offer a new path to follow will give great success to the party, as it did in New Zealand with Jacinda Ardern and in New York with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. These people are the caring future of our politics and I’ve no doubt Swinson will quickly develop a larger supporter base in the UK. Tom Williams, 41, LeicesterSwinson’s voting record is far too problematic for me ever to consider voting Lib Dem again. I regard the Lib Dems as Jekyll to the Tories’ Hyde. By becoming a single-issue “stop Brexit” party, they risk consigning themselves to irrelevance once again, since it’s highly unlikely that Johnson will call another referendum or unilaterally revoke article 50. A shift towards the Greens might be helpful, but I can’t see Swinson being too enthusiastic about that given her voting record. There’s a reason why she’s publicly courting disenchanted Tories they have very similar politics and ideology. Chris Hughes, 41, East AngliaI still have a lingering feeling of betrayal after their actions in the coalition government. As a regular undecided voter however, many of their policies meet my desires. Remain, support for education, higher taxes to pay for public services. I don’t feel I can vote Labour under Corbyn, so it’s Lib Dem or Green now. Fingers crossed Swinson can start to make me believe again. They need to remain a strong voice for a second referendum, but also ensure they have believable policies in other areas too. I suspect they will end up kingmakers again, let’s hope they act with more integrity next time. Andrea Hales, 44, WorcestershireIt’s about time we forgave them their errors in coalition. It’s not as if the Conservatives or Labour have not broken promises or made a total hash of stuff in the past. They are the only middle ground party and the only ones committed to electoral reform. I would personally vote Green but the only way to do that effectively is to edge towards PR. They need to hold the balance of power at the very least. Currently there is no effective opposition to anything. Steve, 61, KentI think the party has been unfairly punished for the worst decisions of the coalition. I hope that the party can be a beacon of hope in a world of increasingly extremist and uninformed views. I hope the party will be able to capitalise on the anti-Brexit feeling among large parts of the population and lead through the middle, growing its support base and number of MPs in any future election. I voted for Swinson because she is young, fresh, passionate, intelligent, articulate and speaks with authority on a range of topics. I think she can lead the party out of its recent difficult past. Fiona Sweetman, 53, CarlisleI think there is a huge chasm in politics at the moment and I feel there is great potential for the Liberal Democrats to fill that void. However, splitting the vote of remain-leaning or left-leaning parties is a problem. The Lib Dems need to manage their image and not be seen as a dumping ground for washed-up Tories and Blairites. I hope I am not alone in my belief that most who are anti-Brexit or centre-left see the benefit of the Lib Dems attracting votes that would otherwise go to the Conservatives. I feel the best hope for the party (and country) is to force a coalition government with Labour. Rob, 26, West MidlandsWhile I understand Brexit is the defining issue of our age, it cannot be a one-issue party. In the short term this may win it some success, but there needs to be longer-term policy planning and a seismic shift in how it projects itself and how it is perceived for it to remain a lasting political force.I was pleased by Jo Swinson’s election as leader in spite of her role in enabling Conservative austerity during the coalition government. But I was disconcerted by her statements in the press saying that she would rule out a Lib Dem pact with Labour under  Corbyn. Who is she appealing to by making this assertion? By denouncing Corbyn’s Labour, Swinson is effectively alienating millions of young voters who swung to Labour in 2017 because of Corbyn and because of his engaging social democratic brand of politics.

And then if I wasn’t able to play in Cincinnati, there’s a good chance I would probably wait until after New York, because I wouldn’t want my first tournament, either, to be playing best-of-five sets.“Murray said he is practising singles in Washington and is also lined up to play doubles at the Rogers Cup next week in Toronto with López. “In terms of moving and feeling and waking up the next day, I’m feeling good,” Murray said. “I’m quite close but there’s stuff that would need to get better."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7b0905740a80d88a4d9caf11bd424a55684a7e9/0_567_4961_2976/master/4961.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3122347e1e59f13eb82321b7132e12fe","title":"ashes 2019 19 things to look out for in the england v australia series cricket","story":"From shirt numbers to the Test Championship, via concussion substitutes, bantermime booing and much more1) At Edgbaston on Thursday, Test cricket will be dragged kicking and screaming into the early 1990s. For the first time, players with have their name and number on the back of their shirts: as in white-ball cricket, Joe Root will wear No 66, proving that the responsibility of captaincy need not get in the way of a popular pun.2) After years of vetoes and false starts, the all-singing, all-dancing, all-context-providing Test Championship will begin this week. Teams collect points over a two-year cycle, with the top two playing in the final in June 2021. There are 120 points available in each series, so winning a match in a two-Test series is worth more (60 points) than if there are five matches (24 points). But you can lose points as well …3) The ICC has changed its approach to slow over-rates. Instead of suspending the captain, they will now hit all 11 players where it really hurts: in the Test Championship. If a team wins any points during the match, they will lose two for each over they were short of the required rate.4) Once upon a time, Ashes series in England began in June and ended in August. The modern schedule is designed to squeeze as much as possible from the lemon, so since 2001 the series have started in July. This year, for the first time in Ashes history, the series will start in August, one day before the start of the Football League season. The latest ever start goes hand in hand with the latest ever finish …5) There has only ever been one Ashes Test in September, a long-forgotten match at the Oval in 2005. This year there will be two, with the series ending on 16 September. Given the eccentricities of the English weather, neither side will want to be behind going into the final Test at the Oval.6) If you use a little selective accounting, Australia are on their worst Ashes run since the 19th century. Never mind the fact they won the last series 4-0 they have lost their last four series in England, the first time that has happened since the 1890s. Their last win was in 2001, when Steve Waugh’s awesome team brutalised England 4-1.7) Trevor Bayliss’s legacy was secured on the balrmy evening of Sunday 14 July 2019. His record with the Test team has been mixed, and Bayliss will leave England’s Test team pretty much where he found them: as mid-table mavericks. He’d love to end as he started, too: Bayliss’s first series was the 3-2 victory over Australia in 2015.8) The inclusion of the Cape Town Three – David Warner, Steve Smith and Cameron Bancroft – in Australia’s Ashes squad should ensure a summer of bantermime booing and sandpaper-based props. Although Warner and Smith played at the World Cup, this is the first time they have been available in Test cricket since their world collapsed in March 2018.9) The increase in T20 leagues means this will be the first Ashes with multiple franchise friendships, which may take the edge off the traditional enmity. To take a small example: Jason Roy has played with Pat Cummins, who has played with Jos Buttler, who has played with Steve Smith, who has played with Jofra Archer, who has played with Tim Paine, who has played with Stuart Broad. And, after their IPL performances for Sunrisers Hyderabad, Warner and Jonny Bairstow are still favourites for the imaginary award for Most Unlikely Bromance of 2019.10) The back page has never been held for the announcement of a vice-captain, yet this year’s are more noteworthy than usual. Ben Stokes will be Joe Root’s deputy for the first time since Bristol, while Australia’s quest for elite vice-captaincy has led them to appoint two: Pat Cummins and Travis Head. Not that this a guarantee of selection. Mitchell Marsh was joint vice-captain when he was dropped during the Australian summer.11) After a successful trial in domestic cricket, concussion substitutes will be used in Test cricket for the first time. There are still some grey areas, but if a player is concussed his team will be allowed a like-for-like replacement that is approved by the match referee.12) Diversity was a theme of England’s World Cup win, and the Ashes will also reflect the multiculturalism of the modern world. The squads for the first Test include players born or raised in Barbados (Jofra Archer), New Zealand (Ben Stokes), Pakistan (Usman Khawaja), South Africa (Marnus Labuschagne, Michael Neser, Jason Roy) and Zimbabwe (Sam Curran).13) The second day of the second Test at Lord’s will be the first Ruth Strauss Foundation Day. Both teams will wear red caps, while there will also be red stumps and special shirts in support of the Foundation that was set up after the death of Andrew Strauss’s wife last December. The idea is based on the Jane McGrath Day, which has become a highlight of the Australian summer.14) Kumar Dharmasena, the umpire whose decisions caused such controversy in the World Cup semi-final and final, will be back in England for the first two Tests. He’s not the only one who may find the past being discussed: Aleem Dar, umpire for the final Test, was in charge when Stuart Broad was infamously given not out at Trent Bridge in 2013.15) The Ashes may be won in a factory in Walthamstow. In May, after a run-laden start to the county season, the ECB asked for a new batch of Duke balls to be made for the Ashes, similar to those used in 2017 and 2018. They have a bigger seam and a heavier lacquer, which England hope will allow their seamers to expose Australia’s fragility against the moving ball.16) The 2015 Ashes, which lasted 18 days, equalled the shortest five-Test series of all time. It might seem like a never-ending boreathon in comparison to 2019, which has all the necessary ingredients – fragile batting, high-class bowling, lively pitches, a ball that never stops talking – to be a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it affair.17) Headingley is indelibly associated with the Ashes, scene of immortal performances from Bradman, Boycott, Botham (and Willis) and Butcher. It used to stage a Test in every Ashes series – but has hosted only one in the last four series, so there will be almost an air of novelty when the teams line up for the third Test.18) England are not the only team who may play a wicketkeeper as a specialist batsman. Matthew Wade has played 141 of his 142 international games as a keeper, including all 22 of his Tests. But Tim Paine’s presence as captain and wicketkeeper means that door is closed, so Wade – who has been in extraordinary form with the bat for the last year or so – seems likely to take his place as a top-six batsman.19) Ashes series define some careers – but they end a lot more. There is usually at least one emotional farewell, and the 2013-14 and 2015 series ended multiple careers at a stroke. The squads for the first Test include 14 thirtysomethings – the oldest is Jimmy Anderson, who turned 37 on Tuesday. If England regain the Ashes, and especially if he gets the 25 wickets he needed to reach 600, he may find the fairytale exit too hard to resist.• This is an extract taken from the Spin, the ’s weekly cricket email.

That, broadly, is the scenario of Nicola McCartney’s neglected 1998 drama in which the schisms of Northern Ireland’s religious ide are played out among the early 20th-century settlers of Saskatchewan. It’s no place for romance.As the playwright sees it, the absurdity of sectarianism becomes even starker when placed in a different context. Over the course of the play, relations between two neighbouring expat families go from frosty to outrightly hostile, purely because of their split affiliations to King Billy and the Pope. This despite the younger members never having set foot in Northern Ireland.Absurd the arguments may be, but Heritage shows the powerful pull of cultural identity. Here in the middle of Canada, the Protestant family pack their son off to join the war in Europe because of loyalty to the British empire, while their Catholic neighbours resolutely proclaim independence. They find comfort and solidarity in their traditions, language, dances and parades. The possibility of a union between David Rankine’s Catholic Michael and Fiona Wood’s Protestant Sarah threatens not just their self-definition but their survival as a group.Staged on Ken Harrison’s imposing set of wooden beams, dynamically lit by Wayne Dowdeswell, Richard Baron’s assured production is at its best when most keenly focused on the central romance – and is elevated by Wood’s radiant performance as a teenager falling for a boy from the wrong side of the tracks."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b31644fc8a6b2d10b2c48a8d58f5232dfe170e09/0_252_4006_2404/master/4006.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=89cb926578d3d2f1a24d9a5d741b35ee","title":"spartacus review bolshoi royal opera house london","story":"Royal Opera House, LondonIdentically drilled dancers and an epic cinematic score are the driving forces behind Yuri Grigorovich’s slave rebellion storyAt the Bolshoi, size matters. The company’s name means “big” in Russian, and the Muscovites open their London summer season with a ballet that lives up to it. Yuri Grigorovich’s Soviet-era slave rebellion story is a signature work of the Bolshoi, one of the few companies that could offer such an army of identically drilled dancers, inexhaustible in grand displays of power and strength.Men dominate the stage in one of ballet’s more masculine outings. Slaves and soldiers thrust forth limbs in tight unison, straight as their swords, and Denis Rodkin’s Spartacus takes on Roman consul Crassus (Artemy Belyakov). Rodkin makes a lukewarm entrance – it’s rare one need ask a Russian dancer for more melodrama, but Anastasia Denisova as his lover Phrygia has the idea, the tilt of her neck expressing a deep lament. Rodkin grows into the role though, his endless leaps becoming higher and wilder, his power and presence revving up.It’s a marathon of a show over three acts, so perhaps it pays to pace yourself. The length and scale are not always at the service of the drama.Crassus and Spartacus spend a long time not fighting each other, then climactic moments pass in a flash. Anyway, it’s clear who should be ruling everyone in Rome: Svetlana Zakharova’s Aegina, Crassus’s courtesan. She is pure steel, wily and merciless. Her arms snake and curl luxuriously to frame her body, her fingers so long it takes an extra bar for them to catch up with the curve.Grigorovich’s choreography comes in statements (as opposed to lyrical phrases) and the stage has a mid-century geometry about it. He uses blocks of dancers in perfect accord, such as the ice-cold courtesans, hypnotic like stony-faced sirens. Act II’s shepherds and shepherdesses are the only characters truly free, and they dance that freedom with almost vaudeville flair from the men and an incredible lightness from the women who whip, skip and flit.The best thing about this ballet, and what drives it, is Khachaturian’s cinematic epic of a score, with its mighty percussion, great swooning love theme and touches of jazz. It’s the music that makes this period piece vigorously alive."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1037db61208f5a7be682ba67ee89e9cdc1316a42/273_780_4637_2782/master/4637.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e017cebee14c854f76fc442e78da44c","title":"sandbank picnic sailing adventure norfolk coast a photo essay","story":"Getting deliberately grounded on a sandbank – in the company of capable mariners – makes for a captivating day trip exploring Norfolk’s hidden depthsby  Patrick Barkham Photography by Mim HowellWe are sailing on eerily calm blue-grey seas a few miles off the north Norfolk coast. There is no sand visible but the hidden banks below us are written in the surrounding water in the form of ripples, white lines of surf and patches of smooth water. These treacherous shallows possess romantic names on the sea charts – Pandora Sand, Thief Sand, Stubborn Sand – but sailors’ lives depend on avoiding them.The captain of Salford, our beautifully restored whelk boat, is trying to do the opposite, however: he’s trying to run aground on one. Our depth gauge drops from 6.9m to 1.4m. We stop and wait for the tide to beach us. Will we soon discover pristine golden sand?Picnicking and playing cricket on sandbanks at low tide was regarded as a grand day out by hail-and-hearty Victorians but messing around on shifting sands is not favoured in our risk-averse era. When a BBC film crew staged a cricket match on the notorious Goodwin Sands in the Channel a few years back, the in-rushing tide turned their boat over, requiring a lifeboat rescue.So, the decision by the Coastal Exploration Company, a band of capable mariners who take visitors to less-well-known spots on the north Norfolk coast in vintage sailing boats, to restart holidaymaking on sandbanks looks a little reckless. But I had to give it a go.Dom, the skipper, steers our 30ft boat through Wells-next-the-Sea’s pretty harbour in the morning sunshine. Our plan: breakfast on the boat, while we sail west to reach the Wash at low tide and “find a nice little sandbank to dry out on,” as Dom puts it – for lunch and cricket. “Any kind of waves would pick the boat up and slam it onto the sand but these conditions are nice and calm,” he says.Wells’ straggly line of colourful beach huts framed by white sand and dark pines slowly diminish as we head into the North Sea. The calm sea may be safe for us but it’s terrible for sailing. Luckily, Salford has a new engine that purrs as we potter along the coast at 4 knots.The seas here are shallow and studded with sandbanks, many of which now house offshore wind farms. It was once Doggerland and even today it sometimes looks like you can walk across the Wash from Norfolk to Lincolnshire at low tide. I’m astonished to learn that this great expanse of low water also contains a section called The Well, which is 47 metres deep.“Everything about the water is dangerous,” warns Charlie Hodson, our expedition chef and former lifeboat man, which could come in handy. “It’s about how you respect that water in return.”Charlie gives this warning as we pass the black silhouette of a ship wrecked on the sands beyond Scolt Head Island. This vessel was deliberately scuppered and filled with explosives to stop German invaders entering Brancaster harbour but we pass two more authentic wrecks visible on the vast sandy shores of north Norfolk.Despite the depth gauge reading 1.4m, the sandbank above which we first float doesn’t appear even as low tide nears. So we sail further along this wild, tranquil coast of sand dunes, windmills and flint church towers and around Gore Point. Ahead shimmies a line of gold: Sunk Sand, rising around two metres out of the water on the lowest of tides. Cormorants stand on the bank, drying their wings like enormous bats on the far side lounge the banana shapes of a dozen grey seals.Slowly, cautiously, we head towards Sunk Sand. Just beyond 1.5m, we run aground. The water around us is still chest-deep, so we blow up an inflatable dinghy to carry our lunch. I jump in and swim “ashore”, which is not as glamorous as it sounds – it’s easier to wade in the shallow water.We step onto our own utterly otherworldly, (extremely) temporary island. We can see Hunstanton in the distance to the south and Skegness to the far north but there is nothing else, and no one else, for miles around. The sand is smooth, wet, and scattered with giant starfish and dozens of sea urchins.Abruptly, the sun vanishes and a murk creeps in. Charlie hurriedly lights his stove, showing us how to fillet the seabass in the shallows. As he rustles up lunch we notice his pop-up kitchen is getting closer to the water. The tide is coming in already. Our sandbank island is shrinking.We move the kitchen 50 yards from the sea. It only gives us 10 minutes. The tide seeps over the sand and Charlie blowtorches the locally caught seabass for his take on “fish and peas and ham with a Masala flavour”. It’s delicious, and there is just enough time for a quick game of cricket. Salford is afloat again, and suddenly looking a long way away. Storm clouds build in the Wash’s huge skies.We swim-wade hurriedly back to the boat, and head home. The sea has turned choppy, the breeze gets up, and we fly past Scolt Head Island as sandwich terns e into the water and emerge, in a twinkle, gobbling silver fish.Rain arrives just as we enter the sanctuary of Wells harbour, sailing smoothly up the channel on a rising tide.This surreal day does not feel dangerous in such capable hands. Instead, the grand peaceful arena of this coast is profoundly soothing. And the wilderness of its salt marshes is nothing compared to the wilderness out there, among the sandbanks and cormorants, a strange liminal landscape where sand meets sea and the tide is the master of all.• The Coastal Exploration Company offers bespoke sailing adventures on the north Norfolk coast.

He said the event was about bringing “joy, excitement and togetherness at the border wall”.He added that it was also about finding “meaningful ways on both sides with the recognition that the actions that take place on one side have a direct consequence on the other side”.The US-Mexico border has become one of the defining features of Donald Trump’s presidency. His promise to “build a wall” between the two countries has yet to materialise but crowded migrant detention facilities, the use of teargas at the border and the separation of children from their parents are among some of the controversial tactics deployed by US authorities as its stance has become more hostile under the Trump administration.The US supreme court recently ruled in the US president’s favour and allowed him to use $2.5bn (£2.05bn) of Pentagon funds on four contracts to replace existing sections of barrier with fencing in Arizona, California and New Mexico.Other art projects have been planned for the border. Estudio 3.14, an architectural practice in Mexico, designed a pink interpretation of Trump’s border wall that was inspired by the 20th-century Mexican architect Luis Barragán, employing the pink pastel colour he often used in his designs.Dozens of artists have used the wall as a setting for projects, including the Japanese art collective Chim Pom, which created a treehouse in Tijuana with “USA Visitor Center” written on the side."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43729b5eba172434f5c1520ef852be9903d98207/0_412_5394_3237/master/5394.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=41e481dc4d587b7f10cb16fd0a53a177","title":"uk teenager detained in cyprus","story":"Woman, 19, held on suspicion of falsely accusing 12 Israeli tourists of attackA British teenager has been remanded in custody in Cyprus after she was arrested last week on suspicion of falsely accusing 12 Israeli tourists of gang rape.The 19-year-old faces “public mischief” charges that come with a maximum sentence of one year in prison and a fine of about €1,700 (£1,600).The woman, who has not been named, stood during the session at the Famagusta district court in Paralimni in south-east Cyprus without speaking. Her mother was also present.She covered her face with the hood of her sweatshirt as she left the court and was put into a police van.Her lawyer, Andreas Pittadjis, said she was expected to enter a plea when she appears again on 7 August. He asked the court for time to “collect videotapes and statements” gathered by the Cypriot police during the investigation.Initially, the teenager had alleged that 12 Israelis raped her at the hotel where she was staying in Ayia Napa on 17 July.The tourists, aged 15 to 18, were released last week after the woman was arrested on suspicion of “making a false statement about an imaginary crime”, according to Cyprus police.Ayia Napa is a magnet for younger holidaymakers attracted by its reputation as a party town and its white sand beaches.The UK is the island’s biggest tourist market with about 1.3 million Britons travelling to Cyprus every year.

Photograph: Aidan Crawley The taxpayer subsidised private schools by more than €90 million last year, according to official figures.The vast bulk of this sum went on salaries for teachers in the State’s 51 fee-paying schools, along with capital expenditure, grants for computer equipment and sports facilities.The figures come at a time when day pupil numbers in fee-paying schools are returning to levels last seen before the recession.Latest official enrolment statistics for the 2018-19 academic year show numbers attending private schools climbed to more than 25,600 pupils, up by almost 500 pupils on the previous year.While numbers slipped during the recession, with some private schools opting to enter the free education scheme, enrolments in the fee-paying sector have been growing steadily for the past four years.Most private schools in the south Dublin area are over-subscribed and have long waiting lists for day pupils.St Columba’s is the most expensive school for day pupils (€8,000), followed by Sutton Park in Dublin 13 (€7,900), Alexandra College, Dublin 6 (€7,386), St Gerard’s, Bray (€7,339) and Sandford Park (€7,150).Department of Education figures show that during 2018, the State paid just over €91 million on salaries for teachers employed in fee-paying schools.In addition, captial expenditure funding, ICT and sports grants for private schools amounted to more than €1 million.State subsidies for fee-paying schools were reduced during austerity era cost-cutting which saw these schools given an inferior pupil-teacher ratio (23:1) compared with schools in the free scheme (19:1).This was on the basis that private schools could use their own resources to hire additional subject teachers or ancillary staff.A report commissioned by the then minister for education Ruairí Quinn into the income of private schools, published in 2013, estimated that they had more than €80 million extra a year to invest in additional support and facilities for their pupils thanks to the income from fees.While there have been calls from the Labour Party for State funding of teachers’ salaries in private schools to cease, a spokeswoman for the Department of Education estimated this would end up costing the taxpayer at least €23 million.This would be as a result of some private schools opting to enter the free scheme and becoming entitled to State capitation grants and better pupil-teacher ratios.‘Day boarding’ optionsWhile day pupil numbers are growing, the number of boarding pupils dipped last year with just over 3,500 boarders recorded, down almost 90 on last year. This may be linked to a growth in new “day boarding” options, where students avail of meals and supervised study before returning home.In Glenstal Abbey School in Limerick, for example, boarding numbers fell by 60 over the past year. However, its day pupil numbers rose from zero to 68.In all, about 25 secondary schools now provide boarding options. They include schools which used to be fee-paying but joined the free education scheme during the economic downturn, such as Kilkenny College. The most expensive boarding school this year remains St Columba’s in Whitechurch, Dublin, which charges up to €22,800 a year.The next most expensive boarding schools are at Clongowes in Co Kildare (€19,890), Glenstal Abbey, Co Limerick (€19,300) and Rathdown School, Co Dublin (€19,275).Kilkenny College is the biggest boarding school in the country (438 boarders), followed by Clongowes Wood College, Co Kildare (433 pupils) and the King’s Hospital, Dublin (277).Fees for Irish private schools are highly competitive compared with the UK, where charges are typically several times higher.This is due partly to the fact that the salaries of most teachers in Irish private schools are paid for out of the public purse unlike the UK.The largest fee-paying schools are mostly Dublin-based and include Blackrock College (1,018 pupils), followed by Belvedere College (1,004), St Andrew’s (988) and Wesley (914). Christian Brothers College in Cork (904) is the largest outside Dublin."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3971136.1564427969!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dublin motorists face 3km diversion under city bus plan","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tView of Stoneybatter. Photograph: Dara Mac Dónaill A one-way traffic system designed for Dublin’s Stoneybatter, as part of the BusConnects programme, would force motorists into a detour of almost 3km, through some of the worst traffic in the capital’s inner city.Residents of the urban village last March protested against the National Transport Authority’s (NTA) initial BusConnects plans which would have resulted in the felling of trees, and the removal of parking and loading bays on Manor Street.The NTA has produced revised designs which increase the amount of green space, involve the planting of more trees, and retain street parking spaces. However, as a trade-off, private car owners will no longer be permitted to drive from the North Circular Road to Manor Street.The new plan involves a “bus gate” on Prussia Street south of the Park shopping centre. Motorists at Hanlon’s Corner will be directed along the North Circular Road towards the Phoenix Park where they will turn left down Infirmary Road and left again onto the quays from Parkgate Street. By turning left again onto Blackhall Place at James Joyce Bridge, they will be able to drive north to Manor Street.In total, the detour would be between 2.5km and 3km, depending on which part of Manor Street the motorist wished to access.A spokeswoman for BusConnects said the changes would preserve local access to streets such as St Joseph’s Road, but the “significant public realm improvement” which offered “great potential” for Stoneybatter could not be implemented if through-traffic continued to travel south down Manor Street."},{"url":null,"title":"green plaza for stoneybatter in busconnects redesign","story":"A new “green” pedestrian and cycle plaza, with flowers, ornamental hedges, trees and cafe-style public seating, has been designed for Stoneybatter as part of the BusConnects programme.The National Transport Authority (NTA) intends to run a core bus corridor from Blanchardstown to the city centre through Stoneybatter. However, when its plans were revealed earlier this year, local residents and businesses protested, saying it would have a “devastating impact” on the urban village.Their concerns centred on the loss of green space, the felling of trees, the reduction of pavement widths, and the removal of street parking and loading bays.The NTA has revised its designs in response. It plans to create a new triangular plaza at the junction of Prussia Street, Aughrim Street and Manor Street, which it describes as a “green square” that will have shared pedestrian and cyclist use and extensive planting of trees, shrubs and flowers. A current car park and through-road in front of Kavanagh’s pub will become part of the plaza and could be a “local hub for passive recreation and host various events”.The new designs also retain parking and loading bays further south on Manor Street at the main shopping area close to the junctions of Arbour Hill and Brunswick Street. Enhanced cycle lanes are also proposed.However, to implement these changes, private cars would need to be restricted.Southbound traffic from the North Circular Road would be restricted to local access only on Prussia Street, to access the Park shopping centre or streets such as St Joseph’s Road with “no direct access to Stoneybatter”.Access to Stoneybatter from North Circular Road direction would be via Infirmary Road, Parkgate Street, North Quays and Blackhall Place – a detour of almost 3km.Motorists travelling north through Stoneybatter from the quays will have to turn left onto Aughrim Street, which will become a one-way street.‘Welcome improvements’Labour councillor and chairman of Stoneybatter Pride of Place Joe Costello said while there had been “welcome improvements”, a lot of issues remained unresolved.“There are quite a few areas that need clarification: funnelling all the car traffic coming from town into Aughrim Street poses a problem similarly, there are clarifications needed in relation to St Joseph’s Road.”Dublin City Council had previously considered making Aughrim Street one way but abandoned the idea because of the problems it would cause for residents, he said.BusConnects was “the right idea” Mr Costello said, but a more holistic traffic and transport plan needed to be put in place for it to work.“Park and ride facilities at rail hubs, and congestion charges need to be looked at to take the burden of commuter traffic off little villages. Otherwise there is a danger of unintended consequences, of creating traffic bottlenecks and rat runs.”Seaneen Sullivan, co-owner of local pub and restaurant L Mulligan Grocers, said the new designs represented a “huge improvement”.“The NTA have shown a willingness to listen. I would still love to see greater protection of cyclists, but from where we were, this is a huge step forward.”The community had been misunderstood as being opposed to BusConnects, she said. “As a community we are very pro-public transport. If you travel by private car, yes this will involve a detour, but this is a community with low levels of car ownership.”The NTA will be holding a new round of public consultation on its BusConnects programme in the autumn."},{"url":null,"title":"revealed really goes recycling rubbish behind scenes","story":"The chaos of Britain’s recycling system is exposed today with hundreds of thousands of

And Twitch, like all apps that allow two-way communication and live streaming, present particular risks to children of being groomed.“These sites need to ensure they are doing everything they can to protect children on their platforms.A Twitch spokesman said: The safety of our community is a top priority and one in which we are perpetually investing.We take any issues or accusations of this nature extremely seriously, and as soon as we become aware of a possible instance of exploitation we swiftly take the content down and report it to relevant law enforcement as appropriate.  The NSPCC’s warning comes as it released the results of a survey of 2,000 11 to 17-year-olds that found one in 25 has received or been asked to send sexual material to an adult online.When compared to the population of more than five million children in the UK of that age, the NSPCC estimates this means up to 201,000 are being subject to attempted grooming. According to the survey, the most common social media sites where children experienced grooming were Snapchat and Facebook, where one in 25 using those networks said they had received such requests.The second most common sites were Twitch and Twitter, with one in 33 reporting having such experiences.As a result, the charity called called for social media and tech companies to share more data with each help catch groomers and disable friend suggestion algorithms for children.Duty of Care campaign | Read morePeter Wanless, NSPCC Chief Executive, said: “The scale of risk that children face on social networks revealed in this research cannot be ignored and tackling it with robust and comprehensive legislation needs to be a priority for this government.   “Tech firms need to be forced to get a grip of the abuse taking place on their sites by using technology to identify suspicious behaviour and designing young people’s accounts with built-in protections.”Following the findings, Antigone Davis, Facebook Head of Global Safety, said: “Keeping young people safe on our platforms is a top priority for us.“In addition to using technology to proactively detect grooming and prevent child sexual exploitation on our platform, we work with child protection experts, including specialist law enforcement teams like CEOP in the UK, to keep young people safe.“Ninety nine percent of child nudity content is removed from our platform automatically.”A spokesman for Snapchat added: “We are concerned that predators are using other, less private, apps to locate potential victims and then steer them to Snapchat or other private messaging platforms. We are working hard to better understand this activity and are collaborating with law enforcement and other industry partners to develop more ways to combat this behaviour.”A spokesman for Twitter said: “Twitter does not tolerate any material that features or promotes child sexual exploitation. Under our child sexual exploitation policy, behaviours such as expressing a desire to obtain materials that feature child sexual exploitation as well as engaging or trying to engage a child in a sexually explicit conversation, are in violation. “We continue to welcome partnerships around the world with law enforcement to continue our rigorous and significantly scaled operations on this type of egregious activity.”Duty of Care CampaignThe  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

live pangolins found hidden bus vietnam","story":"The small, docile pangolin is the most trafficked animal in the worldDozens of live pangolins smuggled from Laos were discovered dehydrated and weak on a bus in central Vietnam, police and conservationists said Tuesday, in a country where the endangered mammals are a highly-prized delicacy.The small, docile pangolin is the most trafficked animal in the world, and is found across Asia and Africa, with one snatched from the wild every five minutes, according to the World Wildlife Fund.In Vietnam pangolin meat is considered high-end and hard to find and their scales are used in traditional medicine to treat allergies and impotence.Police on Monday found 30 pangolins stuffed into boxes on a bus in Ha Tinh province, arresting the driver and his wife on suspicion of trafficking the animals from Laos.Four were already dead and many of the surviving animals were in bad shape, said Truong Van Truong from the NGO Save Vietnam\u0027s Wildlife.In Vietnam pangolin meat is considered high-end and hard to find and their scales are used in traditional medicineMost were dehydrated and weak because they were kept in a tight space for a long time, he told AFP.The pangolins were tied into inidual sacks and crammed into a box, where they might have been kept for weeks with little water or food, he added.They will be nursed back to health before the strongest are released back into the wild.Police said the driver and his wife were paid to transport the animals from neighbouring Laos.The rescue comes on the heels of major wildlife seizures over the past week in Vietnam, both a consumption and transport hub for illegal wildlife in Asia.Police arrested a wildlife trafficking suspect and two others after finding seven dead tiger cubs in their car in a Hanoi parking lot Thursday.On the same day 125 kilograms (275 pounds) of rhino horn encased in plaster was seized at the capital\u0027s airport.Often described as scaly ant-eaters, pangolins curl into a ball when scared, making them easy prey for hunters.They once roamed free in Vietnam\u0027s forests, but numbers have dwindled dramatically thanks to rampant poaching and habitat loss.They are categorised as critically endangered according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature.Turkish bee sentenced to death by Defra

biden vows ditch polite debate approach second democrat","story":"Joe Biden suffered a slump in the opinion polls after being repeatedly challenge by rivals in the first Democrat 2020 debateJoe Biden has vowed to take a more combative approach to Tuesday’s debate of Democratic presidential hopefuls as he braces for attacks from two prominent black rivals over his race record. The former US vice president has seen slumping poll numbers in early voting states and questions about his suitability arise after being challenged over past stances during the first debates last month.Attempting to keep his long-held front-runner status in the race for the Democratic Party’s 2020 White House nomination, Mr Biden warned his rivals: I\u0027m not going to be as polite this time.Evidence of this increased willingness to challenge others has emerged in recent days with coded criticism of Kamala Harris and Cory Booker, two African-American senators seeking the nomination. Mr Biden hit back at Mr Booker’s claim that he is the “architect of mass incarceration”, a reference to his role in helping write the 1994 crime bill blamed for increasing prison populations. The moment Kamala Harris, right, challenged Joe Biden, left, over his past race relations positions was replayed often on cable TV newsThe Biden camp released a statement questioning Mr Booker’s record as mayor of Newark, saying the city’s police department was a civil rights nightmare during his tenure. A more confrontational approach to Ms Harris, whose challenging of Mr Biden over his historic lack of support for the desegregating policy of busing gave her a poll boost, is also evident. Mr Biden noted that Ms Harris once asked him to nominate her for a political role. He also took a veiled swipe at her “fantasy world” plan to provide government-funded healthcare for all without raising taxes on middle-class Americans. The forthright exchanges come amid narrowing polls, with Mr Biden’s lead slashed to just single digits in Iowa and New Hampshire, the first two states to vote, according to new surveys this week. Cory Booker, the Democratic senator for New Jersey, has dubbed Mr Biden the \u0026#39architect of mass incarceration\u0026#39Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator and second-placed candidate who challenge Hillary Clinton for the nomination in 2016, has also seen his poll numbers dropping.Elizabeth Warren, the left-leaning senator from Massachusetts, is now within touching distance of overtaking him in early voting states. The eventual winner will take on Donald Trump at the November 2020 election.Twenty different Democrats will get the chance to make their case during two consecutive debate nights, 10 people in each, in Detroit on Tuesday and Wednesday. For those struggling to get above 1 per cent in nationwide polls time is running out to make an impact, meaning there is more motivation to create ‘moments’ which can dominate TV coverage of the clashes. Mr Biden, who served as eight years as Barack Obama’s deputy, will appear in Wednesday’s debate, as will both Ms Harris and Mr Booker.Ahead of the debate, Mr Biden issued a shot across the bows: If they want to argue about the past, I can do that. I got a past I\u0027m proud of. They got a past that\u0027s not quite so good.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Only Npower, with 30 per cent, scored lower among the UK’s six largest energy suppliers.In February, British Gas blamed the government’s energy price cap as it warned that profits would be lower than forecast.Under the cap, Ofgem sets an upper limit for the annual cost of gas and electricity on so-called standard variable tariffs (SVTs).SVTs are often the default deal that companies switch customers onto after their initial tariff period comes to an end. However they are also among the most expensive deals available, prompting accusations from consumer groups that loyal customers are being exploited.“Centrica’s calamitous financial results come as no surprise to GMB and the announcement to cut another £250m and slash yet more jobs is not the answer – you cannot just cut your way out of crisis.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Only Npower, with 30 per cent, scored lower among the UK’s six largest energy suppliers.In February, British Gas blamed the government’s energy price cap as it warned that profits would be lower than forecast.Under the cap, Ofgem sets an upper limit for the annual cost of gas and electricity on so-called standard variable tariffs (SVTs).SVTs are often the default deal that companies switch customers onto after their initial tariff period comes to an end. However they are also among the most expensive deals available, prompting accusations from consumer groups that loyal customers are being exploited.“Centrica’s calamitous financial results come as no surprise to GMB and the announcement to cut another £250m and slash yet more jobs is not the answer – you cannot just cut your way out of crisis.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The hosts beat Bangladesh by 106 runs to bounce back from defeat to Pakistan in their previous matchHelal Miah, investment research analyst at The Share Centre, said: “Just Eat and Takeaway have complementary portfolios where they don’t currently compete with each other geographically, and the merger indicates the need for consolidation in an industry where economies of scale are all-important.”Just Eat is the largest food delivery company in the UK but analysts have criticised its management’s failure to capitalise on its early dominance of the rapidly growing sector, allowing nimbler rivals like Deliveroo to gain ground.Giles Thorene and Sebastian Patulea, analysts at Jefferies, said Just Eat has not invested heavily enough.The deal with Takeaway demonstrates that the companies recognise that “if any of the European operators are going to outgun Uber, then size does matter”, Jefferies said in a note.Deliveroo rivals shudder as it chows down on Amazon investmentJefferies predicted that Japan’s SoftBank, Amazon or a private equity firm could also come in with a counter-offer.\u0026nbspThe proposed deal is the latest move towards consolidation among online food delivery services. \u0026nbspJust Eat bought its UK competitor HungryHouse in 2018 and last December Takeaway snapped up Delivery Hero\u0027s German business.Uber Eats discussed a takeover of Deliveroo earlier this year but the two sides walked away from any tie-up.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

An unusually high proportion of the fund has been invested in illiquid shares, meaning they could be subject to heavy discounts if a sale is required quickly.Mr Woodford\u0026nbspis also potentially in trouble at another fund he runs: the listed Woodford Patient Capital Trust. On Monday, WPCT\u0026nbspsaid its board will assess “all potential management options” and consider third-party managers.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

White\u0027s goal was England\u0027s second of the match, which they went on to win 2-1In 2018, when English and maths GCSE results were\u0026nbspcompared, poorer students were 18.1 months behind in terms of attainment – widening by 0.2 months since 2017.The report found that the most persistently disadvantaged pupils, those eligible for free school meals for most of their school lives, are nearly two years (22.6 months) behind at the end of their GCSEs – and that gap has increased by 0.4 months since 2011.Researchers say “austerity measures” are partly to blame for the widening of the gap at GCSE.However, primary schools continued to narrow the gap by 0.3 months between 2017 and 2018.David Laws, executive chairman of EPI and former Liberal Democrat schools minister, said the report should be a “wake-up call” for the new prime minister.He said: “We are now witnessing a major setback for social mobility in our country. Recent progress on narrowing the education gap between poor children and the rest has ground to a halt.Thousands of heads to march on Downing Street demanding more cash“The very poorest children are actually further behind now than they were a decade ago – they are almost two years of learning on average behind other children by the time they take their GCSEs.“Educational inequality on this scale is bad for both social mobility and economic productivity.”Julie McCulloch, director of policy at the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), said: “This report makes for grim reading and should be sounding alarm bells in Whitehall.“The fact that the gap in GCSE attainment between disadvantaged students and their peers has not only stalled but widened slightly is likely to be the result of severe financial pressures which have forced schools to cut back on the inidual support they are able to provide to students, as well as cuts to local services for vulnerable families and young people.”Nick Gibb, the school standards minister, said the gap between disadvantaged pupils and their peers had “narrowed considerably” in both primary and secondary in recent years.He added: “We are investing £2.4bn this year alone through the pupil premium to help the most disadvantaged children.“Teachers and school leaders are helping to drive up standards right across the country, with 85 per cent of children now in good or outstanding schools compared to just 66 per cent in 2010, but there is more to do to continue to attract and retain talented iniduals in our classrooms.”North of England\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

My money (figuratively speaking) is on Tommy and Molly-Mae, given how viewers tend to favour the longest-lasting couples and they\u0027ve been together pretty much from the beginning of this season.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspHOWEVER... Amber is a big favourite too and she\u0027s come a long way this series, plus everyone is obsessed with Greg\u0027s Irish accent.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThen there\u0027s Maura and Curtis, who have each arguably had the most tumultuous time on the show (apart from Amber), with Maura one of the most interesting iniduals on the show.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspAnd what about Ovie, everyone\u0027s favourite thanks to his robot arms, breakfast enthusiasm and general refusal to get involved with anyone else\u0027s drama?

One of those, the furthest from the star, is thought to sit in the temperature range that could allow it to support alien life – but its atmosphere is expected to be so thick and dense that it stores lots of heat, and the surface is probably too warm.Scientists hope to learn more about the relatively nearby worlds. As well as being close by and playing host to such unusual worlds, the star is unusually bright, without the solar flares and storms that can sometimes get in the way of observations.“TOI-270\u0026nbspis a true Disneyland for exoplanet science, and one of the prime systems\u0026nbspTESS\u0026nbspwas set out to discover,” Mr Gunther continued.NasaGoddard Space Flight CentreScott Wiessinger)“It is an exceptional laboratory for not one, but many reasons –\u0026nbspit really ticks all the boxes.”There might be yet more planets in this solar system waiting to be found, researchers said.While the planets are interesting enough in themselves, they also link together in a “resonant chain”, according to the researchers who found them. That means that their orbits are lined up neatly in whole integers, meaning that they are in “resonance” with each other.“For\u0026nbspTOI-270, these planets line up like pearls on a string,” Mr Gunther\u0026nbspsaid. “That’s a very interesting thing, because it lets us study their dynamical\u0026nbspbehaviour. And you can almost expect, if there are more planets, the next one would be somewhere further out, at another integer ratio.”Other solar systems have been found with planets that line up in these “resonant” formations. In our solar system, the moons of Jupiter are lined up in this interesting way, too.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

An unusually high proportion of the fund has been invested in illiquid shares, meaning they could be subject to heavy discounts if a sale is required quickly.Mr Woodford\u0026nbspis also potentially in trouble at another fund he runs: the listed Woodford Patient Capital Trust.

What details there are usually come through unconfirmed leaks and the companies officially stay silent on the phones until they are released to the public.But this time around, Google appears to be selectively leaking details of the phone in advance of its release. It has already shown off pictures of what it will look like, and has now shown two of its central features.Today we’re giving you an early look at the technology behind two new features coming to Pixel 4 that make your phone more helpful and represent a next step in our vision for ambient computing, it wrote in a blog post that showed off two of the technologies.The first of those features is a new tool called Soli, which it described as a motion-sending radar.

Over time, new capabilities will come to the phone so that the feature – named Motion Sense by Google – can develop with new software.Such a feature had already been rumoured after some images of the outside of the phone had been leaked by third-parties. Those included a large hole in its front, which prompted speculation that it could fit the radar sensor used to power the Motion Sense feature.Google Pixel 4 leak shows hole for mysterious feature at top of phoneThe second feature is the ability for users to unlock their phone just by using their face. Such a feature is already available in products like the iPhone, but Google said it is engineering it differently.Unlike Apple\u0027s FaceID and other similar devices, Google claims the new phone will be able to use that motion sensing technology to see people are reaching down for the phone before they even touch it. That will be able to wake up the facial recognition sensors, which can then use algorithms to recognise someone as they pick up the phone – before it is even held up to their face.Google stressed that it would focus on security and privacy while designing those two features, and that the data would be kept secure even from Google\u0027s own servers.The blog post ended with a reference to the phone coming out later this year. The handset is expected around October, but Google has given no precise indication of when it will arrive.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The accident remained secret until 1976.Professor Steinhauser said “This time, however, it was a pulsed release that was over very quickly.“We were able to show that the accident occurred in the reprocessing of spent fuel elements, at a very advanced stage, shortly before the end of the process chain,” he said.\u0026nbspThe present-day Mayak plant has been a target for activists, who say managers have not learned the lessons of the 1957 disaster. They claim the\u0026nbspincreased production targets have come at the cost of safety.“Even though there is currently no official statement, we have a very good idea of what might have happened,” Professor Steinhauser said.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

She also talked about the trauma of getting pregnant and having a child, who is now four months old, as a result of the sexual assault.The British government was earlier this month ordered by the High Court\u0026nbspto help her return to the UK on the grounds that its decision to reject her asylum claim had been unlawful,\u0026nbspbecause it was reached by an unfair process which did not give her sufficient time to obtain evidence.She is one of thousands of asylum seekers whose immigration cases were decided under the Home Office’s “detained fast-track” system, which was introduced in 2005 and came to an end in 2015 after the High Court ruled that it was “structurally unfair”.Gay woman wrongly removed from UK ‘gang-raped and feared for her life’The Home Office had booked her\u0026nbsponto a flight just after 4am on Monday, but she\u0026nbspsaid that when she arrived at the check-in she was told she could not board without written evidence that she didn’t require a visa – which she had not been provided with.\u0026nbspThe department said it had been working urgently to resolve the matter and PN was due to board a later flight on Tuesday night.Speaking to The Independent, PN said: “They said I needed something to prove I had a visa waiver. But the High Commission and the Home Office never told me I needed anything. I had nothing to show from the Home Office. They should have got somebody to speak to the people at the airport, something to show them. I don’t know why they didn’t do that.“I had to go back home. I haven’t slept at all. I keep asking myself why have they done this to me. It’s giving me headaches because I’m thinking too much. I can’t even eat, I can’t drink, because I don’t know why this has happened.“I was in the airport, I was happy. I saw the flight. I knew I was going back. Now I feel so afraid.\u0026nbspI don’t even want to move from my bedroom. I don’t want to leave. I’m scared people will know who I am. I just want to get out of this mess. I’m tired of it.”PN, whose full name cannot be disclosed for legal reasons, arrived in the UK in 2011 and claimed asylum on the basis that she was a lesbian and would be at risk of persecution in Uganda. But this was refused and she was removed in 2013 because the Home Office did not believe she was gay.The Home Office has been ordered to facilitate her return to the UK, but is set to appeal the decision, meaning PN faces the prospect of being sent back to Uganda again if the department is successful.Karen Doyle, national organiser of Movement for Justice, a group which has been supporting PN financially since she was removed to Uganda, said: “Being turned away from the flight was frightening and devastating for PN. Having to make her way back to her room in the early hours of the morning after hours in the airport full of anticipation and hope she would be safe in the UK today.“Once again the home office have shown their lack of care and concern for her\u0026nbspsafety. This latest blow for PN is emblematic of the delays, appeals and blocks the Home Office have put in place ever since the order for her return on 24\u0026nbspJune.“It is not acceptable and the Home Office must do everything they can to put this right and get PN out of Uganda.”PN’s return (Phillip Raymond Goodman)It comes as\u0026nbspmore than 400 people staged a protest outside the Home Office building, calling on Priti Patel, the\u0026nbspnew home secretary, to\u0026nbspend the “hostile environment” and deportations.Lucille from the All African Women’s\u0026nbspGroup, a self-help group of women asylum seekers and immigrants, many of whom have been detained in Yarl’s Wood, said: “As women, we suffer particularly from the hostile environment because we are poorer to begin with, are often traumatised from rape and other violence and because we are often mothers with responsibility for other precious human beings.“We face a sexist, racist Home Office and companies that profit from deportation.\u0026nbspWe demand an end to the hostile environment, to detention, destitution and deportations and an end to the separation of families.”Asylum and Immigration\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

She applied for asylum, but this was refused.“I was working for the family. I don’t want to remember that. It’s very hard to talk about, because I want to forget that. It’s not good. It was really hard,” she said.“When I asked for asylum I was refused three times, so I had no\u0026nbspsupport from the Home Office – no house. That was very hard, oh god, very hard. I had to stay with friends. I spent all day outside, and every night a different house.After around five years Sara began to receive help from charities, which provided her with accommodation and financial support, as well as legal advice to re-apply for asylum. She was granted refugee status in January 2019, but says she is still waiting to receive her documents. \u0026nbspShe added: “Then the Red Cross and Ashiana helped me. They gave me a house, food, clothes. They gave me a bus pass as well, and a solicitor.“But I am still waiting for my ID card. I don’t understand – it’s taken eight months, since January. Really I’m tired. It’s been now eight months. I can’t work, I can’t learn English. If you have no papers, it’s very hard.”It comes after The Independent revealed ministers had been accused of prioritising immigration control over survivors’ right to support by knowingly holding victims of modern slavery in removal centres in what experts said was a breach of the law.Home Office ‘illegally put trafficking victims in detention centres\u0027The new report was based on victims supported by the British Red Cross, Ashiana and Hestia as part of a year-long pilot to offer long-term support to survivors across the UK.Half of those supported by the project were female survivors of sexual exploitation, yet most had previously been placed in mixed-sex accommodation where male guests had unregulated access to the property – making them more vulnerable to further exploitation, said the charities.Repeated re-housing also resulted in survivors – 66 per cent of whom had mental health needs –\u0026nbsphaving substantial difficulties accessing treatment and repeatedly falling to the bottom of waiting lists.\u0026nbspMore than half of those supported by the pilot had children, yet their needs were rarely considered in decisions made about their parent, with repeated moves having a negative impact on the children’s wellbeing and education.\u0026nbspThe three charities are now using the findings to call on the Home Office to provide tailored support for at least one year to anyone recognised as a survivor of trafficking under the NRM, as well as leave to remain in the UK for at least 30 months to give people the time to recover and receive the help they need.\u0026nbspThe call comes a month after the Home Office, facing a judicial review of their current policy, was forced to accept that longer-term support is needed for victims of trafficking. But details of what this system will look like are still to be announced.Naomi Philipps, head of policy and advocacy at British Red Cross, said the charity “too often” saw victims without a secure immigration status at risk of falling back into exploitation because they were unable to find somewhere to live or a way to feed themselves.“By implementing the recommendations we make in this report, the Home Office can ensure that being recognised as a survivor of trafficking means that people are protected and given the safety they need to recover and rebuild their lives,” she added.Rachel Mullan-Feroze, service manager at Ashiana said: “This report evidences the need for a flexible response to trafficking and modern slavery which takes into account inidual needs and circumstances.\u0026nbsp“It also highlights how immigration status underpins the ability for a survivor to resettle safely – without which, many survivors are at real risk of re-victimisation.”Abigail Ampofo, operations director at Hestia, warned that without long-term support, many victims were forced back into slavery, allowing the “cycle of abuse” to continue.Created with Sketch.Modern Slavery in the UK Show all 13Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.NCA has launched a touring photographic exhibition which aims to portray the signs of slavery and exploitation.

director of communications warnsClick to followIndy PoliticsTony Blair’s former director of communications Alastair\u0026nbspCampbell has said he no longer wants to be a Labour member, as he warned the party under Jeremy Corbyn‘s leadership faced\u0026nbspan “existential crisis”.In an open letter to the Labour leader, the former No 10 spin doctor claimed Mr Corbyn is unlikely to win a majority if a general election is called in the coming months.Insisting Labour could be “destroyed as a serious political force”, Mr Campbell\u0026nbspmade clear he does not want to rejoin the party.\u0026nbspHe was expelled in May after\u0026nbspsaying he had voted for the Liberal Democrats at the European elections in protest at Labour’s stance on Brexit.In his letter to Mr Corbyn,\u0026nbsppublished today, he wrote:\u0026nbsp”With some sadness but absolute certainty, I have reached the conclusion that I no longer wish to stay in the party, even if I should be successful in my appeal or legal challenge.”The longstanding critic of Mr Corbyn said the party had been “taken over” by Stalinists and Communists, adding:\u0026nbsp “Let’s stop pretending this is the Labour Party we really believe in.”\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Boris Johnson\u0027s cabinet: Who\u0027s in and who\u0027s out Show all 40Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Jacob

resigned as Chancellor of the ExchequerMr Campbell, also a supporter of a Final Say referendum, continued in his letter: “The culture you have helped to create has made the party one that I feel no longer truly represents my values, or the hopes I have for Britain.”He said he does not blame Mr Corbyn for Brexit, something he ascribed to successive recent Conservative prime ministers and senior Tories, but he said the Labour leader does not understand the gravity of the UK’s situation.“I see no sign that you and your office have grasped the seriousness of what is happening, let alone devised or begun to execute a strategy to respond and defeat it,” Mr Campbell wrote.Speaking about his decision on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Mr Campbell also insisted Labour and Jeremy Corbyn are\u0026nbsp”asleep on the job”.\u0026nbsp“This isn’t about being spiteful,” he added. “I think that with Jeremy Corbyn he has got to look deep into himself and say is he up to the job, is he up to the challenge that (he) now faces because if not, we are heading to a very dark, dangerous place with an unbelievably right-wing, populist Government and the answer to which is not a populism of the left.”Johnson to meet farmers in Wales as pound slumps amid no-deal fearsGovernment immigration plan will have ‘devastating’ impact, Khan warnsBoris Johnson admits EU leaders sticking to their

campaigns and of politics, and reading it as I read it now, Labour is facing its own existential crisis... I think there is a danger that we’re going to be destroyed as a serious credible political force unless we face up to the reality of what’s going on.”On Labour’s Brexit policy, Mr Corbyn reiterated at the weekend his support for a referendum on any deal reached with the European Union, and said even if Labour is in government a public vote would be held.He refused, however, to say whether Labour would back Remain or its own negotiated deal if the party came to power.\u0026nbsp“We’ve got to get in office first to negotiate a deal,” he said. “We’ve got to win an election – if we win an election then we’re going to have talks with the European Union. But at the moment, the danger is a no-deal exit on 31 October with all the problems that brings.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The process can be sped up if Labour is in government.Another tactic would be either a no-confidence vote or\u0026nbspmass resignations from the Labour front bench, in order to ramp up the pressure on the Labour leader to quit.In reality, would-be challengers\u0026nbspwill be well aware\u0026nbspthat Mr Corbyn has survived all such\u0026nbspattempts during nearly four years at the helm.He endured a\u0026nbspstring of resignations in 2016 triggered by the sacking of Hilary Benn, who now chairs the Commons Brexit committee.Mr Corbyn lost a confidence vote the same year but he refused to stand down, as he said the ballot did not have “constitutional legitimacy” against an elected leader.The Labour leader then saw off a challenge from Owen Smith in 2016 and increased his mandate, cementing his position further.\u0026nbspMr Corbyn insists he is “not worried” about taking on Mr Johnson\u0026nbspand Labour is ready to fight\u0026nbspthe new Tory leader\u0026nbspat the polls.He will also\u0026nbspreassured by\u0026nbspa recent YouGov survey\u0026nbspthat found more than half of Labour members (56 per cent) said he should lead the party into the next election.But as\u0026nbspMr Johnson steers\u0026nbsphis party towards a no-deal Brexit, while the Liberal Democrats enjoy\u0026nbspa resurgence under\u0026nbspnew leader Jo Swinson,\u0026nbspMr Corbyn, the great survivor, may find the ground shifting.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This meant using WhatsApp on computers would require users to link it to the original device\u0027s account.The new upgrade will mean WhatsApp will work in a similar way to other apps like Facebook, where users can use the same login details across devices, download standalone versions of the app on any and all of their devices and have messages sync between them all.The latest WhatsApp rumour comes courtesy of WaBetaInfo, who claim the new capabilities are currently under development.Created with Sketch.12 useful WhatsApp features you didn’t know existed Show all 12Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.You can unsend a message by tapping and holding it, hitting the Delete symbol and selecting Delete for Everyone.

Not the civil service nor the BBC. Not the House of Lords. Not Tony Blair and John Major and Gordon Brown. Not the Labour Party.And not the combined might of Bob Geldof, Gary Lineker and the bloke who screams, “STOP BREXIT!” in Parliament Square from dawn till dusk.Oh how they all loathed Brexit and everyone who voted for it! They truly believed that those of us who voted to leave the European Union were all thick, racist bigots.There was never any real attempt to change the minds of the .million. There were only sneers, jeers and smears — and the full might of the British establishment committed to stop Brexit from ever happening.Brexit — a true Brexit — has not always seemed inevitable. There have been times over the past few years when the EU looked like the Hotel Calornia, where you can check out but you can never leave.But in the end, it did not matter what they wanted — the elite, the ones with power, the pampered factions of the British establishment, who are totally accustomed to getting their way.Because once the British people had made their democratic decision, Brexit was ALWAYS going to happen in the end.It is more than three years since the nation decided to leave the European Union.But it is only a matter of days that we have had a Prime Minister who actually believes in Brexit.Boris has electried Britain with his vision of a bright, shining future for our country outside of the  rotting EU empire.My heart says Prime Minister Johnson will get Brexit done. So do the bookies.He will probably need a General Election before Christmas to shake up the Parliamentary numbers, but Boris will make it happen.ButBoris can’t do it, then somebody  will make Brexit happen.Brexit is bigger than Boris. Democracy is more important than any one politician.And let the record state: It would have worked the other way around.If the British people had decided in the summer of  that we were staying in the European Union, then no amount of bitching from Brussels-loathing old gits such as myself would have mattered a damn.We would have stayed in the EU for a generation. Our current national debate is not ultimately about leaving or remaining.It is about democracy. And democracy still matters here.Democracy is deep in the British DNA, far deeper than in all those European nations where they have the national memory of a jackboot resting on their throats, far deeper than in all those countries where they have been invaded, occupied and tormented by tyrants.That is why the British establishment, in the end, could not veto Brexit. Sorry, chaps, you can’t dial down democracy. You can’t cancel the will of the people. Not in THIS country.The people decidedIn the end, democracy would not be denied. They could not reverse, overrule or cancel a referendum result in a country that has not been invaded for one thousand years.The will of the establishment — all those ex-Prime Ministers, all those well-heeled big shots, all those Right Honourable members and ermine-clad Lords, all those BBC executives, all those crisp sellers and ex-members of the Boomtown Rats — did not matter more than the will of the people.There is a historical inevitability about this country leaving the EU because, quite simply, it is what the people decided.And no matter what the establishment may believe, the people in this country are not their servants.Our great country is a democracy.Now and for ever, the people are the masters.And that makes Brexit unstoppable.NEW Liberal Democrats leader Jo Swinson wants a second referendum  but admits she would still campaign to keep the UK in the EU evenwe voted to leave yet again.Oh Jo. You may be a liberal. But you are not much of a democrat.Now the cops have dragged Fadi out, kicking and screaming.The property has been secured but worried neighbours say that Fadi could easily get back in with  a ladder.Oh Fadi, you don’t need a ladder. You need a job.And to stop poncing off the generosity of George Michael.THE Conservative Party is now the true representative of the working class.Lefty loons sneer that the Tories are as riven by racism as Labour, that the anti- Semitism that is rotting Labour is matched by Islamophobia in the Conservative Party.But a political party that disliked Muslims would not appoint the son of a Pakistani bus driver to one of the great offices of state – Sajid Javid as Chancellor of the Exchequer.And a party that was inherently racist would not promote Priti Patel – the daughter of Hindu refugees – to Home Secretary.And what a joy to see Esther McVey – who spent part of her young le in a Barnardo’s care home –to the Cabinet as Housing Minister.We may have an Old Etonian as PM, but the Tories are the party of the people now.I AM starting to look forward to an autumn general election.The most devastating put-down that our new Prime Minister made in the House of Commons was the one aimed at John McDonnell.“The Shadow Chancellor!” said Boris, jabbing a finger at McDonnell’s florid, furious face. “Sacked by Ken Livingstone for being too left-wing . . .  sacked for fabricating a budget!”Like every bully who ever lived, McDonnell can dish it out but he sure can’t take it.Jeremy Corbyn suddenly looks more like a candidate for a care home than  Downing Street. But McDonnell could prove to be an even bigger electoral liability to Labour.If that autumn general election comes, the voters must look at McDonnell and ask themselves: Should I really trust a miserable old Marxist with my wallet Perhaps we should send that aid to countries that are not sending rockets to the Moon.Or better still, help the needy in our own country.THE new series of Strictly will be graced by another of the remarkable Mabuse sisters – Motsi Mabuse, Oti’s big sister, who is replacing Darcey Bussell when the th series starts in September.There have been fears expressed that the new judge might favour her kid sister.I can’t think of anything less likely.The three Mabuse sisters – Oti, Motsi and middle sister Phemelo – all danced their way out of riot-torn, apartheid-riven South Africa.They are all dancing pros to the core of their being.Bet your last sequin that Motsi will not do Oti any favours.HOW sad to hear that  Rutger Hauer has died at the age of .

He then took his own le eight years later.Given that one in  of the population identies as gay, this doesn’t exactly seem representative.And that’s probably why @FootballerGay’s account racked up so much support so quickly.The account’s profile said the player was a “proud gay man”. He posted numerous tweets saying his club had been informed of his decision to come out and had been supportive. He tweeted saying that on July  he would reveal his identity.But instead, the account was deleted a couple of days ago. And shortly before that, the bio on the account was changed to read: “I thought I was strong enough. I’m not.”Although his tweets had messages of support from people such as Gary Lineker, lots of other people doubted the authenticity of the account.That includes my husband, an ex professional footballer.His view is that these days no one, from other players to the club, would caresomeone were gay.He should know. He played with Justin Fashanu and says no one in the dressing room had a problem with Justin being gay and he wasn’t treated any dferently to anyone .Still, outside the dressing room, he was singled out.Just one example is the time the owner of the opposing team called him a faggot from the sidelines.Fashanusprinted towards this guy, who got so scared he locked himself in the Press box.Fashanu kicked the door down to find the guy pleading, crying and denying he said anything. Justin could look after himself. But that kind of thing took its toll.Although we’ve moved on since , hearing stories such as that does make you realise why some footballers might think twice about coming out.I don’t carethe Twitter account was real or not. After all, who someone sleeps with is none of my business. Butsomeone wants to come out to the world, it is a terrible state of affairshe thinks he needs to be strong and “brave” to do so.And the reality is that attitudes towards a lot of things have changed over the past couple of decades.I remember when I turned up at the Director’s Box of an away game when I first took over at Birmingham City Football Club in .When I asked where the boardroom was I was told that director’s wives go in the ladies room. When I mentioned that I was the managing director the old boy on the desk put his glasses on, looked at me and said: “Oh yes, you’re that woman . . . stay here and I will find out what to do with you.”Because, at that point, women where banned from entering the boardrooms.That was the first door I ever kicked down. So I know in a very small way how being the first and being dferent to everyone  in football feels.Nowadays I am proud to say there are so many talented women running clubs. And I like to think we have moved on enough that no one would bat an eyelid at a gay footballer.Still, the football world can be a fairly intolerant place for anyone who is anything close to a minority.Maybe it’s the case that until we create a tolerant, accepting environment and culture then footballers won’t feel safe enough to come out.But which will comes first: that . . . or, someone like this being brave enough to admit they are gay and face the possible backlash.Only time will tell.And what I’d really like to see is a football culture in which someone’s sexual orientation really is neither here nor there.DID anyone  wince looking at the photo of the man intercepting his girlfriend’s moment of glory when she was being awarded her degree – to drop down on one knee and propose I guess Edgaras Averbuchas saw it as a romantic gesture but to the onlooker it was just a bit, well, selfish.For a start it looked like he couldn’t bear to let Agne Banuskeviciute have her moment in the sun so muscled in. He attempted to eclipse her huge achievement and make it all about him.Plus, he put her in a very dficult position. I mean, whatAgne wanted to say no Why didn’t he just let her graduate and then ask her in the evening to marry him But also, Agne wasn’t the only person graduating that day – I wonder how everyone  felt about having their big day overshadowed by this big “romantic” gesture Sorry to say that this does not bode well for the relationship.And my advice to this young woman would be to run while you still have the chance and find someone content to allow you to be successful in your own right.[boxout featured-image introI LOVED reading about Mackenzie O’Neill, the -year-old from Canterbury, Kent, who found himself having a bit of a kickabout with Lionel Messi on a Caribbean beach – the stuff that dreams are made of for some kids.]This is the kind of memory that never goes away, but it’s not only children that live for a moment like this. My husband, himself a professional footballer, played on the beach with Diego Maradona about five years agoand he still can’t stop talking about it.[ boxout]KEVIN CASH, once hailed as one of Britain’s most successful property tycoons with a fortune of £million, was declared bankrupt last July with debts of £million.So it is no surprise that he and fourth we Carla are now going to have to make a few changes to their lives.But when you hear that they used to spend £,-a-month on groceries and “housekeeping”, it becomes clear how hard it might be for them to get used to bankruptcy and shopping, presumably, at Lidl.What on earth are they buying  Gold bars to eat Now they’ll be shopping in the bargain bin.As Arsene Wenger used to say about Arsenal’s performances: “One day caviar, and the next cabbage.”WHATEVER you think about Theresa May, no one could deny that she is driven by a sense of duty to the country.So it’s no surprise that she has shed a tear once or twice over the past couple of very dficult months of dashed hopes and disappointments.But what has struck me when she’s been caught crying on camera is how quick people seem to be to triumph over what they see as a sign of weakness.Meanwhile,a man in a position of responsibility is seen to show emotion or shed a tear, he is seen as admirable, noble and passionate.I mean, it’s one thing wearing one in bed, it’s another thing altogether wearing it in bed with a new girlfriend.But to do so on national TV Well, all I can say is, I hope he wasn’t in his socks as well.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And then it happens: Bruce sees me and slowly walks towards me.He leans in and says: “Your book is really beautul.”It was the most incredible rush of euphoria coursing through me. It was beyond amazing to be complimented for my work by someone whose music had meant so much to me for so long.That was eight years ago and now the book has been turned into a movie called Blinded By The Light, which comes out in cinemas next week.The first time I had heard Bruce Springsteen was in . I was , a working-class British Pakistani living in Luton.I had just started at Luton Sixth Form College when I was ­introduced to a Sikh lad called Amolak — who is the character Roops in the film and played by actor Aaron Phagura.Amolak was wearing double denim and he had a pair of headphones tucked up under his turban. I asked him what he was listening to and he said it was Bruce Springsteen.“You mean that guy who makes millions by pretending to be working class,” I joked. Amolak did not laugh.He told me I was an idiot and that Bruce Springsteen was the direct line to all that was true in this world.I was bemused by his passion and so when he handed me a couple of cassettes with Springsteen songs, I promised I would give them a listen.What I heard literally changed my le. In The River, Bruce sings: “I come from down in the valley, where mister when you’re young, they bring you up to do like your daddy done.”This was not like anything I had ever heard. I was a Top  music lover but this sounded less like a song than a short story put to music.I listened to other songs —  like Thunder Road, where he sings: “It’s a town full of losers and I’m ­pulling out of here to win.”My first thought on hearing that line was to wonder whether Born To Run singer Bruce had spent some time in Luton.Springsteen’s music was grounded in reality. His songs were about guys who worked in factories, lived in dead-end towns and wanted a better le.I think the reason he spoke so powerfully to me is that being an Asian teenager in Luton in the Eighties meant that so many of the themes of Springsteen’s songs connected directly to my le.My dad had come to Britain from Pakistan in the early Sixties and my mother and the rest of the family joined him in the spring of .Dad worked on the production line at the Vauxhall car factory and Mum worked as a seamstress at home.Money was very tight so there were no birthday presents or holidays and most of the clothes I wore came from jumble sales.Racism was re. Some of it was explicit, such as the boy who would spit in the face of Asian kids.Sometimes it was more subtle, such as the fact all my friends had Saturday jobs but whenever I tried to apply for one the position would mysteriously not be available.My dad believed that the best way to rise above our circumstances was through ­education. Anything that distracted from studies — friends, music, going to the cinema — was frowned upon.He wanted me to get a respectable job. He would have been delightedI had shown some interest in being a doctor.But I was always dferent.I wanted a le less ordinary and a job that was not just about ­dutul drudgery.That is the basis for Blinded By The Light, which is a semi- fictionalised retelling of my ­childhood. The film is the story of Javedwho is  and longs to become a writer.But this is an impossible dream until a friend introduces him to the music of Bruce Springsteen.That music sparks a fire inside Javed, prompting him to stand up to his dad, find a girlfriend and follow his dream to be a writer.The film is sometimes fictionalised — I didn’t really have a girlfriend back then — but the basic plot is true and I really did end up leaving Luton for Manchester and then became a writer.In  I published my memoir. I toyed with the idea of sending the book to Bruce, but never did — so I had no idea whether he knew the book existed.That was why it was such a delightful shock to learn when I met him at the British Film ­Institute in London in  that not only did he know the book existed, he had read and enjoyed it. When he told me that, I had something close to an ­emotional breakdown.Meanwhile, Gurinder Chadha — the film director I was attending the BFI with — leapt in and told Bruce she was going to direct a film version of the book.Bruce nodded and said ­something along the lines of: “Sounds good.”I poured as much love and heart and authenticity as I could into writing the script, digging into my teenage diaries and poems.Finally it was ready to send to Bruce. This was a nail-biting moment. If Bruce didn’t like it, there was no film, since we needed his consent to use his music. One evening in spring  I got a call from Gurinder saying I had to write a letter to Bruce asking for his music.I sat down and wrote the most important letter I had ever written.It was nerve-racking because I could feel this was one of those fork-in-the-road moments. One road led to getting this film made and the other led to  . . .  who knew Two weeks later, when I was at the Hay Literary Festival, I got a call. Gurinder was ringing to say Bruce had said he was fine with it. We had his approval!In January Gurinder, Viveik Kalra — who plays Javed — and I travelled to Utah for the Sundance Film Festival where Blinded By The Light had its world premiere.It received a rapturous reception and was bought by Warner ­Brothers New Line for a festival record-breaking £million.In the months since, I have ­travelled across the US and Britain attending preview screenings of the film ahead of its general release next Friday.What I have found so extraordinary is the way that so many ­people have taken the film to their hearts. I have lost count of the number of times people have told me the film has left them laughing and crying.In Los Angeles I met a white woman who grew up in a Baptist community in Tennessee with a dream to be a singer which her father did not support. “Your story is my story,” she told me.I met a white man in San ­Francisco who was in his early twenties. He said he has never connected to a film the way he did to this one.My story was connecting with people who had never heard of Luton and had probably never spent any time with Pakistanis — and that felt incredibly humbling.When I was in Luton I felt a connection to America through Bruce’s music.Now, through this film, I hope it can make a connection between those who see it and the world from which I come.The thing I had loved about Bruce’s music was that it felt so specic but it was also universal.I wanted to do that too — to do for Bury Park, Luton, what he did for Asbury Park, New Jersey.The journey from my memoirs, Greetings From Bury Park, to Blinded By The Light has taken  years but there could arguably be no better time for this film to be released than now.We live in deeply ided times and we have leaders who want to exploit these isions.Blinded By The Light is a joyous and timely reminder of the things we have in common and a blast of hope and light in what can seem dark and hopeless times. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I see on it people I once admired behave in a way that erases nearly all respect.Intelligent iniduals make comments they would regretthey had been texts to friends, let alone messages to the whole world.People who once seemed judicious in their judgements behave — at best — like scolds, desperately attempting to ­correct the world for not ­holding precisely the same views as themselves.Yet Twitter has the ability to ­highlight at speed problems only ­noticeable at a slower RPM in the real world.One is the uncomfortable, ever-vanishing line between comment and journalism.While this blurring is not completely new, there was a fine example last week.As news of Boris Johnson’s successful Conservative Party election victory broke, Lewis Goodall — Sky’s political correspondent — tweeted a photo of a television autocue with the caption: “So great to share a set with Black Mirror today.”For those unfamiliar with it, Black Mirror is a Netflix series created by the formerjournalist Charlie Brooker featuring ious dystopian fantasy futures.There is not very much for Goodall or anyone  to gain from this observation.It is possible some people saw it and gave a snort of appreciation.Perhaps somebody somewhere actually laughed. But it is unlikely anyone is still roaring, days later, at the brilliance and perceptiveness of the observation.Like most things on social media, the short-term gain is not worth the cost. For a cost there is, paid in public trust evennot by the tweeter.If broadcasters still cared about the editorial independence of their employees, comments like this would not be made by their journalists.For they further reveal what most of the public has come to suspect — that broadcasters presenting themselves as non-partisan in fact hold very clear political views and that these usually veer in a particular direction.Most, for instance, tend not to be enthusiastic Leave voters who secretly admire Prime Minister Boris Johnson and occasionally let this truth slip. Of course, people have always harboured their suspicions.But not until journalists began to freely give away their thoughts on social media was there such a smorgasbord of evidence.For years, Gavin Esler was the apparently impartial presenter of many leading BBC political shows, including Newsnight, holding people to account whatever his own views.This was back when we viewers did not have access to a presenter’s opinions.Instead, we would have to guess from throwaway remarks or how one interview compared with another.After the Brexit vote, however, it became clear that Esler had strong views about British membership of the EU.Then, this April, he announced his membership and candidacy for the pro-Remain party Change UK.In a speech at its launch and in subsequent media appearances, he turned out to be as partial as it was possible to be.Indeed, some of his political interventions could legitimately be described as “foam-flecked”.Are the public to pretend Gavin Esler pre- was a dferent beast from the Gavin Esler of this year Or do we presume he always held certain views and only broke out when there was a chance to express them while standing — as it turned out, unsuccessfully — as a candidate for the European Parliament By following broadcasters on Twitter, particularly from the BBC and Sky, it is clear to see the barrier is eroding for everyone.When Goodall sent his Black Mirror tweet, the journalist Tim Montgomerie tweeted: “Throughout Sky News we have pundits posing as reporters. Neither Sky execs nor Ofcom seem to give a damn.”In response, Goodall’s Sky News colleague Kay Burley went for Montgomerie herself, tweeting: “You’re an absolute disgrace to our profession. Seriously.”It was, as Montgomerie went on to say, a pretty unprofessional response in itself.But he was right. There is something strange about this whole game.Partly it is so eroding to public trust because it all goes in one direction.On one single occasion in recent years has a television presenter let slip a view that did not fall into lockstep with the narrow orthodoxies of the broadcasting class.When ­Politics Live presenter Andrew Neil sent out one tweet last year mocking the increasingly conspiratorial Observer writer Carole Cadwalladr, he deleted the tweet and himself became a news story.There were swt calls for his sacking and the BBC felt compelled to publicly chastise Neil.Though widely considered the country’s leading ­political interviewer, Neil no longer has a regular slot on the BBC.The incident stands out partly because it is so unusual for a broadcaster not to go in one predictable direction, but also because it was clear that a price must only be paid when the opinions are the “wrong” ones.The breaking of the “fourth wall” — which meant impartial broadcasters refrained from veering into personal political expression — has had a damaging effect on broadcast journalism.Just observing what a broadcaster like Emily Maitlis chooses to retweet tells me more than I want to know about her own political views.These retweets go in the usual direction, and it bothers me not a jot where those views dfer from my own.The trouble is they begin to colour the rest of the work.When Rod Liddle appeared on Newsnight and was roundly harangued and insulted by Maitlis, I did not think: “What a tough interview.”Having seen what Maitlis had tweeted and retweeted in recent months, I simply saw the same views played out in the Newsnight studio.There was no mystery, no separation between impartial interviewer and opinionated tweeter.Will this have an impact  My guess is it already has.And when the broadcast media complains about disappearing trust in their profession, remember — they have only themselves to blame.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This deal has the potential to deliver new markets for great British products and services and lower prices and more choices for British shoppers.We are fast-tracking these deals, and making sure British businesses are ready to trade so they can take advantage of the golden opportunities ahead.The President and new PM Boris Johnson have vowed to work to thrash out a huge new economic relationship between our two countries, the White House said last night.They spoke on Friday - two days after Boris took over at Number  following his Conservative Party leadership election victory.President Trumps press secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement on Monday: President Donald J.

I put this up to try and be helpful, never did I expect it to blow up and me being judged as lazy parent.I filled the basket with everything I bought as an example for the photo, they will not be getting this much each day - however, yes some days they may so shoot me.Also as stated below there is fruit that they are more than welcome to have and have no cap on hence why it’s not in the basket.Speaking to the MEN, she added: It’s so crazy how much this post has blown up.People shouldnt be so cruel and judgemental to people behind a screen, their words can be so damaging.Theyre lucky I’m a strong person and can take the bad comments but the good far outweigh, lighten up enjoy the tip or just scroll on by.Despite the criticism - with some people even slating her sons names - Shannon had hundreds of comments from people praising her idea and saying they would be copying it in their own homes.I saw the idea on Instagram and thought wow that’s great, she said.So we went shopping, the boys picked a few snacks they liked and then when we got home I filled the baskets with one of everything just for an example, they wouldn’t have all of that.I cook homemade meals almost every day, they have unlimited fruit always available and the two are very active so why not let them have treats."},{"url":null,"title":"toddlers feet horrific blisters 10 minutes","story":"Poppy Hallett could not walk properly for up to three weeks after wearing the shoes for the first time.Mum Vikki noticed Poppy limping around the house soon after putting the plastic shoes on.The youngster now shudders when she sees a similar pair of shoes in the shops, after being scarred by her experience.The -year-old was shocked to see the horric blisters that had already formed on her daughters feet.She told Hull Daily Mail said: When I put them on her it was not even hot.

But there were no boats around when this thing surfaced.I never believed in Nessie - but now Im not so sure. What I saw was just weird.It was a dead calm, warm night and this thing broke the surface a few hundred yards away.I couldnt make out a head or anything - but there was something in the middle that was dferent to the rest of it.I watched it for about  seconds. It was moving and disappeared.I dont believe Nessie is a dinosaur or anything like that - but there is something in there for sure.Twelve days earlier Tracy Power, on holiday from Belfast, Northern Ireland, was on a tour.Ms Power, , said: I was on the tourist boat heading towards Urquhart Castle. We had a great day out and thought nothing  of it until I came home and was looking at the photos.I didn’t see the object at the time - I was concentrating on the scenery. It wasn’t a buoy or something similar.I’m a geomorphologist by training so not a believer in the existence of Nessie. However, now I’m really curious as to what I photographed.Maybe Nessie is there after all!The sightings come after a Loch Ness boat skipper logged a large creature on his sonar close to one of Nessies favourite lairs.Mike Bells recording of a -foot long underwater object is the first by sonar for years.It has now been accepted by the Official Loch Ness Monster Sightings Register.Mr Bell, skipper of the Loch Ness Cruises tour boat Nessie Hunter, caught the startling image on sonar near Urquhart Castle.The -year-old had only taken over six months ago from the previous skipper of  years.We were coming to the end of the trip and a family saw the object on the sonar, which we have on display. I looked and couldnt believe it, said Mr Bell.It was my first sighting of Nessie. When we turned around to pick up the contact again we could not find it. It was definitely a moving object and bigger than any fish I know of in Loch Ness.It was exceptionally big. I would like to think it was Nessie. It was at  metres and moving.Regular Nessie webcam watcher Eoin OFaodhagain, , from Co Donegal, Republic of Ireland, also reported seeing two objects on July  at . pm.These sightings are clearly unexplained. It all adds to the mystery, said Gary Campbell, recorder of the Official Loch Ness Monster Sightings Register.But do these latest sightings explain the Loch Ness mystery - No  Do they add to the weight of evidence that there is something happening that is unexplained - yes..The sighting comes around the same time that a mass storming of Loch Ness was planned on Facebook, with about , people say they are going to the event and , interested.It has been inspired by Storm Area , an idea tens of thousands of people could storm a US Air Force base to uncover the truth to a UFO conspiracy.But Loch Ness RNLI is warning of the dangers of the lochs deep water.Concerned that hundreds, or even thousands, of people head out on to the loch for Storm Loch Ness on September , the volunteer crew said it could not match the resources being used by the US military to deal with Storm Area .Although the first sighting is said to have occurred in AD it was only in  that widespread public opinion was sparked.While scientists dismiss claims that there is some sort of prehistoric monster swimming about in the Scottish Highlands others are convinced of its existence.Either way though the story of Nessie is now firmly part of Scottish folklore.Saint ColumbaThe first reported sighting of a monster is said to have been by the Irish monk St Columba in AD. Columba sent a man across the River Ness after stories of a “water beast” had circulated. It’s said that while the man was swimming he was approached by a beast but Columba made the sign of the cross and told the animal to “go no further”.George SpicerModern day interest in the beast was largely sparked by a sighting in July  by George Spicer and his we when they claimed a most extraordinary form of animal crossed the road in front of their car.Surgeon’s photographPerhaps the best-known picture of Nessie is the ‘Surgeon’s photograph’ which was published in April , supposedly showing the animals head and long neck. According to the photographer Robert Kenneth Wilson, he managed to capture the image while he was looking at the lake. The image though was exposed as a huge hoax in the  book, Nessie – the Surgeon’s Photograph Exposed.Holmes videoLab technician Gordon Holmes claimed he had managed to film the monster in  which he described as this jet black thing, about  metreslong, moving fairly fast in the water. Both BBC Scotland and STV aired the footage at the time which marine biologist Adrian Shine described as among “the best footage [he had] ever seen.”Loch Ness RNLI crew has signed off its warning with: Nessie  -  Bandwagon.The first sighting in  of Nessie on January  was the earliest for  years.The latest sighting comes as the professor leading a major scientic study of Loch Ness has suggested that Nessie “might” just be real.Professor Neil Gemmell of the University of Otago, New Zealand, and his team have taken water samples from the loch from three dferent depths on their research vessel Deepscan.The scientists collected DNA left by all creatures from their skin, scales, feathers, fur and faeces.The DNA samples were then sent to labs in New Zealand, Australia, Denmark, and France to be analysed.Mr Campbell, an expert, added: Sightings are now at a level that were being recorded in the s.There are more visitors to the Highlands now so that may have something to do with it.Also, the internet has meant that Loch has never been more watched - and from anywhere in the world.It was in , Mr Campbell saw something resembling a mini whale - with a black shiny back - at the south end of the loch.Since then Mr Campbell has researched and logged over  sightings.He accepted  sightings last year, but one referred to an image taken in  and will be logged for that year - meaning that Nessie was sighted a record  times in .According to Google there are , searches each month for the Loch Ness Monster.The monster mystery was estimated recently to be worth £m to the region.Irish missionary St Columba is first said to have encountered a beast in the River Ness in AD.Among the most famous claimed sightings is a photograph taken in  by Colonel Robert Kenneth Wilson.The image was later exposed as a hoax by one of the participants, Chris Spurling, who, on his deathbed, revealed that the pictures were staged."},{"url":null,"title":"luisa zissman opens up bladder","story":"NewsLuisa Zissman opens up about bladder weakness after embarrassing incidentEx-Apprentice star and mum of three says we need to be less British about bladder problemsShareCommentsByAmy Packer:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL NewsLuisa Zissman first experienced urinary incontinence when she was pregnant with her third child, Clementine\"Get the biggest daily Celebrity Big Brother stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailFor Luisa Zissman, it was one of the most embarrassing moments of her le. And she’s appeared on The Apprentice. While performing a fitness test to qualy for a charity horse race, she lost control of her bladder. “I was doing my ‘bleep test’ where you run back and forth between two beeps which get faster and faster and honestly I had no control,” admits the -year-old from Herts. “I wet myself to the point you could see it. It was a full-on wet patch front and back, in front of  people – including a television film crew with the cameras rolling.    “That was one of the most ­embarrassing things that has ever happened to me, but I’m competitive so I didn’t want to stop running because I didn’t want to fail. All I could say was ‘I’ve had three kids!’. “I just had to try to front it out and said, ‘Guys, we’ve all seen Paula Radclfe do it on TV’. I had worn two pairs of pants and a pad and it still came through.” Luisa first experienced urinary incontinence when she was ­pregnant with her third child, ­Clementine, who is now  months. “I had morning sickness and when I puked I would pee myself. At the time I thought it was the weight of the baby, but about three months after she was born I got a sickness bug and it happened again. “I think having a third baby tipped me over the edge. After Dixie, who is nine, I was fine but I got pregnant with Clementine when my second baby, Indigo, was only five months and she was the trickiest birth. She got stuck and the consultant had to manipulate her to get her out. “I don’t knowmy problem is caused by trauma or just having two consecutive babies very quickly, but now whether I’m sneezing, laughing or running I pee myself. The only forms of exercise I can do without wetting myself are Pilates and horse riding.”   It’s a relief for the Celebrity Big Brother star that she hasn’t had to give up her horse due to the problem – she’s been riding since she was four and this August is taking part in the Magnolia Cup, a charity horse race at Goodwood, to raise funds for Wellbeing of Women.“I’m proud to be racing for an amazing charity,” she says. “They do loads of research into urinary incontinence and chatting about my issue has been really interesting. From what I heard when I visited their offices, Botox might even be able to help me.” Luisa is certainly not alone. Incontinence is a signicant issue for ­approximately three million women in the UK. Six weeks after pregnancy, % of women report urinary ­incontinence and one in three will suffer from it at some point. “I’m quite open about my problem now and just say, ‘Oh my God, I’m peeing’I have an accident around friends. I feel like loads of women actually suffer but don’t talk about it. “Once, while making my podcast, Loose Lips, I laughed so much that my co-host Anna Williamson thought I’d lost control of my bowels as well. But I had peed so much it had made my fake tan run, which had stained my clothes. I had to go and change.” Luisa has used several gadgets to try and solve the problem, “I used this manual Kegel exerciser and one which was a bit like a ­Slendertone. You insert it and it ­electrocutes the muscles but that put me right off so I only used it a couple of times,” she says.

Tony Blairaposs former spin chief branded Labour asleep on the job and said Mr Corbyn has not led on Brexit or anti-Semitism in a blistering attack today.He said the party has been taken over by Stalinists - and claimed they are now crashing it towards a very dark, dangerous place with an unbelievably right-wing, populist Government. Mr Campbell hit out in BBC interviews and a y screed in the New European, where he is an editor-at-large. I no longer wish to stay in the party, evenI should be successful in my appeal or legal challenge, he said. I hope that one day I will rejoin a party that genuinely appeals to the many not the few.It comes after Mr Campbell was expelled from the Labour Party for five years for saying he voted Lib Dem in Mayaposs European elections.   His automatic exclusion - which he previously vowed to fight - prompted a backlash from ideological allies in Labour. And it triggered admissions by a string of grandees that they voted Lib Dem too. Itaposs understood Cherie Blair - the we of former PM Tony - was among those who failed to back Labour in Mayaposs EU elections.At the time Jeremy Corbyn suggested Mr Campbell should pledge loyalty to regain his membership, saying: I look forward to his support for Labour in the future.But in an all-out attack today Mr Campbell addressed his criticisms directly to the Labour leader. He wrote: Your half-hearted approach to the referendum campaign three years ago had a role in Leave winning. Your failure to provide consistent leadership on the issue since then has been a huge disappointment.  Your failure to challenge the lies, crimes and misdemeanours of the Leave campaign your pursuit of Labour versions of unicorns, such as a aposjobs first Brexit,apos your failure to master the detail sufficient to provide confidence to the public, or indeed to Europe, that you would be able to negotiate a better deal your refusal, despite having become leader in large part by promising to listen to members, to do so on Brexit your failure to mount the democratic case for the public having the right to say, given all we now know, whether they wish to proceed - these have all played into the hands of our opponents. Jeremy Corbyn has announced Labour will support a second referendum on any Brexit deal after months of internal wrangling. However, Labour could still go into the next general election vowing to get a Brexit deal with the EU, which would then be put to a public vote.  Mr Campbell told BBC Radio aposs Today programme: I think that with Jeremy Corbyn he has got to look deep into himself and say is he up to the job, is he up to the challenge thatnow faces. Becausenot, we are heading to a very dark, dangerous place with an unbelievably right-wing, populist Government and the answer to which is not a populism of the left.Mr Campbell said new Prime Minister Boris Johnson is trying to clear the decks towards a general election by heaping blame for Brexit failure on Parliament and the civil service."},{"url":null,"title":"mps alarmed government doesnt basic","story":"NewsMPs alarmed as government doesnt have a basic policy for No Deal Brexit tradeBoris Johnson claimed weeks earlier that the odds of No Deal were \"a million to one\" but Michael Gove says its the assumed positionShareByNicola BartlettPolitical Correspondent:,  JUL NewsBoris Johnson has ramped up the rhetoric on No Deal \"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMPs have expressed their aposalarmapos that the government doesnapost have even a aposbasic policyapos for post-Brexit international investment agreements.It comes as No Deal chief Michael Gove said we must operate on the assumption that there will not be a  Brexit  deal on October .

According to the report, the Department told the Committee that it was prevented from formulating such a policy until after Brexit. But the cross-party group of MPs say they have found no credible legal basis for this argument.

Former reporter Lee Cain dressed as our bird to taunt Tories in . But he is now a force in No. One ex-colleague said: “It’s hard to believe.” Cain has been appointed to the key strategic role of Director of Communications - a role held by Alistair Campbell during Tony Blair ’s tenure as PM. The -year-old, who as our chicken taunted David Cameron and his Tory chums as they ducked questions in the run-up to the  general election, has landed the Director of Communications job. He climbed inside the iconic outfit to taunt David Cameron and the Tories at several events around the  General Election. At one point he was pictured being led away by police as Mr Cameron and his we Samantha looked on in the background. He even visited a polling station on election day in  while dressed in the chicken suit – although it is not clear who he backed.    Cain was based at the Mirror HQ in London’s Canary Wharf and worked on our coverage of the  election when he eagerly agreed to wear the famous Mirror Chicken costume. One former colleague said: “Lee was actually a great Mirror Chicken. “He attacked the role with real zeal and a great passion. “The newsdesk were so impressed with his work he was used on a number of occasions. “I vividly remember him coming in to the newsroom and prancing around still in his full outfit like a rooster. “It’s hard to believe that a man with his past of taunting the cowardly Tories is now such a powerful figure inside No .” Mr Cain, , made his name pushing the pro-Leave message and will now help Mr Johnson to get a no-deal Brexit . In reports at the weekend Cain - known as “Caino” - was referred to as a “evil genius” inside Number . The ruthless political spin doctor role was satirised in hit BBC comedy The Thick of It, where Peter Capaldi played foul-mouthed Malcolm Tucker. The character was said to be partly influenced by Alistair Campbell, Tony Blair’s communications chief. Now the former Mirror Chicken will have a key role to play as Boris plans to leave the European Union by October st.  It is not known how much he will be paid, but the PM once described his own £, second salary for writing a newspaper column as “chickenfeed” so he should be OK. His job is to control the flow of information about No Deal planning and make sure everyone working in government press offices sticks with the Government’s “upbeat” messaging. Back during the  election Mr Cain wrote for the Daily Mirror under the headline “Thousands Poll-axed. The Scandal”. His report described how voters in marginal seats were controversially being turned away from polling stations. Mr Cain wrote: “Gordon Brown was said to be furious at the increasing numbers saying they are not allowed to vote. “His spokesman said: ‘The Prime Minister is very concerned by the reports and would support a thorough investigation.” Mr Cain added: “ Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman and Business Secretary Lord Mandelson raised the possibility of US-style legal challenges where voters in the queues were turned away.” A Mirror leader article in the same paper as Mr Cain’s piece said: “The Tories have dramatically regressed into their cocoon of privilege and self-interest.  “And the Labour Party have bravely held the line, emphasising fairness, promoting tolerance and warning against the fiscal outrages lurking in the Tory plans.

Tragically, this kind of treatment is far from unusual. An investigation by animal welfare charities found at least three quarters of zoos and aquariums force their beasts to interact with visitors. They also found lions and tigers forced to perform in shows in ‘gladiatorial’ ampitheatres to entertain large crowds and dolphins used as surfboards by their keepers. Elephants were poked with sticks to force them to play basketball, perform tricks, and give visitors rides. Chimpanzees and orangutans were made to wear nappies and human clothes, ride scooters, and kiss tourists as they posed for photographs.    The charities are now urging tourists to boycott zoos and aquariums that use cruel training methods to force their animals to interact with humans in this way, often causing lasting harm.Audrey Mealia, from World Animal Protection , said: “Seeing wild animals being used purely as circus acts and photos props was more like a horror show.“These ridiculous activities should be a thing of the past.”The new report, The Show Can’t Go On, has been published by World Animal Protection and the Change For Animals Foundation .The charities visited  animal parks across five continents, including attractions in America, Canada, France, Portugal, and Japan. They also examined how animals were used and treated at , zoos around the globe that are affiliated to the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums .    They found % offered visitors the chance to pet the animals, % allowed tourists to walk or swim through the animals’ enclosures, while % used their animals in live shows. Meanwhile, % allowed visitors to hand-feed the animals, while % allowed tourists to ride the animals. This fails to meet WAZA guidelines, which state that modern zoos and aquariums should not participate in animal shows or interactive experiences where animals perform unnatural behaviours. Dr Neil D’Cruze, global wildle advisor at World Animal Protection, said: “Seeing wild animals perform in circus-like shows or pose for photographs is not just a bit of fun. “What might be seen as an enjoyable activity on a day out for the family actually means a letime of suffering for these animals. Cruel and demeaning visitor attractions have no place in any modern zoo or aquarium.” The report did not identy major issues at any UK zoos or aquariums that are members of WAZA.    However, the charities warned that many British tourists would choose to visit parks in other countries which were affiliated with WAZA, either directly or indirectly through national associations, because they wrongly believed that guaranteed the animals were humanely treated. The report advises people not to visit any park that allows visitors to ride, touch, or bathe a wild animals, uses animals as props for photographs or as performers in circus-style shows, or makes animals dress or behave in an unnatural way. Training wild animals to interact with people and perform in shows often involves poking them with sticks, starving them to use food as a reward, or withdrawing social interaction for species like dolphins and elephants which normally live in family groups.    Conditions in zoos that are not affiliated to WAZA can be even worse and the parks may be linked to the illegal wildle trade, the charities warned. Harry Eckman, Director, Change for Animals Foundation, said: “All of these ridiculous activities represent a clear and present danger to the wild animals involved. “Circus-like shows and elephant rides typically involve harsh training methods to establish dominance and the use of wild animals as photo props can inflict stress and injuries. “UK tourists can make a stand by not visiting or supporting these venues. This will send out a clear message – that treating animals in this way is not acceptable.” "},{"url":null,"title":"castaways sought live chilean island","story":"NewsCastaways sought to live on island off Chile by Brit who owns it for £k-a-monthLady Kristyna Drummond-Hay, from Wales, is looking for candidates to live on her familys island, off the coast of Chile, for six monthsShareCommentsByMari JonesMatthew Dresch:,  JUL NewsLady Kristyna Drummond-Hay and her husband Michael Lloyd \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAn aristocrat who famously married a Welsh farmer is offering aspiring castaways the chance to live on her familyaposs uninhabited island for six months in a once in a letime opportunity.Lady Kristyna Drummond-Hay, who lives in Llandudno , Wales, with her husband Michael Lloyd, is seeking six conservation students to take part in the all-expenses paid trip.

The former Arsenal and Celtic star labelled her a apossl*tapos, a apossl*gapos and a aposwh*reapos and turned up at her home in Shotts, Lanarkshire, late at night. Jealous Stokes also demanded to know her whereabouts and pestered her mother, May Scott. Stokes, who has a two-year-old son with Miss Scott, appeared at Hamilton Sherf Court and admitted stalking Miss Scott and her mother between July last year and February. Depute fiscal Lynn McFauld said: Contact was made using six dferent mobile phones all attributable to the UK and one which was an international number.  In July she attended at a friendaposs house for a girlsapos night in and received numerous calls, texts, WhatsApp and Facetime messages from the accused but declined to answer them. She was becoming extremely uncomfortable and agitated by this and eventually accepted a FaceTime message hoping thatshe spoke to him he would desist and let her enjoy her night. He immediately demanded to know where she was and who she was with and was clearly angry and agitated. She turned her phone round the room to let him see her friends and later advised she would speak to him the next day but he continued to try and make contact. The court heard Stokes arrived at May Scottaposs home later the same evening and confronted Miss Scott when she arrived home.    Miss McFauld added: She later received a call from her mother saying she had observed the accused going past the house.

She advised him to drive her to her front door so she could get in and then she and her mother locked and secured the door. The friend reversed out and observed a door of a vehicle opening which caused him to stop and the accused got out and asked aposwhat is that all about apos.  He started walking towards the vehicle and rattled the window with his fist before demanding to know where the complainer had been and why she was being dropped off. The witness was scared as to what might happen next and drove off but as he did the accused kicked the vehicle. This was observed by the complainer who said her stomach was churning as he approached the house before calling her a sl*g, a sl*t, a wh*re and demanded she open the door. She later sent a message saying aposyou are stalking me, leave me aloneapos and later received an email from the accused saying apossorry for my reaction tonight, I just love you too much and snapped tonightapos. Michael Gallen, defending, said: He was working abroad and that may have contributed to him being isolated and the complainer being alone with a young child which put the relationship under strain.    I have discussed the detail of the case with him and he is embarrassed the way he has behaved to the mother of his child. He has apologised and they are both keen to put this behind them. Sherf Alasdair MacFadyen deferred sentence until September for reports and continued bail. He added: You engaged in a course of conduct that caused fear and alarm to your former partner and her mother.

The photo, which has since gone viral on Facebook, shows two white baskets loaded with goodies and a drink dispenser filled with orange squash, Manchester Evening News reports.Though some praised the mother for her witty thinking, other parents were quick to slam her for lazy parenting. Other critics lashed out at her choices of snacks, while others said the children should not be allowed to splurge and help themselves. In her original post, Shannon, wrote: Six week holiday survival kit. One of the hardest times of the holidays is the kids asking for drinks   snacks every  mins so with this idea they can help themselves.    The baskets will be refilled every morning but once it’s gone it’s gone so hopefully this will teach them not to be too greedy and a have bit of independence. Of course this is alongside breakfast, lunch and dinner and fruit is always available for them to help themselves to. After receiving widespread backlash over the post, Shannon edited it, adding: I won’t repeat myself again! I put this up to try and be helpful, never did I expect it to blow up and me being judged as aposlazy parentapos. I filled the basket with everything I bought as an example for the photo, they will not be getting this much each day - however yes some days they may so shoot me.    Also as stated below there is fruit that they are more then welcome to have and have no cap on hence why it’s not in the basket. Speaking to the Manchester Evening News, the -year-old said: It’s so crazy how much this post has blown up. People shouldnapost be so cruel and judgemental to people behind a screen, their words can be so damaging. Theyaposre lucky I’m a strong person and can take the bad comments but the good far outweigh, lighten up enjoy the tip or just scroll on by.

Tragic Lindsay Davies died just four days before her th birthday. She phoned partner Arons Stepans moments before her death on February , telling him: “Look after the kids I love you, I love you, I love you.” The previous evening Lindsay had been argumentative and upset with him as he walked her home after she had been drinking beers with friends She had been drinking beer with her friends in Runcorn, Cheshire, when she became argumentative and upset with her partner, the hearing was told. Arons Stepans woke up the following morning at am to discover a number of missed calls from Lindsay. Calling her back, Lindsay appeared to be distressed and suicidal, so he rushed to her address and broke down her front door when he received no answer. It happened on February  this year, when an oncoming Tesco delivery lorry was driving between junction  and  on the M at mph, where Lindsay jumped out from the hard shoulder, giving the driver no time to react. The Warrington hearing heard that there were no mechanical faults with the HGV, and collision experts who interrogated the CCTV and crash site assessed that the driver would have been unable to prevent the collision as his time to react was “non-existent”.    In a statement read to the hearing, Lindsay’s mother said: “The last time I saw her was on FaceTime on th of February. She seemed absolutely fine and I had no concerns. She went to a local school and then was a carer in the Runcorn area after she left school. She moved to Devon when she was  and stayed for two years, then came back when she was pregnant for support from me and her family. “Lindsay had been up and down over the past few years and had suffered with depression. She’d been prescribed antidepressants at times and following the birth of her daughter, had suffered postnatal depression. “She called me the night of the incident on the phone, asking where she could buy alcohol late at night in Warrington. She said she was out with friends. She spoke of her upcoming birthday and her plans for that, so again, I had no concerns. “Lindsay had a very active social le. All her family and friends have been shocked by what has happened. She’ll be greatly missed but not forgotten. On the th of March we had her cremation and the turnout was such that people had to stand at the back because there wasn’t enough room. I was proud to see how popular she was.” Arons Stepans, Lindsay’s boyfriend of almost two years, said in a statement: “We met through a mutual friend in . It was a casual relationship and at the end of that year she became pregnant and so we tried a relationship and have been together for a year and a half. “In July last year we had a daughter and her eldest daughter came to call me dad and we have a very good relationship. It was an up and down relationship. She often ended it and then we’d get back together. I loved her - she’s the mother of my children. “We had a good relationship, but when it got bad she couldn’t handle it and broke it off. Every time we broke up it hurt me and the kids. The week before she died I went round with the kids and she said she missed me. I said we should take things slow but try to make it work.     “On the night she died she came to my mate’s and we drank some Budweiser. We didn’t talk much. We weren’t really together but I saw her on her phone most of the night. She was crying at the end of the night. I asked her what was wrong and her response was: “Oh, now you care”. “My friends could feel the tension so I walked her home around  or . She was quite drunk but not heavily. She was upset and argumentative with me. I said we should talk tomorrow rather than at night after a drink. I wasn’t aware she had taken drugs. “I walked back to my mateaposs and rang her to check she was okay. I stayed the night at my friend’s and woke up at am to missed calls. I called her back and she sounded suicidal. I ran to her house and broke the door in when I had no answer. I called her back and she said: “Look after the kids I love you I love you I love you.” “She had once before put a belt around her neck pulling it herself. She took a kne from the kitchen and went to stick it in her neck. I had to kick her legs from beneath her to disarm her. I restrained her and she went to sleep. The next morning she apologised and said she’d just been a drunken idiot and it wouldn’t happen again. We worked well together and I loved her to bits.” In a statement read to the inquest, lorry driver Neil Cartwright said: “I’ve been a professional driver since I was . On the night in question I started my journey at .am. “The road was quiet and a little wet although it had stopped raining. I was going - MPH on cruise control. I saw a double decker and a couple of cars but it was quiet. “Coming from the nearside lane about am the collision occurred. I saw an image of two legs and a torso in a similar position to what you would see on a long jump - legs together. “My thought was that it must’ve already been in the air when I hit them. It must have come from the hard shoulder. I couldn’t take any action to avoid the collision. I didn’t have time. “I slowed down and pulled over thinking “what the heck was that ” I wonderedit was an animal, but thinking about the image of what I saw I knew it had to be a human. I called the police and told them I’d just hit a human. “There was damage to the front  on the nearside. I’ve been off work since that day and will be off for some time.

The pair had known each other since around August  and after a period of being friends Mr Morris said they became closer. Mr Morris said Ms Owen was planning to marry Andrews in a black wedding dress and felt she owed him for helping her turn her le around. Mr Morris said: She had tried to tell him that their relationship was over but he just was not listening. She felt it was over because it had gone stale and she did not have feelings for him. Ms Owen had spent the night with Mr Morris on the day before she died and they had planned to meet each other later on December . After Ms Owen died Andrews contacted his father and son telling them he had killed her. The inquest heard he called his father Michael Andrews and said: Dad, Iaposve killed Lana.

The mother, thank God, was able to save herself. Unfortunately, the eight-year-old boy was run over by the ICE. He suffered fatal injuries. The man concerned... fled the station after the crime. Passers-by took up the chase and the man was detained near the station. The man is expected to appear in court today.    The boyaposs mother was taken to hospital and has also been questioned by police.

Firefighters have been battling the blaze in Maspalomas on Gran Canaria for the last few hours. One person has been injured and has received treatment for burns to one of their legs. The fire broke out in a building next to Aqualand at about .pm and families enjoying the water attractions were told to leave immediately before the toxic fumes engulfed the park.  Holidaymakers ran for their lives, most still wearing their swimming costumes and covering their faces with towels. One tourist in the water park, Jorge Rodriguez said: We were able to leave very quickly thanks to the technical and personnel team. A spokesman for the fire brigade said an accumulation of rubbish inside the building made the fire spread rapidly.  Medics and police are also at the scene. Fire personnel searched the premises to make sure no-one was left inside or trapped but the water park itself had been evacuated just after the alarm was raised and before the thick black smoke enveloped the site. The intense smoke was visible from several miles away and numerous people raised the alarm.

It will also keep business rates at a sensible level, at no loss to the council. This will benefit Reform Street and the city centre.”The application by West One, based in the city’s Blinshall Street, is the first by any party to bring the amusement arcade back into use.But the plan comes hot on the heels of a blip in confidence among business owners on Reform Street, who spoken of its “second album syndrome” following a resurgence in food outlets that began with Project Pizza in .The eatery, initially hailed as the shape of things to come, closed without warning last month and the unit is now advertised for let.Proprietors such as Akky Hayat – who runs German Doner Kebab and Fatburger – say punitive business rates are discouraging others from opening shops on the street.Mr Chadwick has not been discouraged. He added: “Footfall is rising and there are positive steps in the regeneration of the area.“The demise of Project Pizza is a minor setback to a street that is on the up.”However, it is hard to ignore the units once home to Victoria Wine, TSB and Swinton Insurance, which have remained conspicuously empty long after they have closed."},{"url":null,"title":"as it happens dundee v inverness caley thistle","story":"Danny Johnson struck on his Dundee debut to send the Dark Blues into the Betfred Cup last  and dump Inverness out.The former Motherwell striker grabbed the only goal of the Group D decider at Dens Park on  minutes.After a cute reverse from Shaun Byrne, the -year-old fired a low shot underneath Caley keeper Mark Ridgers, who perhaps should have done better.Championship rivals ICT end the group in second spot but that was not enough for them to earn a place in the knockout stages, with East Fe grabbing the final best-placed runners-up spot.Dundee will face Aberdeen at Dens Park in the last  but now prepare for their league opener at Dunfermline on Friday night."},{"url":null,"title":"britbox-streaming-service-pricing-announced","story":"UK streaming subscription service BritBoxwill launch later this yearat pound. a month, the BBC and ITV have said."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey - after centuries of mystery."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-new-transplant-system-launch-date-confirmed","story":"LEGISLATION to introduce an opt-out system of organ and tissue donation for deceased donors will come into force in Autumn ."},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-look-back-nightlife-entertainment-glasgow","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Evening Times."},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-look-back-big-nights-glasgow","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Evening Times."},{"url":null,"title":"city-s-first-female-lord-provost-tea-tycoon-greatest-glaswegians","story":"WHO do you think is the greatest Glaswegian of all time  This summer we are showcasing the top  men and woman who have put the city on the map.

That allowed us to build up attacks and play a lot of the game in Chikhura’s half.”Ojo, who played for the entire  minutes in Tbilisi, is set to retain his starting spot against the Georgians in theleg at Pittodrie on Thursday.Bryson is also moving closer to being in contention to start.McInnes said: “I thought Ojo would be able to do  minutes, maybe  in Georgia and he did really well.“Bryson came on earlier than we would have expected, but he used his experience throughout the night.”Aberdeen face a defensive crisis for Thursday’s clash as centre-backs Ash Taylor and Mikey Devlin are both ruled out with hamstring injuries.Left-back Greg Leigh faces a fitness battle to recover from an ankle injury sustained in a pre-season friendly that has ruled the summer signing out of all three Euro ties so far.As the Dons face a defensive injury problem, the club are also braced for further bids for centre-back Scott McKenna.Aberdeen rejected bids of around £ million from Championship outfits QPR and Nottingham Forest.It is understood Forest will come in with an improved offer for the -year-old, who was the subject of a rejected £.m bid from Aston Villa last summer.Aberdeen value McKenna at £m and an approach before Thursday’s tie would not be welcome."},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/07/5d3ac431479602.81990551-441x564.jpg ","title":"adopt a pet can you give one of these animals a new home 28july1","story":"Are you looking to get a new pet  Why not adopt one of these adorable animals from Mrs Murray’s Cat and Dog Home This gorgeous girl is Lexi, who is five-and-a-half years old.This smiley girl loves company, and would like someone at home with her most of the day who she can follow around the house or garden before heading out for a walk exploring and snfing everything.She is not good around cats or small children.Are you an experienced owner who could give this girl the care she needs Zena is five years old and has a mischevious nature.She has been around other dogs previously, but is not suitable to be homed around cats or young children.Zena can be quite the independent girl and will soon let you knowshe doesn’t want to do something.She will need a new owner who has experience of huskies and their sometimes stubborn, strong-willed nature.Bonnie lass Lexi is nine years old and is full of le!This girl loves attention so is not suitable to be homed around children or other pets.Lexi doesn’t have good recall when off the lead so this is something a new owner will need to take into consideration, especially when around other dogs.She is a friendly girl who could be the right companion for you!Mrs Murray#s Home for Stray Dogs and CatsTel:   "},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 7 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsIt is disappointing that Michael Matheson was unable to attend his second A task force meeting in a row.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 25","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFiona McCuish of Ardrishaig captured the VIC puffer wending its way up the Crinan Canal.Fiona used her camera phone as the vessel passed through West Bank, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 28 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat is it with recruiting #professionals# to Argyll We seem to be a distinctly unattractive prospect, as witnessed by the problems with recruiting a dentist in Lochgilphead.What people fail to appreciate is that they stand to gain so much more than they would lose by coming to Argyll.The scenery is unrivalled the pace of le is civilised we are not that far from the central belt and a sense of community remains.Just turn to our front page story for proof.Disappointment at losing out on council grant funding has turned into joy in Tarbert.But only because the people of the village have such big hearts, as they have demonstrated in the past.The council may argue that this vindicates its decision to refuse funding.

Peter O#Neil edged out Penrice in race one, but Penrice would take his revenge in race two and it was all to play for in the final encounter. Peter O#Neil was up to the task and would take the overall, with Penrice a deserved second and  Damian Carter would third.The four stroke class was enthralling, with Sam Sibbald thundering around the Kilmartin track, big Andy Malloch and his Armstrong chasing him all the way to the flag and winning the final race but not the overall. Sam would be the victor followed by Andy and a consistent Keith Stanford third.For the youth class it was a day of mixed fortunes and consistency would be the key, with Jordan Graham coming out on top ahead of James Forrest and picking up a superb third overall was Rhys Brown.Pre- action would see committee man and track builder Grant McClure and his Maico, with three decades of riding under his belt, become the overall winner ahead of Callum Wilson on the superbly prepared Honda.The Twinshock under cc event would be a three race win for the flying Calum Kilgour and his cc Yamaha ahead of Jim Grieve, who would have some bike issues but would bring home his Honda in second fighting off a very persistent David Lawson and Gordon Peterson but it would be Gordon that would hold the third place trophy with some consistent riding.The Twinshock open class event would be a spectacular sight as cc Hondas and Maicos battled their way around the bracken.In race one there was a very small gap between first and second place and a similarly small gap between third. Brian Alexander would take the win from Craig ‘Smitch’ Smith, and John Crawford would come home in third with a notable mention to the very unlucky Paul Chiappa who had his fair share of misfortunes throughout the day, as his seat was torn from his bike at the top of one of the steep climbs. The overall would end up the same as the first race with Brian, taking the win from Craig Smith and John Crawford bringing the big Honda home in third.In the over s class it was a triumphant day for John Lamont with three resounding victories. Johnny Rutherford was second, a great result for the club sponsor, with David Watson bringing home the Honda with some consistent rides.For the group three races Robert Bell took the honours from Allan Shields and Bryan Colligan, all of these riders deserving a notable mention and with some very similar lap times and some quick racing in trying conditions.The clubman class was great to watch, with some fast up-and-coming riders such as Peter Rennie, Callum Laird and Stuart Wilson all angling for the win. Rennie would take the overall from Laird in second and  Wilson in third.The evolution class was again the Paul and Tom show. In what must have been the fastest racing all day, it would be Paul #PJ# Johnston who would take overall honours with three wins and Tom Grant would take the runner-up slot followed home ably by a consistent Roy Potts taking the third place.In the final block of racing it would be a win apiece for Jordan McDonald, Shaun Robertson, and John Kenny, but it would be the ever improving Shaun Robertson, ing from injury, who would take overall honours from a rapidly improving John Kenny in second and #Mr Consistent# Karl Livingstone in third.Results:Group Pre- class:  Grant McClure  Callum Wilson.

He turned Duncan MacKinnon inside-out before flicking an inch-perfect ball to Fraser Watt on the left of the D and he slammed the ball high into the middle of the goal from  yards to make it -.Lochaber had their first shot on goal on six minutes when Ben Delaney found space on the left but his strike went wide of the left-hand post.Inveraray were showing good movement up front and they increased their advantage on nine minutes. The goal came from a corner and Garry MacPherson caught the Lochaber defence napping as he played the ball low from a wide area towards the front post where full centre Lewis MacNicol waltzed into the box and his first-time shot beat the helpless Callum MacDonald to make it -.Lochaber keeper MacDonald pulled off a great save on  minutes as he blocked Garry MacPherson’s fine drive from the left with his chest before clearing the ball to safety.Lochaber’s Ben Delaney and Stuart Callison tested Inveraray keeper Scott MacLachlan but it was the Winterton side who would add a third goal on  minutes. Again the goal came from Lewis MacNicol winning possession, this time deep in Lochaber territory, and he found the ever-alert Garry MacPherson whose defence-splitting pass picked out Fraser Watt running in unmarked through the heart of the Lochaber defence and he slotted the ball low past the keeper from close range.Lochaber were now up against it but, on  minutes, Conor Sweeney took a corner from the right, sending the ball into the danger-area. Stuart Callison found space to slam the ball goalwards and although Scott MacLachlan saved with his feet, he was unable to get the ball away and Ben Delaney was quick to react as he poked the ball over the line to make it - at the interval and give Lochaber hope.Lochaber started the second period with intent and Scott MacLachlan pulled off a great save to thwart Stuart Callison on  minutes.However, Lochaber’s never-say-die attitude got them right back into the match with just  minutes remaining. Lachlan Campbell played the ball across from the right and it came perfectly to the on-running Findlay MacDonald and his  yard shot from the left flew past the keeper to make it -, setting up a tense finishLochaber had a great chance to snatch a point on  minutes when referee John Angus Gillies awarded them a spot-hit, penalising keeper MacLachlan for a “kick” inside the D. Ben Delaney’s well-struck effort went straight down the middle and MacLachlan redeemed himself, saving superbly with his stick before clearing the ball for a corner.Inveraray saw out the rest of the game to claim two valuable points in what was a cleanly fought contest with no cards shown.The win sets Inveraray up for another crucial relegation battle this time at Kilmallie this coming Saturday.Caberfeidh  Kyles Athletic Kyles Athletic came from behind to beat Caberfeidh - in their pm throw up at Castle Leod.Caberfeidh have been on a bit of a scoring spree of late and they took the lead in the opening minute through Craig Morrison.It didn’t take Kyles long to level with Ross MacRae netting on  minutes and Colin MacDonald’s effort on  minutes meant they went into the break - ahead.Ross MacRae got his second on  minutes with Colin MacDonald doing like-wise with just  minutes remaining.Mowi South Division Inveraray  Kyles Athletic The Inveraray seconds and the Kyles Athletic seconds met in a match originally rearranged Thursday  July which was then put back  hours.Kane Kirkhope was playing in a more advanced role for Inveraray and he scored a well-taken goal in eight minutes after some impressive forward play.John MacKenzie was working hard in the middle of the park and he set up Inveraray’s second goal on  minutes. MacKenzie found Campbell Watt who let go a  yard strike which gave the Kyles keeper no chance.Inveraray sealed both points when Campbell Watt continued his good scoring run with his second goal of the game with  minutes remaining."},{"url":null,"title":"skyes the limit for dancer jessica","story":"Janet WestUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWith Highland Games season in full fling, one talented Ardrishaig dancer scooped three first places in three dferent events last week.Eight year old Jessica McCrae, a pupil at Ardrishaig Primary, was crowned winner in the beginners section at Rosneath, Inveraray and Taynuilt Highland Games.

However, this site is unique in Scotland as it represents a very short snapshot in time.#The flint used by the hunters to make their tools would have been collected in the form of small pebbles from the local beaches but because of the general scarcity of flint in Argyll quartz was also used for less fine tools.Towards the Late Mesolithic, around , years ago another band of hunters set up camp at Succoth near Arrochar. The excavation by Argyll Archaeology, for Dunbritton Housing Association, revealed that in contrast to Lochgoilhead, these hunters probably revisited Succoth over  to  year time span and largely made their tools from quartz, presumably because flint was harder to find at the end of Loch Long.Contact Clare Ellis for further information ellisclare@argyll-archaeology or Torben Bjarke Ballin at

sector watchdog, over concerns regarding the purchase of the former Lowood Estate at Tweedbank.Including legal fees and taxes, Scottish Borders Council has spent nearly pound million on purchasing land to the south of the River Tweed with a view to building hundreds of houses and an industrial estate there.The council estimates that developing the estate would cost an extra poundm on top of the price of the land but would potentially generate poundm of gross value added for the regionrsquos economy.However, the SNPrsquos Christine Grahame, who represents Midlothian South, Tweeddale and Lauderdale at Holyrood, has referred the council to Audit Scotland, which acts as an independent regulator for public sector accounts.Ms Grahame highlights a number of concerns regarding the purchase, including the use of tax havens to purchase the land and the fact that the council paid pound.m for the land, which is more than the UK Governmentrsquos district valuer said the land was worth.Despite this, Scottish Borders Council and its  elected members refuse to tell the Borders general public how much more the council paid for the land, and the authority has rejected freedom of information requests for the valuation figure.The pound.m of taxpayersrsquo money used to pay for the purchase ended up in two Cayman Islands accounts, where businesses do not pay transaction tax.Landowner Alexander Hamilton, who sold the estate to the council, was paid via Lowood Estates Ltd and Genesis Trust  Corporate Services Ltd, both of which are based in the British overseas territory.On the other hand, Borders taxpayers face paying a pound, land and buildings transaction tax, as well as a pound, VAT bill, which along with other fees and charges brings the cost of the purchase up to nearly poundm.Scottish Borders Council also confirmed that the cost of temporary borrowing for the purchase sits at pound,, assuming the loan is paid off over a ten year period.Ms Grahame states: ldquoThere is a very big stushie about the purchase by Scottish Borders Council of Lowood estate, partly because the purchase price appears to have been above valuation.ldquoAdditionally, the Tory-led local authority has paid out to landowner Alexander Hamilton via Lowood Estates and Genesis Trust and Corporate Services, based in the Cayman Islands.ldquoSo the purchase price of pound.m for the  acres of land was not subject to transaction tax.ldquoThis means that Borders taxpayers will be forking out pound, in land and buildings transaction tax, plus a pound, VAT bill, which with other fees brings the bill to some poundm.ldquoThere are also challenges to the housing development planswhich are seemingly light on necessary detail, raising serious questions about this Tory councilrsquos grasp of economic reality.ldquoNever mind, pupils may be able to follow this saga on their pound.m iPads.Ms Grahame also highlights a report from Edinburgh-based property consultants Ryden, which the council commissioned, and a report from Chicago-based property consultants James Lang LaSalle, which was commissioned by Middlemede Properties.Middlemede Properties is an Isle-of-Man registered company which owns the salmon fishing along the bank of the Tweed at Lowood.Ms Grahame continues in her column: ldquoIn the meantime, I have read through reams of material, including both the Ryden report on the purchase and a report by JLL.ldquoMy concerns have, as a result, increased, so I have now reported Scottish Borders Council to the Accounts Commission and as it refuses to publish the district valuerrsquos reporthave asked the assessorrsquos office for sight of that.A spokesperson for Scottish Borders Council said: ldquoElected members considered the Ryden report in full, along with a series of other information, in May  and had access to all this information and more ahead of making the final decision to proceed with the purchase of Lowood Estate in December .ldquoThe acquisition of the site by Scottish Borders Council is part of a long term strategy that will enable appropriate development opportunities to be taken forward by both the private and public sector.ldquoScottish Borders Council remains strongly of the view that the economic viability of the site will best be secured through a joint public and private sector approach and is pursuing that approach as agreed by council last December.ldquoThe consideration of economic viability must not just look at the simple cost of the purchase but also the long-term economic benefits of jobs that will be created during construction phases, through employment as part of its mixed use, and through the provision of homes for both local people and those who wish to relocate to this

It would be hard not to notice the single imposing figure of the dersquoil amongst the floral sea of youngsters.John Cockburn, clad in a black cloak and hood, carried the fiery red head of the dersquoil mounted on the top of a stout pole draped in red cloth. Itrsquos an eerily unnerving sight that Irsquom sure sent shivers down the spine of many since it was carved in .To the sounds of the pipes and trumpets, local bands joined the parade which halted briefly near the top of Waverley Road for Dux Boy Aaron Glendinning to hang a wreath at the wall plaque commemorating John Euman, who acted as Master of Ceremonies at the Cleikum for almost  years.This ceremony was repeated at the plaques on the wall of the Burgh Chambers to former Games Chairman Walker McLaren and John A Anderson, one of the instigators of the Cleikum Ceremony.An act of kindness was carried out at the end of the parade as children handed their flowers to committee members which would be delivered to local hospitals.The procession, which opened the nd Anniversary of St Ronanrsquos Border Games, took the form of a massed bands display. St Ronanrsquos Silver Band and Peebles Burgh Silver Band combined to present a most impressive march along Innerleithen High Street just after the Race Roond the Toon.Large crowds lined both sides of the High Street to witness this spectacle. The march played was The Pride of Princes Street. Huge crowds gathered on both sides of the street to support both of Innerleithenrsquos fine bands and to enjoy the music at this yearrsquos Beating of the Retreat.Presiding over the performance was the President of St Ronans Border Games Alan Patterson along with St Ronan and the Dux Girl, Standard Bearer Ronan Caine and Lass Caitlin Urquhart, their supporters, Principal Guest Geraint Florida-James, and his we Sarah, the monks, and the dersquoil.The two town bands marched on together under the expert direction Band Sergeant David Lindsay playing Scotland the Brave. The Pipe Band then performed an excellent Drummerrsquos Call followed by the traditional Retreat marches Greens Hills of Tyrol, The Battles Oer and Lochanside.Next the Silver Band played an upbeat version of the Queen hit, Fat Bottomed Girls which featured one of the bandrsquos percussionists, Cameron McCreadie, on drum kit and soprano cornet player, Simon Railton, as soloists.The Pipe Band followed on with a rendition of their new competition medley set comprising a iety of time signatures, featuring an emotional arrangement of the slow air Mingulay Boat Song.More marches back and forth had the crowds clapping and tapping their feet before it was time for the combined piece, which was a beautul arrangement of The Rose of Kelvingrove featuring Pipe Major Gillie as soloist. The Silver Band then rendered Sunset with Callum Anderson and Callum Robb sounding the calls. The hymn tune Eventide was played by principal cornet player, Callum Robb, and conducted by Band Secretary Keith Belleville.Games President Alan Patterson then gave permission for the Bands to take their leave. To resounding applause, the bands marched off playing On, StRonans, On!.There was only one important task that remained, the matter of the dersquoil. We were honorary torch bearers lighting the way for our neighbours the St Ronanites, to burn an effigy of the dersquoil.I quickly ran to the High Street for a prime view of the black cloaked carrier of the dersquoil, monks dressed in their habits chanting and punching their croziers in the air, Standard Bearer Ronan carrying the Blue Banner. The magic of this ancient tale was brought to le. I can only compare it to watching the village mob with torchlights off to kill the beast in the classic Disney film.The friendly Innerleithen mob halts on Hall Street and the dersquoil strangely disappears out of sight.I think of the Cleikum Ceremony and remark to my husband, who carried out the duties of the Dux Boy in, how nice it is that the old customs and traditions exist today, said exactly as it was since its inception in .He recalls word for word the outgoing speech of the Dux Boy which makes me think back to the words of Principal Guest Geraint Florida-James: ldquoInnerleithen and the Games will be in your DNA forever. Never a truer word. You can take the man out of Innerleithen but yoursquoll never take Innerleithen out of the boy!We begin the climb of Curly Hill to the soul-stirring sounds of the Pipe Band. It is dark and the fire-lit torches have been extinguished. The climb feels never-ending and locals start to sing On St Ronanrsquos On. We finally reach the top and, as I look out over the valley, it is simply breathtaking. Some things are better felt that telt.My eyes are drawn to the dark figure that sits on the pyre. A haunting figure approaches bearing a flame, St Ronan has ed in the form of Aaron Glendinning. The pyre bursts into flames and the crowds on the hillside cheer the effigyrsquos fiery demise.

She was regarded as an lsquoincomerrsquo, however, as she was born at Bolton, a couple of miles away, where she likely spent much of her childhood. When and how she came to Haddington I cannot say, or what her childhood was like, but it seems clear she was poor and for her, le was a struggle.She seems to have found companionship with Elizabeth Golight, who was Haddington born and bred. Perhaps they were neighbours in Haddington. Whatever their circumstances, they drew the attention of others and found themselves in court.This is how they came to the attention of another woman from another century: Ros Parkyn. She sadly died only a few weeks ago, but her le was full of stories and love for people, and she had an especially sharp eye for injustice and empathy for people unfairly treated or judged.Ros was browsing in the John Gray Centre in  and noticed a temporary display of mixed objects and records from their collections. There was a volume of court records laid open for perusal and Ros peered at the entries.The entries hadnrsquot been transcribed but she could just make out that they were accounts of the trials of two women who lived in Haddington in . The th-century handwriting, with its dferent spelling, was very dficult to read in the display case, and so Ros asked the staffit was possible to take the document from the case.A friendly and helpful staff member obliged, then sat down with Ros and assisted her to transcribe the writing. It wasnrsquot easy sometimes they couldnrsquot decipher a word at all, while others seemed to be spelt dferently at dferent times. But gradually, as Ros wrote the words down, she became introduced to Agnes and Elizabeth.There were accounts of others too, but she was particularly taken with the account of these two women, the language used to describe them, and the cruel punishments they suffered.In the account, Agnesrsquos name is spelt in three dferent ways, but was likely Blake or Black.Here is the transcription Ros made:January Agnes Blaik Indweller in Haddington born in the parish of Boulton and Elizabeth Golight, daughter to William Golight, born in this parish being both accused and imprisoned as guilty of lewdness and uncleanliness with many dferent persons. Elizabeth Golight confesses that since Michaelmas last she has been guilty of uncleanliness with several persons and Agnes Blaikie confesses she was formerly convict of uncleanliness and that she was a bad woman ndash But not of late. But acknowledges she lives in a house alone and that there has been dragoons with her in the house. Which being considered by the Magistrates they find Elizabeth Golight is a vicious strumpet and to their certain information Agnes Blaik is a vicious lewd woman. And therefore they ordain both the said Elizabeth Golight and Agnes Blaik be taken to the cross Friday next with the officers and Hangman and there to stand sometime with a paper or sack of theirhellip donating their crime and thereafter be conveyed tohellip with beat of the drum and to be banished forever out of the borough with certicationever they or either one of themto or be seen in this burgh they shall be whipped by the hangman.Signed Andrew Dixon, George Cunningham, Bailies.But it seems the harsh punishment did not prevent them from ing to the town, for Ros came across another two entries:th May Appeared with Janet Golight her mother Elizabeth for repeating acts of lewdness and stealing from Robina Mucklersquos shop. Both found guilty and sent to the House of Correction in Edinburgh to be kept at hard work for  years. Should be whipped by the hangman and burnt on the cheek.th June Agnes Black ed to buy a gown for herself and so was sentenced to be whipped through the town and banished.Ros later sent me her transcriptions, saying: ldquoI love the way Agnes confessed she lsquowas a bad woman ndash but not of latersquo. It rings out over the centuries. And I have a definite dislike for the bailies pronouncing on the lsquovicious strumpetrsquo and the lsquovicious lewd womanrsquo, particularly as there is no mention of any man being named, despite the men being lsquoto their certain informationrsquo!Ros had emailed me the transcription in January  and wrote to me: ldquoI thought it was a tale worth telling and you could weave your magic on it and perhaps find a happy ending.To my regret, I only came across this email last week, as it had somehow remained unopened in my inbox for over two years. I admit to being technically useless on computer matters!But a happy ending  Itrsquos clear both Agnes and Elizabeth had very harsh lives, and on the surface there seems little scope for a truly happy ending.The description of them is misogynistic and full of double standards, as Ros pointed out.So what were these women really like  The writer tries to paint a picture of awful human beings, but the image of poor Agnes secretly creeping back into town, no doubt in a state of desperation, to ldquobuy herself a gown and then being whipped as a punishment gives a dferent story. The punishments for both women are barbaric and utterly unjust.Then I realised that there was a happy ending. That happy ending was in late , when Ros walked into the John Gray Centre and found out about Agnes and Elizabeth. She read the account with human understanding and saw through the prejudice to glimpse at the women themselves and understand just how wrongly they had been treated and judged. And so she spoke up for them and gave them a place in history, while turning the judgment on their accusers.Thatrsquos a happy ending I know Ros would have liked."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-surfer-features-new-advert-carling","story":"The five surfers ndash aged between  and  ndash took on the waves for a national advertising campaign for the beer giant called lsquoMade Localrsquo.Retired roofer Ian McKay, from Whitekirk, was joined by Jason Burnett, Douglas Brown and Dee Ripol, all from Edinburgh, with filming taking place over two days nearly two years ago.

to gear people up for his show.Were you interested in dinosaurs as a child Not just dinosaurs, but anything prehistoric. My first fossil find was on a beach near where I grew up. I was five years old and was on a day out with mum and dad. We wound the fossilised shell of a belemnite, which was a relative of the squid we see alive today. It was over  million years old and that blew my socks off! It made me start questioning where all these ancient animals went, why we donrsquot have dinosaurs around now and how the planet could be so old. Obviously, I loved dinosaurs too and loved reading about them in all my old books, imagining what it would be like to see a T. rex walking through my garden.Why are so many children obsessed with them So many people are obsessed with dinosaurs, both kids and adults alike. Itrsquos hard to pin down exactly why we love them so much and I think itrsquos for a few dferent reasons. First of all, when we are growing up we love to learn lots of facts about things . . . the speed of fast cars maybe or the size of planets in space. Dinosaurs are the same and we love to learn how fast an Allosaurus could run or discover which was the biggest. I also think they inspire us through being so big, fierce and scary but we feel safe because we know dinosaurs can never hurt us because theyrsquore all extinct You are described as an lsquoevolutionary biologistrsquo ndash what exactly does that entail Irsquom a Professor of Evolutionary Biology at the University of East Anglia. Sounds fancy doesnrsquot it but itrsquos the coolest job in the world. The lsquoBiologyrsquo bit just means I get to study all sorts of le ndash it could be anything that is alive or was ever alive, so anything from a chimpanzee or a Troodon, to a butterfly or monkey puzzle tree. The lsquoEvolutionrsquo bit means I study how these living organisms change and adapt over time. How does a changing marine environment affect sharks or how does predation from birds affect camouflage in lizards  All these changes are down to evolution. I study le and how it changes, and I share that knowledge with as many people as possible. Being a scientist means you get to study cool stuff like this every single day.How many books have you written I have written six books so far. My series lsquoSo You Think You Know About Dinosaursrsquo are pretty cool, evenI do say so myself. I wanted them to be the most up to date dinosaur books in  million years and although I wanted them to be enjoyed by young readers, the content should be the same as that which I teach to university students. I know young readers really want to learn and we donrsquot need to dumb stuff down, but with a few more cartoons, quizzes and examples, I think they can be enjoyed by young and older readers. Each book focuses on just one species and it was so hard to pick just six. Eventually, I chose Tyrannosaurus, Triceratops, Stegosaurus, Diplodocus, Velociraptor and Spinosaurus. Therersquos something there for everyone and between them, these dinosaurs really tell the complete story.Herersquos something we all want to know ndash which dinosaur would have been the most dangerous to humans Arrrrrgh, this is such a tough question. Is one T. rex worse than one hundred velociraptors  Even something like a Triceratops could have been deadly. Itrsquos easier to say which dinosaurs would have been safe . . . there wouldnrsquot have been many. Stegosaurus had tail spikes around one metre long, Ankylosaurus had a tail club which could have destroyed a car and Argentinosaurus weighed so much that yoursquod definitely want to be stepped on. And theyrsquore just the herbivores! Imagine what the meat-eaters would have done.And which was the very biggest Ah, this is a question I get asked a lot. There has been huge debate and even some arguments between scientists. Irsquom not going to give it away ndash yoursquoll have to come to my show and find out. Irsquoll give you a clue . . . itrsquos not the one you think it is.What dinosaurs would have roamed around this country many millions of years ago This is a really hard one to answer for each show right now. We had so many prehistoric species that wersquore spoilt for choice now. We had giant sauropods up on the Western Isles in Scotland, early relatives of T. rex in Wales and even the fish-eating Baryonyx on the Isle of Wight. There are also discoveries of marine reptiles such as the dolphin-like ichthyosaurs and super-predator pliosaurs all around our coastlines all the time. The best thing to do is get out there and go have a look or visit your local museum and discover what used to swim, fly, run and plod around near where you live, millions of years ago.Were numbers declining before whatever environmental catastrophe wiped them out about m years ago and would they have become extinct naturally No, they werenrsquot. The Cretaceous period was the third major period of the dinosaurs and they were doing really well. Some of the most well-known dinosaurs were around right about the time when the asteroid struck. It was also the age of the titanosaurs ndash the biggest dinosaurs to ever live. If that asteroid hadnrsquot crashed into the sea just north of Mexico then in all likelihood, things might have been very dferent and you might really have had a Tyrannosaursus in your garden or a Protoceratops in your playground. But remember, the asteroid did not kill all the dinosaurs . . .Have you ever been on expeditions to find dinosaur remains and where are the places most likely to find them I have. My favourite was when I went with Sir David Attenborough to Argentina to film the discovery and excavation of a true dino giant. The great thing about loving dinosaurs and living in the British Isles is that we have so many fossils of dinosaurs and other prehistoric species. There are certain beaches and riversides famous for fossils and you have a very good chance of finding the fossil bones of a prehistoric marine reptile or shark teeth or ammonite shells. You always have to go with an adult and thoroughly plan your trip because fossil hunting can be dangerous but itrsquos so much fun.Do you identy at all with lsquodinosaur expertrsquo characters on film or television There have been some well-known characters on TV who study dinosaurs but usually theyrsquore rubbish. Look at Ross from Friends . . . Irsquom pretty sure he couldnrsquot tell the dference between the head and butt of a Dreadnoughtus. Characters like that donrsquot inspire me. Real scientists are much better and inspire me every day. The men and women who spend their lives digging up fossils and investigating how these animals and plants lived are much cooler than a TV character."},{"url":null,"title":"music-fan-kevin-proves-39-s-popmaster","story":"Kevin OrsquoDonnell stole the show when he appeared on PopMaster on BBC Radio .A score of  out of  was enough to win the quiz on Ken Brucersquos show.Kevin, who runs his own joinery and garden business, told the Courier: ldquoIt was something that I always wanted to do.ldquoI am right into my music and PopMaster is probably the premier music quiz in Britain.The -year-oldrsquos opponent managed a score of , with Kevin declared the winner and receiving the prize of a digital speaker in the shape of an old-style microphone.The prize has taken pride of place in Kevinrsquos West Barns home, with dozens of people getting in touch with him to offer their congratulations since the show was broadcast.He said: ldquoI met Bruce Springsteen in  in Newcastle and I think this is not quite up there with that but it is not far off.The popular radio quiz has been running for a number of years and each contestant is asked  questions based on popular music from the s through to the present day.He said: ldquoI have listened to Ken Bruce for a good  or  years and the last couple of years I have tried to get on the show.ldquoMy kids have always been saying to me to go.ldquoMy son, Conor, is the lead guitarist in The Tesla Coils and we are always discussing and talking about music.The music fan, who spoke to the Courier as he was en route to see American rock legends Kiss perform at the SSE Hydro in Glasgow, played down his achievement and said the questions simply fell in his favour.ldquoYou can get a possible  points thatrsquos the maximum you can score, said Kevin. ldquoThat is based on  questions and it is just general music knowledge.

The second floor would feature six bedrooms, with four bath or shower rooms, and the top floor acting as a managerrsquos flat.The developer has highlighted the poor state of the building and said that the first and second floors were ldquoseriously affected by dry rot and are unsafe.A ldquopriority of repairing the building and eradicating the advancing dry rot has been identied, with the developer keen to bring the building back into use ldquobefore itrsquos too late.Pippa Swan, chairwoman of the townrsquos community council, told the Courier she had previously seen inside the building and it was ldquoin a terrible state of repair.She said: ldquoAnybody that wants to come in and invest high-quality renovation in Dunbar is to be welcomed.ldquoIt is wonderful that the building, which is so prominent, is in line for a facelt.ldquoMy understanding is that the client group is going to be aimed at walkers and surfers and, again, that would be warmly welcomed.Attempts had previously been made to see the building re-open as a hotel.

My mum couldnt understand why I wanted to study English or drama.\":Why we love Glasgows street artHer mother would regularly walk past the University of Glasgow, gaze longingly at its towering spire and tell her daughters that they would one day study there. \"It was almost like she manested it,\" says Dr Krishan, a smile in her voice.\"It was one of her unfinished dreams. My mum had an arranged marriage. She was going to study medicine in India but couldnt because she came to Scotland to be married. Both my sister and I went to the University of Glasgow to study medicine. We are both GPs in Glasgow.\"On paper it sounds like a picture-perfect le trajectory, yet Dr Krishan reveals that in her teens, there was a point when she went off the rails.\"I was a nightmare for my mum and dad,\" she recalls. \"Growing up, I was confused about where I truly belonged. Our summer holidays were always spent in India. I had very much my Indian existence at home, but all my friends were Caucasian.\"There were a lot of restrictions and being told: You cant do this you cant do that ndash what will the aunties think  which I found frustrating. I was always testing the boundaries. I got into trouble at school and was suspended on a couple of occasions.\"When I failed all my exams in third year ndash I got straight sevens in my Standard Grades ndash my mum said she was going to send me to India to finish my studies. She had lost hope. I was given one last chance to turn it around. That was a wake-up call.\"Dr Krishan, who attended Notre Dame High School, knuckled down and achieved the grades to study medicine. \"It was after I became a doctor that I started to feel liberated,\" she attests. \"Then I really felt my wings unclipped after I became a mum.\"The birth of her son Aarish, now six, provided another watershed moment. \"I ended up on a ventilator in intensive care,\" she says. \"My family were told that I didnt have long to live. What happened to me was a complete out-the-blue crisis point in le that gives you a scare.\"She had suffered a postpartum haemorrhage. \"It was a freak, bleed-out episode,\" explains Dr Krishan. \"I went into heart and lung failure, developed clotting issues and widespread sepsis.\"Afterwards, Dr Krishan experienced a le-changing epiphany. \"Everybody around me tried to medicalise me,\" she says. \"Everything was about maybe you need this tablet, when actually all I wanted was support and space to heal. I didnt want drugs to do that.\"I started exercising and eating food to nourish myself inside and out. It is amazing what insights being on the other side of that desk can give you. I ed to work a completely dferent doctor.\"Holistic care is something Dr Krishan regularly applies in her work as a GP. \"I see a lot of poverty and patients living in social isolation, as well as drug misuse. It is quite a challenging population but equally it is a place where you can really make a big dference.\"Around  to  per cent of the things I see as a GP are lestyle-related medical problems. It has become my passion to focus more on the lestyle habits that people form, rather than just the -minute appointment model which is: How can I get you in and out  Can I give you a drug \"She takes her patients on \"Lidl walks\" to share tips on what foods to avoid and how to make healthier choices. Last year, Dr Krishan and a colleague set up Glasgow Wellbeings, a public group where they share their \"health hacks\", which has grown to more than  members.Dr Krishan is married to a fellow GP. \"He started off as an orthopaedic surgeon, but you cant live with me and not become a GP,\" she jokes. Her enthusiasm is clearly infectious, then. \"I would sell it in a jarI could.\"She is currently writing a childrens health book and will make her presenting debut in a forthcoming BBC Scotland medical documentary series due out later this year. Dr Krishan also hopes to pen a memoir about her experiences working as a GP.\"My dream is to write books to help as many people as I can through informed and reflective storytelling in a bid to inspire and empower them along their wellness journeys. I want to bring my Eastern heritage and the wisdom that holds into my scientic Western practice.\":Why we love Glasgows street artThe traditional role of a doctor advocates an evidence-based scientic approach to clinical care. It is important to maintain professional boundaries, yet Dr Krishan strongly believes that patients need compassion too.Such as instinctively hugging a patient who had been diagnosed with advanced bowel cancer. Two weeks later, after the man passed away, his family visited her to say thank you and tell her how much that hug had meant to him.\"Le has been kind to me in that it has taught me lessons ndash sometimes in the most brutal ways,\" she says. \"I have been the vulnerable mum and I have ageing parents, so I understand the pain that brings. I have also lived as a troubled teenager trying to find my identity.\"With this man who was dying of cancer, I was helpless. There was nothing I could do. He knew that and I could see the fear in his eyes. It just felt so intuitive [to hug him] becausethat was my father or grandfather, I would have wanted somebody to reach out and say: Its OK, Im here for you.\"Follow Dr Punam Krishan on Twitter and Instagram at @DrPunamKrishan"},{"url":null,"title":"prince-charles-opens-scotland-s-biggest-ever-offshore-wind-farm","story":"The Beatrice Offshore Wind Farm, located km off the coast of Caithness, will save around eight million tonnes of carbon emissions over  years.The North Sea wind farm, which has been welcomed by environmental groups, was opened by the Duke of Rothesay on Monday.Beatricersquos  turbines will generate MW of energy - enough to power , homes every year, and will play a crucial role in the UKrsquos efforts to combat climate change over the next  years.:Earth Overshoot Day: Weve used up natures  budgetThe pound.bn project is the largest ever single private investment in Scotland and was developed by Scottish-headquartered energy firm, SSE Renewables, along with Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners and Red Rock Power Limited.Construction of the wind farm, Scotlandrsquos single largest source of renewable energy, has provided a pound.bn economic boost to the UK, of which poundbn went directly to Scotland.Jim Smith, managing director of SSE Renewables, said the firm was ldquoincredibly proud of the new development.ldquoWersquore incredibly privileged and honoured to welcome His Royal Highness to Wick today to perform the official opening of Scotlandrsquos largest wind farm, Beatrice, he said.ldquoToday is about celebrating the hard work, innovation, drive and collaboration of thousands of people from across Scotland, the UK and further afield who all played their part in building Beatrice, which is now Scotlandrsquos largest offshore wind farm and the fourth largest in the world.ldquoWersquore incredibly proud itrsquos been delivered on time and under budget, even when dealing with the challenges the North Sea and deep waters bring.ldquoWersquore especially proud of the signicant positive impact Beatrice has already made to the communities of Wick and Caithness, and which will last for decades to come.ldquoThe UK has the biggest offshore wind industry in the world and this world-class offshore project paves the way for future development in Scotland and the UK to help decarbonise our economy while boosting jobs and growth.ldquoMost importantly, Beatrice will save around m tonnes of harmful carbon emissions over its -year letime operation, making one of the most signicant contributions across the UK in combating climate change and meeting our net-zero ambitions.The opening of the wind farm was welcomed by WWF Scotland, who claimed the renewables sector is helping to tackle the worldwide climate emergency.:Earth Overshoot Day is the earliest in historyCharity director Lang Banks said: ldquoScotland is already generating record amounts of power from renewable sources helping us to avoid millions of tonnes of climate-wrecking carbon emissions every year.ldquoThe addition of power from huge offshore wind farms such Beatrice will help us to decarbonise even more of our economy, including our heating and transport sectors.ldquoWersquore in the middle of a climate emergency and renewables will continue to play a critical role in powering the country, creating jobs, and reducing carbon emissions.

One such rule is to limit the use of I, a rule I have already emphatically broken and that I will continue to do.Among his other preferred rules is that Mr Rees-Mogg requires all non-titled males to be referred to as \"esquire\" as a sign of respect. There is no female equivalent of esquire but one perhaps must only be grateful Mr Rees-Mogg allows use of Ms. So modern of him.It, as an aside, is an apparent benefit of having Meghan Markle join the royal family that Ms seems now to be used. Previously, the royal household stuck rigidly to Miss and Mrs. I - there I go again - attended the Garden Party at Holyrood Palace a few years ago, taking my mother as a guest.I put our details both as Ms Stewart. The Ms was rejected and our invites arrived bearing the honoric Miss. Ma Stewart was quite affronted at having an important part of her le erased so quickly and completely while I was quite affronted at having my feminist gas put on a peep.When asked about his style guide, the Honourable Member said, \"Its just a thing listing banned words, which are sort of New Labour words like unacceptable.\" He went on, \"If something is wrong, say it is wrong.\"Who can argue. Plain speaking is a gt in modern times. We have so much baffling claptrap to wade through that even simple things can become entirely inpenetrable - plain speak away. At the same time, you also find find people with unsavoury right wing views boast about their plain spoken ways. Boris Johnson and Donald Trump both would pride themselves on being such.This is where the gt element comes in. They believe they are being direct by failing to pause before engaging their gobs. This means we have an instructively clear insight into how their brains work, failing to keep their racism and sexism hidden. Useful.And so to the Leader of the House of Commons, a bit of the plain speaking there too. \"Just\" and \"banned words\" is quite the telling coupling. Banning words should never be prefaced by \"just\". A ban requires a robust defence, something Mr Rees-Moggs style guide is lacking.Yet, Im prone to support a style guide. For someone with a love of language, a style guide is one of the delights of working on a newspaper and something precious, to be protected. Choice of language says much about attitude and influence it is also a connection to the past, a thread running down through the years.One of the my favourite parts of The Heralds house style guide is \"Never use a French phrase when an English one will do just as well.\"Rees-Moggs soi-disant style guide makes me wondersocial media could do with a bit of a style guide too. When heated debates play out in the public realm Twitter is the  for much of these discussions.And yet, instead of debate being nurtured and furthered, the letter limited medium of conversation naturally forces people to use shorthands, usually deeply unhelpful shorthands that only silence, or at the very least, stymie debate.Think pro-le as a term for those who are anti-abortion. It doesnt quite cover it, does it  Pro-lers are hardly pro the mothers le. If American and Republican, they can hardly claim to be pro any le once it is out of the womb and isnt white and or wealthy.Its a disingenuous phrase at best and dishonest at worst.The issue of independence has come to the fore again with a Boris Johnson prime ministerial term and a looming Brexit ing the issue to the public domain. Can we drop terms like Yoon, and Nat  No matter what your persuasion, either one prompts nothing but hackles to rise and thats the last thing we need at what is a crunch time for the country.TERF - with regards the trans rights debate - is another one. TERF is a slur. Others say it is not. No matter whether you agree it is offensive, it is a tool for shutting down debate. It is a form of threat.It is almost impossible for these shorthands to be satisfactorily explanatory of a persons beliefs.They then become offensive and damage debate by reinforcing prejudices.It must be possible to have lively, robust debate without reducing peoples views to pitul stereotypes.It must be possible to take the sting out of the worst of Twitter debate by being allowed and able to name our own viewpoints without being thoroughly dishonest about what those viewpoints are.How about: Never use a reductive label when treating people as iniduals will do.How about: drop labels, use respect."},{"url":null,"title":"alastair-campbell-no-longer-wishes-labour-member","story":"Mr Campbell was expelled from the party in May after admitting voting Liberal Democrat in the European elections as a protest and had planned to appeal against the decision.But in an open letter to Mr Corbyn, part-published in the , the former Labour spin doctor has now said, ldquowith some sadness but absolute certainty, I have reached the conclusion that I no longer wish to stay in the party, evenI should be successful in my appeal or legal challenge.ldquoThe culture you have helped to create has made the party one that I feel no longer truly represents my values, or the hopes I have for Britain, he told Mr Corbyn in the letter, which is also published in full in the New European.Read More:Nicola Sturgeon accuses Boris Johnson of lacking guts as he dodges protestersMr Campbell said he does not blame Mr Corbyn for Brexit, something he ascribed to successive recent Conservative prime ministers and senior Tories, but he said the Labour leader does not understand the gravity of the UKrsquos situation and was likely to lose a potential general election.ldquoI see no sign that you and your office have grasped the seriousness of what is happening, let alone devised or begun to execute a strategy to respond and defeat it, Mr Campbell wrote.Last week, Mr Corbyn said Labour will ldquocampaign to RemainPrime Minister Boris Johnson puts an unsatisfactory Brexit deal back to the public in a second referendum.ldquoLabour will oppose any deal that fails to protect jobs, workersrsquo rights or environmental protections.

People living with dementia might not remember to drink enough liquids to stay hydrated or wear appropriate clothing for the weather.Prolonged exposure to excessive heat can lead to heat exhaustion, with symptoms including headaches, dizziness, nausea or vomiting, intense thirst, heavy sweating and a fast pulse. It can be le-threateninguntreated.Michelle Supple, director of charity services at Age Scotland said: “While many of us are having fun in the sun, it’s important to remember that warm weather can present health risks, especially for older people.“People with heart or lung conditions, those with reduced mobility or living with dementia can be especially vulnerable when temperatures go up. As we age, it becomes more dficult to regulate our body temperature and this can be exacerbated by some medications.“It’s important to take simple steps to stay cool, including drinking plenty of fluids, limiting strenuous activities, and staying inside during the warmest part of the day. It’s also vital to protect your skin by using sunscreen and covering up with a wide-brimmed hat and loose-fitting clothes.“We would encourage everyone to check on older neighbours, friends and family to make sure they are doing well and seethey need anything. Something as simple as helping open a window or popping to the shops to pick up some sunscreen can make a huge dference to someone’s comfort and well-being.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Volunteer cleaners become citizen scientists, as they also record the litter they find along a designated m stretch of every beach that’s cleaned, and it’s this aspect that has helped MCS change policy and behaviours over the last  years.“Now more than ever is the time to turn awareness into action,# says Catherine Gemmell, MCS Scotland conservation officer. #Everybody is talking about marine litter — you see it on the TV, hear it on the radio and read it in the papers and across social media. We want people to take that awareness and turn it into action by taking part in the biggest beach litter survey and clean up in Scotland! Only by combining awareness with action and data can we make sure that industry and government put in place the urgent measures needed to stop this plastic tide for good.”The p carrier bag charge, a ban on microbeads in wash-off products, consultations on a plastic tax, commitments to depositschemes, a ban on plastic stemmed cotton buds in Scotland and the banning of lantern and balloon releases — have all come about following compelling evidence gathered over decades by volunteers at MCS beach cleans. Cleaning and surveying a beach only takes a couple of hours at most. Each beach has a coordinator, who explains how to fill in a simple data form, and then it’s just a case of grabbing a litter picker and a bin bag and filling it up with rubbish.“Beach litter is a serious environmental problem,” says Lizzie Prior, MCS Beachwatch Officer.“But the solution is in our hands. We want the th Great British Beach Clean weekend to be the biggest ever. The BBC’s Blue Planet II and subsequent programmes have given the UK public a real understanding of the pollution crisis facing our oceans and now people want to make a dference.

Sadly, many are under threat from coastal erosion and the effects of climate change.“SCHARP is doing brilliant work engaging communities with this issue and working to identy and protect sites across Scotland, including a number here in Orkney.  Without the work of volunteers, however, this would simply not be possible. Those who get involved, devoting their time, energy and local knowledge, are due an enormous debt of gratitude.“For example, volunteers in Sanday helped to move and rebuild eroding structures from the Meur Burnt Mound to the local heritage centre, preserving an important cultural and historical attraction. This is just one example of the invaluable work carried out by volunteers that will allow current and future generations a better understanding of their heritage.“I know there is similar great work being undertaken in communities across Scotland and I’ve written to my MSP colleagues encouraging them to find out more about what is happening in their constituencies and regions.

But how can those words be justied Well, the first bit is easy. We have just witnessed the th match in the series and from an Orkney point of view the game and outcome were ‘glorious’. But they haven’t all been like that. Amidst many dazzling encounters there have been some dull, tepid affairs which have failed to raise the pulse rate for supporters of either hue.Ah, but that’s all right. Teams are allowed the odd blip or series of blips, safe in the knowledge that the deep sense of history and tradition built up over a long period of time will cover it. No lasting damage will be done to something so enduring as the annual Milne Cup fixture which is ingrained into the culture of the Northern Isles. It is a game like no other and to play in it represents the pinnacle of most players’ footballing ambitions.So, look at it like this. Despite what those from other sporting disciplines might say, football is the ‘glorious game.’ Orkney versus Shetland is our own ‘glorious game.’ And we have just reached number one hundred.

So now is a good time to ask some fundamental questions about what kind of future we want for tourism.A revamp of Edinburgh’s tourism strategy is under way it will be launched in six months’ time setting out actions planned for the coming decade. Are the right questions being asked  Are the voices of citizens and residents being heard CNN Travel recently identied Edinburgh, alongside Barcelona, Venice, Rome and Amsterdam as global “hotspots” for “overtourism”. The helter-skelter, sky’s the limit, tourist boom we are living through represents a considerable success not just for the tourist industry, but also its partners, the Scottish Government and our local city council. Tourism is seen by the Government as Scotland’s most important industry, employing , people, providing one in  of our jobs, though contributing a less impressive six per cent to the national economy. Edinburgh is crucial to Scotland’s tourism. In , the city accounted for  per cent of overnight trips by overseas visitors to Scotland, and  per cent of all overseas visitor spending in Scotland. For unlimited access to Scotland’s best news, sport and expert analysis, SUBSCRIBE to The Scotsman website here: Edinburgh’s tourism industry urged to act to avoid ‘backlash’With a   per cent split between visits from March-October and the rest of the year, tourism is also less seasonal in Edinburgh than in rural Scotland. Edinburgh’s  tourism strategy sought to increase the number of visitors to the city by a third between  and , from . million a year to . million.By , it was ahead of that target and the “stretch target” was upped to . million a year. So, simultaneously, Scotland’s tourist industry and the revenues it generates for government are dangerously over-reliant on Edinburgh, but also umbilically tied to the city’s further tourist growth. A policy for tourism in Edinburgh is a policy for tourism in Scotland, and vice versa.Amidst economic uncertainties about Brexit, government and the industry will cling to the comfort blanket of growing tourism in Edinburgh. The plunging pound makes Scotland more affordable for international visitors, but Brexit poses problems for tourist businesses, including visa uncertainties and the end of EU-wide free movement in a sector that relies signicantly on non-UK EU workers, and has a disproportionate percentage of employees earning below the living wage. In addition, the prolonged and continuing period of austerity has drained the capacity of local councils to maintain, let alone enhance, the public realm and its attractiveness, not just to residents but to visitors also. Globally, tourism demand is expected to accelerate in the medium term. Therefore, there are good grounds for expecting the number of tourists coming to Edinburgh to continue to increase, and for businesses and government policymakers to seek to attract new visitors, particularly from emerging economies experiencing rapid growth of middle-class incomes and lestyles.A global economic recession may yet blunt the momentum, but this is the lens through which preparation of Edinburgh’s tourism strategy for the next ten years is being viewed. The work is being led by the Edinburgh Tourism Strategy Implementation Group , which has operated since . Its members include Edinburgh council leader Adam McVey and councillor Donald Wilson, convenor of the Culture and Communities Committee. Then there are three senior officials – the chief executive, Andrew Kerr Paul Lawrence, director of place and Jim Galloway, from economic development. Apart from the director of the National Galleries, the other eleven members are from Scottish or local tourism and marketing bodies, including Scottish Enterprise, VisitScotland, Edinburgh Airport, and industry organisation the Edinburgh Tourism Action Group. Though its built and natural environment is Edinburgh’s major attraction, there is no official from Edinburgh’s planning department on the SIG, nor any representation of the conservation or community bodies in the city.Effectively the industry is in charge of making policy for the city, with planning and citizens consigned to near irrelevance. The city council is there as a corporate entity to help tourist businesses to realise their dreams. A key principle of the SIG is stark: “Decisions by the SIG are made for the benefit of the tourism sector in Edinburgh.” Chaired by the council’s chief executive, SIG declares, without any caveats, that it works by “championing the strategy at a senior level” and “aligning the strategy and member organisations’ activity to be inclusive, complimentary and mutually supportive”.The idea that the city council exists to represent and serve the citizens, rather than to give unconditional support to some private businesses and investors, may seem quaint. Similarly, the thought that the council, as the local planning authority, has a duty to take decisions in the public interest, respect the multiple heritage designations that apply in central Edinburgh, and refuse permission for inappropriate development, sits uneasily with an absolutist pursuit of growth in tourist numbers and the infrastructure of hotels, transport, events etc that such growth requires.These concerns about governance and accountability matter since tourism-driven development in Edinburgh has become fiercely contested, just as it has in those other “over-tourism hotspots”. The fate of the old Royal High School and its setting on Calton Hill now rests with Scottish ministers.

Foreign secretary Dominic Raab – one of the members of the XS – said the  referendum result was an instruction to leave the EU with or without a deal. “The mandate certainly wasn’t to leave the EUthe EU let us, it was an in out referendum and we made clear, those on the campaign, that we should strive for a good deal, butthat wasn’t available, that we should go on and make a success of Brexit,” he told the BBC’s Today programme.Speaking in Scotland, Mr Johnson said: “My assumption is that we can get a new deal, we’re aiming for a new deal.“But, of course, Michael is absolutely right that it’s responsible for any government to prepare for a no-dealwe absolutely have to.”Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said it was “disgraceful” to spend the money on advertising for a “totally avoidable” no-deal Brexit while “four million people are in deep poverty”.“Boris Johnson knows no-deal will cost jobs, but the Tories only care about the wealthy elite who fund them,” he said.SNP Treasury spokesperson Alison Thewliss said a £m advertising campaign was a “shameful waste of taxpayers’ cash”. “Boris Johnson has no mandate in Scotland,” she said. “We didn’t vote for Brexit and we didn’t vote for this Tory government.“With public money being thrown down the drain, the Tories must explain why Scottish taxpayers are being forced to foot the bill for a Brexit we do not want.”Mr Johnson’s failure to contact Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar since taking office was branded “discourteous and offensive” by Sinn Fein yesterday.In recent times, incoming UK prime ministers have placed a call with their Irish counterpart on the first day of assuming office.Sinn Fein vice president Michelle O’Neill accused Mr Johnson of “snubbing” Mr Varadkar.“I would judge that it is highly discourteous that the new Prime Minister Boris Johnson is not engaging with the Taoiseach,” she said.

Other events of similar size # even in less challenging locations than Lewis # have come and gone. But the HebCelt remains, steadfast and loyal in the face of changing fashions and changing economic demands.Without the Celtic element, it#s doubtful it would have been able to survive, but as it is it offers something unique in the Scottish music events calendar # both in the kind of acts on show and the setting, with a floodlit Lews Castle over-looking the main site, giving it an ambience all of its own.With up to  acts on show, performing from early afternoon to late at night, it once again provided a veritable feast of Celtic and traditional music. Now some may quibble that the music of KT Tunstall, the headline act, is not Celtic in nature # more pop-rock maybe # but the LA-based singer-songwriter is most certainly Scottish. And she got married in Skye, so that#s enough.Maybe the biggest testament to this year#s festival is that the internationally-renown performer, with a string of hits and albums to her name, did not steal the show as you might expect.Instead the talk of the tent was on the performances from the likes of Elephant Sessions the country and western outfit of The Shires # always likely to prove a hit at an island event # and west coast favourites Manran and Tide Lines.And, of course, there#s the strange phenomenon that is Peat n Diesel, three unassuming local characters whose tongue-in-cheek lyrics # like #Calum Dan and his Transit van# # have captured a mass following, particularly among the youth. They were first scheduled to play in the small acoustics before the hordes of disappointed followers, who were simply unable to get near, persuaded the festival organisers to give them a last-minute billing on the main stage. It was again a hoot, and maybe it#s true after all that #that#s the way we do it in the Western Isles#.But perhaps the real beauty of the HebCelt is that it is about far more than what happens at the main site. From Wednesday to Saturday the town was alive every night into the small hours of the morning. No doubt bar and hotel staff were exhausted in the aftermath, but rather delighted in the sharp spike in takings.The truth is that, while tourist numbers coming to the island are on the rise, the local economy is not performing great. Jobs are scarce, depopulation of the more rural communities re. So the estimated £ million that the HebCelt generates is more than welcome, as well as providing a brief respite from reality and a sense of something major happening on the doorstep.

The play shows a time in history of the bitterness of some people captured through Marie’s writing during that football match. I know there is a percentage on both sides of people who still hold a bit of resentment but hopefully the majority of us have moved on and this piece shows what can happen when we do move on.“This is the first time I’ve done something like this, something on this scale, and it’s the same show, basically on people’s doorstep at the Devenish. We finished a fantastic run at the Lyric Theatre, the Féile is also part of our tour before we head to Derry. The Irish Arts Centre in New York came to see it in the Lyric and there is talk of taking it over to the States for the Irish Arts Festival in February.”Gerard continued: “If people with tickets for the s Night which is happening as part of Féile want to come to the show first, then we wanted to put it out in the Andersonstown News that they can get a ticket half pricethey show their ticket at the door or contact us via sodabreadtheatre@gmail – we can give them a code when booking.“We are really looking forward to bringing the piece to the Devenish and hearing people’s reaction to the work.”A Night in November will be performed at the Devenish Complex on Sunday, August .

They are intent on pursuing a strategy to undermine workers’ pay, terms and conditions as well as imposing price hikes excluding lower income users. There is now a substantial two-tier workforce with increasing numbers of casual workers coming in on poverty pay rates while those previously employed by Belfast City Council are being denied pay uplts, leaving their wages fall ever closer to the legal minimum.“The community has been left behind as well. Last year Unite called a protest against the price hikes and attacks on workers’ pay and conditions on the peaceline which drew signicant cross-community support from both the Shankill and Falls. Working class people are united in their opposition to the council’s austerity-driven policies on leisure services.“Belfast City Council voted to outsource leisure services to this company – they cannot wash their hands of the consequences of that for either the public or their former employees. We call on all parties to reconsider their positions and bring these public services back in-house and give all the GLL workers a decent pay uplt.”A spokesperson for GLL said the company would meet union representatives to “understand the issues they have”.“GLL remains committed to genuine engagement on these matters in the interests of all parties, and to ensure the seamless provision of services across all of our leisure centres,” the spokesperson added.A Belfast City Council spokesperson said: “Belfast City Council is disappointed to learn that strike action is being considered at the city’s leisure centres. Council is committed to working with GLL, its employees and their representatives to ensure the continued provision of leisure services to all our ratepayers across Belfast.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"casement park decision due by the end of year","story":"THE long awaited planning decision for the redevelopment of Casement Park is anticipated to be made before the end of this year. Speaking to the Andersonstown News, following meetings this week with the Department for Communitiesand Ulster GAA, West Belfast MP Paul Maskey said that as “far as I can ascertain, all the information required for this project is in”. He added: “I would be expecting a decision on planning before the end of .”The redevelopment of Casement Park has faced several setbacks since it was first announced in December .The then SDLP Environment Minister Mark H Durkan granted planning approval for the £ million ,-capacity stadium, however, a year later a High Court Judge quashed the planning approval following a successful residents’ legal challenge. The judge ruled that the impact of bigger crowds exiting the stadium had not been properly examined. As of February , Ulster GAA have submitted its revised Casement Park planning application with a reduced capacity of ,.Speaking after a round of top level meetings this week, Paul Maskey told the Andersonstown News: “I met with the DfC on Monday and I’m in constant contact with the Department for Infrastructurewhose Permanent Secretary, in the absence of a department minister, will make the decision on planning for the project. “I met with the Ulster Council in Armagh on Tuesday, and have been meeting with all the stakeholders with regards to Casement Park for a long, long time.“There are around £ million of additional costs to the Casement Park project due to time delay and change of design. DfC are working on the business case to try and find where that additional money will come from. Once the planning decision has been made it means we won’t be sitting further more years waiting on the business case being drawn up,” he said. Mr Maskey said he would be “very disappointed”the planning decision was not made within the next five months. “In all likelihood, in the absence of a minister, it will be DfI’s Permanent Secretary Katrina Godfrey making the decision.”When asked what would he say to those in the community who think Casement will never be built Mr Maskey said: “We are pushing for Casement to get built – I can understand that people say this will never be done because its been frustrating for so long, it has taken all these years to get the project to this stage. “I think the negavity around the project has reduced over the years. The new design has come in, there has been a lot of hard work done behind the scenes to try and get this major investment for West Belfast through. “The GAA have assured us that all the information needed is all in, that there are no outstanding issues at this stage. “There should be nothing that stalls this project back any further.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"reaching new musical heights at the earagail arts","story":"THE Earagail Arts Festival runs every July and brings a wealth of talent to Donegal’s Wild Atlantic Way.The festival has been running this year from July  and will wrap up its calendar of events for another year on Sunday, July . With Belfast’s love affair with Donegal well established, what was once a well-kept secret among the country’s festival-goers is now well and truly on the radar for Belfast music and arts lovers and this year they have been spoiled for choice.At the weekend the festival moved to Arranmore Island for what was billed as the Mór Music # Arts Trail – two days of music, comedy and the spoken word.Crossing over on the Blue Ferry from Burtonport at lunchtime on Saturday passengers were already getting in the mood for the weekend ahead. It was only later that we realised some of them were the artists whowould grace the stage later in the day.Proceedings soon got under way amid the intimate surroundings of Neily’s pub. This is one of the attractions of the Earagail Arts Festival: organisers bring together some of the most talented musicians and artists from around the country and put them before an audience in an accessible setting. Saturday afternoon did not disappoint, with the talented Oscar Jennings – just turned  that day – who, with a mature acoustic set, belied his tender years. The young singer-songwriter had Neily’s in the palm of his hand. Look out for his distinct voice in the years ahead.Conor Mason – also from Derry – and Leila Jane followed, and again their acts were faultless. Switching from guitar to keyboard, Mason’s voice is melodic and haunting, his love songs touching the soul. Singer-songwriter, -year-old Leila Jane from Donegal, once more exemplied the depth of talent in the Irish music scene with hints of Janis Joplin and Patsy Cline hovering above her blues six string.The night was but a pup and we moved on to Early’s pub. Ahead of us –we could stick the pace – was Eve Belle, Delta Fuse and Accidents in the Workplace. A self-proclaimed “singer of sad bops” Eve Belle took us on a journey through the consequences of le. A woman of immense song-writing talent, she’s another one to check out. The evening was brought to a crescendo withblues rock four-piece Delta Fuse from Derry – boy, there’s some talent in Derry these days – and funkmeisters Accidents in the Workplace from Dundalk.After lunch it all began again on the Sunday with more music, this time at The Crossroads. We arrived just as the highly-rated Josie Duncan was wrapping up. However, we would catch-up with the Scots Gaelic singer back in Early’s later. Also playing at The Crossroads was Thatcher of the Acropolis with their unique blend of electronic rock and Gaelic poetry. After a trad session in Phil Ban’s – which coincided with Shane Lowry’s Open win on the big screen – the island was really rocking now, and it was soon back down to Early’s for the final evening. When Dublin poet Stephen James Smith announced from the stage that he would be reading poetry for the next  minutes, there was some uneasy shuffling in the seats, but we needn’t have worried, he had us laughing and crying in equal measure with his poems and stories. Incidentally, Stephen is playing in the Black Box in Belfast on October . Make sure you go along. I’ll be back.Following Stephen we were treated to the haunting Gaelic sounds of Diane Cannon and Manus Lunny, followed by Clann Mhic Ruairi. Another rousing ending to another Arranmore evening was brought courtesy of the impressive Honeyfeet.You can check out the final weekend of entertainment at the Earagail Arts Festival at eaf.ieWe stayed on Arranmore island at Early’s Bed # Breakfast where you will get a great welcome from Jerry and his we Pat.We travelled to Arranmore Island on the Blue Ferry – https:arranmorefastferry tickets "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"sailin away on the crest of a wave","story":"TO understand today’s music scene in West Belfast you have to go way back to brass, reed and silver bands. There were  children in our house, a sure sign you were from the Falls during the s, and St Peter’s Brass and Reed Band and St Paul’s Silver Band featured prominently in our lives.Members of St Peter’s Brass and Reed were affiliated with the Irish Free State Army where they were assigned to the Infantry so they could play in the Army Band. With names like Johnny McCorry, Pat Campbell, Fr Montague et al teaching them the ropes,it was no wonder that most of the Morgan brothers like Pat, Tony and Tom went on to make music a big part of their lives. Tony was a member of ious swing and brass bands while Tom, Pat and his we Ann started The Ballymurphy Martyrs Flute Band which then split to form Éire Nua. Another band on that scene were the Tom Williams Pipers, I’m sure our readers know more.Trombones and French horns, tubas and clarinets were all over our Beechmount house, with band unorms hanging over doors and music stands taking up precious space. We were all encouraged to learn an instrument as our clarinet-playing father Paddy Morgan thoughtwe were ever out of work, especially being Catholic, we could always busk and have our music to fall back on.During the late s through to  our Tom was in a band called ‘The Livin’ Thing’ named after Seamy and Roy Cassidy’s love of ELO. Also in the band with Tom, Seamy and Roy were Angela Hayes, John McKavanagh, Jim Hughes, Willie McAllister and Conor McHugh who has played for Katmandu, The Adventures and many other bands looking a genius keyboard player.Other bands doing the West Belfast circuit during those times were Brendan Hayes’ band The Dodgers, The MSJ Band, Sunshine, The Starjets, Katmandu, the mighty Avalon, Paris, Luv Bug, Kozee, The New Dimension, Glenties Folk Group, Alec Matthews Quartet, Blackwater Boys, Freemen, Baraka and the Rollie Stewart All Stars – and they all played anywhere they could get a booking. Places like The Green Briar, Terry McDermotts, The Sloan’s Club, Market Social, St Matthew’s, Donegal Celtic, The Old Burnt Cabin , Pound Loney Social Club, Andersonstown Social Club, Arlington House , The Inn Place , The Clubhouse , Beacon’s , Pass ‘n’ Grove, The Trocadero, Rossa, Chluain Árd and the infamous Lake Glen Hotel. These nights were usually followed by a fish supper from Aldo’s.During the dark days these groups gave people something to look forward to at weekends, sometimes taking big risks in travelling to ious places usually in clapped out cars, nearly always getting stopped and sometimes getting caught up in tragedies happening on the road. In  Tom was in a car accident near Dundalk. He was transferred to Jervis Street Hospital in Dublin where he died aged just . I know Tom’s family will feel proud when we hear about the talent that stemmed from West Belfast on st August as part of the Andersonstown News’ Greatest Hits Night when we’ll be celebrating the music of those days and remember Tom and all the people who kept the music going during our darkest times – we might even get a fish supper in Aldo’s afterwards!• Jog any memories  Let us know anybody or any place you remember through Text  or email Cathy at c.dobbin@belfastmediagroup"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38358864.ece/92a39/BINARY/Harland_Wolff_protest020.jpg","title":"administration at harland and wolff postponed worker tells rally","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Whilst this remains the case, the BBC must be seen to be impartial on this subject and indeed on any contentious political issue, especially because it is in receipt of licence fee income from all sections of the community, including those whooppose the introduction of such legislation.“Secondly, I find it very disappointing that the senior management of BBC NI has failed to face up to journalists’ questions on its stance, again because it should be seen to be responsive to all sections of the community it seeks to serve.“In my time in BBC management I was proud to debate openly with critics a number of controversial editorial decisions I was involved in, from the commissioning of ‘The Show from the Joker Club’ in the late s to a night of ‘gay-themed’ programming on BBC in the early s.”Mr Kennedy added that it is a privilege to enjoy income from licence fee payers but it brings a huge responsibility as the BBC must be seen to be held accountable.“Bland written statements simply will not do, especially when sections of the viewing public clearly wish to challenge one of your decisions,” he continued.“I firmly believe that the BBC is the best broadcasting organisation in the world and it should be particularly proud of its work over many decades in the challenging circumstances of Northern Ireland.“But on this occasion I believe it has made a mistake in allowing its staff to participate in the Pride festival as BBC representatives.”A BBC spokesperson defended its decision, saying: “BBC Pride is a staff-led initiative that seeks to reflect and support all aspects of workforce ersity.“None of this affects our decision-making about BBC output.“We are committed to serving all audiences and do this within the context of our editorial guidelines.”"},{"url":null,"title":"full of life and fun tributes paid to northern ireland chef who conquered kilimanjaro","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

day of assuming office.Five days after his appointment as Prime Minister, Mr Johnson had not had a conversation with Leo Varadkar.It comes amid heightened tensions between the UK and Irish governments over the Brexit stand-off.Government officials in London and Dublin have been in contact amid efforts to arrange a conversation between the leaders.Arriving at Galway Races, Mr Varadkar said there were no plans for talks with Mr Johnson on Monday.A spokesman for the Taoiseach later said he hoped the men would speak in the “near future”.Sinn Fein vice president Michelle O’Neill accused Mr Johnson of “snubbing” Mr Varadkar.It is concerning that British PM Boris Johnson has failed to make contact with Irish Gov since coming into office.This lack of communication is highly offensive given the disastrous impact that Brexit will have for Ireland.We raised this issue with British SOS Julian Smith. pic yQCZjhNveH— Michelle O’NeillJuly , She raised the matter during a meeting with Northern Ireland’s new secretary of state Julian Smith at Stormont on Monday.“I would judge that it is highly discourteous that the new Prime Minister Boris Johnson is not engaging with the Taoiseach,” she said.“That is highly offensive given the disastrous impact of Brexit on the island of Ireland.”Mrs O’Neill said Mr Smith did not offer an explanation as to why there had been no contact between the prime ministers.She said it was not up to her who made the first move in initiating a conversation.“Whoever phones who first, the issue that needs to be discussed are the implications, the catastrophic implications for the island of Ireland so I think whenever the Taoiseach and Boris Johnson speak at some stage I think the message will be very, very clear from An Taoiseach – which will be around Brexit, the need to protect the Good Friday Agreement, it will be around the fact the withdrawal agreement needs to be adhered to and agreed because this is what the British government negotiated themselves a short time ago,” she said.Is he electioneering, is he bluffing, is he trying to strengthen his hand in a negotiation  I dont know is the answerMichelle ONeill on Boris JohnsonMrs O’Neill added: “British-Irish relations are very important, that does strike right to the heart of the Good Friday Agreement, but the jeopardy that the British government want to bring to our people on this island cannot be understated – it is huge, it’s going to impact for generations to come.”Mrs O’Neill said the rhetoric from Downing Street and the “right-wing cabinet” did not suggest there was going to be a Brexit deal achieved by the October deadline.She said she did not know Mr Johnson’s motivation in threatening to leave the EU without an agreement.“Is he electioneering, is he bluffing, is he trying to strengthen his hand in a negotiation  I don’t know is the answer,” she said.“What I am fixated on, what I am concerned about is what it means for the people here.”The Sinn Fein Assembly member added: “The language we have heard from Downing Street and the cabinet team over the course of the weekend has been very frightening for people on the ground.”Mrs O’Neill rejected the suggestion the Government might move to legislate to introduce direct rule in Northern Ireland ahead of the October  Brexit deadline,devolution has not be restored by then.“Direct rule is not acceptable, we cannot go backwards, we can only go forwards,” she said.The republican leader said she told Mr Smith he could not be a “bystander” in negotiations to restore

It paid more than £.m between April and June this year alone.The Northern Trust was closely followed by the Southern Trust which paid more than £m between   and June this year.The Belfast Trust shelled out almost £m to SNG over the same period, while the Western Trust paid almost £m between   and June this year.The South Eastern Trust had the smallest bill — standing at just under £m for agency nurses from SNG between   and June this year.The figures have come to light just weeks after it emerged that one in six people in Northern Ireland is waiting longer than one year for a first outpatient appointment.Staff shortages and budget cuts are largely to blame for Northern Ireland’s spiralling waiting list shame.At the same time, the Royal College of Nursingin Northern Ireland is campaigning for better pay and conditions for its members in Northern Ireland as an increasing number of nurses are leaving the profession due to burn-out.There are currently around , vacant registered nursing posts in the health service, and a similar level in nursing homes, meaning health bosses are being forced to turn to agencies to keep services running.Paula Bradshaw, the Alliance Party’s health spokeswoman, said: “I have been working closely with the RCN over recent months in lobbying the Department of Health to address the sustainability of the nursing workforce and the high levels of pressure and responsibility placed upon them. data-dfpadtargetingThe Alliance Party’s Paula Bradshaw“Therefore, it is understandable why many qualied nurses opt to work for nursing agencies or, increasingly, work in a full-time job for a health trust, plus register with a nursing agency for bank shts, to supplement their income.“There are a number of issues that need to be addressed — firstly, this immediate one of installing a legislative framework in Northern Ireland that ensures that agencies operate within a controlled environment.“Secondly, we need to stabilise the nursing workforce here by ensuring that their pay and conditions are comparable to agency staff, so that vacancies become less frequent due to stress and unsafe working practices.”RCNdirector Pat Cullen said: “The RCN has continuously highlighted how excessive expenditure on agency nurses is a symptom of the nurse staffing crisis here in Northern Ireland. Addressing this issue is a major priority for our safe and effective care campaign.”The SNG declined to comment. A spokesman from the Department of Health said no cap exists in Northern Ireland to restrict the amount of money medical staffing agencies can charge the health service.When he announced his plans to introduce a cap on agency charges in October , Mr Hunt said: “For too long staffing agencies have been able to rip off the NHS by charging extortionate hourly rates which cost billions of pounds a year and undermine staff working hard to deliver high-quality care.“The tough new controls on spending that we’re putting in place will help the NHS improve continuity of care for patients and invest in the frontline, while putting an end to the days of unscrupulous companies charging up to £, a sht for a doctor.”"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland traffic alerts latest delays and updates","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

But they will also be under pressure to provide specics about how they would improve the lives of Americans by lowering the cost of health care or protecting jobs at a time when the economy is showing signs of sputtering.We need to fundamentally transform our approach to trade—and that means using trade to raise wages and combat climate change instead of padding the bottom lines of big multinational corporations who have no allegiance to America. https:t.co sWLqWabOd— Elizabeth WarrenJuly , The second debate of the Democratic primary has higher stakes for a historically large field of more than  candidates,  of whom will face off each night. For several candidates, the debates will likely offer a last chance to be considered a serious contender for the party’s nomination. Tougher rules set by the Democratic National Committee are expected to narrow the race. To qualy for the next debates in September, candidates must raise money from more donors and hit higher polling thresholds, a bar more than half of the candidates are at risk of missing.We cannot continue to allow private health insurance companies to make massive profits by denying care to those that need it. That is fundamentally immoral and that is why we need Medicare for All.— Bernie SandersJuly , “Everything’s at stake,” said Jill Alper, a Democratic strategist who has worked on seven presidential campaigns. She had simple and direct advice for the White House hopefuls confronting questions about Mr Trump: “protest and pivot” and “pivot quickly” to what they can offer American families.The two leading progressives in the field, Senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, will be at centre stage on Tuesday. The president’s continuing racist attacks on the American city of Baltimore are part of his project to ide America: white versus black, rural versus urban. A president should serve all Americans. This one is busy weakening our country.— Pete ButtigiegJuly , Ms Warren’s campaign has gained ground in recent weeks, partially at the expense of Mr Sanders. The debate could offer a high-profile chance for Ms Warren to prove to Mr Sanders’ supporters that she’s worthy of their consideration.The night will also provide a contrast with more moderate candidates, such as South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, former Texas Representative Beto O’Rourke and Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar, poised to offer themselves as alternatives to the liberals.When I’m president, the middle class and working Americans will not bear the brunt of the burden of paying for Medicare for All. It’s time we ask those at the very top and on Wall Street to start contributing more to America’s health.— Kamala HarrisJuly , Also on stage will be former Colorado governor John Hickenlooper, who has repeatedly said Mr Sanders’ brand of democratic socialism is bad for the party and the country, as well as Ohio Representative Tim Ryan, former Maryland Representative John Delaney, author Marianne Williamson and Montana governor Steve Bullock, who joined the race after the other candidates and did not qualy for last month’s debate in Miami.Wednesday will provide a rematch between former Vice President Joe Biden and Calornia Senator Kamala Harris, who went after Mr Biden during the June debate for not supporting federal bussing orders as a means of desegregation when he was in the US Senate in the s, prefacing her comments by saying: “I do not believe you are a racist.”We’re gathering #TeamJoe in Detroit on July th and st to show the power of our grassroots movement at the second debate. I hope to see you there! RSVP at https:t.co dhRvZbO.— Joe BidenJuly , Mr Biden defended his record but appeared caught off guard by the exchange, a shaky response that could give voters pause about his ability to go toe-to-toe with Mr Trump on a debate stage or otherwise in a general election, said Michigan-based pollster Bernie Porn.“Biden needs to do better,” he said.Several candidates have been putting out policy proposals ahead of the debate, likely as a way to get out in front of rivals’ criticism.Ms Harris, who says she supports Mr Sanders’ plan for Medicare For All, released a proposal on Monday that stopped short of the proposal he and other more liberal candidates are backing. She said she envisions a role for private insurers, Mr Sanders’ plan does not, and she would slow the transition to  years rather than four.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Kamala Harris gave frontrunner Joe Biden a torrid time in the first debates While Mr Sanders will not be on stage with Ms Harris, other advocates of the plan will be, and could take her to task for not going far enough. Mr Biden’s campaign, meanwhile, attacked from another direction, saying that she has been inconsistent and that her plan would undo the Affordable Care Act approved under President Barack Obama and force a large tax increase on middle-class families.Ms Warren on Monday rolled out a trade policy that would propose nine preconditions for US trading partners to meet to participate in agreements, including an end to fossil-fuel subsidies. She did not rule out tarfs, echoing some of the rhetoric Mr Trump used in  as he wooed working-class voters in places like Michigan.Democratic strategist Jamal Simmons said the intramural fight among Democrats is necessary to get a battle-tested nominee who is ready to face Mr Trump on all topics, including race. \" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Whoever wins the Democratic nomination will duel with Donald Trump for the presidency But he said it was important for Democrats not to let the president off the hook for his racial rhetoric and policies, noting: “The Trump factor is always present.” He said Mr Trump’s latest comments blasting Democratic Representative Elijah Cummings and his Baltimore-area district underscore voters’ unease with Mr Trump in the White House.“People argue over whether we are beating up the ultimate nominee, butwe don’t, Trump will,” Mr Simmons said. “People are testing each other. How you stand up under pressure is part of what the judgment is of who’s the best candidate.”The Trump campaign and Michigan Republicans also were readying for the  election, meeting in Lansing for what they said was part of a nationwide effort to train thousands of volunteers.Michigan Republican chairwoman Laura Cox said they were starting earlier than in past election cycles."},{"url":null,"title":"279792","story":"The Derry public has been encouraged to attend a meeting this evening which will call on the government to properly fund rail infrastructure in the North West.People Before Profit Cllr Shaun Harkin commented: \"I want to encourage the broadest possible attendance at Into The Wests meeting in the Guildhall tonight.

Those included Foyle Jobs and Benefits Office on Asylum Road, Carlisle House on Carlisle Road and Orchard House on Foyle Street from early morning until .am.After the picket lines, members gathered for a rally at the City Hotel which began at .am.The -hour strike was organised to highlight an imposed “pay deal” of .% and changes to terms and conditions of employment which union officials claim have been implemented without proper and meaningful consultation.Ms Gates addressed the rally along with Gerry Murphy, President of Irish Congress of Trade Unionsand Niall McCarroll, Chairman of the Derry Trades Union Council .Mr McCarroll addressed a packed room at the City Hotel where he said all workers had taken action to bring about better working conditions.He said the Tory government was “attacking working class communities” and it is time to “fight back” by building solidarity amongst workers. “Let us together build up a working-class spirit and let the Tories know we can bring them down.”Meanwhile, Ms Gates was keen to dispel the notion of civil servants having well-paid “cushy jobs” as an “absolute myth”. She added: “There are civil servants relying on tax credits, second jobs, credit cards to bring them to the end of the month or to pay off debts and those using food banks.”She praised those in the room for leading the way, recognising that many,not all of them, could ill afford to go without pay for the day. “We have to say, enough is enough, they can’t keep piling work on us and saying they can’t even give us a decent pay increase.“Many workers are % worse off than ten years ago in real terms.”Referring to legal action which has been initiated for “failure to consult”, she informed those in attendance, that the judge has decided to forego a pre-hearing by instead fixing a court date.She added that there will be a “few white faces” in the Department of Finance who know their actions have been “discriminatory” as they have been “acting outside the law”. And concluded by saying “it’s time to strike a blow for all workers”.Other members of the audience were afforded an opportunity to speak and one worker, named Amy, said the government does not care about workers standards of living, nor their mental and physical health. She demanded a living wage for all.A motion was put forward by People Before Profit at last month’s full Council meeting calling on the Permanent Secretary at the Department of Finance to provide a “fair and just settlement” which was backed by all councillors.

No details were provided on how existing vegetation will be retained and no bioersity checklist was provided.”The residents also employed planning consultant Lee Kennedy, who told the Council of his concerns that some demolition work to existing buildings on the proposed development site had already taken place, prior to planning approval and that trees had been felled along the rear boundary of the site close to the homes of the objectors.A spokesperson for the Waterfoot residents said: “Mr Kennedy went onto state that residents have expressed genuine fears about a threat to the remaining vegetation on the application site.“He reminded Council that they hold a duty of care to work in the public interest and offer protection to the remaining mature trees, by the serving of a Provisional Tree Preservation Orderunder the  Planning Act.”Mr Kennedy confirmed to the Derry News that he had submitted a request for a TPO from the Council, but “no action had been taken.”However, the Waterfoot Park residents say their fears were heightened again earlier this month when a team of workers appeared on the proposed development site and began to cut down more trees.A spokesperson for the residents told the Derry News: “On Friday, July  at .am the neighbours were woken with the sound of several power saws and saw a full team of tree cutters on site behind them.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“Within an hour they had created absolute mayhem on the site, with trees felled all around and they were left when they fell. The ground and houses nearby vibrated and caused house alarms to go off.“Some neighbours felt very intimidated, shocked and panicked with the suddenness, noise level and by the time of the morning it happened. The residents are up in arms. It should never have been allowed to happen as Council was made aware last year about their responsibility of a duty of care to work in the public interest. The residents feel unsupported to date in their endeavours to the Council.”Addressing the residents’ concerns, a spokesperson for Derry City and Strabane District Council said that: “During the processing of the application,  objections have been received to the proposed development.“Correspondence to the Planning Department from Planning Consultant, Mr Lee Kennedy acting on behalf of the objectors, was received on August ,  and raised concerns regarding the trees on the site, and a request for a Provisional Tree Preservation Orderto be served on the site.“These concerns were raised with the Planning Department’s Tree Preservation Officer on September ,  who advised on September , that in his professional opinion, a TPO was not appropriate for this site given the nature, type and scale of trees.”On April  this year, Planning Department officials met with objectors at the city’s Council offices, where again, the Tree Preservation Officer advised that a TPO was considered but was unnecessary when assessed against the criteria required for a TPO.The Council spokesperson continued: “The site was further inspected by planning officers on June ,  and officers met with objectors on site.“More recently, the case officer wrote to the agent and the applicant on June ,  to advise that further information was required. Amongst other things requested, the case officer advised that a tree survey of the site was required, a landscaping plan to show existing trees and vegetation to be retained and additional planting to be shown and a bioersity checklist was to be submitted to advise on any existing ecology on the site.“The agent confirmed in correspondence dated, July  that a Phase  habitat survey was instructed to be carried out as well as a tree survey and would be submitted in due course.”However, the Council spokesperson added: “The Planning Department were made aware by an objector by email on July ,  that eight trees along the boundary of the site adjacent to properties in Waterfoot Park had been felled on July  at .am.“Council takes its obligations in respect of these matters seriously and has undertaken an appropriate course of action to ensure that the opinions of residents are and will be fully considered in the processing of the planning application.”CAPTION: Residents of Waterfoot Park have accused the Council of failing to provide a duty of care in relation to a proposed building development."},{"url":null,"title":"picture special royal welsh show powys county times camera club stars","story":"A magnicent beast at the Royal RWelsh Show from Mick Pleszkan.\" Picture special from the Royal Welsh Show by Powys County Times Camera Club starsFrom the equine classes at the Royal Welsh Showby Mick Pleszkan\" Picture special from the Royal Welsh Show by Powys County Times Camera Club starsAgony of choice...

Following myfrom maternity leave, I availed of a temporary reduction in hours, working three days per week instead of five.ldquoSo when a colleague was appointed Temporary Head of English, and I was not considered because I was working part-time, I thought it was unfair to be denied the opportunity to be considered for this temporary promotion and the chance to gain that experience. I understand that the demands of the post would mean working full time, but I wasnrsquot given this option.However, the settlement has not detracted from Ms McCormickrsquos enjoyment of working as a teacher as Assumption Grammar School.She added: ldquoI love my job and am happy at the school, so Irsquom pleased that a new co-option policy has been put in place which will ensure that opportunities for career enhancement are dealt with on a formal and procedurally correct manner.In settling the case, Assumption Grammar School said it recognised that it did not give Ms McCormick an opportunity to apply or be considered for the position and disadvantaged her as a part time flexible worker.The schoolrsquos board of governors said it regretted the upset felt by Ms McCormick and looked forward to a continued good working relationship with her.The board of governors confirmed that there will be ldquono disadvantage to her due to the fact that she was unable to avail of the acting up experience, nor will she be victimised in any way.They added that the school would liaise with the Equality Commission on appropriate training in recruitment and selection with specic focus on part-time workers.Anne McKernan, Head of Legal Services at the Equality Commission, said: ldquoThis is a good result all round.ldquoOne of the main reasons we support cases is to effect change. While Catherine missed out on this opportunity, she has been able to secure a change in policy and practice that will benefit other teachers into the future.ldquoItrsquos good that this has been resolved productively and amicably. Wersquore publicising this to remind all employers of the dficulties and dangers of disadvantaging people on flexible or part time working arrangements, even unintentionally.Ms McKernan went on to explain that in Northern Ireland % of female employees worked part-time compared to % of male employees and % of part-time employees were women.She added: ldquoBecause of the high concentration of women in part-time jobs, any measure which excludes part-timers from a particular post or promotion is likely to have a more adverse effect on women and thatrsquos why it may amount to indirect sex discrimination..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch’s French connection  ","story":"ON Saturday the Rowallane and Slieve Croob Community Twinning Group will stage a charity fundraising garden party at the home of Hugh and Violet Hawthorne, opposite the Dairy Lake on the old Belfast Road, Ballynahinch.Special guests will include seven visitors from Lamorlaye in northern France, and interestingly, the Lamorlaye Ballynahinch partnership celebrates its st anniversary this year, dating back to .Connections between Ballynahinch and France are not new some actually existed in the heady days of the Seven Years War and the French Revolution. In , as part of an ongoing world war between France and Great Britain, a substantial French force led by Commodore Franccedilois Thurot invaded Co Antrim, and captured Carrickfergus Castle. The French sustained  dead and  wounded.Two of the wounded French officers, Brigadier Flobert and Major Brajelon, were treated with extraordinary kindness while in Ulster. They convalesced in comfort at Moira Castle in Co Down, before being repatriated to France.It is thought that part of their welcome was owing to their membership of the Freemasons ndash Lord Moira being a Mason himself. Around  mdash at the same time he was entertaining the French mdash Moira planned to move his family headquarters to Ballynahinch, and was busy building his new Montalto House there.Thirty years later Lord Moirarsquos son Francis ndash by now a resident at Montalto mdash was rather less friendly towards the French. In December , as a British Major-General, he led a military expedition to the Royalist deacutepartement of La Vendeacutee, with the intention of reversing the French Revolution. In June , he was back on the Continent, in a successful operation against the French in the Low Countries.With the  rebellion now looming, Franciswas warned his own home town was a hotbed of sedition. Nonsense, he famously declared in the Irish House of Lords: ldquoNo town is so loyal as Ballynahinch!. He was wrong there. In fact the military committee of the United Irishmen, meeting in Armstrongrsquos Inn on Ballynahinch Square, was busy plotting a French invasion of Ireland.The rebel planners communicated with French generals via their Co Down emissaries, Alexander Lowry and Bartholomew Teeling.Lowry hailed from Linen Hill in Katesbridge mdash his house is still there mdash and Teeling was from Twinbrook. They were now resident on the continent along with their close associate Wolfe Tone. British military intelligence knew all of these details perfectly well, and Armstrongrsquos Inn was one of the first buildings to be burned down after the Battle of Ballynahinch.On August , , General Jean-Joseph Humbert landed a small French expedition in Killala, Co Mayo, on the west coast of Ireland. This was in direct retaliation for Lord Moirarsquos earlier intervention in La Vendeacutee. Humbertrsquos force was too small and too late, and achieved little. The rising in Ulster had been extinguished two months earlier.As late as Emmetrsquos Rebellion in  there were rebel hopes mdash always disappointed mdashthat a French army would arrive in Co Down.The poem, The Man From God Knows Where, reads:lsquoFor a wheen orsquo days we sat waitinrsquo the word to rise and go at it like men, but no French ships sailed into Cloughey Bay and we heard the black news on a harvest day that the cause was lost again.rsquoHorace Reid will give a -minute slide presentation of these tales on Saturday afternoon. Karen Patterson will provide a fluent French translation for European visitors.

To me, this is a critical part of the continued regeneration of Irish Street.ldquoThe brief aims to encourage developers to come forward to redevelop the area and I wholeheartedly welcome plans to work alongside the local community on the design of the site to maximise not only the Irish Street sitersquos potential, but its historical heritage.Cllr Hanlon said revitalisation schemes in other towns have proved successful and welcomed assurances from the Department of Communities and local council that they will work closely with businesses and provide support to ensure the revitalisation scheme is delivered efficiently and quickly.ldquoThe delays in completion of the public realm scheme have undoubtedly impacted trade on Irish Street and the wider Downpatrick town centre, she said. ldquoConfirmation that revitalisation funding is being made available is a welcome boost.ldquoIt is imperative that businesses feedback to the steering group what they feel will work best from the revitalisation scheme to help them going forward. While the scheme is limited to Irish Street traders, it will no doubt have a positive impact on the wider town centre economy..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Castlewellan is ready for week of Ulster Fleadh fun  ","story":"CASTLEWELLAN is set to welcome over , musicians and guests for the  Ulster Fleadh this week.The traditional Irish music festival and follows hot on the heels of Castlewellanrsquos annual agricultural show, which saw , people descend upon the Mourne town.The week long festival of competitions, concerts and ceili dances runs until Sunday and celebrates all thatrsquos good in Irish music, song and dance.Some of the names on the bill include Zoe Conway, Donal Lunny and Martin OrsquoConnor.There will also be theof the Ulster Fleadh parade followed by a firework display and open-air music all weekend with lots of free entertainment.Organisers say the event, worth pound. million to the town last year, marks the fourth consecutive year for Co Down to host the event, following Bangorrsquos back-to-back stints in  and .Last year more than , competitors from across Ulster took part with more expected this year.Newry, Mourne and Down District Council says it is delighted to support the Ulster Fleadh.ldquoThe council believe that as a result of footfall generated through events like this, visitors are more likely toto the area for sightseeing, embracing our offer of food and drink or attending other events, a spokesman said.ldquoThere is a clear economic benefit generated for the district both on the weekend of the event and following it with further repeat visits.Paddy Breen, Fleadh chairman, said: ldquoWe are hoping to go bigger and better this year as it is the th anniversary of our host branch, Newcastle Cohhaltas Ceoltoiri Eireann .Last year we welcomed nearly , visitors to the town over the course of the weekrsquos events.ldquoVisitors to the Ulster Fleadh come from all over Ireland and we attract a iety of visitors of all ages -

He was three weeks in hospital but we are glad we did it.ldquoDespite all of what Matthew has gone through, he is never seen without a smile on his face. He is the most lovable, happy and determined boy.It was during Matthewrsquos recovery in hospital that Louise learnt about Swim Labrsquos water-based physio technique from another mum.She first took him to a programme in Lanzarote in March but has since took him to Swim Lab programme in Fivemiletown last month. He will be ing in September and December.Louise added: ldquoWe have exercises and activities to do with him every day which I video and send to the instructors to view and they then set other exercises so the work continues between the sessions.ldquoMatthew is doing things like riding a pony which he enjoys, but he doesnrsquot realise that this is helping strengthen his core muscles while he is doing it.The next local fundraising event is a charity golf day and barbeque at Bright Castle Golf Club on Saturday, August .To donate please visit www.gofundme f matthews-wish-to-walk..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Down Rally has surprise winner  ","story":"REIGNING World Rally Esports champion Jon Armstrong secured victory at a sensational Carryduff Forklt Down Rally, which was round four of the McGrady Insurance Motorsport UK Northern Ireland Stage Rally Championship.Armstrong and co-driver Noel OrsquoSullivan mirrored some of his success in the virtual gaming world by taking victory aboard a McGeehan Motorsport prepared Mini WRC at the event which was jointly organised by Ballynahinch and District Motor Club as well as Rathfriland Motor Club.It was his first time driving a World Rally car competitively and after using the opening miles to settle Armstrong quickly became a major contender.He was fourth overall after the tricky opening stage before climbing to third after setting the fastest time through stage two.He was gradually building his pace and looked set to challenge for the lead during the second loop of stages when he got a puncture during the fourth stage. The same stage also saw second-placed Meirion Evans lose six minutes with a puncture.Luckily for Armstrong, his time loss wasnrsquot as severe but it was still painful nonetheless as he ped one minute, placing him at the bottom of the top .The incident only made the Fermanagh man more determined and by the time crews arrived back at service after stage eight, he had set four fastest stage times and clambered his way back up to second overall.While early rally leaders, Jonny Greer and Kirsty Riddick, were forced to retire with mechanical problems, Armstrong had recovered to second position, just six seconds adrt of new leaders Stephen Wright and Liam Moynihan, with Daniel Harper and Chris Campbell third.The chasing crew got the bit between their teeth for the final loop of three stages which saw Armstrong move into the rally lead for the first time after stage nine.Using the power of his Mini WRC to full effect, he consolidated his advantage over the final two tests to win the event by just over  seconds.ldquoWe didnrsquot expect to win at all, Armstrong said at the finish. ldquoItrsquos only my second rally in two years so the aim was to get a bit of seat time in a World Rally car.ldquoItrsquos something that Irsquove never really had a lot of but I try to make up for it by making detailed pace notes which is what stood by us today.ldquoNoel and I worked really well together and the car worked really well too, he added.Stephen Wright and Liam Moynihan had to settle for second overall but in doing so, they claimed maximum McGrady Insurance N.I. Championship points.Wright had led the series after winning the opening round, but he subsequently missed an event, so the result puts him back on target for a  title challenge.In third position, Daniel Harper and Chris Campbell were the best of the Protyre Motorsport UK Asphalt Championship crews.Their Mini WRC never missed a beat as they powered to another podium position, finishing with a reasonable cushion over the rest of the chasing pack.The battle for fourth overall raged right through to the finish with four crews in with a shout of the award. In the end, Melvyn Evans and Aled Davies secured the position from Derek McGarrity and Paddy Robinson, with Steve Wood and Keith Moriarty sixth.Stuart Biggerstaff and Anthony Nestor had also been right in the hunt, but they dropped out of contention with power-steering troubles on stage nine.As for McGarrity, the result gives his NI Championship campaign a welcome boost as he continues to play catch-up after his round one retirement.He was left a little bit disappointed that a wrong tyre choice and a broken anti-roll bar thwarted a potential challenge for outright victory but he is very much among the main contenders for the  championship spoils.The bottom half of the top  also featured the father and son team of Draperstownrsquos Derek and Mark McGeehan.It was navigator Markrsquos second closed road rally, and only his second time reading pace notes, so his father Derek was as proud as punch of his efforts at the finish.Last yearrsquos winner Jonny Greer was left despondent after his retirement.He blitzed the opposition on the opening stage when he went  seconds faster than anyone  and when both Meirion Evans and Jon Armstrong hit trouble on stage four, it looked as though the Carryduff based driver was on course for another win.However, it wasnrsquot to be as one stage later, suspected gearbox troubles forced him and navigator Kirsty Riddick out of the rally.WDIn the battle for two-wheel-drive honours, Damian Toner and Barry McParland put in a scintillating display aboard their Ford Escort MkII.They were never outside the top  and eventually powered home to a seventh-placed finish with a comfortable margin over their two-wheel-drive rivals.

The garden has been created by staff and contractors from housebuilders Barratt Homes and David Wilson Homes.The custom design incorporates traditional elements of earth, wind, fire and air, and has been purpose-built for the school.Ysgol Y Deri supports a erse range of pupils with specialist needs from ages three to .Rhys Jones said: ldquoItrsquos absolutely phenomenal. Having this facility for all ages and abilities is something that I wish I had when I was younger.ldquoIrsquove been asked to open the garden and Irsquom honoured to be at the school. Irsquove read up a little about it and what theyrsquore doing is outstanding.Caroline Williams, headteacher of primary at Ysgol Y Deri, said: ldquoThe dedication and hard work of all the volunteers was incredible under dficult conditions, with lots of clay and concrete to dig through. The space was sad and neglected before and now is interesting, welcoming and inviting truly a space for all our learners to explore their senses. The pupils loved exploring it for the first time on Saturday during the official opening.ldquoWe canrsquot thank the teams enough who have brought this project together Barratt David Homes and their volunteers for the financial support and labour, Dunn Landscapes who managed the work daily, Pam Creed for her design and Pughrsquos Garden centre for the donation of the plants, as well as KidsOut for the donation of the musical instruments.Barratt Homes and David Wilson Homes managing director Steve Williams said: ldquoEveryone at Barratt gets a day off to volunteer for a charity. So we looked for a project that we could all do together to really make a dference. From the company  people volunteered to work on the project. Itrsquos fair to say we all got a lot out of it. It really warms our hearts to see what wersquove been able to do in four weeks.Blisse Mellons, , and her mother Laura were already using the gardens. ldquoShe likes this one a lot. She likes to scratch stuff, said Mrs Mellons. ldquoItrsquos good for the wheelchairs and itrsquos a great height.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people.

Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

One was in relation to a report of a loud bang in the Tullygally Road area of Craigavon. About  minutes later there was another report from a Belfast-based newspaper that they had received a report that a device had been fired at a police patrol but it missed its target. We responded and discovered a suspicious object at a bus shelter close to Aldervale flats.“We put up cordons, which caused a bit of disruption to local residents, on the advice of Army Technical Officers. They advised us that the flats had to be evacuated.Device was found close to a bus shelter in the Tullygally area of Craigavon“There were a number of people who were reluctant to leave but we engaged with them and persuaded people to go to alternative accommodation. Quite a few had family members that they could go to in the area. Also the Parochial House was opened up and people were able to go there,” said Supt Middleton.“I want to stress my thanks to everyone who did engage with us and support us in very dficult circumstances and also for the very public outpouring of support we have had since then from both members of the community and elected representatives. It meant a lot to me at the time and to my officers.“Our colleagues in ATO made the device safe. It was a viable device. It was a dangerous device that had been left at the bus shelter. “It was a mortar-type device which had not been fired at a passing police patrol. We were able to clary that very quickly. It was attached to a concrete block and that concrete block had been manufactured - and within that concrete block was a device containing explosives. This was designed to kill.“Our working hypothesis and that of the investigations team was that the initial bang was to draw us into the area and then with the secondary device and anybody who would be handling the suspicious object - it was designed to kill.“We have already got feedback in relation to that. The ATO, when they made the device safe, they were able to report to me that it was viable and it was designed to kill.“We believe the device was an attempt by dissident republican terrorists to murder police officers. I condemn this strongly.” Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"She said there have been no arrests as yet and the investigations is at an early stage.“No group has claimed responsibility and the investigation team have an open mind as to which grouping it might be.“My assessment is the threat that we are facing is coming from within local communities and I want to offer reassurances as well that this will not deter us in any shape or form.“As the local commander my responsibility is for making sure we deliver high quality and effective policing service. I can assure the local communities of this district, that is what our focus will be.“This won’t put us off and we will continue to build on the strong relationships that we already have in the local community.“This was a completely reckless attack. This was a busy residential area. This is a busy road and right beside a bus stop and a block of flats. When the ATO advised me that the flats needed to be evacuated that gives you some insight into the size and the damage that could have been caused.“I would like to appeal for information. This really saddens me what has happened on Friday night. We are no dferent from any other emergency service. We are just trying to provide a service to the local community and be there when the community need us most.“What I do know is the explosives need to have been sourced somewhere. The bomb had to be constructed. You will see from the photographs, this was a sophisticated construction. It wasn’t crude. It had to be transported. It had to be put in place where it would have maximum impact and then the people that did it had to leave the area.“My appeal is for anybody who, in the weeks and days leading up to Friday night, saw anything suspicious in terms of vehicles or people.“I can assure any of your readers that I am not interested in who they are. All I am interested in is what they know.“We have a report as well from a witness that saw a young male running away onto rough ground from the bus shelter area. That was about quarter to twelve on Friday night which would have been in and around the time that is relevant to us and went onto the black paths.“He is described as being ’” to ’”, slight to medium build and on that basis the witness felt they were young, in their late teens to early s, wearing a light grey or beige long sleeve hooded top with the hood up and face covered. We are particularly interested in speaking to that person.”When asked what direction the witness saw the male running, Superintendent Middleton said they did not know but it would be helpful to find out in which direction he ran.Askedshe was concerned about an escalation of dissident activity, she said: “Obviously it is of concern that we have had a viable bomb left in a public road in Craigavon which I believe was intended for my officers. So that is of concern to me and that is increasing activity, obvious increasing activity. But the reality is the threat to serving officers in Northern Ireland is severe and has been for the last ten years, and certainly within this area, I have seen a consistent threat rather than anything that would have happened in peaks and troughs. We are aware of it. It is something that is a priority to the PSNI - is the threat of violent extremism and therefore it is something we take into account and consideration in our policing response.”When askedthis would mean even more caution in a police emergency response, she said: “No I don’t think so.

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add.

A statement, signed by  business organisations and trade bodies, says that “two and a half years on from the collapse of the Executive, and now approaching the likely conclusion of the Brexit process, the Northern Ireland business community is deeply concerned at the continued absence of a ing administration and is calling on political representatives to redouble their efforts to reach agreement to get the Assembly and Executive working again”. “There has seldom been a time when strong and effective leadership has been more necessary, both to deliver on the domestic agenda and also to speak up for Northern Ireland in the Brexit process. “We need a fully ing administration to agree and deliver a Programme for Government that will build infrastructure, reform our health service and education system, ensure we have a strong economy, and create opportunities for our young people. We also need effective representation in the Brexit discussions, even at this late stage in the process, to ensure that the economy is protected through whatever changes arise and that all necessary mitigations are sought and secured. “The business community will give encouragement and support to those politicians who stretch themselves to reach a compromise. Without such a commitment and associated action from our elected representatives, we risk irreparable damage to our economy and our society for which future generations will judge us harshly.””  The letter has been signed by the following organisations: Belfast Chamber Causeway Chamber of Commerce CBI NI Centre for Competitiveness Construction Employers Federation NI Federation of Small Businesses Northern Ireland Freight Transport Association Hospitality Ulster IoD NI Londonderry Chamber of Commerce Manufacturing NI Mineral Products Association NI Newry Chamber of Commerce  Trade NI Grain Trade Association NI Hotels Federation NI Tourism Alliance Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry Northern Ireland Food and Drink Association Northern Ireland Retail Consortium Retail NI Women in Business NIView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
