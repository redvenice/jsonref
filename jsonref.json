Charlotte is turning three today (Picture: WireImage)It’s been a big year for birthday girl Princess Charlotte after starting nursery, going on a royal tour and becoming a big sister.And she may only be celebrating turning three, but Charlotte already has a number of memorable moments.Charlotte stole the show on the day her baby brother Prince Louis was born when she visited him in hospital.The world gushed over her unbelievable cuteness as she waved for photographers while leading her dad Prince William up the steps of the Lindo Wing.Her confident reaction was in stark contrast to shy older brother Prince George, with the princess waving from the moment she got out of the car.She gripped onto her dad’s hand going into the hospital, before professionally turning her head and giving a final wave to cameras.One Twitter user said: ‘Princess Charlotte completely stole the show she is the cutest little girl and her little wave really did melt my heart.’Princess Charlotte taken by her mother at Kensington Palace shortly before the princess left for her first day of nursery (Picture: PA)The young princess started at Willcocks Nursery School, near to Kensington Palace, this year, with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge releasing sweet photographs of Charlotte on her first day.The photos – taken by mum Kate – saw Charlotte beaming in a red coat, pale pink scarf and matching pink backpack.With Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s wedding is now just a couple of weeks away, with Charlotte rumoured to be a flower girl or bridesmaid for her uncle.But the princess is already skilled at bridesmaid duties.Kate Middleton and Princess Charlotte as a bridesmaid at the wedding of Pippa Middleton and James Matthews (Picture: WireImage)She took on the role when the Duchess of Cambridge’s sister Pippa Middleton married hedge fund manager James Matthews in the village of Englefield in Berkshire last May.Dressed in a cream dress tied with a dusky pink sash, Charlotte scattered confetti petals from a wicker basket and wore a headdress of white flowers.Kate took charge of the bridesmaids and pageboys, including Prince George, and at one point had to tell the excited children to keep quiet.Of course it is Charlotte’s cheekiness that makes her so adorable.Kate once said feisty Charlotte is ‘the one in charge’ at home with older brother George.And when she and George joined their parents for an official tour of Poland and Germany last summer, Charlotte was not about to do anything she didn’t like.The princess was pictured collecting posies, peering out of the windows of their plane with brother George – but also having a little tantrum on the tarmac.The youngster sat down on the floor in protest, but was promptly scooped up, comforted and distracted by her mother Kate.A very excited 16-month-old Charlotte giggled away as she sat down on six-year-old therapy dog Moose at a children’s party in Canada.The garden party at Government House, British Colombia, in September 2016 marked Charlotte’s first public appearance with her brother George, who was three.Footage from the day showed her bouncing up and down on the dog’s back before excitedly playing with balloons.It’s a royal rite of passage for princes and princesses so Charlotte joined the Windsors on the Buckingham Palace balcony for the Trooping the Colour parade.While George appeared to have had enough, resting his head on his hand as he stood on a little step on the red cloth decorated balcony, Charlotte seemed content during the annual event.She happily watched the flypast, grinning as the military aircraft flew over the Queen’s London home."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/30/19/4BB5CAAA00000578-5675139-image-a-2_1525113320117.jpg","title":"Paul Simon admits short 5 foot three height eclipsed success","story":"    Paul Simon (left, with Art Garfunkel), who is 5ft 3in tall, claimed that despite being ultra-competitive and an alpha-male, society discriminated against him his whole life because of his diminutive size          Simon was so sensitive about his height that he was still hurt 60 years after his Bridge Over Troubled Water co-singer Art Garfunkel, who was six inches taller at 5ft 9in, told him: \u0027I\u0027ll always be taller than you\u0027Simon\u0027s obsession with his height is detailed in Paul Simon: The Life, by Robert Hilburn, which is out on May 8 and published by Simon \u0026amp Schuster. While Simon is far from the only successful male celebrity who is short, his feelings of persecution about it seem to run deep.Prince was 5ft 3in tall, the same height as Simon, and wore stack heels on stage to make himself look taller.Bruno Mars is just 5ft 5in but that has not held back his career while Tom Cruise is 5ft 7in and he has enjoyed a lifetime of success in Hollywood.Also among famous short men is 5ft 6in-tall Good Morning America anchor George Stephanopoulos, whose show desk has been modified to disguise his short legs between taller anchors Robin Roberts, 5ft 10in, and Michael Strahan, who is 6ft 5in. In his new book, Hilburn writes that Simon had been sensitive about his short stature all the way back to the beginning of his partnership with Garfunkel in the late 1950s.The book quotes Simon as saying: \u0027I remember during a photo session Artie (Garfunkel) said: \u0027No matter what happens, I\u0027ll always be taller than you. Did that hurt? I guess it hurt enough for me to remember 60 years later\u0027.\u0027According to Simon, people thought Garfunkel was the one who wrote the songs, not him, because he \u0027looks like he writes the songs\u0027.Simon said: \u0027It came up all the time. There is a prejudice against small men and that has been a problem at times because I happen to be a sort of alpha male-ish type guy. It becomes a competitive thing.\u0027There\u0027s this attitude that \u0027I\u0027m taller, so I could beat you up, or I should be in charge\u0027.          By 1960 Simon started fretting about his thinning hair as well because all his role models like The Beatles and Mick Jagger were, as he put it \u0027skinny and tall, and they had a lot of hair\u0027. Simon and Jagger are pictured above in 1989Eventually, when he was in his 40s, Simon said to himself: \u0027Listen man, if you\u0027re going to make a big issue out of what you don\u0027t have, you\u0027re taking your actual gifts for granted….that\u0027s the hand I\u0027ve been dealt with. That\u0027s the way I\u0027m going to play it\u0027.Elsewhere in the book Simon talks about how his height was bound up in his long running mental health issues.In 1981 he went to see Los Angeles psychiatrist Rod Gorney and told him he was so unhappy he couldn\u0027t write songs anymore.Hilburn quotes an interview with Simon from 1984 in which he says that from the outside people could not understand why he was depressed, but inside he was looking at the \u0027thin slice of the pie that has got the bad news in it\u0027.What he meant by bad news: \u0027being short\u0027, his voice and his relationships.Simon said that his issues left him \u0027unable to absorb the bounty that was in my life\u0027 and he used to joke that he would happily pay $5 million to look like his hero Elvis Presley, who was 6ft 2in tall.Simon, 76, grew up in the Kew Gardens neighborhood of Queens, New York, and dreamed about playing for the New York Yankees.But his dream died because of something that Hiburn says would \u0027haunt him for years: his size\u0027. By 1960 Simon started fretting about his thinning hair as well because all his role models like The Beatles and Mick Jagger were, as he put it \u0027skinny and tall, and they had a lot of hair\u0027.          Simon first saw Garfunkel in 1951 at an assembly in their school when they were in the fourth grade. They attended the same high school and began to play music together. The pair are pictured together in 1957          Simon (right with Garfunkel), 76, grew up in the Kew Gardens neighborhood of Queens, New York, and dreamed about playing for the New York Yankees. But his dream died because of his small statureSimon said: \u0027That\u0027s what rock\u0027n\u0027roll was, and it was a really big thing with me.\u0027I once had this conversation with John Lennon, and he really wanted to know how I knew enough to keep my own publishing rather than give half of it away like the Beatles did. I told him I grew up around the music business....then I asked him: \u0027Who ever told you how to comb your hair like that?\u0027\u0027Much of \u0027The Life\u0027 is taken up with the love-hate - mostly hate - relationship between Simon and Garfunkel.Simon first saw Garfunkel in 1951 at an assembly in their school when they were in the fourth grade.They attended the same high school and began to play music together. Their first single was an R\u0026ampB number titled, \u0027Sh-Boom\u0027 in 1954. And even before they turned 18, the boys were being played on national radio. In 1957, however, they suffered a split that \u0027caused a wound so deep in Art it would never heal fully\u0027.Sid Prosen, the owner of the record label called Big which signed them, asked Simon if he could record some songs on his own and \u0027caught up in the excitement of the moment\u0027, Simon agreed.Hilburn writes that their \u0027massive mistake\u0027 was not telling Garfunkel who knew he had a great voice but was \u0027dependent on Paul for songs, which meant Paul had all the power\u0027.Garfunkel \u0027always felt in danger of being tossed aside\u0027, the book says. Simon\u0027s song flopped as did their next collaborative project and the pair went their separate ways for five years. Tank tops, flock wallpaper and a cheese plant in the corner:...\u0027She just wanted to know that he\u0027s in jail\u0027: Patton Oswalt...Share this article    Simon and Garfunkel, pictured above in 1993, have long had a love-hate relationship with each other. The biggest blow up came in 1993, when Simon\u0027s business manager had to to physically get between their dressing rooms to stop anything from happening.They would go through the same cycle for the next 50 years reconciliation and fighting before breaking up once more. The biggest blow up came in 1993. Simon and Garfunkel had reunited for a series of shows in New York called Event of a Lifetime that sold out so fast they added 14 more nights to the ten-night run.But the old tensions came back straight away, and Joseph Rascoff, Simon\u0027s business manager, had to physically get between their dressing rooms to stop anything from happening.He said: \u0027I genuinely believed that if there had been a knife on the table, one of them would have used it\u0027.At one point Garfunkel accused Simon of getting a journalist to write a negative review of one of the sets.On another night, while playing their hit \u0027The Boxer\u0027, Garfunkel suddenly stopped singing, which Simon thought was a mistake. But after the show Garfunkel told him: \u0027I didn\u0027t forget. I just wanted you to see what it feels like to be made a fool of\u0027.The two men went at each other and, recounting the episode, Rascoff said: \u0027They never came to blows but there was shoving, and I had to step between them\u0027.Simon described the incident as \u0027ugly - the most vicious fight, verbally at least, I\u0027d had in my life\u0027.Simon ided opinion among those who met him and a veteran from the British club scene in the 1960s called him \u0027shy, arrogant, self-assured, ruthlessly determined\u0027.           Simon did not get on with some celebrities, including John Lennon when they were supposed to be working on a covers album in 1974. He\u0027s pictured above, second from left, with Garfunkel (left), Yoko Ono (second right)  and Lennon in 1974Other said that he was so obsessed with music that human relationships came second.Joan Bata, a friend of his first girlfriend Kathy Chitty, said: \u0027He wasn\u0027t deliberately being hurtful. It was just that his mind was totally occupied with something else.\u0027The most striking breakup was with his first wife Peggy which is described with brutal starkness in the book.In 1974 the couple were due to go to their home in New Hope, Connecticut, but Simon was listening to his competition in that years\u0027 Grammy Awards, Stevie Wonder\u0027s Innervisions.Peggy called him to join her but he was too caught up in the music so she called him again and he became angry, thinking to himself: \u0027Can\u0027t I even listen to music any more?\u0027          Robert Hilburn\u0027s biography, Paul Simon: The Life, is out on May 8 on Simon \u0026amp SchusterAs the book puts it: \u0027When Peggy called out a third time, the marriage was over\u0027. Simon simply walked out of their townhouse and moved into the Stanhope Hotel around the corner until their orce was finalized.In the book, Simon said: \u0027Ultimately I wasn\u0027t ready for marriage. The marriage didn\u0027t solve the loneliness. I knew right away I had made a mistake. \u0027I didn\u0027t know how to be a good companion. I wasn\u0027t a very mature person. I didn\u0027t understand you had to work at problems. I wanted the marriage to solve my problems.\u0027\u0027The Life\u0027 says that Simon did not get on with some celebrities, including John Lennon when they were supposed to be working on a covers album in 1974.Lennon was constantly drunk and when Simon started to play acoustic guitar on \u0027Rock Island Line\u0027 before Lennon wanted he repeatedly told him to stop.Then Lennon started to reach over and mute Simon\u0027s guitar strings with his hand. A frustrated Simon told him: \u0027John, I play guitar too.\u0027May Pang, who was staying with Lennon at the time, said that Lennon was annoyed by Simon because \u0027unlike almost everybody else who entered John\u0027s orbit (Simon) had a powerful sense of himself and could actually refuse to be treated badly\u0027.In 2002 Simon was in Washington to receive a Kennedy Center Honor to receive an award for his lifetime of achievement to American culture through the performing arts.As he sat next to Elizabeth Taylor they watched as Alicia Keys butchered Bridge Over Troubled Water.Taylor leaned over to Simon and said: \u0027Tell me, Paul, does it upset you when somebody f**** up one of your songs?\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/01/09/4BB960A700000578-0-image-m-54_1525162161765.jpg","title":"Eugenie fianc living door Harry Meghan","story":"Princess Eugenie and fiance Jack Brooksbank, left, have moved into Kensington Palace and now live just yards away from Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, right.

Sajid Javid is the new Home Secretary after Amber Rudd\u0027s poor handling of the Windrush scandal saw her forced to resignOne university and 57 private further education colleges were been stripped of its right to admit foreign students.But immigration barrister Patrick Lewis told the Financial Times that many of the students accused of faking the English language tests may have been wrongly accused. Some of these would have been deported.He said the harsh treatment of the foreign students - in the UK legally - highlighted the flaws in the ‘hostile environment’ strategy introduced by then Home Secretary Theresa May in 2014.The approach which seeks to make life tough for illegal immigrants, denying them homes, jobs, bank accounts and benefits, has been blamed for targeting Windrush generation Commonwealth migrants who did not have paperwork proving they had a right to stay in the UK.The plight of the foreign students began after the BBC’s Panorama programme aired an investigation in February 2014 alleging systematic cheating at some colleges in the Test of English for International Communication (TOEIC).Mrs May responded by asking US-based firm Educational Testing Services, which ran the testing system, to analyse voice files to work out if students were using proxies to sit the tests for them.After analysing the files, ETS said it was confident 33,725 test takers had used someone else to sit the test for them. Most were told they had no right to appeal and should leave the country.But an immigration appeal tribunal in 2016 heard that when ETS’s voice analysis was checked with a human follow-up, the computer had been correct in only 80 per cent of cases.This meant that some 7,000 students had their visas revoked in error, it was claimed.The Prime Minister’s spokesman said the Government response to the cheating scandal was ‘measured and proportionate’.He said that expert evidence had shown the number of false matches would be ‘very small’. He said 21 people had been convicted for helping students to fake their tests, with prison sentences totalling 68 years imposed.A Home Office spokesman said: ‘In February 2014, investigations into the abuse of English language testing revealed systemic cheating, which was indicative of large scale organised fraud.‘The Government took immediate robust action on this, which has been measured and proportionate, and so far 21 people have received criminal convictions for their role in this deception.‘There is no limit on the number of genuine international students who can come to study in the UK, nor is there any intention to impose one.’ "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/02/09/4BC251CC00000578-5681477-image-a-5_1525248060821.jpg","title":"Yobs caught CCTV damaging familys car","story":"    Alyson Carson, right, and her son Connor, pictured have complained to police after a gang of yobs damaged their cars outside their home in Berwick-upon-Tweed          The gang ran over the bonnet of the car damaging the metal work, pictured          These are the shocking scenes as a mob of yobs run across the roof of a car causing damage          The miscreants caused the damage outside a home in Berwick-upon-Tweed last month \u0027They did a five or 10ft jump right into the middle of it and they can’t get the dent out at the body shop repair.\u0027My husband’s friend\u0027s car was also damaged and has a crease in the middle of it.\u0027Ms Carson lives in the border town along with her husband, Rob, 52, and sons, Connor, 22, and Daniel, 15.   The beauty therapist said the incident on April 28 was the latest in recent months and believes their house is being targeted.In the age of #MeToo, why DO so many women enjoy watching...Retired British businessman falls to his death from his 18th...Share this articleMs Carson and her son Connor\u0027s cars were vandalised by a group of yobs who ran over the top of their cars outside their home in BerwickShe said: \u0027It has been going on for about 18 months and started with apples being thrown that were stolen from a neighbour’s garden.\u0027Then there were stones and gravel being thrown and when it snowed they made snowballs filled with ice and chuck them at the windows.

Sarah and Andrew first met back in 1996, shortly after she moved to Cambridgeshire - first forging a platonic relationship after being introduced by mutual friends.\u0027We were all talking about what we\u0027d want in a spouse and, virtually at the same time, Andrew and I both said a best friend that makes me laugh,\u0027 she recalled.\u0027It was lovely having that in common. We decided to go for a drink, just the two of us, and it was a complete whirlwind from there.\u0027We were even talking about engagement rings just six weeks into being an official couple. All our friends kept laughing about how bouncy Andrew seemed, saying he had a real spring in his step.\u0027Everyone said they knew we\u0027d end up together.\u0027Starting life as a married couple, Sarah and Andrew\u0027s minds turned to children.But, after years of trying to no avail, tests revealed they both had fertility issues and sadly, IVF treatment, which they had in the early noughties, was unsuccessful.          After returning from the trip to Australia, to celebrate his landmark birthday, Andrew started seeming disorientated and forgetful. Sarah explained how he struggled with balance, often clipping into things when driving, and his body would sometimes slump to one side\u0027I said to myself we\u0027d keep going every year until I hit 40. But then, as Andrew turned 40 himself, things started to change,\u0027 added Sarah.After returning from the trip-of-a-lifetime to Australia, to celebrate his landmark birthday, Andrew started seeming disorientated and forgetful.Sarah explained how he struggled with balance, often clipping into things when driving, and his body would sometimes slump to one side.Because of his high-pressure job, the fertility treatment and a string of family bereavements, it was initially assumed he was just reacting badly to stress.But, after his symptoms worsened over the next couple of years, he was referred to Addenbrooke\u0027s Hospital in Cambridge for further investigations.There, in 2006, when he was just 43, a lumbar puncture – where fluid is collected from the spine for diagnostic testing – confirmed he had a rare genetic type of dementia.

There, in 2006, when he was just 43, a lumbar puncture – where fluid is collected from the spine for diagnostic testing – confirmed he had a rare genetic type of dementia\u0027There\u0027s no history of it in his family, so we were told it was caused by a mutation in a gene he had called presenilin 1, which has been linked to early onset dementia,\u0027 explained Sarah.\u0027The doctors told us that, if we did have children, there was a 50 per cent chance of them getting it, too, so we decided not to carry on with the IVF.\u0027I don\u0027t think I\u0027d have coped with seeing Andrew ill and our children watching the disease progress, then maybe even developing it themselves.\u0027In the end, we donated the unused embryos for stem cell research. For us, children were just never meant to be – but Andrew would have made a great dad.\u0027Shortly before his diagnosis, Andrew\u0027s symptoms had meant he had given up his job as a geneticist, swapping it for a job in Tesco, where he stayed for a year.As the disease progressed, he gradually became more forgetful and disorientated, ringing Sarah up to 30 times in one go, as he could not remember if they had already spoken.          As the disease progressed, he gradually became more forgetful and disorientated, ringing Sarah up to 30 times in one go, as he could not remember if they had already spokenSarah continued: \u0027With his work and having seen other patients further down the line, he must\u0027ve known what was coming and been so scared. But he never let on. I never saw him shout or get upset.\u0027The only time he cried was when he had to give up driving, because it\u0027d always been a big love of his. I think he felt part of him had gone.\u0027In November 2007, after Andrew became doubly incontinent, it was agreed he would move into assisted living nearby.Then 18 months later, he had a PEG tube inserted to help feed him.\u0027Before that, he\u0027d been eating mashed up food, one teaspoon at a time,\u0027 said Sarah.\u0027He looked like a skeleton.

Sources said that in the long term this would be around the same each year as the UK’s contribution to the EU’s Galileo programme.The EU’s uncompromising stance will raise concerns about the difficulties that will arise as Britain attempts to tie up a future relationship with the bloc.Business Secretary Greg Clark has said that full UK involvement was a key part of a future security relationship with the EU.In its decision, the EU said that security information could be ‘compromised’ if Britain was to gain access to the information now before being cut out of the service following Brexit.The EU’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said last month: ‘The EU cannot share security-relevant proprietary information with countries outside the EU.’ "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/02/10/4BC301C300000578-5681851-image-a-52_1525253534239.jpg","title":"Herd elephants calmly work help mother pull tiny calf river","story":"    At the start of the video, the herd can be seen drinking by the side of the river in South Africa\u0027s Kruger National Park           The tiny elephant then slips from the muddy bank into the river as its mother tries to grab it           Using her trunk, the mother tries to get pull her calf out of the water but it keeps slipping back in           The other elephants then come to the mother\u0027s aid and also try to pull the baby out of the water I\u0027m no stick in the mud: Adorable moment baby elephant has...Adorable moment baby elephant \u0027kisses\u0027 and cuddles delighted...Share this articleThe mother eventually got into the water and pushed the calf to safety with the help of the rest of the herd. The footage was captured by Jaques Joubert, 55, and Michelle Broadhurst, 49, in Kruger National Park, South Africa.Jaques said: \u0027We were watching this group of elephants having a drink after a very hot day.

They also helped the photographer find spring water at the summit\u0027He has also made improvements in the rural sectors, large orchards, more meat coop farms. \u0027The very remote rural parts though still need a hand and have been subsistent with little regular infrastructure support for a while, but the North Korea economy doesn\u0027t have the financial reach yet to help those areas as much as they would wish. \u0027That\u0027s mainly due to decades of sanctions, and an international military threat that forces them into military developments.\u0027  His work has been exhibited and shown to both sides of Korea and Mr Shepherd says he is often approached at exhibitions by older Koreans who once lived North of the border and distinctly remember once living in the village or even being reminded of a particular mountain.

Pictured, a small hamlet in Kapsan county, Ryanggang-do provinceMr Shepherd added: \u0027Some of the exhibition visitors were even born near some of the mountains I photographed in the North, and these are some remote never photographed before peaks. \u0027I remember one older man coming to one of my exhibitions and telling me he was born in the county where this particular distant photo was taken. I asked him if he remembered this mountain and his reply was \u0027all I can remember as a boy was many mountains\u0027.\u0027In the North, they finally get a chance to see photos of mountains they\u0027ve only ever heard about. For the most part, the mountains of Korea mean identity to them. There\u0027s typically a human story attached to it like my great grandfather came from that area and always talked about that mountain. This has much more impact when that grandfather or mother was born on the other side of the border they can no longer cross.\u0027Mr Shepherd said it was the abundance of the mountains that first caught his eye.    \u0027At first, it was their abundance and shapes that intrigued me,\u0027 he said.

So when you stand on a ridge, you look out over waves and waves of more ridges, and when the light hits them, it can have an impressive effect, like looking at broken layers of paint.\u0027Then when I walked the Baekdu Daegan ridge (687km) in South Korea and wrote a guidebook about that. I started to discover this other world of Korea\u0027s mountains. \u0027They contained a deep history of fairy tales, mythologies, animistic religions, culture, foods, arts, and literature, all stemmed on mountains. \u0027In this busy Korean world, they had this ancient influence from their mountains, which they were all understandably born of.\u0027 Mr Shepherd is planning to release a book about his work on the Baekdu Daegan containing photos of the amazing scenery, as well as the villages and its people.He recently launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund the release, which will also include essays on the Baekdu Daegan.

I would like to see a two-country one-nation system slowly developed. The border reduced from fortified to crossable, and then some mixture and development via exchange.\u0027We could end up seeing a new political direction for Korea. An emergence of both a socialist and capitalist system. \u0027Koreans are talented people with a will to do it their way, given a chance. There are also willing and keen to adapt and take on all technologies and global ideas. They can set an example.          Mr Shepherd hopes that with both North and South Korea in negotiations over bringing peace to the peninsula that the Baekdu Daegan can became a symbol of unification.

The Baekdu Daegan is the perfect one, the spine that connects the nation. It\u0027s apolitical and symbolic to all Koreans.\u0027Mr Shepherd will also be going on a historical trip with his tour guide company HIKEKOREA.The unique opportunity will see a group go on an overland trekking expedition of the Paektu Highlands in the northern province of Raynggang- do, in North Korea for the first time.These highlands are part of an exclusive preservation zone at the foot of Korea\u0027s highest and most sacred mountain, Paektu-san. ONE KOREA: Mountains, Villages, \u0026amp People.

The missile base came up for sale from the government in 2012 and we were able to buy it.\u0027At the time, we bought it we had eight children still living at home and our original idea was to use the underground command centre\u0027s 12,000 square feet to create a large living, bedroom and shop spaces to accommodate our large family.\u0027We also thought it would be good for family get-togethers as out children grow up, get married and have children of their own.\u0027The underground 12,000sq ft command centre, also features 30-inch thick walls, 15-foot-tall ceilings and a nine foot by nine foot access tunnel approximately 75 feet long.Two towers, a 25-foot-tall intake tower, and a 30-foot-tall exhaust tower sit on top of the property, which is also protect by blast doors.The site sits in 36 acres of land, surrounded by an eight-foot military grade chain fence with barbed wire, and with around.75 miles of paved road.A guardhouse, where the Cleveland\u0027s spend most of their time, is a poured concrete 2,400 sq foot building complete with three large garage bays, kitchen bathroom, office and turnstile security desk.

A boiler in the underground building also provides hydronic heat.Jim said: \u0027Everything is liveable here although there is still much work to be done by someone who has a vision and the means to make this amazing space their dream.\u0027This would be fantastic for many different uses, among them being a high-end family survival or retreat centre, or an amazing underground lair for the person who wants something truly unique with an incredible wow factor.\u0027           The family said that their kids growing up and moving on has left them less in need of the gigantic space with only three left on the site          The bunker section boasts a modern kitchen which is built to remain fully functional in the event of a total nuclear apocalypse          The property in North Dakota is just 10 miles away from the Canadian border and is perfect for those seeking a tranquil lifestyle"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/02/14/4BC3F06E00000578-0-image-a-5_1525266203803.jpg","title":"Gardeners World presenter Monty Don slams BBC ditching World Snooker Championship","story":"    Mr Don hit out at the broadcaster after it ditched his show during National Gardening Week          In a tweet (top) he called the decision a \u0027load of balls\u0027 and he retweeted a post from a fan calling it \u0027ironic\u0027He added: \u0027#loadofballs.\u0027Don had previously retweeted a post from a viewer that read: \u0027Doesn\u0027t it seem ironic that on #nationalgardeningweek Gardeners World is cancelled for ... snooker!! @TheMontyDon @BBCTwo.\u0027The World Snooker Championship, which this year saw Ronnie O\u0027Sullivan knocked out in the second round, started on April 21, with the final finishing on Monday.The tournament, which takes place at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, has been shown on the BBC since it was first held at that venue in 1977.

She added: \u0027It\u0027s living a nightmare that you never wake up from.\u0027Nearly 37 years ago we became members of an exclusive club we didn\u0027t ask for membership of — we became parents of a missing daughter. \u0027I would dearly love to be able to revoke that membership.\u0027          Investigators believe Katrice, who had been shopping with her mother when she disappeared, may still be alive having been abducted but have little memory of her early years          British soldiers are searching an area near a riverbank in northwest Germany as they hunt for missing Katrice Lee          German Police help British Royal Military police in their search for missing Katrice Lee           The Royal Military Police is carrying out a five-week excavation of the banks of the River Alme in PaderbornShe told The Sun: \u0027The next five weeks is a double-edged sword for us as a family. We desperately want Katrice to be found but we also know that if anything is discovered during this search then my daughter\u0027s life would have been ended in very unsavoury circumstances.\u0027That\u0027s another emotion we have to learn to live with.\u0027 The case was reopened in 2000 and led to the arrest of a former soldier. But he was released without charge and the case closed again after three years. There were further inquiries in 2012 when Royal Military Police chiefs admitted mistakes were made during the initial investigation.  Katrice went missing on 28 November 1981 - her second birthday - while out shopping with her mother Sharon          Katrice Lee was snatched from a supermarket while out shopping with her mother (pictured)          Sharon and Richard Lee, the parents of Katrice, who are desperately hoping the search will find what happened to their daughter          Katrice\u0027s mother Sharon, now 64, said the toddler was \u0027gone in a matter of seconds\u0027The RMP announced on Monday that it would be carrying out a dig on the River Alme\u0027s banksat Paderborner Str, Paderborn.It followed a reanalysis of evidence gathered during the original investigation, which pinpointed the river as an area of interest, the force said.The \u0027detailed excavation\u0027 of the site is expected to last around five weeks. Senior investigating officer Richard O\u0027Leary, of the RMP, said: \u0027The aim of the search is to find evidence that could finally shed light on what happened to Katrice.\u0027  A man was seen climbing into a green saloon with a child matching Katrice\u0027s description (pictured: the photo-fit of the man)He renewed an appeal for information about a man seen at the shopping centre placing a child matching the toddler\u0027s description into a green saloon car.\u0027A green saloon car was also seen on the River Alme Bridge near the NAAFI the day after Katrice disappeared. It may or may not be the same car, but we are very keen to identify this car,\u0027 he added.A photo-fit of the man has been reissued as part of the fresh appeal.Anyone from the Paderborn area who owned such a car at the time is asked to approach police so they can be ruled out of the inquiry.But the possibility remains that Katrice is still alive – now aged 38 – having been abducted and raised with little memory of her early years, investigators believe.  This is what police believe Katrice would look like today - she went missing in November 1981She was born with a distinctive eye condition in her left eye which would have required two medical operations to correct.Mr O\u0027Leary said: \u0027An age progression image of what Katrice may look like now, aged 38, has been produced.\u0027If anyone feels they know someone who looks like this, or believes they could be Katrice, then we would encourage them to come forward.\u0027Katrice\u0027s father Richard, now 68, who has split from Sharon, had criticised the RMP handling of the case, but felt his voice had \u0027finally been heard\u0027 at a summit with Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson this year.           A hundred British soldiers will spend five weeks on a forensic excavation of the banks of the river Alme in Germany           Police are investigating the site near to where two-year-old Katrice was last seen           The latest investigation is considering the theory that the toddler was abducted and possibly taken to the River Alme          Katrice Lee vanished on 28 November 1981, her second birthday, as her mother was buying treats for a birthday teaHe said, during the initial investigation, border guards were not informed when Katrice disappeared, statements from shop workers were not taken until six weeks later and information about an eye condition Katrice had was not made known. He added: \u0027Hopefully, we can resolve issues and find out where my daughter is.\u0027  Mr Williamson said Katrice\u0027s case was heart-wrenching, adding: \u0027The disappearance of a child is every parent’s worst nightmare and I have been struck by the courage and dignity of the Lee family who have never given up on their search for Katrice.\u0027As this major dig gets under way, the efforts and expertise of the Royal Military Police are behind the family.\u0027Anyone with information for the Operation Bute team, should call the UK helpline on 0800 616888 or the Germany helpline on 0800 184 2222.

He spent a month photographing the country and then returned to the US on several other trips. In this picture, Mr Carnicelli captured a young boy in Chicago leaning against a signpost at the moment a green bus marked \u0027INDIANA\u0027 passes by in 1966          When Mr Carnicelli (pictured in New York in 1966) returned to Italy after his first trip to the US, he showcased his photographs in an exhibition in Milan titled \u0027I\u0027m sorry, America\u0027          His new book says he named that exhibition  because he \u0027felt almost like an intruder in a society completely new to him\u0027. A group of construction workers are pictured giving directions in New York in 1966          He went on to become a freelance photojournalist who worked with several Italian newspapers and magazines and traveled around the world until he retired from photography in the early 1970s.  A retired trade union worker is pictured in Detroit in 1966          Mr Carnicelli (pictured today) tells DailyMail.com that he \u0027felt as if I were living in another dimension\u0027 when he first visited the US in 1966. \u0027I was captivated by the carefree spirit and the freedom that America offered with its mix of cultures and traditions,\u0027 he saysHe adds: \u0027America is a state of mind. Telling it is easy and difficult at the same time. Behind that opulent face, it has many others all of them true, all of them deeply meaningful.\u0027 The images also showed the sadness and loneliness juxtaposed with the American Dream from his European perspective. He realized America was far more complex than he had expected and, when he returned to Italy, Mr Carnicelli showcased the images in an exhibition in Milan titled \u0027I\u0027m sorry, America\u0027. His book says he felt he was trespassing in a place that was unfamiliar to him.\u0027Looking back now, it was as if I wanted to apologize for what I had recorded as a photographer,\u0027 Mr Carnicelli says. \u0027I did feel like an intruder investigating a new society at that time.\u0027After that first trip to the US, he returned to the US several times and photographed cities including New York, Boston, Chicago, Detroit, Buffalo, Dallas and San Francisco.He was able to capture men resting against a wall as they wait in line at a job center in Chicago, a man selling newspapers in New York, a trade union worker wearing a colorful hat and jewelry in Detroit, the impatient looks of people in phone booths at O\u0027Hare International Airport in Chicago, people resting on benches at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, DC and Neo-Nazis demonstrating in Dallas.\u0027The images come very naturally,\u0027 he says. \u0027I did not have to look for them, they just showed up.\u0027            Mr Carnicelli had decided to put his camera down to open his own photography business, where he developed and printed photos in Florence. This schoolboy was photographed by Mr Carnicelli in 1966 in New York          While he worked on his business, Mr Carnicelli\u0027s own photographs ended up being stored in his cellar for 50 years before they were rediscovered last year. Men are pictured leaning against a wall and waiting in line at a job center in Chicago in 1966          He closed his store back in 2010 and asked curator Bärbel Reinhard to look at the negatives he had tucked away. As she looked through the images, she found thousands of images from the \u002760s and \u002770s, including the ones he took of the US - including this photo, showing people walking past the South Pacific Restaurant on an evening in Chicago in 1966          His photographs from his visits to the US are being published for the first time this month in a new book, American Voyage. A black \u002767 Plymouth Belvedere is pictured in Brooklyn in 1967Mr Carnicelli\u0027s family ran a photography equipment business when he was growing up, so it wasn\u0027t a surprise that he started taking photographs himself. He went on to work as a freelance photojournalist for Italian newspapers and magazines including Panorama, Corriere della Sera and Il Giorno.He traveled around the world for his work and even had several exhibitions of his work in the \u002760s and \u002770s. However, by the early 1970s, he decided to retire from photography and open a photo development and printing business in Florence, following in his family\u0027s footsteps.Thousands of his photographs, including those he took on his visits to the US, were stored away in his cellar and forgotten for 50 years until they were rediscovered by curator Bärbel Reinhard last year.

This is not possible. Photography is subjective, the image does not belong to who takes it, it belongs to the viewer who gives it their own interpretation.\u0027American Voyage, published by Reel Art Press, will be released this month. An accompanying exhibition at the David Hill Gallery in London opened on April 20 and will run through June 8.          According to The Guardian, Mr Carnicelli took this photograph of a man in front of a shop window displaying nurses\u0027 uniforms just outside New York. The outlet reported that Mr Carnicelli had been intrigued by the mannequins when the man walked by          An exhibition to accompany Mr Carnicelli\u0027s new book opened on April 20 and will run through June 8.

Legal claims that can be heard by an arbitrator under the scheme, without the claimant facing unaffordable legal costs associated with court actions, include libel, invasion of privacy, data protection and harassment.Bringing an arbitration case will cost the claimant a maximum of £100. And under the new rules they could be awarded up to £60,000, including aggravated damages.IPSO’s chief executive, Matt Tee, said of the development: ‘Lord Justice Leveson stressed the importance of having a low-cost means of people that had been wronged by a newspaper getting compensation, without the expense of court and legal fees.‘The new IPSO scheme does exactly that and the papers are not able to choose which cases they take.’Once IPSO has accepted the claim, a senior barrister will be appointed as an arbitrator. The arbitrator then makes a preliminary ruling on some of the issues at the centre of the dispute.This will indicate how likely it is that the claim will succeed and provide a basis for settlement negotiations.If either of the parties wants to continue the claim, it then goes to a final ruling stage. If the claim is successful, the arbitrator can award damages of up to £60,000.The existing scheme has been in place for 18 months.

We decided to go for a drink, just the two of us, and it was a complete whirlwind from there.\u0027We were even talking about engagement rings just six weeks into being an official couple. All our friends kept laughing about how bouncy Andrew seemed, saying he had a real spring in his step.\u0027Everyone said they knew we\u0027d end up together.\u0027Starting life as a married couple, Sarah and Andrew\u0027s minds turned to children.But, after years of trying to no avail, tests revealed they both had fertility issues and sadly, IVF treatment, which they had in the early noughties, was unsuccessful.

For us, children were just never meant to be – but Andrew would have made a great dad.\u0027Shortly before his diagnosis, Andrew\u0027s symptoms had meant he had given up his job as a geneticist, swapping it for a job in Tesco, where he stayed for a year.As the disease progressed, he gradually became more forgetful and disorientated, ringing Sarah up to 30 times in one go, as he could not remember if they had already spoken.

I think he felt part of him had gone.\u0027In November 2007, after Andrew became doubly incontinent, it was agreed he would move into assisted living nearby.Then 18 months later, he had a PEG tube inserted to help feed him.\u0027Before that, he\u0027d been eating mashed up food, one teaspoon at a time,\u0027 said Sarah.\u0027He looked like a skeleton.

He spent a month photographing the country and then returned to the US on several other trips. In this picture, Mr Carnicelli captured a young boy in Chicago leaning against a signpost at the moment a green bus marked \u0027INDIANA\u0027 passes by in 1966          When Mr Carnicelli (pictured in New York in 1966) returned to Italy after his first trip to the US, he showcased his photographs in an exhibition in Milan titled \u0027I\u0027m sorry, America\u0027          His new book says he named that exhibition  because he \u0027felt almost like an intruder in a society completely new to him\u0027. A group of construction workers are pictured giving directions in New York in 1966          He went on to become a freelance photojournalist who worked with several Italian newspapers and magazines and traveled around the world until he retired from photography in the early 1970s.  A retired trade union worker is pictured in Detroit in 1966          Mr Carnicelli (pictured today) tells DailyMail.com that he \u0027felt as if I were living in another dimension\u0027 when he first visited the US in 1966. \u0027I was captivated by the carefree spirit and the freedom that America offered with its mix of cultures and traditions,\u0027 he saysHe adds: \u0027America is a state of mind. Telling it is easy and difficult at the same time. Behind that opulent face, it has many others all of them true, all of them deeply meaningful.\u0027 The images also showed the sadness and loneliness juxtaposed with the American Dream from his European perspective. He realized America was far more complex than he had expected and, when he returned to Italy, Mr Carnicelli showcased the images in an exhibition in Milan titled \u0027I\u0027m sorry, America\u0027. His book says he felt he was trespassing in a place that was unfamiliar to him.\u0027Looking back now, it was as if I wanted to apologize for what I had recorded as a photographer,\u0027 Mr Carnicelli says. \u0027I did feel like an intruder investigating a new society at that time.\u0027After that first trip to the US, he returned to the US several times and photographed cities including New York, Boston, Chicago, Detroit, Buffalo, Dallas and San Francisco.He was able to capture men resting against a wall as they wait in line at a job center in Chicago, a man selling newspapers in New York, a trade union worker wearing a colorful hat and jewelry in Detroit, the impatient looks of people in phone booths at O\u0027Hare International Airport in Chicago, people resting on benches at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, DC and Neo-Nazis demonstrating in Dallas.\u0027The images come very naturally,\u0027 he says. \u0027I did not have to look for them, they just showed up.\u0027            Mr Carnicelli had decided to put his camera down to open his own photography business, where he developed and printed photos in Florence. This schoolboy was photographed by Mr Carnicelli in 1966 in New York          While he worked on his business, Mr Carnicelli\u0027s own photographs ended up being stored in his cellar for 50 years before they were rediscovered last year. Men are pictured leaning against a wall and waiting in line at a job center in Chicago in 1966          He closed his store back in 2010 and asked curator Bärbel Reinhard to look at the negatives he had tucked away. As she looked through the images, she found thousands of images from the \u002760s and \u002770s, including the ones he took of the US - including this photo, showing people walking past the South Pacific Restaurant on an evening in Chicago in 1966          His photographs from his visits to the US are being published for the first time this month in a new book, American Voyage. A black \u002767 Plymouth Belvedere is pictured in Brooklyn in 1967Mr Carnicelli\u0027s family ran a photography equipment business when he was growing up, so it wasn\u0027t a surprise that he started taking photographs himself. He went on to work as a freelance photojournalist for Italian newspapers and magazines including Panorama, Corriere della Sera and Il Giorno.He traveled around the world for his work and even had several exhibitions of his work in the \u002760s and \u002770s. However, by the early 1970s, he decided to retire from photography and open a photo development and printing business in Florence, following in his family\u0027s footsteps.Thousands of his photographs, including those he took on his visits to the US, were stored away in his cellar and forgotten for 50 years until they were rediscovered by curator Bärbel Reinhard last year.

This is not possible. Photography is subjective, the image does not belong to who takes it, it belongs to the viewer who gives it their own interpretation.\u0027American Voyage, published by Reel Art Press, will be released this month. An accompanying exhibition at the David Hill Gallery in London opened on April 20 and will run through June 8.          According to The Guardian, Mr Carnicelli took this photograph of a man in front of a shop window displaying nurses\u0027 uniforms just outside New York. The outlet reported that Mr Carnicelli had been intrigued by the mannequins when the man walked by          An exhibition to accompany Mr Carnicelli\u0027s new book opened on April 20 and will run through June 8. Two fashion students are pictured walking past construction in New York in 1966          During his career as a photographer in the \u002760s and \u002770s, Mr Carnicelli had several exhibitions for his work in the Milan, Bologna and Florence and Prague.

Eyes on the wall are looking back. There’s tension there. I’m not sure if it’s hopeful or not’I’ve lived in Belfast almost all my life. When I took this, I had recently moved to the north of the city, to Limestone Road, in search of cheaper rent. I didn’t know until after I moved in, but it was at the border between a Catholic and a Protestant area. For the first time in my life, I witnessed sectarian violence right on my doorstep: regular riots, brick and bottle throwing.I took it just off Limestone Road, a few minutes from where I lived and still close to where I am now. As a photographer, you get a sort of sixth sense for places that might prove interesting and that’s what drew me here. The place was abandoned, ruined. I’ve no idea who put the chairs there, or whether they were the same people who sprayed the graffiti and smashed the wall. At first glance, the hole looks like it’s been broken through, but if you look closer you can see intact bricks jutting out, almost as if it was taken apart brick by brick.The chairs look out on to the green space, but then there’s a pair of eyes on the wall looking back. I’m interested in the tension between those views. I’m not sure if it’s hopeful or not. Then there’s the evidence of activity, perhaps by different people at different times who’ve long since disappeared. It’s an aftermath, but an aftermath of small, local events – not of a major battle or anything like that.It was taken some time ago, in 2002, but I’ve been making photographs of Belfast since the late 1980s. I’ve traversed it back and forth on foot. That’s the thing about living in a relatively small city for decades: you can observe small changes as they happen, while keeping a sense of the place as a whole. It all adds up to a portrait of Belfast through the decades.After the ceasefire, things started to change and I wanted to capture the new cityscape that was being put in place, which was at times reminiscent of a theatre set. One day, I saw giant trees being carted around the city on lorries. It was all part of the wave of redevelopment surrounding the peace process, with murals of new buildings against blue skies – in lieu of murals of gunmen. The developments were called things like Meridian Plaza or Horizon Building. It was a kind of anodyne future being plotted out for Belfast. But the reality of the city was always different.I’ve been back to this spot since. The building has been knocked down and replaced with an old people’s home. The residents probably have that same view out over Alexandra Park. It’s the only park in Belfast with a wall running through it — one of the so-called peace lines. There are miles of these walls criss-crossing the city. It’s still a very ided place. There’s a long way to go.I once showed this in a gallery in London and it was stolen. Somebody must’ve liked it enough to take it – and it was quite a posh gallery, too.Training: Documentary photography in Newport and Fine Art Photography in Glasgow.Influences: “Tom Paulin’s The Strange Museum and Rebecca Solnit’s Wanderlust.”High point: “Getting my series Bonfires printed by Steidl.”Low point: “Machine-printing holiday photos at Quik Snaps for seven years to get access to their dark room.”Top tip: “Keep your negatives in order.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b4bdadb22cbdea0ab3d59d00b8420486c7b6aa4/0_334_4943_2966/master/4943.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b96e3d8d509d8f0311d0bdcf27e4f4c","title":"museum of pizza eggs ice cream alternative museums too far","story":"As New York prepares to welcome the Museum of Pizza, it will join similar pop-ups aimed more at inspiring Instagram selfies than spreading knowledgeAmerica’s first pizzeria opened at 32 Spring Street in New York City in 1905. It was founded by Italian pizza maker Gennaro Lombardi, who sold each slice for five cents. The Museum of Pizza, opening this fall in New York, may or may not acknowledge this piece of history, and there’s a reason why.It’s a selfie museum. Rather than hanging photos on a wall and outlining the chronological history of pizza, it’s a tourist-aiming pop-up space fit for a digital-savvy generation, featuring a pizza beach, a pizza cave and several funhouse spots to pose and celebrate pizza.Call it the Kusama effect. Since Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama’s Infinity Mirror Room exhibition has taken off (the recent Los Angeles opening of her show at The Broad sold out their 50,000 tickets in less than two hours), it has fueled a debate around selfie-friendly art.Although Kusama’s artworks were not necessarily made for the smartphone (many were made in the 1960s), it’s still part of the “made-for-Instagram” exhibits, or “selfie factories”.It was partly propelled by the Museum of Ice Cream, which launched in New York in 2016 and tapped into a serious demand. They sold more than 300,000 tickets priced at $18 in the first five days of its opening in 2016, resulting in a $5.4m haul. It has since traveled to Los Angeles, Miami and San Francisco, where they almost doubled their ticket price to $38, and sold out six months’ worth of tickets in less than two hours.Meanwhile the “real museums” are struggling to pay the bills. The Berkshire Museum in Pittsfield is auctioning off 13 artworks, including classics by American painter Norman Rockwell, to meet their $55m debt. La Salle University in Philadelphia is also selling 46 artworks to raise roughly $10m, which will go towards funding new teaching initiatives.Artnet critic Ben Davis has warned that the new pop-up museums are contrived to feed our vanity. “It is an attraction that quite literally aspires to be the visual equivalent of junk food,” he writes. “It is a very, very serious force to be reckoned with, rivaling the popularity of actual museums in any city it lands in.”While going to museums is supposed to be fun – as well as educational – are pop-up, photo-op museums the new Disneyland of the art world? “We see an opportunity to add new layers of playfulness to the current art, food and learning experience,” said Kareem Rahma, founder of the Museum of Pizza. “We love how the experiential aspects of a children’s science museum and the zany fun quality of Pee Wee’s Playhouse makes learning fun.”The Museum of Pizza aims to balance Instagram selfies with the history of pizza. “Our visitors will learn more about their relationship with food, pizza, art and walk away with some really great memories and photos,” said Rahma. “People want to learn and take selfies so we’re creating an opportunity to do both simultaneously.”As museums adapt to suit a younger generation, it’s not always seen as the answer. “We’ve noticed more iPads and museums apps, but we think it only keeps younger people staring at their phones instead of experiencing the museum itself,” said Rahma. “We feel the gap between looking at art on screen and looking at art on a wall has closed. Artists are great at creating experiences and we think museums are catching on.”A similar approach to photo-friendly “art” is taken in a pop-up called the Egg House, which celebrates the egg. Set in the heart of Manhattan, the exhibition features giant eggs, an oversized egg carton and an egg pool with palm trees.“It aims to provide a quick getaway from the daily life through a fantasized theme-house,” said Biubiu Xu, founder of the Egg House, which runs until 27 June. “People have the need to immerse themselves in another refreshing and inspiring environment the Egg House allows them to do that.”Xu helped stage the exhibition with the smartphone in mind, proving that museums are changing in the face of social media.“Now, the focus is not only on pleasing the visitors but the lens,” said Xu. “We think it’s not necessarily a bad or superficial thing – cameras are better vehicles for communicating things for a shorter attention , which is the case for the current generation.”However, with the rise of selfie-driven museums, the “wow factor” has to be over the top, as the stakes are higher for a digital savvy audience. “The younger generation is definitely harder to please,” said Xu. “They’ve seen everything, so more interactive experiences for all senses is necessary – that means, visual installations, more foods, sounds and even smells.”But this selfie-driven pop-up is not the place to learn about the history of eggs, it’s not even a thoughtful take on agriculture in America, never mind the controversy around animal cruelty and free-range or ethical eggs. “The Egg House is more of a funhouse rather than an exhibit,” said Xu. “The experience aims at providing a fantasy space where guests can play or interact and enjoy themselves it’s not an educational space.”A more traditionally food-centric offering, the Pizza Hut Museum, recently opened in Kansas and honors the half-century-old restaurant chain, yet hasn’t made the same splash on social media. At the same time, selfie museums, like the sold-out Color Factory in San Francisco, which features a confetti room, rainbow-hued photo-ops has garnered more than 100,000 followers on Instagram. But these new museums may have to evolve to acquire staying power. They may be on the rise, but the most Instagrammed museum in America remains the politan Museum of Art followed by the Museum of Modern Art and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.Maybe it isn’t about the photo, after all? “White box museums forbid you to touch the art, which for me personally inspired the burning desire to touch all the art!” said Rahma. “We’re like the second-coming of the interactive science museum – we’re a fully immersive space with many different experiences, all in one.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7278a693c8091c44d4ebfe6ea2b6c47d03495cb5/0_251_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=909059cd86a243db8962afce150ca4ce","title":"may day celebrations in glastonbury in pictures","story":"Although more synonymous with International Workers’ Day and Labour Day, May Day, or Beltane, is celebrated by druids and pagans as the beginning of summer.

If it had seen any hint of the problems, it wouldn’t have pressed on.Paul Pester can’t say how many people have left TSB since the crisis began.And the committee’s obvious amazement, Paul Pester thinks TSB can still win new customers in the weeks and months ahead.Nicky Morgan picks her jaw off the floor, and lashes Pester for simply not understanding the impact of this crisis:Do you recognise the reputational damage that this has caused, not just to TSB but to online banking generally?The UK needs TSB to be a challenger to the big five banks, Pester insists.Your customers need TSB to provide a good banking service, Morgan shoots back.Pester tried to pay tribute to TSB’s thousands of hard working staff, saying he’s confidence that his ‘partners’ can persuade customers to move to TSB in the future.Those partners have been badly let down by senior management, Morgan retorts.Pester says customers should use TSB’s online complaint form to get in touch, rather than trying to phone or using social media to report problems.Everyone enjoys tweeting, but it is ‘shouting into the void’, TSB’s CEO adds.Nicky Morgan won’t stand for this, pointing out that TSB’s own Twitter account says people should phone.They can phone if they prefer, Pester replies.After 90 minutes of evidence, Morgan has heard enough - and lays into Pester:What we are hearing this afternoon is the most staggering example of a chief executive who seems unwilling to realise the scale of the problem that is being faced.Saying that tweeting is ‘shouting into the void’ doesn’t show much commitment to digital, she adds firmly.Simon Clarke MP brings up the case of a third constituent, whose business is threatened because he can’t access his banking services.Pester sounds concerned, but he is also insistent that most of TSB’s services are working well. Millions of customers are using their bank cards every day, he says.There’s clearly a disconnect here -- MPs (and the media) are hearing from people in a real fix, but TSB thinks problems are intermittent.Q: What is the quantum of the compensation bill?Pester sways away from this one, playing the “we’ve been so focused fixing the problems that we haven’t calculated it” card.Conservative Simon Clarke MP now challenges Pester, citing the case of a constituent called Kerry.She has been stuck on telephone lines, paying 50p per minute. She relies on pensions credit, and is at her “wits end” with her gas about to be cut off.Q: who should she contact to resolve this today?Pester apologises to Kerry, and says that TSB wants to deal with complaints. Again, he encourages customers to get in touch with their problems.He also reveals that the bank is using ‘artificial intelligence’ to find vulnerable customers.(I’m glad to see there’s some intelligence involved in this mess).Clarke then cites another customer - Alison Wickes, who lost a non-returnable deposit on a car because she couldn’t get the money to buy it out of TSB, and the dealer sold it to someone else.More reaction from irate customers....Q: Has this shambles, or meltdown, put customers at risk of fraud?Based on experience, we know that fraudsters will be following the news, following social media and will take any opportunity to take advantage, Pester replies. That’s why TSB wrote to customers this week warning them to be careful.Q: Will there be any legal action over this mess?But....TSB’s chairman is more circumspect. Richard Meddings says it all depends on Slaughter and May’s independent review:Q: When will this shambles be over, asks John MannMeddings says TSB is seeing “improvement” on its online services, and across its other channels.But it’s still not good enough”.The wrong thing to do would be to set a date, Meddings claims -- but “we are working as hard and as fast as we can”.Q: Can you do better, Mr Pester?I can’t give a fixed date, Pester replies. If I give one it’s likely to be unfair to customers, he adds.Q: This week, next week, the week after next?Pester won’t be drawn.Mann turns in exasperation to Sabadell’s COO, Miguel Montes....We are very close, Montes replies.Q: That sound like days. Could it be days?John Mann turns to the issue of compensation, and the case of a TSB customer whose wedding planning thanks to the IT chaos.Q: How will TSB make things right?Meddings says TSB don’t simply use a ‘financial calculation’ when assessing compensation. It will also take stress and inconvenience into account.Deloitte are helping TSB to draw up a framework to help deal with compensation claims, Meddings explainsQ: What if customers aren’t satisfied?They could consider appealing to a financial onbudsman, Meddings suggests.Mann turns his guns to chairman Richard Medding about the “shambles” at TSB.The only similar mess I can remember in my time on this committee is the Co-op Bank, says Mann. They lost their chief executive and chairman - are you going to lose yours too? Q: What about Mr Pester’s bonuses?Boom! Meddings reveals that Pester has offered to give up the bonus related to the successful migration of the IT system. That’s the right thing to do, Meddings adds.Q: So, no bonus for Mr Pester this year?It’s not as simple as that. A decision over his total pay and bonus package will be taken at the end of the year, once the review into the IT project has been concluded, Meddings explains."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ffa74d0828da201ada3d4d59191b91967e34151b/0_105_4342_2605/master/4342.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a3b96f2b34419cc0c69e88b88c081366","title":"an open book a photographers love letter to city libraries in pictures","story":"Swiss librarian and photographer Thomas Guignard captures the beauty, symmetry and intricate designs of libraries across the worldTo some they are a sanctuary, to others a place of silent boredom, but to Swiss photographer Thomas Guignard libraries are a thing ofbeauty. Working as a librarian and photographer for the last 12 years, Canada-based Guignard combines his great loves in the Instagram account @concretelibraries. “Libraries are the tangible, physical and often monumental representation of human knowledge,” he says. “They are built to share and make that knowledge accessible, to foster community, to encourage the sharing of ideas and invite everyone to contribute to that trove of knowledge.”Guignard has photographed library buildings across the world, from his current hometown of Toronto to Oxford, UK via Detroit in the US. So far he’s visited 35 libraries and has a bucket list of about 310 that he hopes to visit and photograph in the future. Guignard’s interest in library architecture grew in parallel with his photography practice. Whilst working for the library at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, Switzerland, he was involved in the development of a new learning centre, which opened in 2010. As part of his research, Guignard visited other, photographing unique details of their design, and gradually became fascinated by them.“As I visited those libraries, I took more and more pictures, and became more interested in those spaces for their unique aesthetics,” he says.“I try to use symmetry and pay particular attention to how I align my shots to highlight the sacredness of these spaces.”Guignard sees libraries as symbols of “gathering places for communities”. “They are participatory they can’t exist without users, a community – and, of course, librarians and library workers, who do so much more than just stamp out books.” Cities brings together the best in urban photography on Instagram at @cities.

Literally. From Malaysia to Dubai, luxury developments are rising on artificial islands and coastlines. Everybody wins – except the local sea life and the fishermen who depend on itby Wade Shepard in George TownAsia is growing. Literally. From Malaysia to Dubai, luxury developments are rising on artificial islands and coastlines. Everybody wins – except the local sea life and the fishermen who depend on itby Wade Shepard in George Town“Before, there were many fish,” says fisherman Mohd-Ishak Bin Abdul Rahman as he pulls a dried up crab from his net. A few years ago he could just walk out into the surf and pick up crustaceans with his bare hands, he tells me. “Now, nothing.”He blames the palisade of new luxury condominiums that rise on the coastline behind him. Built on 240-acres of land artificially reclaimed from the sea, they are part of the Seri Tanjung Pinang 1 (STP1) project. Started in 2006, it brought a taste of new Asian modernity to what was then a rural area beyond the fringes of George Town, Penang’s only city. It also took away the fish, says Mohd-Ishak.The 72-year-old is the undisputed chief of Tanjong Tokong, a fishing village of 100 houses built by the community a few decades ago. He is also the leader of a movement of fishermen protesting against development projects they claim are destroying the island’s fisheries, and with them their livelihoods.Mohd-Ishak says his family has been fishing the area for at least five generations. As we talk, shirtless fishermen watch cautiously from handmade hammocks, half-broken plastic chairs and pieces of junk that washed up on the shore.The contrast between the village with its shacks built from planks, beams and drift wood and the condos, swimming pools, luxury mall and Irish-themed pub is extreme.Now the second phase of the STP project is in full swing. Dredgers, barges, bulldozers and diggers operated by a local subsidiary of the China Communications Construction Company (CCCC) are busy creating 1,000 more acres of land for luxury development. Slated for completion in 15 years, the STP2 development is expected to have an eventual value of $4.4bn.Land reclamation is nothing new in Asia – China, Hong Kong and Japan have been at it since the 19th century – but it has recently reached epidemic proportions. Maritime ecosystems are abruptly transformed as natural islands are artificially conjoined with coastlines, natural shorelines are extended and artificial islands are built from scratch.Cities on China’s coast reclaimed an average of 700 square kilometres of land – that’s about the size of Singapore – from the sea every year from 2006 to 2010 for new houses, industrial zones and ports. The 130 sq km of land that was reclaimed to build the new city of Nanhui was significant enough to reconfigure China’s national map, and the reclaimed land for the Caofeidian economic zone was twice the size of Los Angeles.Concerned these megaprojects were getting out of control and doing irreparable harm to the environment, Beijing stepped in earlier this year and put an end to land reclamation projects that were not spearheaded by central government.Meanwhile, many Asian cities are picking up where China left off. Besides the STP projects on Penang, Malaysia has massive reclamation works under way for the 700,000-person Forest City in Johor the Philippines is reclaiming 1,010 acres from the sea for its New Manila Bay – City of Pearl Cambodia is building a slew of Chinese-financed properties on reclaimed land Dubai has turned reclamation into an art form and Sri Lanka is building a new financial district on the dredged and deposited land of Colombo International Financial City. Around a quarter of modern-day Singapore was open sea when the nation state came into existence in 1955.Apart from acting as geopolitical flash points – reclamation in the South China Sea is repeatedly bringing the region to the brink of conflict – sourcing the sand is a major problem. Malaysia, Indonesia, Cambodia and Vietnam have already banned the export of sand, with reports of a multibillion dollar black market run by organised crime syndicates. Some of Indonesia’s Riau Islands have mysteriously disappeared – loaded on to barges and shipped to nearby Singapore, reports suggest. The verdant, hilly island of Penang has been gripped by a development boom since the historic centre of George Town was declared a Unesco world heritage site in 2008. As tourists poured in from all over the world, so too did prospective property buyers looking to take advantage of the Malaysia My Second Home programme, and floods of east Asian real estate speculators.“Penang has this obsession with wanting to become like Hong Kong and Singapore,” explains Andrew Ng Yew Han, a local film-maker who has documented Penang’s development.The state government’s crosshairs soon fell upon the other natural feature hemming in their ambitions: the sea. Taking a trick from the playbooks of their model cities, Hong Kong and Singapore, Penang launched several large-scale reclamation initiatives – many strategically placed in prime locations.This ability to home in on high-value sections of cities to reclaim land for new development often produces incredible profits. Research from Ocean University of China professor Liu Hongbin found that land reclamation in China can produce a 10- to 100-fold profit.“If you are confident that you can sell the properties at a high price, which is likely the case at the fringe of large coastal cities or in popular coastal tourism destinations, reclaiming the land from scratch could potentially be more profitable than building on extremely expensive existing land,” explains Matthias Bauer, an urban designer who has worked on reclamation projects in China. However, there is a lot more at stake with these projects than the money that is invested in them. Not only are the fishermen of Tanjong Tokong banned from entering what was once an extremely productive fishing ground but there are now fewer fish in the waters near their village. Mohd-Ishak claims his catches have halved since development began.Walking with him down the beach, another fisherman calls me over to his small house. His name is Haron Din, and his torso and legs are covered in the traditional tattoos that many fishermen in south-east Asia once wore. At his feet lie piles of torn up old nets. He pulls out a dried up crab and explains it was dead long before it got tangled in his net. “The mud from the project suffocates them,” he says.Holding a shiny new white net next to one of the 40 or so damaged ones littering the beach, Din complains that mud from the nearby reclamation area is killing the local marine life and doing irreparable damage to their fishing equipment.The fishermen must travel further out to sea to find fish, which drastically increases both the cost of petrol and the dangers of the job. Unable to make a living in their sheltered bay, they now have to cross a busy shipping lane and contend with higher waves. There have already been a few deaths, Mohd-Ishak says.Mageswari Sangaralingam, a research officer for Friends of the Earth Malaysia, says the thousands of sq km of land reclaimed across coastal Asia has meant the annihilation of mangroves, wetlands and reefs – destroying the habitats and breeding grounds for fish, sea turtles, crustaceans, plants and other marine life. In addition, the new cities, transport hubs and industrial zones built on the new land inevitably create added pollution and waste, he says.“The multimillion-ringgit fisheries sector here on which thousands depend is being traded off for development,” says Sangaralingam. “Fish are being wiped out, and the fishermen will soon be too as they lose fishing grounds.”“You have this development and yet people are losing their jobs,” adds film-maker Han. “You have reclamation which promised development, but you have fishermen who are losing their livelihoods, looking for second jobs … You build so many buildings here but in the end it doesn’t belong to us, it will be bought up by other people and foreigners.”I visit Straits Quay – the high-end shopping mall surrounded by luxury condos overlooking the fishing village. On three trips here I’ve never seen anyone actually shopping in its luxury boutiques. The hallways are bare wind tunnels and even the giant atrium that acts as an opulent entranceway to the mall appears desolate, echoing the caws of resident crows and little else. If it wasn’t for a few stragglers slipping in and out to pick up groceries at the small supermarket – and the yacht owners drinking on the patio of the Irish-themed pub – the place could be called a ghost mall.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7a6e9e7657f6b5bd0877bca6cddc1da01df39c8/49_0_1713_1028/master/1713.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d72183a9944e50ca6b35048359020554","title":"brexit new respect house of lords","story":"I hate it when people call me a lady. At my girls’ school, when the teachers used to holler, “Keep to the left, ladies!” , I preciously exclaimed: “I’m not a lady, I’m a citizen.” My deep mistrust of any sort of nobility was drummed in from an early age. In our house the only thing worse than the nobs in the House of Lords were the bishops. The idea that an entitled, unelected class or religion had a role in our democracy was anathema.Even after the reforms of the 1990s that saw the Lords turn mostly into a place for old MPs and good eggs, I remained steadfast in my criticism. While many had merit, that merit seemed to have some serious crossover with being mates with politicians.Maybe it’s my age, or the fact that I’ve become an establishment shill, but my attitude to those who walk the red carpet of Westminster is softening. Just as the Daily Mail has done the opposite about-turn, it is a completely fair criticism to say that I have started to see the need for the House of Lords at the exact moment they started to agree with what I think. I’m a total glory supporter, I’m the Manchester United fan who lives in Chiswick, and I’m absolutely fine with that.Earlier this week, the Lords defeated the government on an amendment that will give MPs the power to stop the UK from leaving the EU without a deal. They also voted through a plan requiring ministers to report on the steps they are taking to negotiate a continued EU-UK customs union. Jacob Rees-Mogg predictably tweeted: “Labour and Lib Dem peers vote to give themselves a veto on Brexit. What about democracy?”Unlike Rees-Mogg’s father, my dad was never in the Lords, so perhaps he knows some noble secrets I don’t. But I’m fairly certain that what happened was that the Lords gave us MPs a chance to vote in the event of a “no deal” situation. Perhaps I like the Lords now because they are saying what I was raised to think: that the House of Commons is the only real representation of the people. They are trying to invest a stunted, weak and indecisive House of Commons with the power to do what is best for our constituents.Today the House of Commons finds itself a hung parliament, where the power of a pressure group and fears of positions stunt proceedings. The current feral nature of our politics means elected parliamentarians can find their minds clouded by fear – not of defeat at the ballot box, but reprisals from an angry online mob or, at the moment, their own political parties. Never before has there been quite such a need for cool heads who are not bothered about their careers and their particular allegiances. The Lords are not saying they want us to stay in the EU, or that they will use their power to force it: they are dealing in the details of how we leave, and thank God someone is. One baroness who is a former MP once commented to me that in the Lords the quality of the debate was better but that there was no adrenaline. Today, it feels as though quantity is all that matters in the Commons, and so perhaps an unelected chamber troubled with quality isn’t such a bad thing.As they are currently enjoying the rock star status of actually achieving something in parliament, I spoke to more members of the Lords this week than I normally do. Every single one, from pretty much every party, all said the same thing: that they wanted to give the Commons a chance to properly consider the customs union, and to give them a chance to vote against a possible disaster. They all also said that when it is our turn to vote on their suggestions, they will respect the collective decision of MPs, and only the votes that lose by the slimmest of majorities will ever get another going over at their end of parliament. What I heard was a group of people who knew their place, and who revere democracy above all else.When the revolution comes I will still be tearing up the ermine and painting over the gold with a nice magnolia. I do not believe power can be bestowed, no matter how good you are at science, or who your dad was. But for now I fight the war in front of me, and it seems I have some very unlikely allies.• Jess Phillips is the Labour MP for Birmingham Yardley"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de058f5e53e4242b23a19f86f3d5bad25d007c09/0_87_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2cc9bd197741c7a788cc938f904daebb","title":"the most farcical day yet with brexit your best comments today","story":"Interesting discussion on site today stemmed from Rees-Mogg calling May’s preferred customs model as ‘deeply unsatisfactory’Reaction to the live blog’s updates on what the best EU customs proposal looks like provoked some of the most interesting discussion on site today.

To join in the conversation you can click on the links in the comments below to expand and add your thoughts. We’ll continue to highlight more comments worth reading as the day goes on.Today’s politics live blog has generated a lot of conversation below the line about how much time has been wasted discussing custom deals that have already been rejected by the EU.Today is possibly the most farcical day yet with Brexit. The customs partnership and streamlined approach have both been turned down by the EU as feasible approaches. Davis may call this an “opening position” but so far it seems pretty clear that neither of them will work. They are both moot. Yet, here we have the Conservative party tearing itself apart about one of these options still being pursued. Not because the EU won’t accept it, but because the Brexiters won’t accept it. It would be like a couple arguing over whether they are still considering buying a Porche, instead of a Lamborgini, when in fact they would be lucky to afford a 20-year-old Fiesta. Neither of the options is viable, stop wasting time arguing about them and think of something new, anything.jezfAre they that stupid that they still think that after two years they have time to debate which of the two proposals to put forward to the EU, even though both have already been rejected? Are they too stupid to realise that they wasted 18 months pursuing the cake-and-eat-it deal and wasted precious time when they could have been planning to effectively and competently leave the EU? Now it’s crunch time and if we don’t stay in some kind of customs union the UK will face economic turmoil. RunningbladeElle Hunt discusses the suggestion that young people should live in “centrally located but smaller” housing. You’ve been sharing your own views below the line. There is a case for the minimum to be reduced. I lived for a year in a 23m2 apartment, perfectly OK when I was single. The problem is storage for stuff bicycles, camping gear etc. The space is sufficient to live in, but we should adopt the continental idea of a storage cupboard or similar, not necessarily in the apartment.madridpunchWhen we have frequent articles and public concerns over loneliness, and articles on the effects that gadgets and TVs have on sleep if used in the bedroom, to encourage housing spaces with no communal areas seems a depressing step backwards. Not to mention the fact that constantly being out of your house socialising is very expensive, especially in a city like London. To be able to have friends over rather than go out for another overpriced cup of coffee or inflated bottle of wine would help a lot in terms of keeping costs down- for those millennials who can even afford to be constantly out of the house socialising.latenightreaderYou’ve been sharing thoughts on Ranjana Srivastava’s piece on whether older drivers should have their licences revoked if their fitness to drive is in question.A toughie. I live in a sea-side community where it is near imperative to drive to live your life. It has its share of elderly people who obviously should not still be driving. I know the day is not too far away when it will be me in that position. It will be hard but I hope I will recognise that my days of having the privilege of driving are over, that it is my responsibility to care for the wellbeing of other road uses and pedestrians and to hand my licence in. It is one of the reasons we are planning to relocate in the next couple of years to somewhere we can live without driving. We will be leaving our beautiful home of many years, but the elderly are not immune to the responsibilities of citizenship and should plan for not being able to drive as they plan for other contingencies.venusplutomoonIn New South Wales the Roads and Maritime Services has strict guidelines for fitness to drive that MUST be followed. As a doctor if someone technically meets the requirements but I have concerns I refer them for a practical driving assessment. If they don’t meet the minimum requirements the decision is simple to make and explain but often difficult for the patient to accept especially in a rural area where there is no public transport. It always makes me very sad when I have to break bad news like this but the rules are quite clear on this with very little wriggle room.dtm1966Comments have been edited for length.

It’s no shocker that Vancouver regularly tops lists of the world’s most liveable cities, but where to start if you’ve only got two days in town? MorningStart the day right at cult bakery Purebread in Gaston – an outpost of their popular Whistler address. Earl Grey and lavender scone, lemon chèvre brownies or white chocolate whoopie cookies with your morning coffee? Breakfast of champions. Suitably carbed up, join Talaysay Tours for a kayak trip (April-Sep) – paddling the Salish Sea with an indigenous guide who’ll share aboriginal history and culture with you as you explore the rainforest coast – or a Talking Trees hike (year-round) along the north shore. Learn about the Coast Salish legends of the trees while you discover the plants that were used for food, shelter, art and medicine.Stop for lunch at Tap and Barrel Shipyards for local craft beers and wine on tap, along with sustainable seafood, piled-high pizzas and rice bowls. Keep an eye out for “Mealshare” options on menus across Vancouver that provide a free meal for at-risk youths every time a Mealshare item is ordered.AfternoonYou may be surprised to find that just outside of town you’ll find a peak as tall as Wales’s Snowdon: Grouse Mountain. In summer, the Skyride Surf Adventure lets visitors ride the roof of the gondola as it climbs 1,610 metres to the summit. In winter, there’s a night-time snowshoe walk, illuminated by fairy lights. In every season, it offers spectacular views over the city. Vancouver recently legalised “happy hour”, which has been enthusiastically embraced with most restaurants running a 4-6pm deal and many offering a late-night one, too. Once you’ve scaled Grouse, head downtown for a cut-price drink and snack. Try Joe Fortes for C$5 (£2.80) happy hour beer and “buck-a-shuck” oysters Boulevard for octopus ceviche and C$6 high-balls or headcheese toast and a C$6 Aperol Spritz at Royal Dinette.NightGet the best of this fiercely foodie city through its pop-ups. Swallow Tail offers exciting culinary adventures in unusual locations, often with foraged foods. Elsewhere, Vancouver Foodster’s self-guided Tasting Plates nights are a fun way to eat around a neighbourhood, and the Greasy Spoon Diner series at Save On Meats sees big-name chefs creating upmarket takes on diner classics to raise funds for A Better Life Foundation.MorningBrunch is a big deal in Vancouver. Join the crowds at local favourite Jam for chicken and waffles or pancake-batter-dipped-and-fried sausages drenched in maple butter syrup. A few doors down is also brunch institution Chambar, where waffles – with bacon-caramel or the bon matin plate with eggs, tapenade, ham and cheese – are always just right. Next, head east to explore one of the city’s coolest neighbourhoods, centred around Main Street. Heading south from around E28th Ave, take in the colourful street art left over from the area’s annual mural festival (pictured above) then stop for a bit of shopping in Main Street’s erse indy boutiques. Browse rare vinyl at Red Cat Records, local art and graphic novels at Lucky’s Comics, handmade notebooks and badges at quirky stationery store Regional Assembly of Text and pick up a pretty floral dress or two at The Barefoot Contessa.Refuel at Dock Lunch, a 16-seat spot that looks more like your gran’s front room than a restaurant. Chef-owner Elizabeth Bryan serves up something different almost every day (apart from the non-negotiable Friday meatball banh mi) – check Instagram for the menu. If Dock Lunch is out of space, try the Cascade Room for unpretentious west coast food – the wild sockeye salmon burger is superb.AfternoonKeep cruising down Main for fine art South Main Gallery and contemporary local works and performance at Hot Art Wet City. If you’ve still got the energy, push on to Centre A in Chinatown to explore contemporary Asian art before rewarding yourself for all that culture with craft beer at relaxed Brassneck or locally distilled spirits at Juniper bar.NightFor dinner, check out the West End’s treasure trove of Asian restaurants – you’ll find a deeply satisfying, steaming bowl of ramen on every corner. Alternatively, go ultra-Canadian on your last night at the Timber gastropub, which serves comfort food favourites such as poutine and bison burgers, or try Forage for locally sourced, sustainable fare like Haida Gwaii halibut or foraged stinging nettle risotto.For more information and inspiration, see explore-canada"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9fe847ac2e86c03516703ecb54b35500f7145817/0_9_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1691c8512901a069851466e9012c49e3","title":"my canadian food odyssey by chef john quilter","story":"On his six-week journey from east to west Canada, chef John Quilter – AKA The Food Busker – finds a salt beef sandwich that’s 10 days in the making, a killer craft beer brewed with foraged herbs and the best Chinese meal outside of ChinaOn his six-week journey from east to west Canada, chef John Quilter – AKA The Food Busker – finds a salt beef sandwich that’s 10 days in the making, a killer craft beer brewed with foraged herbs and the best Chinese meal outside of ChinaFor many years, Canada has rented a room in my thoughts, ever since I worked there as a young chef. I spent a summer season in the kitchen of a restaurant in Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario, when I was 18 and had the time of my life. The people, the countryside, the food, I loved it all, and I’ve longed to go back ever since. Last year, I finally returned on an epic six-week food tour of the country. When you think of Canada, I guess you think of mountains, forest, and bears, right? That’s only half the story, but it’s true: the country has a vast natural beauty on a scale we just don’t see in Europe. As I travelled all over, Canada’s vistas constantly stopped me in my tracks. Just when you think you have seen it all – “Nothing, surely, can top Lake Louise, this has to be Canada’s most breathtaking spot!” – two days later you’re on a ranch in Alberta, riding a stallion, hearing about a cougar or a grizzly bear sighting nearby. Canada makes you look at the world through the eyes of a child. Constantly fascinated, completely immersed. The wildlife I expected, what I was not prepared for was how vibrant and unique Canada’s cities are, and the rich foodie scene that each deserves to be proud of.  Time and time again I experienced cultural centres humming and sparkling with the day-to-day life of food shopping, eating out or grabbing a coffee. I was astonished and delighted by the quality of the markets and shops, and Canada’s incredibly strong field-to-plate movement, which ensures the freshest, tastiest raw ingredients. Below are a few of my culinary highlights from the trip.Montréal is a befuddling enclave of Francophone culture in this mainly English-speaking country. The city practically fizzes with fierce French passion and values, which you can’t help but be charmed by. I fell in love with its French-style model economy of independent boulangerie, boucher and pâtisserie.Montréal to me was more than just foodie heaven, it was a blueprint for how a city could be. It’s a city that cares about the little things, such as bookshops, delicatessens, decent coffee and croissants the provenance of goods, and the importance of heritage. Montréal is full of independent shops that have been around for generations. From opening their doors every morning to closing at night, they are committed to the simple idea of creating just one thing of value – a coffee or a salt beef sandwich – and taking enjoyment and pride in the “means”. The aforementioned perfect salt beef sandwich was enjoyed at one of Montréal’s ultimate foodie landmarks, Schwartz’s. The smoked-meat experts have been trading on Saint-Laurent Boulevard since 1928, when established by Jewish immigrant Reuben Schwartz. Unlike many places, Schwartz’s still smokes its meat the old-fashioned way: with a 10-day marinade and then an eight-hour smoke before it’s sliced in front of your eyes. Frank Silva, the manager, has worked here since he was a boy, something I found time and again in Montréal. In an age when there is often little customer or staff loyalty to establishments, I found it truly enchanting.The city also lays claim to the world’s best bagel – or, rather, two of the world’s best. Locally, it is considered an undisputed fact that you won’t find a better bagel than the ones made here, but the jury is very much out over which Montréal institution is superior: St-Viateur Bagel or Fairmont Bagel. Some favour St-Viateur for the honey water they boil their bagels in, while Fairmont is so in demand it stays open 24 hours a day. Both, to me, were perfection – yet another example of the city’s impassioned, artisanal approach to food.Halifax, the capital of Nova Scotia, has a kicking live music scene, along with a fabulous market culture. The city’s Seaport Farmers’ Market on the waterfront is the oldest continuously operating farmers’ market in North America, the hub for a long list of cheese makers, fruit and vegetable producers, and wine growers from the plentiful farms in the nearby Annapolis valley. At the stall for That Dutchman’s Cheese Farm, I sampled Dragon’s Breath – one of the stinkiest, creamiest, most kick-ass blue cheeses you could imagine.But it is Halifax’s craft beer scene that rivals anything I’ve seen anywhere else. At the Good Robot Brewing Co, the female brew team of Erica Fraser and Kelly Costello create beers with locally foraged herbs and medicinal plants. The list of brews is extensive – on reflection, I may have investigated it a little too thoroughly.And the restaurants also punch way above their weight. I found classic comfort food at 2 Doors Down, where the braised Prince Edward Island beef short rib is knockout, while Halifax’s privileged coastal position also makes it a hotspot for seafood.  Ontario in east-central Canada is the province I have spent the most time in over the years, since working here as a teen, and it still feels like a home away from home. Capital city Toronto is such an enthralling city, with so much going on. What sets it apart from other cities is the sheer wealth of its ethnic communities happily living and eating together. It is one of the world’s most multicultural cities – in fact, a survey by BBC Radio named it the most erse, ahead even of London. Just over half of its residents are foreign-born, hailing from 230 different nationalities. This shows in the food scene, a heavyweight collection of authentic ethnic cuisines alongside young chefs developing and modernising traditional flavours. Here, I had stand-out Indian and Vietnamese, while Mexican food is on the rise in a big way. My favourite restaurant, and the one that sums this all up, was Snack Bar 416 (pictured above). A small hipster joint near bohemian Kensington Market, it uses all the city’s main ethnic communities as inspiration, taking one hero dish from each cuisine. Often when this pick-and-mix approach is attempted it falls flat on its face, with compromise and inexperience resulting in bland creations. Not here, not in Toronto. One of the best ways to take the culinary temperature of a city is to see how its various establishments serve brunch. I hit two spots and became addicted to Chambar on the edge of Gastown, the hipster area of the city, and the waffle heaven of Medina, which served incredible dishes with imagination and attention to detail. And then came the holy grail: a killer cup of coffee. Revolver, again in Gastown, is the coffee shop St Peter would open outside the pearly gate. Trust me.For more information and inspiration, see explore-canada"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13db697d6353b087fe4ad5d71b85ccf6c2ae77a6/0_343_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10e9e0fd9ddf93726ab15b04cf5750e9","title":"canada is one of the coolest countries on the planet if you want proof take a look at its festivals","story":"From the glamour of the Toronto International Film Festival to the freewheeling Halifax Pop Explosion, Canada’s erse, culturally dynamic population knows how to party. Get in on the action with our four favourite Canadian festivalsWhen Miguel Zamora Sanchez first arrived in Toronto after moving from his native Mexico, he was immediately struck by the city’s ersity. “The first weekend I was here it was the gay pride parade,” says the student. “And that same day I saw a jazz festival – it was spread out through the entire city.”It may all have been new to Sanchez at the time, but this will come as no surprise to anyone that’s spent much time in the country. Canadians have a long history of celebrating art and culture, resulting in a vibrant, varied, year-round festival calendar up there with the world’s best. Take the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF), which began in 1976 and attracted more than 30,000 attendees in its inaugural year. It is now one of the film industry’s highest-profile events (considered by many in Hollywood to be second only to Cannes in terms of headline premiere screenings and star power) and one of the largest publicly attended film festivals in the world – with almost 400 movies being screened and as many as 480,000 people attending.Piers Handling, director and CEO of TIFF, believes the city’s erse, multicultural population is the spine of the festival’s success. Despite the many A-listers that flock to the city every autumn for the festival – bringing the eyes of the world with them – TIFF thrives because of the people that call Toronto their home all year.“What makes the festival cool is the public,” says Handling. “It’s a very warm, welcoming and erse public. They’re not judgemental. They’re very, very open. They’re not cynical. They’re incredibly curious. So many film-makers have said that it’s the best public to show their film to for the first time.”That openness and cultural savvy isn’t just limited to film, either. Five years ago, Field Trip, an annual summer music festival that hosts approximately 10,000 visitors a day at historic Fort York in downtown Toronto, was launched. While it can be difficult for a new festival to find its footing with so many other competing brands and approaches, Field Trip has thrived because it aims to welcome a broad demographic – not just younger tastemakers.“One of the strengths of the festival is that it’s very community focused,” says Field Trips’s co-director Aaron Miller. “It’s family focused.”Held over two days in June (2-3 June 2018), the festival has brought celebrated acts such as the National and Phoenix – as well as homegrown talents Broken Social Scene and Feist – to Fort York, but still strives to curate a programme that appeals to all ages. “It’s the ersity and the inclusiveness,” Miller says of what makes the festival “cool”. “Those are obviously buzzwords that are associated with Toronto. No place is perfect and this city, like many others, has a lot of work to do. But, ultimately, Toronto does do a pretty good job of celebrating ersity. That ethos is what Field Trip really grabs on to.”Hundreds of miles away from Toronto, the port city of Halifax is also enjoying a flourishing creative movement that hinges on its ersity. Once known as Seattle of the North for its thriving grunge scene in the early 90s, the Nova Scotian capital now prides itself on attracting a wide variety of creative types.“We’re a real hub for artists and left-wing thinkers and people that want to express themselves,” says James Boyle, executive director of Halifax Pop Explosion, a multi-day music festival and conference.Boyle describes Halifax as “a melting pot of different perspectives, ideas and communities” and lauds the rich history of the African Nova Scotian community, the strength of its indigenous community and high student population as the main sources of this distinct outlook. “It’s a hub for ideas and music to flourish,” he says. “That’s why we have so many different genres of music. The city has become that place where people can come and speak their mind and push their ideas forward.”And it’s the festival-goers who reap the rewards of this freewheeling, inclusive approach, with an ever-expanding lineup of interesting, critically acclaimed acts.But few festivals can lay claim to the kind of heavy-hitting programme that Festival d’été in Quebec City offers. One of Canada’s largest music festivals, hundreds of artists play at the 11-day festival each year. Celebrating its 50th anniversary last year, it’s played host to the Rolling Stones, Metallica, Kendrick Lamar and Lady Gaga in the past four years alone. But despite the monumental acts that the festival attracts, Luci Tremblay, communications director at Festival d’été, echoes Handling’s belief that the home audience is the most integral part of the festival’s success.“The people of Quebec make Festival d’été cool because the people of Quebec are cool,” she says. “The festival belongs to them, they are defending it, they love it. Summer here is short. It’s not always warm. So the people of Quebec, as soon as it gets warm, they want to get out. So they add that spirit to the festival and that’s what makes it unique.”“The artists are discovering something,” Tremblay says of the many big names who have played the festival. “When they arrive, they discover how big the festival is and they see the huge stage we have on the Plains of Abraham, which can hold up to 100,000 people – I remember Billy Joel saying that he’d been doing this job for 50 years and he wondered why he’d never come here. It’s always a discovery like that.”For more information and inspiration, see explore-canada"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98e70765116b8f0847ead3970a60e7167b0d174a/0_34_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4a0cb22f7d60ed079dd4316381944bb2","title":"recycle the weetabix what i learned from a month on the app that tackles food waste","story":"I am walking with a woman named Kerry, whom I have just met, to her car. She is in her mid-30s and has a tinge of attitude, as if she came to London to fix it. When we reach her car, she opens the boot. Inside are hundreds of industrial-sized tubs of hummus, enough to power Brighton for a week.I met Kerry online, not via some kind of hummus-appreciation society messageboard, but on Olio, an app that is attempting to end food waste at home by letting people upload details of the food they would otherwise chuck out, so that others living nearby can take it off their hands. I am trying out the app for a couple of weeks to see if it can reduce my own waste to zero (and to see if I can get some freebies).For members willing to take things to the next level, like Kerry, they also have a “food waste heroes” programme, where volunteers offer to pick things up from cafes and shops and list this food on the site. After picking up these hummus tubs from a supplier that had no use for them, Kerry is now spending one of the hottest days of the year shepherding people to and from her car. She was disappointed when I said said I could only take four – “Are you sure your friends and family wouldn’t want some?”Most hot-button environmental issues have to go on a journey, from being pipe dreams discussed in the furthest reaches of the Glastonbury green fields to a central plank of government policy. Climate change, non-GM food, plastic pollution – they were all once dismissed as fringe politics, until the government and industry suddenly gon on board. For food waste, it seems as though that moment is now. In the past six months, Tesco has reduced all edible food waste to zero, Co-op is trialling the sale of products that have passed their best before date and the EU has announced that, for the first time, it is forcing member states to report on how much food is wasted each year, with the goal to halve waste by 2030.Launched in 2015, Olio feels part of this sea-change in our attitude to waste. The app was started by Tessa Cook and Saasha Celestial-One (the latter’s names come from her Iowa-hippy parents – although she rebelled by becoming an investment banker). Cook was previously managing director at Wonga, the controversial payday loans firm. Cook, who grew up on a farm in North Yorkshire, says she got the idea after being left with a few sweet potatoes and a cabbage on the day she was moving back to the UK from Switzerland. It was not feasible to take them with her, but knowing how much work had gone into growing fresh produce she couldn’t bring herself to chuck them out. Like so many tech-inventors of the modern era, she thought: there should be an app for that.I have to admit I was part of the problem. When I first moved out of home, I chucked out food even if it seemed fine, because I couldn’t remember how long ago I bought it. I would get lots of ingredients for a complicated recipe, use a teaspoon of each and then leave them in the fridge till they went off – not knowing what else to do with the remainder.When my partner, who works in food, first moved in, she was horrified. I was instructed that the kitchen had to change: uneaten bananas would be chopped up in the freezer for smoothies, leftover milk gets turned into labneh even the rind of the parmesan will be frozen to later be chucked into a minestrone. The kitchen became entirely refocused. The first question when cooking is not “what do you want to eat?” but “what have we got to use up”.Now I’m a fully paid-up member of the anti-food-waste brigade, Olio was an obvious thing to try out. After downloading the app, I immediately find plenty of listings, although a lot of them are more than 2km away, which seems quite a schlep to pick up a few carrots. There are a few single pastries, a half-eaten birthday cake and five leftover pieces of fried chicken. Mostly though, there’s just lots of white bread – packets and packets of half-eaten Kingsmill. I’m considering making a bread and butter pudding for the first time in my life but then I see the hummus stash pop up and my Olio journey begins.Inspired by my early score, I try to find some things to list myself, although our waste-not-want-not regime doesn’t leave much going spare. Eventually I find a packet of unwanted Weetabix, left behind by a previous flatmate. I put it on the site and await a response.One came within minutes – he said he could be over soon. The man who arrived told me that he had been using the app nearly everyday: he has a big family, none of whom are working much, and Olio can be a lifesaver. He says these days he doesn’t really leave the house unless it is to pick something up from Olio or go shopping. We talk about his struggles finding work, his depression, run-ins with the police and issues among his family. I realise it is probably the longest conversation I have had with a stranger from my area. After 80 minutes of chatting, he asked if I had any other food I could give him – I said I would have a look around and let him know. It’s an odd feeling: was I helping? Is it patronising? How could I ever let anyone else on the site pick something up from me now, when this man was in such need?Olio’s online spiel is similar to a lot of companies that believe technology can change the world. Its positioning feels aspirational, with neighbours working together.The initial trial for the app took place among 12 people in Crouch End the first item to be shared was half a bag of shallots. But what quickly becomes apparent is that many of the people on Olio are using it as an alternative or supplementary food bank.I put it to Cook that the app exists on two different levels: one for a well-meaning middle class, with food leftover from fashion shoots or Sunday dinner, and then people who are travelling a long way to pick up not very much food at all.“What has been quite shocking for us to discover on this journey, is how many hungry people there are in this country,” Cook says. “I’ll be very honest, I had no idea and I think many people have no idea. Since working on Olio, I have learnt that 8.4 million people are living in food insecurity. We have found that around a third of our regular requestors are living in poverty. What I’ve heard from a lot of those people is that what they love about the app is that there is no stigma when they collect food.”Isn’t there something a little uncomfortable, though, about those with too much giving their scraps to those with too little? “We don’t like to think of it as the haves giving to the have-nots. Actually this is just part of modern everyday communities, it’s absolute madness that people are throwing away perfectly delicious food on the one hand, while living nearby are people who would like that food or perhaps even need that food.”Over the next few weeks, I continue to use the app, mostly for non-food items. I give away a lampshade to one man called Ty and some toiletries to another called Ramneek – both twentysomething locals who say they have been on the app for a while, just doing their bit to reduce waste. I also pick up an old milk-bottle collector that I have repurposed into a shower caddy.But most of the time I look on Olio, the pickings are relatively slim. Desirable items go very quickly and most are far away. I also decide that it is not right to pick up ready-to-eat food such as sandwiches and pastries, which make up a lot of the listings, when there are people using the app in serious need.Olio claims to be the biggest food-sharing network in the world. More than 500,000 items have been shared in more than 40 countries. It is a pretty good start for an app that has only been going for a few years, but it feels like a drop in the ocean considering how much is wasted each day.It is a bold ambition and they are a long way off, especially considering that they are far from the only organisation aiming to tackle this problem. FareShare, Wrap, Freegle, Food Cycle and The Felix Project are just some of the groups trying to help ease the food waste problem. Still, Olio can provide food that some charities wouldn’t bother with – lots of listings on the site are for a couple of potatoes or half a sandwich.In recent weeks, plastics have been top of the agenda when it comes to new environmental policy, with the biggest food companies agreeing to end the use of non-recyclable packaging. This move should be taken as a sign of willingness to change – but food waste is arguably a more critical concern, because it is connected to so many modern afflictions: hunger, greenhouse gases, waste disposal and escalating food prices.And this is where there is an opportunity. It is not really the interface that matters: it can be a charity, an app or just a WhatsApp group between five people in a village, but if people are able to shake off the stigma about passing on the food they don’t want, they might help to fix a bunch of the world’s problems at the same time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9292906588b4c57703367793ead34ecf4c98b2fe/0_0_5150_3090/master/5150.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7b70377fd507d0b22d52d318e55b771c","title":"loyalty to navy shirts means monagamous relationshps","story":"Fidelity is not the only benefit of being with a man who is loyal to navy T-shirts. According to our fashion fixer, he can use the time saved to bring you tea in bedMy partner only wears navy T-shirts and jeans on weekdays. Is his fashion monogamy a good sign for us, or is he going to have a midlife crisis and buy a pair of cerise jorts? Helen, LondonI’ll be honest, Helen, I hadn’t previously considered the correlation between fashion and fidelity, but I do think you have a point here. After all, in my experience, contrary to all those women’s magazineDaily Mail headlines of the “What every woman should know to keep their man!!!” variety, most males are deeply monogamous in nature. Buckle up, everyone, while we enter the galaxy of … Sweeping Gender Generalisations!From my vantage point, at the coalface of gender observations, the majority of men, once they’re in a relationship for the long haul, just want to bed in. By which I mean they don’t want to have to make the kinds of efforts they once made when they were single. They get a bit fat, they go a bit bald, and that’s just fine with them because they’ve had enough of the hassle that they think goes into impressing prospective paramours. They’ve got their partner so can they just get some takeaway, watch Netflix and let their bellies flop over their jeans with secret elasticated waist, please? This explains why, over the age of 35, men tend to settle into a daily uniform, whether that’s a suit or (bad) jeans, (worse) khakis and neutral – meaning blue, white or tartan – shirts (men, for some reason, consider tartan to be a neutral on a button-down shirt, similar to the way women think of leopard print as a neutral when it’s on anything).This also explains why often the most untrustworthy men are the ones with the most inconsistent dress sense. I mean, look at Gavin Rossdale: one day a sexually ambiguous goth, the next a grunge rocker, the next a trendy Silverlake dad. Anyone could see which way this was going and, allegedly, it was going straight to shagging the nanny. Or Ben Affleck, who for years couldn’t figure out if he was a hunky leading man or an edgy indie director, and his oscillating clothing choices reflected that. He is now nicely settled into a T-shirt-wearing, fortysomething-dad groove but, alas, it allegedly took dating the nanny to find it. True, Donald Trump has been wearing suits since he was three years old and has probably grabbed the pussy of every pussy-possessing person who crossed his path. But then, there’s a consistency to that, as much as there is in his wardrobe.So what I’m saying, Helen, is I see nothing but promise in a partner who settles into a work uniform pretty much two minutes after getting married. He has found his thing and he’s sticking with it and I’m afraid that by “thing”, in this instance, I mean both the navy T-shirts and you. But, as we’ve already discussed, blue T-shirts are pretty much man’s greatest invention in many men’s eyes, so take it as a compliment.I think there are a lot of advantages to being with a man who wears the same thing every day, beyond the reassurance of fidelity. The primary one is with the time he saves in the morning by not having to decide what to wear, he can bring you tea in bed. But I would suggest he reassure his colleagues he’s not wearing the actual same clothes every day. Perhaps you could get some cards printed up for him to hand round the office.As for your fear of cerise jorts, I understand the concern, but I think it is misplaced. For a start, I strongly suspect a man who wears navy every day doesn’t even know what cerise is, let alone jorts, so this would be like worrying about him running off with Dua Lipa. He would need to Google just to get started here, so let’s not waste time worrying about the non-existent.At most, he might dally with what I call “man ‘fashion’”. These are fashion twists that conservative men allow themselves to indulge in because they think they are fun and they convince themselves they don’t threaten their masculinity. Absurd shoes are very much man fashion, as are watches, oddly patterned button-down shirts and waistcoats. Do not worry: this is just the sartorial equivalent of your partner getting a harmless little hobby, like fly fishing, or Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons. At heart, he’s still your navy T-shirted guy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0c12544f10fab15042d73d93b6677dfe7d0f5ba/0_9_4883_2929/master/4883.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=60733257cead646986f68965fef3e3df","title":"harvey weinstein netflix alexandra canoso marco polo","story":"Mogul denies claims of rape, assault and bullying detailed in lawsuit filed by Marco Polo producer Alexandra CanosaHarvey Weinstein sexually and physically assaulted a Netflix executive over a five-year period and threatened to ruin her career if she made his conduct public, according to a lawsuit.Alexandra Canosa, a producer on the series Marco Polo, which was executive produced by Weinstein, made the allegations in an amended complaint filed in New York supreme court on Monday. She also accuses the board of Weinstein Company of enabling the producer’s behaviour.The claims come as a private equity company was announced as the winning bidder for the Weinstein Company, which had been filed for bankruptcy following the allegations around Weinstein’s behaviour.In her complaint Canosa alleges that Weinstein sexually assaulted her between 2010 and 2014, and committed a further act of physical assault against her in 2015. She also claims that Weinstein verbally threatened her as recently as September 2017, less than a month before the New York Times and the New Yorker published multiple accusations of sexual assault and harassment against him. In total Canosa details 11 alleged incidents by the producer, including rape, physical assault and verbal bullying, at hotels in Los Angeles, New York, Budapest and Malaysia.The lawsuit alleges: “On many occasions, Harvey Weinstein insisted on meeting with plaintiff in isolated environments for business purposes, made sure that no other persons or bystanders were around when having business meetings with plaintiff, demanded sexual contact, and threatened plaintiff if she would not give him what he wanted, and forcing himself on plaintiff despite repeated requests to stop.”In a statement sent to Variety, Weinstein’s attorney, Phyllis Kupferstein, said the relationship between Canosa and Weinstein was consensual.“Ali Canosa was a friend who had worked for the Weinstein Company for 10 years, travelled the world for the company and held several influential roles overseeing many projects throughout the years,” she said. “From someone who has been thought of as a good friend, involved only in a consensual relationship, these claims are not only mystifying to Mr Weinstein, but deeply upsetting, and they are not supported by the facts.”Weinstein, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by more than 70 women, denies all allegations of non-consensual sex made against him. He is currently under investigation by police in London, New York and Los Angeles, and is the subject of multiple civil lawsuits, most recently one filed by the actor Ashley Judd, who claims that the producer damaged her career after she rejected his sexual advances.As well as Weinstein, Canosa’s lawsuit accuses the Weinstein Company of knowing about and failing to prevent Weinstein’s behaviour and using non-disclosure agreements to keep allegations against him out of the public eye. has contacted a representative of the Weinstein Company for comment on the lawsuit against them. It has previously denied liability for any wrongdoing on Weinstein’s part.On Tuesday the winning bidder for the Weinstein Company was announced as the Dallas-based firm Lantern Capital. Lantern are believed to have offered around $310m (£227m) for the distressed assets of the company, along with the assumption of liabilities totalling $115m.“Lantern’s bid clearly achieves the highest and best value for the estate and its creditors,” the Weinstein Company board member Ivona Smith said in a statement. “We look forward to working with Lantern to close the transaction and consummate the going concern sale.”A rival bid from the Broadway producer Howard Kagan was rejected by the Weinstein Company. Speaking to Variety, Kagan said that he had been shut out of the bidding process after the company “refused to engage” with him."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a2016f50bb8372d83d7d9d290042d8dd141a6852/0_340_5095_3056/master/5095.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f645c6b6e07b665ca02b0517fee84fb","title":"jurgen klopp liverpool roma champions league borussia dortmund","story":"Manager believes his Champions League achievements with Borussia Dortmund will make no difference to a group of players he feels are ready to do something specialJürgen Klopp turned to a higher power during a fraught finale to his previous appearance in a Champions League semi-final second leg. It was not Zeljko Buvac. “I thought if God wills it, we’ll go to the final if he doesn’t, we won’t,” said an emotionally drained Klopp following Borussia Dortmund’s 4-3 aggregate win over Real Madrid in 2013, when Sergio Ramos was a stoppage-time miss from sealing a three-goal comeback at the Bernabéu. The Liverpool manager would live the ordeal again at Stadio Olimpico for another shot at the final. Far better, however, to let Roma suffer once more.“Yes, I would take the result again if I wanted to have the same trip (to the final) but I don’t think anyone wants that,” said the Liverpool manager, whose Dortmund team took a 4-1 lead into the second leg against Real and whose current charges hold a 5-2 advantage over the Italians. “I would take that game again, we played a really good game, but we are not Borussia Dortmund, they are not Real Madrid, we are another team and it’s in another stadium. We are here to try and win, not to only lose 2-0.“In the first moments after the game at Anfield it was like Roma felt better than we did. That’s crazy. It was 5-2 but everyone was like: ‘Oh, now we have to work again’ but that was clear before. I’m still really happy with the result. I never thought we’d have to play one game at the highest level before we got to the Champions League final.”Klopp has refused to explain why Buvac, “the brain” of his managerial operation for 17 years, left his role as Liverpool assistant manager days before the club’s biggest Champions League date in a decade or confirm a reported approach from Arsenal. Similarly, he will not dwell on the past when preparing Liverpool for Wednesday’s examination in Rome. A campaign in which Liverpool have scored in every away game en route to the semi-finals offers enough encouragement.“I cannot tell the boys old fairytales about their manager who came through at Madrid,” said Klopp. “That doesn’t help. We have made our own experiences in the competition and the boys did brilliantly, especially away. Everybody talks about the Anfield nights: outstanding. But the away performances– Moscow, Hoffenheim – we have been spot on all of the time. We did it our way. We came here with really good, exciting football and I’m really happy about that. And now we want to continue that journey.“I don’t think people are that interested in semi-final losers, or final losers. I could write a book about that – we all know that. But the only way to win something is to go the whole way. Football is as in life if you are not ready to lose you cannot win.”Another gruelling episode was the first half of the quarter-final second leg at Manchester City, when Liverpool’s last three-goal lead in Europe came under serious threat. Wijnaldum, who excelled in place of Oxlade-Chamberlain against Roma, insists the Etihad Stadium experience could prove invaluable at Stadio Olimpico.The Liverpool midfielder said: “I think we were too impressed by the way City were playing and maybe a little bit scared. We knew it would be difficult but we were surprised by their unbelievable attacking speed. In that case you are lucky the game has two halves so we could recover and play a good second half. At half-time the manager showed us the chance that Ox had. He said we didn’t need to be scared, we just have to play our own game and if we played football we would create chances as there was so much space in behind because they were playing with five or six attackers. Every game is not the same but you always learn from games. We know what we can expect.”Given their first-leg lead, sheer dominance of Roma for the majority of the tie at Anfield, Mohamed Salah’s hold over his former club and the hosts’ duty to attack on Wednesday, it would take something extraordinary to deny Liverpool a trip to Kiev on 26 May. Whatever transpires in the Italian capital, Klopp is adamant this is just the start for Anfield’s latest generation of European specialists.Klopp explained: “If this team goes to the final it would be an outstanding, outstanding, achievement already. It is not the prize we want then because if you go to a final then of course you have to think a little bit bigger, but it would be something we could not have expected at the start of the season."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84957104c21c354799ad650ceb0469938cc2d009/0_192_2817_1691/master/2817.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1cb32f16b83075e06f3747680390b68f","title":"eleven sports la liga internet live footbal sky sports radrizzani","story":"•Live football could be aired exclusively over the internet•Sky Sports thought to be unwilling to continue paying £18mLive football matches could be shown exclusively over the internet in the UK for the first time after Sky lost the rights to broadcast Spain’s La Liga.Eleven Sports, founded by the Leeds United owner, Andrea Radrizzani, has acquired exclusive rights to the Spanish top flight for three years, starting from 2018-19.It brings an end to an association with Sky Sports that has lasted for more than two decades, although the broadcaster may yet be able to show games through a secondary agreement with the new rights holders.“We are proud to build on our existing relationship with La Liga, this time in the UK, one of the most passionate football countries in the world,” said Eleven Sports’ chief executive, Marc Watson, in a statement. “We will announce soon how we will introduce innovative ways for dedicated fans to watch and engage in the live action.

In the US, meanwhile, Eleven Sports leases content through broadcasters and telecoms companies. The company has not revealed which approach it will adopt in the UK.There had been speculation that the Premier League would strike a deal with an OTT broadcaster under its latest rights deal, but that has not yet come to pass.

Bayern Munich tried so hard to win it. That neither could achieve this apparently shared aim speaks in the first place to Real’s pure champion will and secondly to that nexus of game-management, calamitous Bayern defending and something close to a kind of white-shirted voodoo, the ability to win even while in the process of sputtering and panting like a stalled presidential motorcade.This was a fun, wild, oddly drunken game of football that ended 2-2 at the Bernabéu and 4-3 to Real on aggregate. At the end of which a couple of things seemed clear. Above all this was just a brilliant game. These late-stage encounters are supposed to unwind like a game of chess, a matter of grudging details. This was a more like a seasick game of quoits on the deck of a rum-sodden pirate ship, 95 minutes of half-chances, howlers and defending that seemed to have come undone at the seams like a soggy envelope.This leads on to point two, the ongoing, perhaps misguided conviction that somebody somewhere is finally going to connect in a decisive way with that elegantly presented champion’s glass jaw. Liverpool or Roma will travel to Kiev later this month with a chance to stop Real from making it three in a row. With this in mind Bayern might just have offered an anatomy of how to go about doing it, with a performance that will be picked apart and pored over with interest by either Jürgen Klopp or Eusebio Di Francesco over the next few weeks.For long periods in the second half Bayern were heroic. They thrashed Real 2-2, battered them to a score draw, steamrollered their own way right out of the competition. Albeit at times it was as though Real were actively trying to concede goals, with Thomas Müller left unmarked for pretty much the whole of the second half, constantly hollering for the ball in another traumatically wide open green space while Marcelo ambled back wearing a look of mild curiosity.With the final kick of the game, and with Bayern a kick from the final, Müller eventually got that cross from the left and launched himself, missing by a toenail. As the whistle blew there were spent, crumpled bodies across the turf. Bayern had 22 shots at goal to Real’s nine. They hogged the ball. They reduced Cristiano Ronaldo to 13 completed passes. But for a frankly bonkers error by Sven Ulreich, Jupp Heynckes would now be preparing for a swansong final.Instead Ulreich came up with something genuinely strange, seeming to stop and then simply lie down on the turf as the ball bobbled towards him, a man overcome with weariness, allowing Karim Benzema to score his second of the game.Whoever their opponents later this month Real’s weaknesses here seemed to tessellate intriguingly with the attacking strengths of both Liverpool and Roma. The most telling was the constant weakness Bayern found on the flanks. David Alaba’s willingness to attack the temporary right-back Lucas Vázquez had Real looking at times like a three-legged dog of a team, always listing to one side, exposing a lack of cover for the full-backs.The ball fell the wrong way three or four times. Alaba drove outside where Sadio Mané or Mo Salah can be expected to hare infield. And both Bayern goals came from surges out wide, the second after fine work from the excellent Niklas Süle and a cross that James Rodríguez put away before producing a laughably prim no-celebration-celebration right in front of the delirious away fans.Similarly Bayern only really struggled when they let their high press drop, when Real were able to build and maintain pressure, allowing that high-grade but far from youthful attack to find space. Real lack a little pace these days without Gareth Bale on the pitch. It is possible with a little luck to play a bold high line, to press with the throttle to the floor, as both Liverpool and Roma do at times.Real will be favourites whoever they face but there will still be hope in the familiar sense of brittleness on show here. Should they make it to Kiev Liverpool will surely look to play with a high-pressing sense of risk, to do as much as possible in their own full-throttle red zone against opponents who can look vulnerable and oddly invincible at the same time, and who were winners once again by some shakily enacted ine regal right."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2cb076c6393683deaedafefd0e7d3c10e6f3eb7/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eaded722e8c24ef569817590d4a9d641","title":"premier league outcasts europe depay traore aspas thauvin","story":"Mohamed Salah and Kevin De Bruyne needed two attempts in the Premier League. Perhaps these players will be the sameBy Martin Laurence for WhoScored, part of the Sport NetworkFootball clubs can be quick to write off foreign imports as flops if they do not settle into their new surroundings immediately. One only needs to look at the two standout candidates for the top inidual awards in England this season to recognise that players often deserve a second shot at success.Mohamed Salah and Kevin De Bruyne have shown that succeeding at a club often comes down to more than talent. Players can suffer from bad timing, working with managers who do not bring out the best in them or just arriving at a club too early in their development to make an immediate impact. Indeed, numerous players who have been cast aside by Premier League clubs are now flourishing following abroad.There were great expectations for Depay when he arrived at Old Trafford and inherited the famous No7 shirt in 2015 but he failed to deliver for a number of reasons. He wasn’t really given the regular playing time he needed to acclimatise to the pace of the English game under fellow Dutchman Louis van Gaal and the pressure ultimately proved too much.Out of the spotlight in France, Depay has been sensational of late, recently becoming one of only nine players in Europe’s big leagues to reach double figures for both goals and assists this season. He has scored 16 goals and provided 12 assists in Ligue 1 alone and, remarkably, has had a hand in 12 goals in his last six appearances. Depay, now 24, is losing the playboy image and is once again considered a great hope for the Netherlands as they try to recover their reputation. He has a point to prove and was impressive in his country’s 1-0 defeat to England earlier this year.Florian Thauvin, another player posting incredible numbers in Ligue 1 this season, may have played himself into the France squad for the World Cup, where he could even take the place of his Marseille team-mate Dimitri Payet. The idea that the one-time lesser-spotted Newcastle United winger might outshine one of the stars of Euro 2016 would have been laughable to most Premier League fans, but he has been Marseille’s star this season.The 25-year-old’s form in both Ligue 1 and Europe has ensured that Rudi García’s side still have two possible routes to next season’s Champions League. He scored the opener in the Europa League semi-final first leg against Salzburg last week and has been even better in the league. Thauvin, like Depay, is also one of that elite group of players to have hit double figures for goals and assists this season. His latest goal – Marseille’s winner against Troyes on Sunday – was his 20th in Ligue 1 this season. Neymar only has 19.Iago Aspas, the former Liverpool striker, has also just hit 20 league goals for the first time in his career. The 30-year-old has been in fantastic form for Celta Vigo for the past two seasons, so much so that he has a genuine chance of leading the line for Spain at the World Cup this summer.His tenacious approach from the front is valued highly by Spain manager Julen Lopetegui. Aspas helps his teams win the ball high up the pitch and overload their opponents in the final third – and he also boasts a decent goal return at international level. Not only is he the top scoring Spaniard in Europe’s big leagues over the last two seasons with 39 league goals, but he has also scored four goals for his country despite starting just one of eight appearances.Luis Alberto, who played with Aspas when they were both at Liverpool in the 2013-14 season, is showing he may just be the one who got away. He was just 21 when he arrived on Merseyside and he has blossomed a lot since the last of his nine appearances for the club. After a successful season on loan at Deportivo, Lazio signed the playmaker for just €4m in August 2016. He took a little time to settle in Rome but has been a revelation this season. Now 25, Alberto is excelling in support of lone striker Ciro Immobile, scoring 11 league goals and providing 13 assists – the most in Serie A – with another five assists in Lazio’s Europa League campaign. Alberto made his international debut last November and will also be hoping to make the Spain squad for the World Cup.Staying on the topic of players who may have been sold too early, Serge Gnabry has also played himself into international contention after leaving Arsenal two years ago. The 22-year-old impressed at Werder Bremen last season and earned himself a move to Bayern Munich, who sent him to Hoffenheim this season to continue his development. The loan deal has been a winner for all involved.Hoffenheim made that loan move permanent in the summer of 2016 and Kramaric has repaid the faith they showed in him, having a direct hand in 47 league goals having started 50 of his 71 league appearances. The 26-year-old will almost certainly be at the World Cup this summer he may even start for a very capable Croatia side.• Follow WhoScored on Twitter and Facebook• Follow Martin Laurence on Twitter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f42a799070d2a0b9ef018186d9eb74a5a9f3c3a/0_222_1875_1125/master/1875.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4a46c1a4cd0a1ae7749e05e6335eb7f8","title":"legal watchdog may investigate christian group over alfie evans case","story":"Solicitors Regulation Authority reviewing role of Christian Legal Centre in life-support disputeThe Christian campaign group that acted for the family of Alfie Evans could face an investigation by the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA), the  has learned.The legal watchdog confirmed it was reviewing the Christian Legal Centre’s role in the high-profile life-support battle that ended with the death of the 23-month-old boy on Saturday, five days after he was removed from a ventilator.Three court of appeal judges criticised the role of supporters who may have “infiltrated or compromised” the legal representation of Alfie’s parents, Tom Evans and Kate James.The high court judge Mr Justice Hayden was particularly critical of the role of Pavel Stroilov, a Russian-born law student who appeared to have taken the lead in representing Alfie’s parents for the Christian Legal Centre (CLC).The judge described Stroilov, who formerly worked for the Ukip leader, Gerard Batten, as a “fanatical and deluded young man” whose legal advice was “inconsistent with the real interests of the parents’ case”.The SRA has not yet decided whether to launch a formal investigation but is assessing concerns surrounding the CLC’s involvement. An SRA spokesman said: “We can confirm we will review the information provided and consider if any next steps are appropriate.“Only those authorised by a legal services regulatory such as the SRA are allowed to carry out reserved legal activities, as defined within section 12 of the Legal Services Act 2007, within the English and Welsh legal system.”Tom Evans was presented with an award at Everton football club’s annual end-of-season ceremony, the Dixies, on Tuesday night in his first public appearance since Alfie’s death at 2.30am on Saturday.Receiving the Blueblood award, given to those who “embody the Evertonian spirit”, Evans said he had dreamed his son would follow in Wayne Rooney’s footsteps by playing for the club. “Alfie will always be a part of Everton,” he said.CLC has not yet responded to the SRA’s review of its role but said in a statement on Friday that it rejected the “unfair and detrimental” criticism by judges and commentators. It said that in the three weeks of its involvement, its barrister Paul Diamond “took the case from the high court to the court of appeal to the supreme court and to the European court – and then back again to the high court and to the court of appeal. We can think of no other organisation that would have achieved this in such a short period.”Stroilov was described in court as the legal adviser who had encouraged Alfie’s father to pursue a private prosecution for murder against doctors at Alder Hey children’s hospital, where Alfie was treated for a degenerative neurological condition for 16 months.Hayden also criticised Stroilov after the student gave Evans a letter purporting to be legal advice stating that it would be lawful for him to remove Alfie from Alder Hey – a letter that the hospital’s legal team blamed for causing a highly-charged standoff between Evans, the police and doctors and ignited protests outside. Three court of appeal judges said Stroilov’s letter was “misleading to the extent of giving the father false advice”. has since learned that Alder Hey’s legal team is considering bringing contempt of court proceedings against Stroilov after apparently being met with silence when asked for his legal qualifications.CLC said on Friday: “We reject the prejudicial and inflammatory comments made by Mr Justice Hayden. We also reject the portrayal by the court of appeal of our role in this case and the assistance that we have offered to Mr Evans.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df3a50aab263b97737cd6fd19da02bb604bba927/0_100_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d200901a57ffbcf98a9db443e4a441a0","title":"nominative determinism who has the best name in running","story":"What’s in a name? A runner by any other name might run as fast. Unless, of course, you are Bolt. Here are some of the best examples of aptly-named athletesYes, you may have seen this guy mentioned once or twice before: recently retired multiple world record holder, possessor of more gold than the national bank of a middling nation, and generally reckoned to be pretty speedy on his feet. But would he have achieved all this if he’d been called Usain Jones? A paper published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology in 2002, snappily titled ‘Why Susie Sells Seashells by the Seashore: Implicit Egotism and Major Life Decisions’ concluded that people were in fact disproportionately likely to ‘choose careers whose labels resemble their names’. So athletics gain was meteorology’s loss. Fell, trail and mountain runner, Lightfoot has lightfooted his way to victory in many big races, including the Three Peaks and the trail running World Championships. No one who has had Lightfoot fly past them on a hill would dispute that his name is extremely apt. Oh, and he’s also a full time firefighter at Workington Fire Station in Cumbria. Stepanova was – naturally – a hurdler. She held the 400m world record holder and won the 1986 European Championship gold in the event. It’s likely she would have done the same at the 80 and 84 Olympic games, but the 400m hurdles was not an event for women in the former, and in the latter the Soviet boycott scuppered her changes.However, in news that will in no way surprise followers of athletics, it turns out that it wasn’t even her own name. Admittedly taking your husband’s name upon marriage is probably not the worst form of enhancement that Russian athletes of the 80s have been accused of, but still ... would Marina Makeyeva have stepped over those hurdles as nimbly?US steeplechaser and proud holder of Running World’s coveted “best name in running” title, in which he just pipped Gretchen Speed to the post, Hurt participates in an event that involves jumping multiple times over barriers and water jumps. Perhaps, therefore, this is not so much nominative determinism as a constant reminder to keep his feet up. She ran in the Commonwealth games marathon for England in 2010, won the Edinburgh and Pisa marathons in 2014, and these days is as likely to be found running (and winning) ultras and trail races as road ones. Perhaps the ultras are an attempt to be in less of a rush, or perhaps they are just an attempt to eat more pork pies. Either way, Rush by name, Rush by nature.

That sounds like a choice. You was there for 400 years and it’s all of y’all. It’s like we’re mentally in prison. I like the word prison because slavery goes too direct to the idea of blacks. Slavery is to blacks as the Holocaust is to Jews. Prison is something that unites as one race, blacks and whites, that we’re the human race.”He then proceeded to talk directly to the entire office before TMZ reporter Van Lathan shot back at him for his comments. “I actually don’t think you’re thinking anything,” he said.He continued: “While you are making music and being an artist and living the life that you’ve earned by being a genius, the rest of us in society have to deal with these threats to our lives.” Lathan said he was “unbelievably hurt” about Kanye morphing into something that’s “not real”.West’s comments were met by anger and incredulity. Fellow rapper Will.i.am told Good Morning Britain that West’s comments were “ignorant” and “broke my heart ... when you’re a slaved, you’re owned... that’s not choice, that’s by force.” Prominent civil rights activist Deray McKesson said West “continues to fuel the racist right-wing folks who believe that black people are responsible for their oppression,” while fellow activist and TV host Marc Lamont Hill wrote: “There has never been a moment in history when Black people didn’t resist slavery... Our resistance led to our freedom.”Earlier in the conversation, West reaffirmed his support for Trump calling him his “boy” and explaining why he tweeted a picture wearing a Make America Great Again cap. “I felt a freedom in doing something that everybody tells you not to do,” he said.West’s return to the spotlight has preceded the release of two new albums out in June. The rapper dropped two new tracks last weekend, including Ye Vs the People, where he elaborated on his support for Trump with another nod to slavery: “See that’s the problem with this damn nation  All blacks gotta be Democrats, man, we ain’t made it off the plantation”. Referring to the Make America Great Again cap also worn by Trump, he rapped: “Make America Great Again had a negative perception  I took it, wore it, rocked it, gave it a new direction  Added empathy, care and love and affection.”Today also saw the release of an hour-long interview with radio host Charlamagne tha God which saw West say he’s in “a stronger place” than he’s ever been, and that he was taking an unspecified medication – “an imperfect solution, it helps calm me down” – in the wake of a two-week spell in hospital in 2016 following a mental breakdown he now characterises as a “breakthrough”. He also expressed hurt over Barack Obama calling him a “jackass” in 2009. “Don’t tell the world I’m a jackass,” he said. “I’m fighting hard enough. Something about me going on stage was similar to what you was doing. ’Cause I’m fighting to break the simulation, break the setup. That didn’t make no sense.”In the same interview, West also briefly touched upon slavery and Tubman. “When I saw Harriet Tubman on the $20 bill, that’s when I wanted to use bitcoin,” he said. “It’s like all the slave movies. Why you gotta keep reminding us about slavery? Why don’t you put Michael Jordan on the $20 bill?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02b0c3872a0b379a294472979334ecd10afaa071/0_96_4500_2699/master/4500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6a21002c052a6df858ddebc31143b5a6","title":"george michael fans asked to take down tributes by family","story":"Impromptu memorials have become international tourist attraction, iding local opinionThe family of George Michael have asked fans to take down tributes left outside the singer’s homes in London and Oxfordshire, after the growing popularity of impromptu memorials that have turned into international tourist attractions began to ide local residents and conservationists.Fans of Michael, who was found dead at his riverside house in Goring on Christmas Day 2016, flocked to his two homes to create memorial gardens filled with flowers, poems, cards, framed pictures and candles. In Highgate village, north London, a prosperous area that counts A-list celebrities as residents, a triangle of land opposite Michael’s Grade II-listed house has been festooned with a growing number of offerings.In a statement on his official website, members of Michael’s family, including his sisters, Mel and Yioda, father Jack and friend David Austin, said they had been touched by the tributes celebrating and remembering Yog – their nickname for Michael. “However, we feel we cannot expect our Highgate and Goring neighbours to continue to accept as normality, the memorials so personal to you all, to remain as and where they are any longer,” they said.The statement asked Michael fans, who call themselves “Lovelies”, to pick up their tributes by 27 May and make a donation to charity instead, “so we can return both Mill Cottage and The Grove to their former simple state”. “This will take time to do properly, so we ask for your patience while trying to improve the grass and railings at The Grove,” it said.The family added that Michael liked his privacy and “would not want to disturb or change the quiet neighbourhoods he so loved, for the people in the local area who, honestly, despite reports otherwise have been gracious and very understanding”.The houses on Michael’s road in Highgate face the famous Flask pub and are one of the area’s biggest attractions. Former residents include the 19th-century poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Sting, Annie Lennox, Kate Moss and the late Victoria Wood. At the end of last year, Susan Rose, the chair of the Highgate Conservation Area advisory committee, wondered what Michael “would think of it all outside the beautiful home that he looked after so well, and right where he erected a wonderful Christmas tree every year”.No permanent memorial to Michael exists. Fans have campaigned for a lifesize bronze statue of the singer on the land outside his Highgate property. But though the campaign was backed by Michael’s record label, Sony, and local councillors, his family decided against the statue, saying he was a private person and would consider such a gesture “embarrassing”. The Highgate Society planning committee has also said proposals for a statue were “problematic”. “We are hoping, into the future, to get back to you with some more thoughts on ways and ideas to remember Yog that we hope you’ll like, and be a part of,” Michael’s family said in their statement. Annette McHail, who lays flowers near Michael’s Mill Cottage home in Goring every week, told the BBC the decision would “put the house back to how George would like it”. “He was a private person and I can appreciate what the family are saying. It needs to go back to normal now,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6c7ea2ae53e5080f043040bbe52bcc86d517c62/0_0_5472_3648/master/5472.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=83403bd557d143d26829653b4ca0e3ea 1400w","title":"customs squabble brexit have cake and eat it fantasy","story":"Focus on customs has cast doubt on Theresa May’s compromise approach to EU exitAmid fierce cabinet squabbling over the minutiae of customs policy, it is easy to lose sight of the big picture: a battle to decide what kind of country the UK will be after Brexit.On the face of it, Wednesday’s Brexit sub-committee meeting promises little in the way of enlightenment. Downing Street sources have been playing down the prospect of any decision over which of two customs proposals the UK will take into the next phase of negotiations with the EU. Even if the cabinet does decide between the hi-tech “maximum facilitation” model or the highly integrated new customs partnership (NCP) approach, the EU remains deeply sceptical that either will prove satisfactory.But postponing another painful showdown may no longer be enough for Theresa May. One lasting legacy of this week’s focus on customs has been to cast doubt on her government’s overall compromise approach to Brexit. What the Europeans have dismissed as the UK’s “have-cake-and-eat-it” fantasy is now under withering attack by Tory Eurosceptics too.The target of their attack is the NCP approach favoured by May and the Treasury. The idea of this plan, first outlined in August, is that post-Brexit Britain can avoid introducing friction at the EU border while at the same time creating enough flexibility to strike new trade deals with other countries.It would do this by acting as if Britain were still in the existing customs union, but crucially allowing imports bound purely for UK customers to qualify for a rebate if there was a gap between the EU tariff rate and any reduction agreed under new trade deals. More importantly, British car exports sent to Europe via Dover would not be held up by having to prove where their component parts came from – the so-called rules of origin test – because everything from outside Europe would have passed through the same common external tariff regime.The problem is that delays at customs are not just caused by tariffs and rules of origin tests. A big factor in smoothing trade flows is standardising product safety standards and other regulations too. To maintain truly frictionless trade with Europe the UK would also need to abide by the rules of the single market.Where the critics agree is that this would be impossible to do without effectively being a member of the single market and the customs union. Jacob Rees-Mogg’s European Research Group (ERG) regards this as a sellout and a betrayal of the referendum result. The EU views anything less than explicit membership as an attempt at cherry picking and would force the UK to submit to the supervision of its courts and regulators too.In fact, the more scrutiny it comes under, the closer the NCP looks to the partial customs union approach now favoured by Labour and a number of backbench Tory rebels. Instead of providing a halfway house a customs partnership could quickly prove to be the very softest of Brexits.The only alternative would be the “highly streamlined” technological approach designed to provide “maximum facilitation” of trade, but not promising to avoid controls entirely. The ERG says this is a price worth paying to maintain freedom from EU rules and a more unfettered ability to strike independent trade deals.The cabinet hardliners argue that if this proves unsatisfactory to the Irish government and collapses the talks, so be it – it would be the EU choosing to erect border controls, not the UK. “No deal is better than a bad deal,” as the prime minister used to say.They say the real choice is between a lightly regulated open economy trading largely outside Europe, and maintaining a highly integrated European-style social market that has to keep collaborating with Brussels. Pretending Britain can have both is an option May no longer enjoys."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abd8a8bdb4a4e9f16b3d20718c4cc542ae923e83/0_280_4200_2520/master/4200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c3fd2ad47eed5bd1f1ebae54d860d10c","title":"secrets of resilience womans extraordinary trauma survival carmen tarleton","story":"Carmen Tarleton was so badly beaten and burned by her ex-husband that she needed 38 operations and a face transplant.

This prevents the brain from damaging itself further by trying to keep going without an adequate blood supply.“Even when I first woke up from the coma I just knew it was such a big event, and it was so strange, that it had other meanings for me,” she says. “I could help a lot of people.”Carmen started doing inspirational speaking. “I looked terrible and people felt so sorry for me, but I wanted to show people it didn’t matter what I looked like,” she says. Photos of Carmen from that time are shocking with all the grafts, she didn’t have proper eyelids, and her eyeballs looked out through small circular holes cut into the skin. She had synthetic corneas and couldn’t blink, and the edges of the skin were red raw.“It forced me to look at the big picture of what life is really about,” she says. “And that’s where I’ve had to go, because this horrific event occurred and I found a way through it. And not because I’m different or special, but because that’s what was meant to be: to show people you can be involved in these incredible events and you can forgive, totally, and move on.”She says she has forgiven her now-ex husband for what he did. (In return for pleading guilty to maiming, he accepted a sentence of 30 to 70 years in prison. He died in prison in December 2017.) “I was never religious,” she says. “I took responsibility for my life. I was not responsible for what happened, for what he chose to do, but I certainly was responsible from that day forward.”Even after leaving hospital, Carmen was still in a lot of pain. The injuries to her skin and the multiple grafts caused tightness when they healed, and this led to all sorts of secondary problems with the mobility of her neck and spine. Still she kept going.Then, on Valentine’s Day 2013, Carmen’s life changed again. She became only the seventh American to undergo a complete face transplant. The operation was performed by Pomohač.Pomohač says that for a long time he didn’t think of Carmen as a candidate for face transplant, because she was so immunologically challenged. All those grafts and transfusions had primed her body to attack almost any donated tissue. But there were several pressing reasons why she needed a new face. The pain and the narcotics, yes, but as well as that, the opening on to her eyeball was getting bigger, and this was threatening the integrity of the synthetic cornea. Then there was the drooling, and the problems with speaking and eating.It’s possible there is a psychological force that carries people through … Sometimes people can surprise you with their resilienceThe operation was a technical success, but then there was the immune system to deal with. Carmen’s body mounted a massive rejection of the face and, for a period of four weeks after the operation, she was pumped up on numerous immunosuppressants. By then there was only one more drug left to use. A full dose would help suppress the rejection, but would also completely wipe out her immune system, to such an extent that any trivial infection would kill her. In the end, with Carmen’s consent, they gave her a little of that final drug it was enough to tame her immune system. She got better. Carmen says she felt she had made a choice to live.“It’s possible there is a psychological force that carries people through, but my official answer has to be that the statistics were still a little bit in our favour,” says Pomohač. “Sometimes people can surprise you with their resilience.”Carmen suffered physical injuries that could easily have killed her. That she survived is remarkable in itself, but what seems even more incredible is how she has not just survived mentally, but developed into someone else – someone who, by her own account, is better.Before, she was a registered nurse and was raising children, and, until her incident, she had not thought about the big questions of life: “I wasn’t going to sit around and complain and cry.” Carmen now says she wouldn’t go back and change what happened: she has grown too much. It is a pattern seen in others who have suffered an incredible trauma, and found a way through it.How do they do it? For physical trauma, it is not so mysterious that some people survive. As Pomohač says, statistically, some people will just make it through. When they do, we are so surprised that we fixate on it, and may even call it miraculous. We remember these people, the extraordinary survivors such as Gabrielle Giffords, and we don’t just shrug and say, “Well, it’s not impossible to survive even being shot in the head.” Statistics aside, medical care is good and the body is capable of amazing repair – perhaps better than we might give it credit for.But it is the mental resilience that is sometimes more impressive. Carmen tells me that we get too caught up in negativity. You’ve got to take control, and make your own choices. “I don’t live like the typical person on the inside at all,” she says. “I have different beliefs that help me go when I’m going.”Some people can ride out trauma and even prosper, when others suffer lingering physiological stress and fear – the hallmarks of post-traumatic stress disorder. Psychiatrist David Wolfe is head of outpatient services at the evocatively named Building of Transformative Medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. The funny thing, he tells me, is that the people who suffer trauma but actually come out better aren’t the people who are studied. If someone is coping well, they are sent home. Psychiatrists see the people who struggle. But perhaps, he says, people don’t suffer as much as we think.“Psychiatry has been as guilty of this as anyone. You assume that, if something bad happens to someone, they’re going to have some mental problem. It happens when we see patients in hospital with very serious diseases. We think: ‘They must be depressed – wouldn’t you be?’ But, actually, they’re not.”That is not to say, of course, that people don’t suffer and don’t need treatment. According to the United States National Center for PTSD, seven or eight out of every 100 people will experience PTSD at some point in their lives. What Wolfe is saying is that it is wrong to assume a traumatic event will be the same for everyone. More often than not it’s more impressive how well people cope with trauma, which makes sense from an evolutionary point of view: it is advantageous to have hidden powers of resilience. “The ability to power through adverse conditions should be there in our DNA,” Wolfe says. “It’s more of a puzzle why, from an evolutionary standpoint, we have problems with that sometimes.”No one does things like this alone, without the friends and family who rally round. Your social network is key to how you deal with trauma. “People who respond well tend to have positive relationships in their life and that translates into positive relationships with their treatment teams,” says Wolfe.One of Carmen’s sisters moved to Boston so she could see her every day while she recovered, even before she came out of the coma. When Carmen left hospital, years before the face transplant, she went to her family. She saw a therapist for a while after she was attacked, but she says her experience was so far off the chart that nobody knew what to say to her. “I cried at my sister’s and my mother’s and bitched a little, and after a year and a half I thought, that’s not going to help me.”I needed to find a way through this … My biggest motivation was that I wanted to be a role model to my daughtersOptimism, not surprisingly, is one of the character traits shared by people who respond well to trauma. “The opposite is hopelessness, which is a feature of depression,” says Wolfe. “Engagement, taking it on, taking on responsibility, and being active in the process – these things go a long way.”When you ask people what keeps them going, Wolfe says, the number one answer is family and kids. People who are resilient look to the future. Carmen had a clear goal: “I needed to find a way through this, because I wasn’t going to go anywhere. I was raising children, there were things I wanted to do. My biggest motivation was that I wanted to be a role model to my daughters.”What about the genetics of resilience? Even when we find genes related to disease, it rarely works on the basis that “you have the gene, you’ll get the disease”. Sure, there are instances, such as familial Alzheimer’s or cystic fibrosis, where this is almost always the case, but most diseases, and almost all traits, are far more complex, and are influenced by many genes. Resilience is one such complex trait.The capacity to be super-resilient may be there even in normal people, but we need guidance and support to find it, maybe from psychotherapy, maybe from friends. We need help to be optimistic, encouragement to take control, and empowerment to be responsible. We need a certain amount of self-love. A touch of narcissism is good. We need to stand up for ourselves so we are not mistreated at work or in relationships, we need to be assertive without devaluing others and have a self-image that is positive without being conceited. This mixture of personality traits will drive you forward. And, if you do not have them naturally, some of them can be constructed.Extracted from Superhuman: Life at the Extremes of Mental and Physical Ability by Rowan Hooper, published by Little, Brown on 3 May, price £14.99 (rrp).

He never showed any sign of wanting to quit.”“It was never said between us that this would be the last paper. I personally felt this might be the conclusion of our journey, but I never told him.”Modern physics has more than one theory of how the universe came to be, but one of the most popular ideas is that the big bang was followed by repeated bursts of ‘cosmic inflation’ which created an endless number of ‘pocket universes’ that are now scattered throughout space.“The usual theory of eternal inflation predicts that globally our universe is like an infinite fractal, with a mosaic of different pocket universes separated by an inflating ocean,” Hawking said last autumn.But in the latest work, Hawking and Hertog challenge that view. Instead of space being filled with pocket universes where radically different laws of physics apply, these alternate universes may not actually vary that much from one another.While the consequences of the proposal may not be obvious, the theory may provide some comfort to physicists who wonder how, given all the hostile variations thought possible, we find ourselves in a universe well-suited to life. “In the old theory there were all sorts of universes: some were empty, others were full of matter, some expanded too fast, others were too short-lived. There was huge variation,” said Hertog. “The mystery was why do we live in this special universe where everything is nicely balanced in order for complexity and life to emerge?”“This paper takes one step towards explaining that mysterious fine tuning,” Hertog added. “It reduces the multiverse down to a more manageable set of universes which all look alike. Stephen would say that, theoretically, it’s almost like the universe had to be like this. It gives us hope that we can arrive at a fully predictive framework of cosmology.”The new theory takes work that Hawking and the US physicist James Hartle published in the 1980s and updates it with the more powerful, modern mathematical techniques used in string theory. In string theory, reality is described through the interactions of one-dimensional objects known as cosmic strings.“Stephen himself said that this work was the area he was most proud of,” said Malcolm Perry, a colleague of Hawking’s at Cambridge University. The new paper will not be the last to bear Hawking’s name, however. With Andrew Strominger at Harvard, Perry has written at least two papers with Hawking on black holes which are still being readied for publication. Hawking, who rose to fame on the back of his bestselling book, A Brief History of Time, died on 14 March, aged 76, at his home in Cambridge. His ashes will be interred at Westminster Abbey near the grave of Sir Isaac Newton during a thanksgiving service later this year.Hertog believes that his work with Hawking is one small step towards a theory of our cosmic origins that physicists could ultimately test. If the universe has evolved as the theory predicts, he says, it may have left a telltale signature on gravitational waves, or the so-called cosmic microwave background, the radiation that was released at the birth of the universe. “There may be clues in those signals as to whether or not we are on the right tracks,” he said.”I’m reasonably hopeful that both further observations and further work on the theory will eventually enable us to test our models of the big bang,” Hertog added. “We are not doing this for Platonic pleasure. Though it is fun.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e817fe46d2d4602936f63c1bd1e396fa96ace6bb/0_300_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c33794b88cf5d0bb1b7f04351f065abe","title":"the universe is an egg and the moon isnt real notes from a flat earth conference","story":"Michael Marshall attended the UK’s annual gathering of people who share the unshakeable belief that the Earth is flatThere was the three-hour presentation which contended that the universe is a giant egg. There was the Manchester musician who posited that the Earth is the shape of a diamond. And another who believes that the moon is a projection. Welcome to the Flat Earth UK Convention, a raucous departure from scientific norms where people are free to believe literally anything. That unshakeable belief is one of the few points of total agreement for the 200-strong audience at this week’s gathering. There is less consensus, however, on what form the Earth actually takes: some believe it to be a disc with the Arctic circle in the middle some believe that circle is under a dome, above which there may or may not be an expanse of water others believe the Earth is just one in a series of ponds in a vast expanse of ice and other still believe the Earth exists beneath four cosmic rings within a giant egg-shaped universe. Most do not believe in space none believe mankind has ever travelled there. One speaker, Manchester-based musician Darren Nesbitt, dismisses the circular model of the Earth entirely, correctly critiquing that the Sun would have to travel faster in the South to make it around the outer-edge of the circle, which does not match our observations. “You can’t just trust YouTube”, he implores the audience during his talk, “you have to be your own authority”. The Earth, according to Nesbitt, is more likely a diamond shape, with East-West travel facilitated by 4D space-time warps along the edges, allowing for a “Pac-Man” version of reality – where a traveller might sail off one side of the screen, and appear at the other side. That diamond is propped up on seven circular pillars, “because God likes the number seven”. This version, he explains, fits the evidence better, and is supported by the Bible, in the book of Job. Several speakers throughout the weekend take time to highlight that evolution is a myth, accompanied by occasional heckles of “monkey men!” from audience members.To their credit, there are members of the Flat Earth community who are determined to disprove the globe model through scientific experiments: some use high-powered lasers over bodies of water to try to attempt to observe any curvature, others creating complex 3D models to explain the movements of the Sun and stars. Although the ideas have persisted for generations, the modern Flat Earth phenomena is surprisingly recent. When I first encountered the community in 2013, Flat Earth arguments played out on a fringe messageboard, with some dispute over whether proponents actually believed in the theories they espoused or whether they simply enjoyed the intellectual pursuit of arguing an untenable position. However, if there were disbelievers among the 200 attendees at the conference, they were exceptionally convincing there seems little doubt over the sincerity of modern Flat Earth proponents. Almost all of the speakers came to the Flat Earth within the last five years: Nesbitt “came out” as a Flat Earther in 2015 Gary John found the movement in August 2015 Martin Liedtke in 2015. Almost all – speakers and attendees alike – credit their conversion to the Flat Earth to YouTube, watching videos like those produced by American Flat Earth star Mark Sargent.Fame in the Flat Earth world is not without its pitfalls, however, as Sargent’s standing in the UK movement demonstrates. Sargent was booked to speak at the conference, before he gave interviews to the BBC and Good Morning Britain, in which he espoused his belief that the Earth exists under a dome, like a snowglobe. These interviews reflected badly on the community, Gary explained to me during lunch, so he contacted Sargent to air his concerns over the interviews, and how they were perceived by members of the Flat Earth community. In response, Sargent publicly and acrimoniously withdrew from the conference.Sargent’s influence perseveres, however: one attendee during lunch showed me his favourite proof of the Flat Earth – a video showing a side-view from a plane-tracking software, created by Mark Sargent. “It shows the height of the planes as they fly”, he told me, excitedly. “If the Earth was round, we’d see their heights all change as they fly over the curve!”“Isn’t it measuring altitude?” I asked, “So that’s the elevation above the ground. If the ground curved, and the plane’s path naturally curved with it, it would stay the same distance from the ground – which is exactly what we see in that video, don’t we?”He paused for a moment. “That’s interesting”, he said, “I’ll have to think about that”. Dave Marsh, an NHS manager from Derbyshire who came to Flat Earth belief in November 2016, tracked the movement of the moon across the night sky, in order to compare his observations to the “official” records and see if the movement of the moon matched that of the ‘Globalist’ model. The results of his backyard experiment differed from data he found online, leading him to conclude that “the moon is a projection, put there for a reason, which we could study for a thousand more years and never understand”. A more cautious experimenter might look to the accuracy of their equipment before drawing so radical a conclusion, but it’s hard not to admire his commitment. Other speakers focus not on experimentation, but on observation and “common sense”. Dave Murphy, something of a celebrity in the Flat Earth movement after appearing on Macedonian TV in 2016, dedicated his talk to “debunking the debunkers” – bombastically dismissing arguments from Globalist physicists like Neil Degrasse Tyson. It was hard not to be charmed by Dave’s confidence and charisma as he took us through some of his refutations of the criticisms levelled at his theories, even if his understanding of distance, scale, and the movement of bodies in a closed system left a lot to be desired. Interestingly, when it came to debunking some of the theories put forward by Flat Earth proponents – including the “transparent moon” theory and the false notion that photographs can show clouds passing behind the Sun – Dave’s delivery shifted completely. Gone was his confident swagger as he poked holes in theories the audience might hold dear. Flat Earth belief may be a broad church, but they are not above turning on their own. The reluctance to submit their own theories to the level of scrutiny comes as little surprise, though it remains no less disappointing to witness. While the conference did include a debate with first-year astrophysicists from UCL and Cardiff University (who spoke with calmness and good-natured warmth in the face of exceptional pressure), self-examination was in short supply. In fact, one of the most telling moments of the weekend came in Darren Nesbitt’s talk, after he dismissed the disk Earth as being “counter-intelligence” set out to throw people off the scent, and before he explained that the Earth is a diamond, resting on seven circular pillars, operating in a 4D Pac-Man version of reality. Nesbitt shared what he called the “Flat Earth Addiction” test – seven questions Flat Earth proponents should ask themselves, including “Have people said that you are pushy or obsessive about Flat Earth?”, “Have you thought that if only everyone knew about Flat Earth the world would be a different place?”, and “Have you noticed that you spend less and less time with your family and friends and more and more time talking to Flat Earthers?”.  Looking around the room, I could see knowing nods, as people recognised themselves in each question. The questions, Nesbitt explained, were taken from a checklist used to determine whether someone is in a cult. The implication seemed lost on the audience.

It is, though, hoped the inaugural race would take place in October 2019.F1’s managing director commercial operations Sean Bratches is confident Miami would prove “the perfect destination”.“Earlier today the City of Miami Commission took an important step by adding an item to their upcoming agenda, that if approved, will make way to bring Formula 1 to downtown Miami next season,” Bratches said in a statement released on formula1.“We appreciate the community’s interest in hosting a Formula 1 race and look forward to working with local officials and stakeholders to bring this vision to life.“With over half a billion fans worldwide, Formula 1 is the greatest racing spectacle on the planet, and Miami’s status as one of the world’s most iconic and glamorous cities, combined with its robust tourism infrastructure, makes Miami the perfect destination for Formula 1 and its fans.”Miami Dolphins owner Stephen Ross, the US entrepreneur and supporter of the proposed race, feels hosting such an iconic event would only have a positive impact on South Florida.Ross said: “Miami is a first-class global city and Formula 1 is a first-class global brand.“In cooperation with the City of Miami and Miami-Dade County, I am confident we can deliver yet another global event that will be a destination for people from around the world and drive economic value to South Florida.“From football and soccer to tennis and motorsports, Miami deserves only the best in music, food, art, fashion and sports and entertainment, and that is exactly what we plan on delivering with a Formula 1 race.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2755f37e4eff9f3a556d8f0f19f07154cc3bc530/0_31_1157_694/master/1157.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=81a880d4a6a596cc08195bc1cd40d28c","title":"anuvab pal interview the empire soho theatre india identity british raj","story":"With his persona of a Raj-revering Indian, Anuvab Pal dons a Beefeater jacket and judge’s wig to trace colonial legacy in the standup show The EmpireReckoning with colonialism is on the minds of third-generation diaspora kids. Projects such as the Crimes of Britain website are monitoring Britain’s imperial legacy for today’s youth and interrogating Britain’s claim to greatness. Now, the Indian standup Anuvab Pal anatomises the same subject matter in his touring comedy show, The Empire, which he performs at Soho theatre in London this week.A Bengali native, Pal offers an Indian perspective on the armies who turned up uninvited on India’s shores. But he also uses his routines to inform audiences of a subset of Indians who yearn for the return of the Raj.“A certain sort of middleman got very rich both in Britain and India by exploiting poor Indian people, who have pretty much always been exploited,” he tells me over the phone. “And it wasn’t just the British doing horrible things directly – it was through a class they created.” And what does this class look like? Pal’s interpretation dons a Beefeater jacket and judge’s wig, and adopts the personality of an Indian suffering from such a fervent colonial hangover that Ukip’s nationalism seems tame. This is a character who has no desire to be Indian. He sports jodhpurs, refers to his friends as “old chap” with the staccato slur of a bygone radio announcer, takes his wife ballroom dancing and attends Gymkhana and croquet clubs.Pal’s absurd onstage persona navigates India’s recent colonial history, taking us on a journey from the Mughals to the Portuguese and finally the British. In a convivial manner he explains India’s battle to define its identity after being subjected to outside interference, juxtaposing its history with the rightwing nationalism of the country’s current prime minister, Narendra Modi.“The Modi narrative is essentially: ‘We started a long time ago, and the Mughals were invaders, and the British were invaders, and everything before that, we were who we were,’ whatever that means,” Pal explains. “In new India, no one’s really interested in going back and looking at our history. Shah Jahan built an entire city. They just ignore the amount that the Mughals did for religious tolerance, culture and architecture.”Modi’s nationalistic narrative labels the Mughals as colonisers and delegitimises everything they brought with them. Such a stance has been used to perpetrate Islamophobia. Pal hopes to point out the hypocrisy in dismissing the significance of invasions. “Which country would not like to be told that invaders were horrible? With that same logic you can say: ‘Oh, Taj Mahal, terrible, just a rubbish monument built by invaders. Biryani, nonsense, rubbish food.’ You could keep going back in history and say anything.”Pal is by no means endorsing colonialism. “It’s true that the British were invaders, but I just thought there has got to be more nuance, there’s got to be more deception on both sides,” he says. “I was struck by how similar wealthy Indians’ homes were at the turn of the century, based on copying British homes because they were contractors and serving as middlemen for British people.”It’s this dichotomy of thought that made Pal’s Britain-loving Indian such a striking caricature. “These people are kind of outdated in new India but their generation, in many ways, built India by being very English and following the same exploitative things that the English did.”Due to increasing animosity towards those who don’t fit in with India’s image of unified hindutva, this class is being erased from Indian culture. “These people belong nowhere – they’re foreigners in their own country,” Pal says.But his show does not set out to make audiences feel sorry for them. “I wanted to understand this bizarre generation of anglicised Indians,” says Pal. In doing so he has delved into what makes India India. Perhaps it acts as an antidote to the current regime’s exclusionary populism, but Pal laughs: “There is no ‘we’ – everybody’s fighting.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d41d8834b5a6400c1d440c3cf1856db533bd036/831_1028_2906_1743/master/2906.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=19c9e1e16d583ce1afe7c819747f50d5","title":"noel fielding interview salvador dali alice cooper urban myths","story":"The comedian stars as one of his heroes, goth-rocker Alice Cooper, in Sky’s latest Urban Myths romp – so why did he pitch to play its other lead character, the clown prince of surrealism? Noel Fielding was born, or so you’d think, to play Alice Cooper. The eyeliner, the dangling black locks, the camped-up goth vibe, the way the comedian and Bake Off host dresses more outlandishly than anyone in any room, with the possible exception of Prue Leith.Cooper has long been one of Fielding’s heroes. His parents were fans and inducted their son into the rock musician’s oeuvre, perhaps even instilling into little Noel the subversive philosophy of Cooper’s School’s Out. “I love his music. He was a punk before punk.” And then one day, Cooper appeared as a guest on the pop quiz show Never Mind the Buzzcocks, on which Fielding was a team captain. Their relationship blossomed. “He invited me to his show and then I did a cartoon strip about him in the .” He also interviewed his hero for the paper.So when Fielding went to audition for a role in a new drama for Sky Arts’ Urban Myths series about the time the glam rocker met the venerable shock artist Salvador Dalí, Fielding was a shoo-in to play Cooper. But he had other ideas. He suggested to directors Jane Pollard and Iain Forsyth he should play Dalí. “I mean, both Alice and Dalí are heroes to me, but Dalí has been important to me since I saw a painting of his with a burning giraffe in the background. When I was aged 12, I just went: ‘This is it for me.’ And I went to art school because of that.”But you grew up to become not an artist, but a comedian? “Yeah, but Dalí’s a comedian as well. Everything he does is funny, for shock. He’s the most ridiculous man played straight.” And in any case, Fielding has never quite set aside his artistic chops. The comedian has held a number of different exhibitions, including The Jelly Fox, a video installation shown at the Saatchi Gallery in London in 2012. Fielding is, in many respects, the Salvador Dalí of British comedy.Understandably, the directors wouldn’t countenance casting Fielding as Dalí when they had as surefire a lookalike as Cooper. Instead, they sent him away for six weeks to research the Cooper role. He was assigned a voice coach to make his stab at Cooper’s flat, Michigan accent more convincing. “It is scary playing someone you know. You don’t want to let him down.”We’re chatting in Fielding’s dressing room at Pinewood Studios between shots for the new drama, The Dalí and the Cooper. Fielding, wearing a prosthetic nose, tells me he was mollified when he found out who’d been cast to play Dalí. “I love David Suchet. I’m obsessed with Poirot. Then I saw him in The Importance of Being Earnest, where he did Lady Bracknell and he was amazing – he did it like a dinosaur, like a velociraptor. “I was very nervous because I was thinking, him and Sheila Hancock” – who plays Dalí’s 79-year-old wife, muse and manager Gala Dalí – “they’re big actors who’ve got a lot of experience. And I’m learning how to be an actor.” Suchet gave him some helpful tips about watching footage of Cooper from the early 1970s. “David said watch him with the sound down. Then you’ve got nothing but the body language.”We meet on the day in March last year when it was announced that Fielding and Sandi Toksvig would replace Mel and Sue in Channel 4’s retool of of The Great British Bake Off. “I know it’s odd – I look like a goth – but I think it’s quite an inspired choice,” says Fielding. Yet even Fielding – no stranger to fame – admits to being blindsided by the fuss. He didn’t go home last night to elude the media scrum. “I forgot it was such a big show. My phone’s on fire.” His PR agent has been scrambled to Pinewood to make sure Fielding talks about Cooper rather than, presumably, blabbing nuggets about his nascent rapport with Bake Off’s mahogany tiger, Paul Hollywood. “I’m not allowed to talk about it,” he says. “I like the show and I like Sandi Toksvig, so I thought it would be fun.” Given all the media rumpus, it’s astounding he can keep his head in the game.The Dalí and the Cooper riffs on the day in 1973 when Cooper comes off stage during his Billion Dollar Babies tour to be told by his manager Shep Gordon (the superb Paul Kaye) that Dalí is in that night’s crowd. “Well, if that gives you wood, drop your kimono and get ready for the happy ending, kemosabe, because the D-Man wants to work with you.” Such, at least, is how comedy writers Roger Drew and Ed Dyson, who worked on The Thick of It and Veep, imagine the conversation.What the D-Man wants to do, it turns out, is to make Cooper the subject of his latest artwork. But there is a problem. Gala Dalí refuses to pay this American oik for the privilege. Shep is a tough businessman (he wears a T-shirt emblazoned “No head. No backstage pass”), but even Shep’s lurid professional backstory ill-prepares him for professional dealings with this woman whom he pegs as a ball-buster. Gala tells Shep she was once in a threesome with Paul Éluard and Max Ernst but neither could satisfy her. Hancock clearly revels in this role.While Shep and Gala wrangle over the money, the Dalí and the Cooper meet. As Suchet’s Dalí shoots Fielding’s Cooper, who’s half naked and clutching props such as a brain capped with an eclair over which crawl some ants, the two men discuss what it is to be an artist. Dalí can’t quite believe that his subject is not Alice Cooper all the time, but is developing a fond relationship with something usually frowned upon by surrealist artists and rock’n’rollers, namely golf. Unlike Dalí, Cooper isn’t always on.Fielding grasps why the character he plays left his madness on stage. “He knew Jim Morrison, Janis Joplin, Keith Moon and Harry Nilsson and they all died. He worked out that he couldn’t be that character off stage. And that’s kept him in good stead, I think. In the days playing golf, and in the evening cutting his own head off with a guillotine. What a life!”What makes Fielding’s performance so compelling is that he’s is channelling something of his twentysomething self. “In this Alice is 24 and Dalí’s 69, so Alice is trying to hold his own. He’s a huge rock star and he’s quite cocky. He’s like me when I was doing the Boosh and we were doing arenas. Not cocky in a horrible way, but you’re just sure of yourself because you’re, like, 20,000 people came tonight – you’ve got a spring in your step. You’re not really old enough to realise that’s only going to last for so long.”Fielding’s greatest fame came in his 20s when he and Julian Barratt starred in the surrealist comedy The Mighty Boosh. The characters he created then – flamboyant zookeeper Vince Noir, a Cockney hitchhiker and hermaphroditic merman Old Greg – are remembered fondly by fans. “People keep asking me if the Boosh is coming back and I say I hope so. I’m not bothered people ask me about it. TV’s become quite disposable, so to make something that lasts a bit of time – it won’t last forever – is quite nice.”As for the Urban Myths directors, they were trying to create a piece of TV that looks like the era run which the drama is set. “We had a rule book,” says Jane Pollard. “We would only use tech devices we could have used in 1973. So there’s no screen, all the effects are in camera.” This kind of self-denying ordinance is of a piece with their use of music. “It would have been so easy to have put in some Alice Cooper music.” So why didn’t you? “Because he wouldn’t have been listening to Alice Cooper.” Instead, they commissioned Jarvis Cocker to write the soundtrack, which he performed with Richard Hawley.Back in his dressing room, Noel Fielding gets the call. Despite the prosthetic nose and the lavish eyeliner, they need him in make up sharpish. He toddles off obligingly on high heels, but not before I ask him one last question. Has playing Alice Cooper given you an insight into how to mellow? “Maybe. I mean I’m on Bake Off – now I might start playing golf. “ He is, please God, kidding."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f81a7b30125aff99f4639f94fd9bc06fff2519bd/0_0_4438_2664/master/4438.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6a6c776095e61fc6f504512bfcf086bd","title":"cayman islands considers legal action uk public scrutiny","story":"Premier Alden McLaughlin says decision is reminiscent of bygone era of colonial despotismThe Cayman Islands government said it was considering legal action in an attempt to stop the UK making the overseas territory open up its company ownership registers to public scrutiny, a day after MPs agreed they should do so by the end of 2020.Alden McLaughlin, the premier of the Cayman Islands, said the territory was keeping all options on the table including a legal challenge to the amendment and accused MPs of making a decision that was “reminiscent of the worst injustices of a bygone era of colonial despotism”.The territory was joined by Bermuda, which questioned whether the newly passed legislation was constitutional, while others in the 14 jurisdictions representing the remains of the British empire said it would be punitively expensive to implement. David Burt, the premier of Bermuda, said parliament’s action was a retrograde step after 50 years of “constitutionally sanctioned self-government”. He added that the island territory would take necessary steps to ensure its constitution was respected.  The Cayman Islands and Bermuda are among the larger financial centres within the 14 overseas territories, which all operate a secretive financial system and have not been obliged to publicly state the true owners of companies.  However, backbench MPs led by Labour’s Margaret Hodge and Conservative Andrew Mitchell, aided by a rebellion of at least 20 Tory MPs on Tuesday passed an amendment to the sanctions and anti-money laundering bill forcing the government to require the overseas territories to change their system. Hodge said it was a “world-changing measure in relation to the fight against corruption”.The Panama Papers are a leak of 11.5m files from the database of the world’s fourth biggest offshore law firm, Mossack Fonseca. The records were obtained from an anonymous source by\u0026nbspthe German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung, which shared them with\u0026nbspa network of international partners, including the , in April 2016.The documents show the myriad ways in which the rich exploit secretive offshore tax regimes. Twelve national leaders were among 143 politicians, their families and close associates shown to have been using offshore tax havens. They included the Pakistani prime minister, Nawaz Sharif the former vice-president of Iraq, Ayad Allawi the president of Ukraine, Petro Poroshenko and the prime minister of Iceland, Sigmundur Davíð Gunnlaugsson.An offshore investment fund run by the father of the then British prime minister David Cameron\u0026nbspavoided paying tax in Britain by hiring residents of the Bahamas to sign its paperwork.The leak is larger than the\u0026nbspUS diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks in 2010, and the\u0026nbspsecret intelligence documents given to journalists by Edward Snowden in 2013. Leaks such as the Panama Papers and Paradise Papers, reported by the  and a consortium of investigative journalistic organisations, revealed that dictators and oligarchs from around the world channel money through companies in the overseas territories. About half the companies referred to in the Panama Papers were set up in the British Virgin Islands (BVI), according to Transparency International. British politicians are confident they have the right to intervene in the overseas territories, which are normally self-governing. Britain forced the territories to abandon capital punishment in 1991 and decriminalise homosexuality in Caribbean territories in 2000. However, more recently, Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, decided not to intervene when Bermuda repealed same-sex marriage legislation. Complaints also made by the Caribbean territories say that the region is struggling to recover after the impact of Hurricane Irma. The BVI has indicated it generates about $100m (£73m) a year from company registration and related activities – and said that the UK government should foot the bill if it wanted to introduce public registers. Orlando Smith, the premier of the BVI, accused the UK government of “constitutional overreach”, saying Britain had forced on the territory another significant challenge for the people of the BVI following last year’s hurricanes.

Mangroves in south-east Florida in an area studied by the researchers have been on a “death march” inland as they edge away from the swelling ocean but have now hit a manmade levee and are likely to be submerged by water within 30 years, according to the Florida International University analysis.“There’s nowhere left for them to go,” said Dr Randall Parkinson, a coastal geologist at FIU. “They are done. The sea will continue to rise and the question now is whether they will be replaced by open water. I think they will.“The outlook is pretty grim. What’s mind boggling is that we are facing the inundation of south Florida this century.”Mangroves are made up of coastal vegetation that grows in salty or brackish water. They are considered crucial buffers to storms and salt water intrusion, as well as key habitats for certain marine creatures.Using aerial photographs, satellite imagery and sediment cores, FIU researchers found that mangroves just south of Miami were migrating westwards over marshland at a rate of about 100ft a year until they were halted by the L-31E levee, a flood barrier in Miami-Dade county, where they are now making their last stand. Previous research has suggested the same phenomenon has happened in other parts of south Florida, making the region more vulnerable to storms, such as Hurricane Irma, which swept up Florida last year, and land loss as the sea rises further.Of particular concern is the future of the Everglades, the vast marsh, mangrove and pine flatwoods wilderness that provides a home to threatened species such as the manatee, American crocodile and Florida panther.The Everglades, known as the “river of grass”, was long nourished by fresh water flowing slowly from marshes, lakes and rivers to the north. However, the ecosystem has shrunk by around half since a network of canals and dams were built over the past century to ert water for agriculture and to build homes. Swaths of the Everglades have been drained to accommodate a booming human population – more than 6 million people now live in south Florida.A restoration plan to ert water back to the Everglades has been backed by Congress but the area now faces the existential problem of sea level rise, which is connected to climate change. The oceans are rising rapidly at the largely flat south Florida coastline, around three times faster than the global average. Salt water is entering the Everglades from the coast and from underground aquifers. “You can restore the plumbing of the Everglades but the question is whether that will be enough,” Parkinson said. “If you have a healthy patient, it will have a higher probability of survival if they are exposed to a virus. The Everglades isn’t a healthy patient, it faces a lot of threats. Dr Stephen Davis, a wetland ecologist who was not involved in the FIU study, said the work illustrates the problems that researchers have witnessed in south Florida in recent years.“There will still be some mangroves in south Florida but areas will collapse into open water bodies,” he said. “Unabated sea level rise will continue to eat away at the marshes. We should do everything we can to help restore the Everglades to reduce its vulnerability.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d82c010a332f4b341e41c26abdf586d72018f92/0_473_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=615d354b275f031976ec3e6d9ad78f03","title":"stephon clark official autopsy california","story":"An official autopsy released on Tuesday says an unarmed black man was shot seven times, not eight as concluded by an independent doctor hired by the man’s family.A pathologist retained by the Sacramento county coroner says that is a crucial distinction because it shows the pathologist hired by the family of 22-year-old Stephon Clark mistook an exit wound for an eighth entry wound, creating an impression that police first shot Clark from the side or back.Clark was most likely shot as he approached police, a conclusion that is consistent with the officers’ story of the fatal encounter, Dr Gregory Reiber wrote after reviewing the official autopsy along with video taken by the two officers’ body-worn cameras and a sheriff’s helicopter circling overhead.The autopsy also says Clark was legally drunk and had traces of marijuana, cocaine and codeine in his system when was shot, but the report said the toxicology findings are not directly relevant to the fatal shooting.The officers shot Clark after chasing him into his grandparents’ backyard. They were responding to a report of someone breaking car windows, and said they shot Clark because they thought he was approaching them while pointing a handgun. Investigators found only a cellphone. The slaying set off weeks of protests as demonstrators called for the officers to be fired and criminally charged. Protesters at times blocked fans from attending professional basketball games and disrupted rush-hour traffic downtown in the state capital and on a nearby interstate. Benjamin Crump, a spokesman for the family’s attorney, did not immediately comment. The pathologist hired by the family, Dr Bennet Omalu, told the Sacramento Bee he found it strange that the coroner’s office brought in its own independent pathologist to review the official autopsy.Omalu found that Clark was hit by six bullets in the back, one in the neck and one in the thigh, and took three to 10 minutes to die. Police waited about five minutes before rendering medical aid.The official autopsy found that Clark was hit three times in his right back in the right front of his neck his right arm in his right chest, slightly back to front and in the left thigh.Two bullets perforated his lungs, with one of those two bullets hitting his heart and aorta, and another bullet striking his spine. The direction of the bullets “do not support the assertion that Clark was shot primarily from behind as asserted by Omalu”, Reiber wrote. He wrote that a frame-by-frame analysis of video from both officers’ body-worn cameras shows Clark facing the officers while helicopter footage shows him “walking … toward the officers’ position”. He was most likely shot first in the thigh, then in the right side and back as he fell first to his knees and then face down with his right side facing the officers, Reiber wrote."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2861e46ecd81b0c0259ef86744f69a34315866e5/0_141_5315_3189/master/5315.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=acc8ca4abc714abcb1b01c2749d1e8de","title":"canada first nations mohawk kahnawake rule","story":"Quebec judge strikes down controversial rule after plaintiffs said they had been harassed for marrying outside Mohawk communityWaneek Horn-Miller had just begun construction on a house for her young family on the Kahnawà:ke Mohawk Territory near Montreal when she received a troubling letter.Signed by the band council, it requested that she “respect the law and the will of the people in the community by leaving the territory”.The territory had long been her home. She had bled for it: as a youth, Horn-Miller nearly died after sustaining a stab wound on the front lines of the Oka Crisis, a 1990 land dispute that grew into a standoff between Canadian soldiers and Mohawk protesters. And she had competed for it: as a Canadian Olympic athlete, she often wore traditional clothing to represent the Mohawk Nation. But her husband, Keith Morgan, is not Mohawk. And in marrying him, she had breached a longstanding rule of the community, informally known as “marry out, get out”.As tensions grew and her name appeared on an eviction list in 2014, she acceded to the demands of the community. She and her family moved to Ottawa.This week, a judge in Quebec struck down the controversial order which had snared Horn-Miller and 16 other plaintiffs. The province’s superior court found that the rule violates Canada’s Charter of Rights and Freedom. “This is a kind of rule that wouldn’t be acceptable anywhere else in Canada, because it’s very clearly unconstitutional,” said Geneviève Grey, who was part of Horn-Miller’s legal team.Justice Thomas Davis rejected arguments that the rule – originally implemented in 1981 – was an effective way to preserve Mohawk culture. Instead, he found the it was “grounded in stereotypical belief that non-native spouses will use the resources and land” of the community.“In fact, most, if not all, of the non-native spouses or the family members who have been denied membership … have embraced the Mohawk culture,” he wrote.“Marry out, get out” is rarely enforced, despite being codified as law. But a number of plaintiffs told the court they were harassed and often feared for their personal safety.Terri McComber said the intimidation became “unbearable” after she married Marvin McComber, a member of the band. She testified that protests were held outside the family home she was known as “the white woman”, her children were called “half-breeds”.The judgment also exposed difficult questions surrounding federal jurisdiction and indigenous autonomy. “Indigenous groups really push back against jurisdiction that is unilaterally imposed upon them,” said Naiomi Metallic, a law professor at Dalhousie University. Such clashes over jurisdiction are often the result of communities grappling with rapidly diminishing lands, resources and disappearing traditions, she said.The Kahnawà:ke reserve on the southern banks of the Saint Lawrence river has 8,000 members on 53 sq km of land, – about a third of its original territory. Metallic said roughly a third of First Nations in Canada have rules of some kind to determine who enjoys benefits of treaties.The Mohawk Council of Kahnawà:ke is currently reviewing the decision.“Obviously we maintain the position that matters that are so integral to our identity have no business in outside courts,” said Grand Chief Joseph Norton in a statement. “However, a decision on the case has been rendered. We are now taking the time to analyze the decision and will inform the community further in the coming days.”The law remains isive within the community, and some residents strongly support it. Others simply comply.Terry McComber (no relation to Terri McComber), is a Mohawk woman who recently married a non-native man. “He would never be able to live here. And I wouldn’t want him to live here. We belong on the outside now.”The decision wasn’t easy, she said: “Kahnawà:ke is still my home in my heart.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d13687b635cb580e93e67a66f5d2763af76162c/0_166_4360_2616/master/4360.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=765bccd07da2c8884bd7d1899e6e715f","title":"pakistani army manzoor pashteen pashtun","story":"Manzoor Pashteen’s Pashtun Protection Movement gathers support in country where criticism of army is rareEvery morning Ahmed Shah puts on his circular, red-and-black cap, decorated with spades, and feels ready to take on the world. “For me this cap is a symbol of resistance,” he says. “That’s why I like it.”Shah (not his real name) is one of thousands of Pakistanis who have taken to wearing the distinctive tribal hat to show their support for Manzoor Pashteen. The charismatic 26-year-old, rarely seen without his “Pashteen hat”, leads the Pashtun Protection Movement (PTM), which has convulsed the country with unprecedentedly virulent criticism of the powerful armed forces. It accuses the military of being behind a litany of abuses in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (Fata), an inhospitable, mountainous region on the border with Afghanistan dominated by Pakistan’s 15-million-strong Pashtun minority and which has played host to a variety of terrorist groups.Although Pashteen is committed to non-violent protest, his youthfulness, firebrand speeches and distinctive headgear have drawn comparisons with Che Guevara.What marks the PTM out as a particular threat to Pakistan’s army, which has ruled the country for more than half its 70-year history, is that its allegations mirror those made by western officials, namely that the army plays a “double game” with regard to terrorism, silently supporting groups that target India and Afghanistan.The government has responded with a crackdown, banning rallies and harassing PTM supporters. Nine PTM activists have gone missing in Karachi, Pakistan’s southern business capital. At a rally last weekend in Swat, pro-military protesters tried to block entry to some of a 25,000-strong crowd.Even the “Pashteen hat” has been subjected to local, unofficial bans. Replicas can no longer be found in the Swat valley city of Mingora, where at least five shopkeepers selling the hat were recently detained and beaten by thugs associated with the military, locals say.At a rally in Lahore on 21 April, held in defiance of the government ban, Pashteen bowed his head like a boxer as minders escorted him through an exultant, selfie-taking crowd to a stage adorned with pictures of missing people. Earlier that day, sewage had mysteriously flooded the ground. About 8,000 people – many in the Pashteen cap – chanted “the uniforms are behind the terrorists”, a slogan that fosters particular apoplexy in the military’s headquarters in Rawalpindi.Pashteen tells his audience that he has come to Lahore, a city populated by relatively few Pashtuns, to “expose what the army are doing against us”. To his right, a gigantic poster shows a devastated, rubble-strewn street in a town in North Waziristan partly flattened during a 2014 military campaign against Pakistan’s Taliban. That campaign is credited with helping reduce deaths from terrorism by more than two-thirds. Yet, according to the PTM, ordinary Pashtuns were caught in the crossfire, and have ever since been subject to humiliating curfews, checkpoints and collective punishment by troops stationed to maintain order.So-called enforced disappearances generate particular grief. A government commission has dealt with almost 5,000 cases since 2011, but rights groups say this number vastly underestimates the scale of the problem. “According to the constitution, anybody who commits a crime must be produced in a court of law within 24 hours,” says Pashteen. “But so many people have been taken and are still missing.” His voice rising, almost to a scream, Pashteen yells at the crowd “are you with the tyrants?” He calls on ordinary soldiers to defy the orders of high command, a statement some have interpreted as treasonous. One rally-goer from Pakistan’s Punjab majority bites his lip and glances anxiously over his shoulder. “It’s quite remarkable hearing this,” he says, on condition of anonymity. “What it portends for Pakistan I don’t know.”By tradition the military is largely referred to in code, as “the establishment” or, in the case of agents of the feared Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), “angels”. Among PTM-supporters, however, that is changing. “Before the PTM we didn’t say anything, even in our bedrooms, about the ISI and military intelligence,” says Shehrullah Khan, whose brother was “disappeared” from his luggage shop in 2016. With some safety in numbers, “we can now say everything in our mind and hearts”. PTM leaders admit that some of the disappeared may have links to the Taliban, but argue that all should be produced in court to face charges.A white flag, representing the movement’s commitment to non-violent protest, flutters above the stage. Among the stereotypes Pashteen is helping to break down, says analyst Fasi Zaka, is that of “Pashtuns being a martial ethnic group given to conflict”. Its leaders argue that Pashtuns are more victims of the Taliban than the willing hosts often portrayed in the media. One, Ali Wazir, has had 17 members of his family or killed.The military response betrays choking discomfort. General Bajwa, the chief of army staff, has referred indirectly to the PTM as being “engineered” by Pakistan’s enemies. Reporting on the movement has been censored in the media. Yet, unable to stop its growth, corps commander Lt General Nazir Ahmad Butt held a meeting last week with the PTM to discuss its “legitimate grievances”, referring to a five-point list of demands that includes de-mining, the punishment of a Karachi police chief accused of carrying out extrajudicial killings, and a “truth and reconciliation commission” on enforced disappearances.“The PTM’s success,” says civil rights activist Jibran Nasir, is that after years of denial, some in the military “admit there have been some transgressions”.From the back seat of a car whisking him away from a horde of supporters, Pashteen tells the  that he is unconcerned by a possible threat to his life. “At first my family said they would throw me out of the house,” he says, “but now they say if you are killed, then at least you will have done something for the people.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/709f2897232dd4917a55e68ef5424528e2c906bb/622_437_5138_3083/master/5138.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8c8a4cb0e24611c0f8cdec1c2d6f1d7b","title":"radio dodo syrian refugee children bedtime","story":"Canadian Brigitte Alepin’s brainchild Radio-Dodo is a bilingual radio station with stories, songs and segments to help Syria’s scattered kids get to sleep“Attention ladies and gentlemen, come closer! The circus – and your favourite radio show – is about to start,” says a French-Canadian veteran journalist in French. He turns to his co-host, a Syrian storyteller, who repeats the words into her microphone, this time in Arabic.In the tiny downtown studio of a student radio station in Montreal, Bernard Derome and Marya Zarif are recording a radio show for Syrian refugee children.Launched in 2017 with the support of the Canadian Commission for Unesco, Radio-Dodo, or Sleepytime-Radio, has already broadcast 37 episodes online and through Radio-Rozana, a Syrian radio station based in Paris. News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can follow up with our Further Reading guides and can also recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theThe weekly bilingual show mixes stories, songs and segments about everything from tying your shoelaces to why your milk teeth fall out. The aim is to help Syrian refugee children around the world forget about their worries and fall asleep at night. The woman behind the show is Brigitte Alepin, a French-Canadian tax expert whose Syrian grandfather immigrated to Canada in the early 20th century.When the Syrian war erupted in 2011, Alepin said she felt shocked and helpless only a few years earlier, she had visited her grandfather’s hometown of Aleppo with her young son. Throughout the trip he had played with local children now, she couldn’t help wondering about them.“I asked myself, how is it that life makes it possible for my boy – who had been in Aleppo – now to be safe at home in Quebec?” she said. “I told myself I would never be able to feel good about myself again if I didn’t find a way to help.”For a while, Alepin wondered how she could help Syrian refugees half a world away, but as she discussed the problem with a friend, an idea formed: radio waves could cross borders and reach an audience anywhere around the world. “We were talking and a little while later, I had an intuition: I would try to make a radio show for children,” said Alepin. She gathered a small team of Syrian, Algerian and Canadian volunteers to help her organize the show, find content and sign up storytellers. Prominent Canadian writers including Kim Thuy and Wajdi Mouawad, and former Canadian Olympic athlete Marie-Ève Marleau have appeared on the show to read stories or discuss their jobs.Most of the audience is in Turkey and Quebec. One regular listener is Rahaf, a 10-year-old Syrian refugee from Damascus who came to Montreal in 2016 with her two brothers and their parents.Rahaf uses her brother’s laptop to listen to the show as she falls asleep her favourite story so far was about a dog taking the bus by himself.“I just listen on my bed and I sing along,” she said in French, her new language.Rahaf’s mother, Basma – who asked for the family’s surname to be withheld – said that her husband and sons escaped to Jordan first. But when Basma and Rahaf attempted to follow, they were arrested and jailed for 18 months. After being released, she and her siblings lived in a refugee camp in Jordan for three years conditions were harsh, and there was no chance for the children to go to school.Now Rahaf is getting used to her new life, going to school during the day and playing at home. “I like telling myself stories and when I have a new book, I read it to myself,” she said.Alepin says she wants to continue spreading love and joy to refugee children and plans to further expand her project. She has recently found a partner radio station in Mali to broadcast her show to children in the French-speaking country, and hopes that eventually Radio-Dodo can become a global radio show for child refugees around the world.

File photograph: Getty Images Proposals to raise the age of digital age of consent from 13 to 16 years of age were rejected by an Oireachtas committee on Wednesday.The digital age of consent is the age below which a person cannot by law make an agreement with an online service provider.These agreements allow social media companies such as Facebook, Instagram or WhatsApp to access users’ personal information for the purposes of marketing or advertising.The party’s justice spokesman Jim O’Callaghan said 13 was “too young” and meant young people were vulnerable to being exploited.“We must recognise now that children are growing up with levels of intrusion that we didn’t experience,” he said.Mr O’Callaghan noted that a child could not legally enter a contract until aged 18.Social media, he said, merged people into groups and was a threat to inidualism and “is anti-intellectual in the long run”.He was supported by Labour TD Sean Sherlock who said by making 16 the age limit, the onus was being pushed back on to the social media companies.Sinn Féin TD Donnchadh Ó Laoghaire bemoaned the “cynical and exploitative” micro-targeting of children by social media companies.However, he added that he would go against the recommendation of the Ombudsman for Children and groups such as Barnardos “with trepidation”.Children’s groups have argued to maintain the age of digital consent at 13 on the basis that young people’s rights must be valued and raising the age could potentially undermine child protection measures and result in some services potentially being withdrawn.Independent TDs Mick Wallace and Clare Daly argued strongly for 13, citing a wide range of expert opinion behind that threshold, including the Children’s Rights Alliance.Both said that education was the best protection for children and not a “nanny state”.Ms Daly said the digital age of consent was a data protection issue, not a child protection issue.Colm Brophy of Fine Gael said the committee had previously brought in experts and made a judgment.It was regrettable that the age issue was being revisited, he said. Having listened to all, he was “firmly of the opinion” that 13 was the correct age.Róisín Shortall of the Social Democrats argued passionately for a ban on marketing companies targeting children, irrespective of the age of consent.She said it should be illegal to harvest personal data for marketing and commercial purposes.There was “relentless targeting of children”, she said. “Our children have a right to be allowed live their childhood without being targeted.”Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan said the Government opted for 13 as an “appropriate balance” having listened to all experts. Denmark, Sweden, Finland, the UK, Spain and Latvia thought the same, he said.His experience as a parent was of seeing 13- and 14-year-olds being very tech savvy and able to circumvent their parents. A digital age of 16 “would be really difficult to monitor and enforce”, said Mr Flanagan.The committee’s decision to reject the proposal was welcomed by groups such as the Children’s Rights Alliance, ISPCC and other leading children’s organisations“Children’s inidual rights must be valued, and raising the age of consent to 16 will potentially undermine child protection measures and result in some services potentially being withdrawn,” said alliance chief executive Tanya Ward.Gráinia Long of the ISPCC said no one should confuse data protection and the need to ensure children’s safety online with imposing “unworkable” restrictions on children’s use of services."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3480746.1525206423!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"hse chief in line for large fees and share options from us firm","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTony O Brien, HSE director general: will receive fees totalling $65,000 (€54,000) a year from his work for San Diego-based Evofem Biosciences, a female contraceptive manufacturer.

The company referred to Mr O’Brien’s role leading the Irish national health service in a March 21st public statement to the stock market released in advance of its annual meeting next week.As a non-executive director of the company Mr O’Brien will receive an “annual cash retainer” of $50,000 in addition to $10,000 a year from his role as chairman of the company’s compensation committee and $5,000 a year as a member of the company’s audit committee.The HSE chief currently holds no shares in the company.The company’s filing last month says, however, that he has the chance to buy into the company he will be awarded options for 24,691 shares, which would be worth $181,725 based on Evofem’s share price last night on Wall Street’s Nasdaq technology-dominated stock exchange. The California firm lists Mr O’Brien’s past roles as founding chief executive of the National Cancer Screening Service and director of CervicalCheck in an extensive biography in stock market statements, along with his past role as chief executive of the Irish Family Planning Association.

Mr Lynch, who is Evofem’s chairman, is also non-executive chairman of Ireland East Hospital Group, the country’s largest hospital group and the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital.It has been a lucrative role for Mr Lynch. The company said he received $700,000 from Evofem in 2017, a figure that includes $290,000 in consulting fees and a $350,000 bonus.Evofem’s annual meeting, which will be attended by board members, will take place next Tuesday at the San Diego Marriott Del Mar in southern California."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3481613.1525273090!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"hse s tony o brien committed to cervical screening solution","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            HSE director general Tony O’Brien at the  Oireachtas health committee.

Image: Oireachtas TV screengrabThe head of the HSE Tony O’Brien has said he will devote the greater part of his remaining period in office to addressing the controversy surrounding the cervical screening programme.Mr O’Brien is scheduled to leave his post of HSE director general in the summer.He told the Oireachtas health committee that as he started his career in the public service in the BreastCheck programme, the current controversies had come as a “personal blow”.He said he had appointed a HSE national director to oversee the screening programme from Thursday and would take a close personal interest in developments.Asked whether everything was now known regarding the controversy, he said the serious incident management team process was continuing.He said the group wanted to get out as much information as quickly as it could.He said this meant the HSE was sharing information before it had complete information.The chair of the serious incident management team Patrick Lynch said 172 women had now been contacted and all offered an appointment.Labour’s Alan Kelly was told that legal proceedings with respect to the Cervical Check programme have been initiated in six cases.Mr O’Brien said there were 10 “active claims” altogether at various stages.Mr Kelly said that the public view was that the controversy was either a major cover up or one of the biggest examples of incompetence in the history of Irish healthcare.Mr O’Brien is in line to receive substantial fees and share options this year from his role on the board of a publicly quoted US healthcare company that he joined in January.Mr O’Brien (54), who announced last month he will leave the HSE in August, will receive fees totalling $65,000 (€54,000) a year from his work for San Diego-based Evofem Biosciences, a female contraceptive manufacturer, and share-buying options of $450,000 in his first three years.Stock-market filings submitted by the Californian firm said Mr O’Brien joined the board in January 2018, two months before he announced publicly that he would be departing as director-general of the HSE when his contract expires in August.The chairman of Evofem Biosciences ran a political fundraiser for the Taoiseach, the Dáil heard on Wednesday.

Photograph: Cyril ByrneWomen of Ireland: What they don’t know won’t hurt them.Best say nothing.Particularly as it’s not a patient safety issue anymore.Because these particular patients are beyond saving now.Give them access to information and they mightn’t take it well. They might get emotional and start kicking up. They might even decide to sue.Women of Ireland: What you don’t know won’t hurt us . . .Another day in the Dáil and another gallop of TDs into the chamber to agonise over the latest sorry episode concerning this State’s disordered relationship with women from the waist down. More than once, TDs listed the many dangerous indignities visited on Irish women through the decades by a paternalistic establishment.The Taoiseach led the way in the afternoon as the cervical cancer screening scandal became the main topic of discussion, running well into the evening with the Minister for Health listening to statements and taking questions for more than three hours.“I know this whole controversy is having a huge impact on the women of Ireland. It is about women’s health it’s about women’s lives,” said Leo Varadkar, as women wondered if there will ever come a day when the intimate details of their health and their lives are not dissected and debated and held up for public scrutiny by very important men.“This comes after a very difficult year with controversies around issues such as #MeToo, sexual harassments and difficult rape trials and other matters as well. And I know this country hasn’t always treated women very well, and in the past and even today perhaps, treats them very badly, whether it is mother and baby homes or Magdalen laundries or the marriage bar or the Hep C scandal.”As the contributions from TDs piled up, Leo’s initial list was expanded by other speakers.Of course, the catalogue of insults they reopened was an old one. These things don’t happen in these more enlightened times.Except they do.“Even tonight you’ve been put in the unenviable position of coming in here with new information, drip-feed, reclarifying the information,” said Daly. She accepted the cancer screening process is not wholly reliable. Mistakes happen no matter what systems are in place and tragedies happen and will continue to happen. How society responds is what matters.It was agreed by all sides the response by CervicalCheck and ultimately the HSE to the women whose cancer was not detected in their initial tests has been completely unacceptable.The situation is a mess. Women who have had cervical smears and were given the all-clear are now worrying their results may not have been correct. The Taoiseach made a point of stressing “there is nobody walking around today with a cervical cancer diagnosis from whom that information is being withheld by the HSE.”He was personally “very angry” that women were not told that following an audit of their tests it was discovered that pre-cancerous cells were not picked up when they had their first check. “I’m a Taoiseach, a doctor and also a brother with two sisters.”He mentioned his anger twice. “Not just angry, Taoiseach, you should be livid, livid about what’s after happening in these cases,” responded Joan Collins of Independents4Change.Meanwhile, Alan Kelly couldn’t believe his ears when Minister for Health Simon Harris imparted his new information. It was “a bombshell that you’re after landing in her tonight, which I wasn’t prepared for . . . This is a bombshell. What volume of women haven’t had their cases audited?”And he looked around the chamber, with its usual overpopulation of men in suits.“We actually have a big problem in this country protecting women’s health” he declared, adding that Vicky Phelan, the woman with terminal cancer whose diagnosis was missed and who had to take her fight to the High Court, was probably following the debate at home.“I’m sure she’s watching us all here tonight, fellas,” he said.Louise O’Reilly, Sinn Fein’s health spokeswoman, echoed remarks made during Leaders’ Questions by Mary Lou McDonald about the decision not to tell women that their first test for cancer should have come up as positive.“The toxic culture of concealment and harassment pursued by the HSE and Government against women who have been wronged by the State is now in full public view” she said, urging the Minister to ensure that other affected women are not forced to fight the State through the courts as Phelan and others have been made to do.The Fianna Fáil leader summed up the state of confusion surrounding the story. “Everybody knew but nobody knew, and nobody could tell us anything in the past week. It had to be dragged and drip fed in a frenzied way.”Mary Lou McDonald homed in on the presumption of medics who decide what a woman with terminal cancer needs to know.“They passed away not knowing that their cancer should have been caught earlier, that their treatment programmes, prognosis and possibly their outcomes could have been different. They died unaware that this information was known to the HSE and to others.” It was part of a “a toxic culture of concealment and a refusal to take responsibility within the HSE, a culture in which women are literally allowed to die before fault is admitted.”All day, the questions kept coming for the Taoiseach and his Minister for Health, underlining the sense of confusion and ignorance felt by people trying to fathom the detail of this scandal.It’s creating a sense of worry where there should be none.“Across Ireland today, there are many thousands of women terrified following the revelations about the CervicalCheck screening programme,” said Labour leader, Brendan Howlin. What’s to be done to reassure them?Mary Lou called for the resignation of the head of the HSE, Tony O’Brien.But the Taoiseach said the full facts have yet to emerge, but he is determined to get to the bottom of the issue. He asked for more time. “I think everyone, even Tony O’Brien, deserves a fair hearing.”Whatever we do, it should be based on facts. We are letting women down, and letting people’s health down, in particular, women’s health, if we make decisions that are not based on facts.We are really letting people down, particularly the women of Ireland, with regard to women’s health, if we make decisions that are not based on fact.Facts are already out there: the Taoiseach outlined some of them, others were added, such as symphysiotomy, maternal deaths, Brigid McCole, Susie Long . . .And in the chamber, there was the unspoken spectre of the referendum and the further fears of pregnant women who have cancer and how the State might treat them too.The wonderful women of Ireland, so beloved of all TDs in the Dáil.What they don’t know won’t hurt them.What you don’t know won’t hurt us.-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3468658.1524242996!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"le big mac emmanuel macron s rise and rise","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWinning ways: Emmanuel Macron at his victory rally in Paris after being elected president, in May 2017. Photograph: Patrick KovarikAFPGettyPresident Emmanuel Macron likes to convince people. In manner and method, he is unlike his predecessors. Nicolas Sarkozy cajoled and bullied. François Hollande just gave up. Macron fixes interlocutors with his intense blue stare and builds a Cartesian argument. If that doesn’t work, he starts over, patiently, but with determination.The past week has tested the young president’s powers of persuasion. Early in the hours of April 14th, Macron used his constitutional power as commander in chief for the first time, joining the US and Britain in launching cruise missiles against three chemical weapons installations in Syria. The goal, Macron said later, was to convince Bashar al Assad and Vladimir Putin that the international community was more than a “nice” and “weak” body they could push around.In a further exercise in persuasion, Macron volunteered for a combative, 2½ hour live television interview on Sunday night, during which he made the surprising claim that, “Ten days ago, President Trump said the US would pull out of Syria. We convinced him it was necessary to stay for the duration.”The White House later issued a statement saying Trump’s view had not changed, and the French president made an embarrassing climbdown on Monday, claiming he “never said” the US or France would remain militarily engaged in Syria for the long term.Perhaps Macron, whose nickname is “Jupiter”, is threatened by hubris, the sin of pride that afflicted Greek gods.The rest of the week was one long attempt to convince Europeans and the French of the rightness of his positions. Macron – who has become the de facto leader of Europe – received the heads of the three Baltic states who have teamed up with five other northern EU countries, including the Netherlands and Ireland, to thwart his efforts to further integrate the euro zone.Then, before a more sympathetic audience at the EU parliament in Strasbourg, Macron pleaded with proponents of liberal democracy to wake up and oppose the populist authoritarians who deny European values. Macron then travelled to Berlin in yet another effort to enlist German chancellor Angela Merkel’s support for his European reform agenda.On Monday, Macron will go to Washington for a three-day state visit, the first of Trump’s presidential term. Although the two men have clashed on climate change, the Iran nuclear accord, trade protectionism and the rise of Eurosceptical populism, Trump appears to have been charmed by the young president, who says Franco-American co-operation is crucial in the fight against terrorism.As the first anniversary of Macron’s election approaches on May 7th, and a half century after the May 1968 revolution, a different kind of spring is flowering in France. For the first time in decades, the country is reversing its post second World War decline, and the persuasive Macron is turning France into the world’s greatest soft power.There is, of course, discontent. It wouldn’t be France if there wasn’t. This week Macron also confronted striking railway workers in the Vosges, telling them to “stop taking people hostage.” The country is struggling through a rolling strike over the reform of the SNCF railway company.And despite Macron’s best efforts to reassure them, many in France suspect their young president is out to destroy the familiar but dysfunctional “French social model”. In their eyes, Macron is pushing France into the chasm of savage, race-to-the bottom capitalism.So what do they make of him in his home town? The  travelled there to find out.Macron was born in Amiens, the capital of Picardy, 40 years ago and lived here until just before his 17th birthday. From age 11 to 16, he studied at the Jesuit school La Providence.Built in the graceless concrete style of the 1950s, “La Pro” is an elementary, secondary and technical school for 2,000 pupils, spread over several acres. Aside from occasional crucifixes, calendars of Pope Francis and portraits of St Ignatius of Loyola, the religious footprint is light. The teachers are lay people. The priest visits only once a week now.Not a single plaque or photograph records that the president and first lady of France passed through these corridors. Yet this is where Macron asked to be baptised at the age of 12, and where, at 15, he fell in love with his future wife, a French and drama teacher called Brigitte Trogneux Auzière.Macron has always been drawn to older people. His maternal grandmother, Germaine “Manette” Nogues, died in his arms five years ago, at the age of 97. The Protestant humanist philosopher Paul Ricoeur was a spiritual father to him the progressive socialist millionaire Henry Hermand his political mentor. “He’s attracted by knowledge, by people who have experience,” his neurologist father, Jean-Michel (67), says over lunch in Amiens.At La Pro and subsequently at Henri IV, France’s leading lycée and prep school in Paris, Macron often stayed after class to talk to teachers.Marc Defernand (78) taught Macron history and geography here, and was principal of Macron’s section. “He was more mature than other students,” says Defernand. “He always asked a lot of questions. Sometimes he would pick up a conversation we’d started eight days earlier, exactly where we’d left off.”In the autumn of 2016, Defernand queued in a local bookshop to ask Macron to sign his autobiographical manifesto, Révolution. The retired educator is moved, recalling what happened. “He grabbed me by the hand and said, ‘Monsieur Defernand! It’s so good to see you!’” Macron inscribed the book: “To Marc, this ‘Revolution’, which owes more to him than he knows. In friendship, Emmanuel.”We visit the 700-seat theatre where Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Trogneux Auzière adapted a play by Eduardo De Filippo together.“He was dynamite,” Defernand says. “I told him that if he continued, he would be the Gérard Philippe of the 21st century. It was difficult for others to act in the same play with him. In the same way, it’s difficult for his cabinet ministers now.”Defernand wasn’t aware of the relationship at the time, though he knew Macron went often to Auzière’s house. “I assumed there was a flirt between him and her daughter Laurence,” he says.The scandal of a married teacher with three children having an affair with a student nearly 25 years her junior has been transformed into romantic legend. Everyone would rather forget the trauma.“Jesuits never pried into people’s private lives. There was no morality investigation,” Defernand says. “There were unmarried teachers living together at the time. I was more worried about students taking drugs.”The fact that Brigitte continued to teach at La Pro for years after her lover’s departure, and then transferred to Lycée St Louis de Gonzague when they began to live together later in Paris, is further evidence of tolerance, Defernand says.A tragic love story, known to most French people, occurred a quarter-century earlier and helped pave the way for Macron and Auzière.Schoolteacher Gabrielle Russier (32) had an affair with a lycée student half her age, Christian Rossi, in Marseille. The youth’s parents filed a complaint against the teacher and had their son placed in a mental hospital. Russier was given a suspended prison sentence and took her own life. The story became the subject of books, films and songs. Asked about it at a press conference, former president Georges Pompidou famously quoted a poem by Paul Eluard that was sympathetic to women accused of having slept with German soldiers during the war.The historian Jean-François Sirinelli\u0026nbspcompares the Russier and Macron stories in his book Les Révolutions françaises, to show how much France evolved in a single generation. “Gabrielle Russier takes her own life in 1969. Emmanuel Macron and his teacher start an affair in the 1990s, and in May 2017, Brigitte Macron becomes first lady of France.”Macron’s parents learned of the affair by chance. “My wife was much more upset than I was,” Prof Macron says. “It may sound macho, but I thought he’d get over it. He didn’t . . . I thought it was a little early. It wasn’t the way I envisioned life, but it wasn’t my life. I raised my children to be free and independent.”The Macrons didn’t consider filing charges against Brigitte Auzière, but they asked to meet her. “I was requisitioned to impose authority,” Prof Macron laughs. “I told her, ‘He’s a minor. I want him to complete his studies. After that, he’s free to do what he wants.’”The president’s parents have been hurt by press reports that they sent their son to Paris to get him away from Auzière. “He was going to go to Henri IV anyway. It was planned,” Prof Macron says, nonetheless admitting that perhaps Emmanuel “went a little early”.At La Pro, I ask a class of 14-15 year-olds, Macron’s age when he met Brigitte, if they could fall in love with a teacher. The teenagers laugh and say yes. “If it happened to someone our age, it would shock me,” says a student called Grégoire. “But now that he’s an adult, it doesn’t bother me.”The students say it’s “cool” that Macron is president. “He was elected because there was Marine Le Pen,” pipes in Ayoub, of north African origin. Perhaps parroting their parents’ opinions, the youths object to rising taxes and praise the appointment of cabinet ministers who are not professional politicians. For the future, they predict flying cars and tell me France will never know full employment.On a scale of one to 10, they give the young president an approval rating of seven. “He has to prove himself,” one explains. Like France, Macron’s successors at La Pro are waiting to see.The Amienois may seem blasé about their president, but his father attributes this attitude to the “taciturn, reserved” character of Picard people. The region particularly suffered in both world wars, has a miserable climate and has been decimated by de-industralisation.His son is an atypical Picard, “an extrovert” infused with the sun of the southwest on the side of his mother, Françoise Nogues-Macron.History and bloodlines led me to Macron père, to find out more about the family’s English ancestry. In February, Macron spent an evening with the Presidential Press Association. As the representative for foreign journalists, I was part of the welcoming party. I gave him a sepia postcard of English soldiers in Amiens in 1918. \u0026nbspMacron studied the photograph closely. “You know, they found me an English great grandfather,” he said with a laugh, staring at the postcard. “He was called George Robertson.” The president scrutinised the English faces for a long moment. He was looking for a face that resembled his own.Towards the end of last year’s presidential campaign, Brigitte Macron mentioned to British journalists that her husband had a great grandfather called “Mr Robertson from Bristol”. The London Times, Mirror and Daily Mail researched the story and told the Macrons more than they had ever known about “Mr Robertson”.George William Robertson was born in Bristol in December 1887, and is believed to have fought in the Battle of the Somme. Distant relatives in England have preserved his war medals.Robertson married Macron’s great grandmother, Suzanne Leblond, in the town of Abbeville, 40km from Amiens, in 1919. They had three daughters. The middle daughter, Jacqueline, born in 1922, was Emmanuel Macron’s paternal grandmother.“He disappeared from one day to the next,” Prof Macron told me. “No one in the family ever heard from him. Suzanne raised three daughters alone. She kept a very modest grocery shop in Abbeville. My parents sent me to live with her and my aunts for two years as a child.”The failed marriage to an Englishman “was never, never talked about. The family kept no trace of him. I never saw a picture,” Prof Macron continues. George Robertson married again, settled in east London and kept a grocery shop, like his ex-wife, Suzanne. A step-daughter told the Mirror that he liked to sing Roses of Picardy, which he had learned in the trenches.Had a butcher from Bristol not fought in the Somme, married a Frenchwoman and fathered her children, Emmanuel Macron would not exist, would not be president of France today.Macron’s intellectual precociousness and his relationship with Brigitte meant he “skipped his adolescence”, his father says. In the autumn of 1993, three months short of his 17th birthday, the future president moved to a garret near the Lycée Henri IV in Paris. \u0026nbspHe continued his relationship with Brigitte. “When I went to see him in his chambre de bonne, sometimes he called through the door for me to come back later,” Prof Macron laughs. “I knew she was there with him.”Christian Monjou taught Macron American and British civilisation for three years at Henri IV. Though he did not know about the romance, Monjou noticed that Macron raced off to Amiens the moment classes ended on Saturday. “It was a case of\u0026nbsp ‘the ided self’,” Monjou says in an interview in his book-lined study.Macron obtained his baccalauréat with honours, but twice failed the entrance exam for the École Normale Supérieure, which trains French academics. It was the only failure of his life. Had it not been for the distraction of romance with Brigitte, Monjou says, Macron would have succeeded in the exam and become an academic.Against all odds, Brigitte Macron eventually orced and moved to Paris to live with Emmanuel. They married in 2007. “Without her, I would not be me,” Macron said during the campaign.Macron went on to earn a doctorate in philosophy, then reoriented his life towards politics with degrees from Sciences Po and the École Nationale d’Administration (ENA). “He used failure as a launching pad,” says Monjou. “That is typical of a leader.”“Have you brought your helmet and bulletproof vest?” the taxi driver who takes me to the Whirlpool clothes dryer factory in north Amiens asks. It’s a joke, of course, but the “Whirlpools” are notoriously hostile. A year ago, Marine Le Pen promised their factory would not close if she became president. Macron ignored advice and plunged into the crowd of angry strikers, saying, “If you listen to the security guys, you’re dead.”The factory will move to Poland at the end of May. Most of the 290 workers have been promised retraining or jobs building “intelligent” refrigerators by the factory’s new owner. But they’re still angry. On the day I visit, management proposed a clothes dryer in lieu of a severance bonus.“Macron, Macron. He’s not a god. We’re losing jobs. We don’t give a damn about Macron,” François Gorlia, the in-house union leader, tells me on the phone when he refuses to come to the gate to talk to me.“He’s a right-wing guy. Everything for the rich. Nothing for the poor,” Sibylle (39), an assembly line worker says as she arrives for the 1pm shift. She’ll benefit from Macron’s investment in training for the jobless, but she isn’t convinced. “Training is fine and dandy, but there are no jobs.”After lunch in a simple bistro, Macron’s father Jean-Michel guides me through a maze of streets under construction, to the music conservatory where his son studied piano for nine years. When he failed the conservatory exam after his first year, Macron’s mother told his biographer Anne Fulda, the boy insisted on having the same examiner the second year, an early sign of his determination to convince. He played well, Prof Macron recalls, mastering Bach’s devilishly difficult Goldberg Variations.Prof Macron gives me the address of the modest, two-storey brick bungalow where Emmanuel and his two siblings grew up, and where the neurologist still lives with his second wife. “It’s not Neuilly,” Macron père says laughing, referring to the Beverly Hills-like Paris suburb where Nicolas Sarkozy came from. Though they are both doctors, Macron’s parents earned low, public sector salaries. “They weren’t neurosurgeons with private jets,” comments a presidential adviser.The Trogneux chocolate shop, near the cathedral in central Amiens, is where Brigitte Macron’s family have made chocolates and macaroons for five generations. They also own the local Renault dealership.Black-and-white photographs of successive generations of the Trogneux chocolate dynasty hang inside the shop. There is no photograph or mention of Brigitte Trogneux Auzière Macron. Jean-Alexandre Trogneux (57), the first lady’s nephew and godson, agrees to be photographed, but refuses to talk about the presidential couple. “We’ve made it a golden rule,” he says. “We don’t talk about them and they don’t talk about us.”Fabien Dorémus (32) heads the political book section of a shop in central Amiens. Macron’s Révolution sold more than 400 copies there, an “enormous” number, Dorémus says. He had no desire to read it, and dismisses the book – and Macron – as “all slogans and clichés”. A former journalist whose local online newspaper failed for lack of funding, Dorémus is close to the far left party France Unbowed.\u0026nbspSince Macron’s election, Dorémus says, “I’m not optimistic for workers, pensioners and people who need public services. I am very optimistic for the rich.”The bookseller mentions various left-wing grievances against Macron, arising from a handful of disparaging remarks since 2014: Macron referred to slaughterhouse workers who were losing their jobs as “illiterate” Macron told a heckler wearing an anti-Macron T-shirt, “The best way to buy a suit is to get a job” Macron called protesters against his labour reforms “slackers” and accused strikers of wanting to foutre le bordel, or wreak havoc.It’s hardly “let them eat cake”. But the president has been hanged and burned in effigy by protesters. “You have to put yourself in the place of the people who get told they are slackers and freeloaders,” Dorémus says. “He’s contemptuous of the lower classes. People started hating him because they feel disrespected.”Another criticism, made by Macron’s former teachers, is that his speeches are often so long and intellectual that they can be difficult to follow.And attempts to control the president’s image can be counterproductive. The novelist Emmanuel Carrère was given exclusive access to the president and first lady. In two interviews with Macron, there was “one really strong, beautiful sentence”, Carrère wrote in the . “And this really strong, really beautiful sentence was off the record. In its place I was given permission to use a perfectly dull, perfectly formatted variant.”In the course of a day in President Macron’s home town, there is not a single photograph of him to be seen.Brigitte Fouré, the city’s mayor, tells me the poverty rate is two percentage points higher than the national average, and 80 per cent of inhabitants qualify for social housing. Amiens is ided between disadvantaged north and middle-class south. It was ruled by a communist mayor for 18 years in the 1970s and 1980s.Macron spent less than 17 years in Amiens, Fouré notes. He “went up” to Paris nearly a quarter of a century ago. “People here don’t know him. A lot of people are proud that the president is from Amiens, but that’s it. There has never been a real relationship between him and the city. There is no emotional tie.”On a beautiful spring day, the Élysée Palace feels light years away from dreary Picardy. The top-floor office of a close presidential adviser has a view over the gardens and the Eiffel Tower in the distance.Macron’s entourage is comprised mostly of fervently devoted young men with backgrounds similar to his own. No one at the Élysée, other than the president, can be quoted by name. “Our rule is that no one gets inidual credit for anything,” the adviser explains.The adviser reportedly thought up the slogan used by Macron when Trump pulled out of the Paris accord on climate change, “Make our planet great again!” But he refuses to confirm this. “We work collectively. Everything we do belongs to the president.”The adviser counts a resurgence of French pride as Macron’s greatest achievement so far. “It’s been a long time since the French have been proud to be French, in the eyes of the world,” he says. Though it contradicts my experience in Amiens, the statement rings true. Most people in the professional milieus of Paris adore Macron and are proud of his presidency.A few doors from the president’s office, the adviser lists Macron’s “important victories”: the revision of the labour code and the taxation of capital investments the overhaul of the country’s education system changes to the EU’s posted workers directive ending the giant squat at Notre-Dames-des-Landes and dismantling the nuclear reactor at Fessenheim. The last two issues had festered for decades. “They seemed impossible for any preceding majority,” the adviser says.Macron is doing as much for the disadvantaged as for the rich, the adviser insists. “We have increased basic payments to the poor, the disabled and the elderly. We’re decreasing social charges on lower salaries. The pendulum has swung much more towards the least advantaged than the most privileged.”So why isn’t that message getting through? Why do polls indicate that a majority consider Macron the “president of the rich”?For one reason, the adviser says. “He was an investment banker. What’s more, at Rothschild the most symbolic bank in the world. For many people, that proves his competence. The thing that makes him hated by some is the reason why he is respected by others.”Because Macron worked for four years as an investment banker, “everything he does that is perceived as right-wing or for the rich is blown out of proportion”, the adviser says.“And everything he does for the underprivileged, that would be seen as left-wing, is discounted. It’s a problem of perception.”Opinion polls can be read two ways. An Ifop-Fiducial poll published on April 10th gave Macron a 55 per cent approval rating, high for France, 11 months into a presidency. But a BFM poll published four days later showed that 44 per cent of voters are “disappointed”.Nine years of piano and the rigour of France’s best schools have honed Macron’s powers of concentration. On April 17th, he took questions from MEPs in Strasbourg for three hours, without notes, without so much as jotting down a question – a regular performance for Macron.“He is someone with a great capacity of attention and concentration,” says Monjou. “People who’ve met him often tell me they were struck by the intensity with which he looks at them, as if, for the time they are with him, they are all that matters.”“When you talk to him, it is as if he is downloading your brain,” says a former cabinet minister who sometimes advises Macron.Geraldine Byrne-Nason, now Ireland’s Ambassador to the United Nations, is doubtless the Irish official who knows Macron best. She became friends with the future president when both were “sherpas”, responsible for briefing and accompanying Irish and French leaders to EU summits, between 2012 until 2014. Byrne-Nason represented the taoiseach’s office, Macron the Élysée Palace.“We spent hours and hours in corridors through the night while the heads of state and government were locked in meetings,” Byrne-Nason recalls. “Emmanuel would be one of my first points of repair. If you’re going to be there for seven hours, you want someone interesting to talk to.”Byrne-Nason calls Macron “an insider-outsider” who has mastered the system but is able to regard it with detachment. “He has a healthy disrespect for bureaucracy, and Brussels is the home of process and procedure,” she says. “In that regard, we were kindred spirits. There was a slight impatience with the weight of slow-turning wheels.”Macron was particularly understanding of Irish difficulties during the bailout, Byrne-Nason says. She believes he was responsible for support offered by then president François Hollande.Byrne-Nason sent glowing reports about Macron’s potential to Dublin, long before he became a presidential candidate. Last September, she listened to what she calls his “extraordinary speech in favour of international co-operation and law” at the UN General Assembly. “It was poetic. It was powerful. It lit up the place.” Ireland could have signed off on every word, Byrne-Nason says, calling Macron “a superstar president who generates both respect and influence here amongst the 193 countries of the UN”.If Macron were Irish, he might be a hybrid of President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar: part poetic intellectual, rooted in left-wing Christianity and fascinated by ideas part dynamic young liberal, determined to make the economy flourish.When Christian Monjou was Macron’s teacher at Henri IV, he says Macron talked a lot about the Fabians, the centre-left British intellectuals who founded the London School of Economics. The Fabians believed in “the inevitability of gradualness, the idea that everything that is gradual you won’t be able to go back on,” Monjou says. “It is totally anti-French, with our tradition of revolution, not evolution.“French political life is saturated in ideology,” Monjou continues. “With Macron, there is something you might call empirical or pragmatic. It’s familiar to an Anglo-Saxon, but it stands out in France. I suspect this slightly Anglo-Saxon approach may come from listening to me for three years.”Macron’s adviser stresses he is more than a mere pragmatist who would be content to solve one problem after another. “The two legs of Emmanuel Macron are action and reflection,” he says. “He always does both.”Macron’s en même temps mantra seeks to reconcile irreconcilabables, such as liberalism and social protection. The challenge is most obvious in his self-described “humane but realistic” immigration policy. Measures such as the Collomb circular, which authorises police to search emergency shelters for illegal migrants, have alienated some of Macron’s closest allies.In 1997, Macron’s spiritual father Paul Ricoeur delivered a lecture titled Foreigner Myself. Ricoeur cited Leviticus, about “the stranger that dwelleth with you”, and the Gospel of Matthew, which says: “I was a stranger and you took me in.” Opponents of Macron’s tough immigration policy say he has betrayed Ricoeur’s ideals. The criticism must sting, but Macron believes that unless he calms fears of unlimited migration, extreme right-wing populists will continue to gain ground, in France and across Europe.The necessity of ending the “society of status” in which family background, education and profession determine all aspects of one’s life, “gives coherence to everything we are doing”, says the presidential adviser.Philippe Aghion, who teaches economics at Harvard, the London School of Economics and the Collège de France, has greatly influenced the president’s economic thinking.Contrary to Thomas Piketty, the French author of the best-selling Capital in the 21st Century, Aghion and Macron believe that increasing social mobility, not high taxation, is the most effective way of reducing income inequality.Aghion wants to wean France off its post-second World War reliance on the Keynesian welfare state, in which government spending stimulates demand. He is inspired by John Maynard Keynes’s exact contemporary, the Austrian-born economist and Harvard professor Joseph Schumpeter, who believed that innovation and technical progress are the basis of a prosperous economy.Aghion’s theories underlie Macron’s reform of the French labour code last year, and the ongoing reform of professional training. It is, Aghion admitted in an interview, a liberal economic policy. But, he insists, it is also a social policy.Schumpeter believed in creative destruction, “which means you constantly have new jobs replacing old jobs, new firms replacing old firms”, Aghion says. It’s a hard sell to a French public that craves security and is adverse to change.Aghion advocates Danish-style “flexicurity” that combines labour market flexibility with unemployment benefits and retraining for laid-off workers. “In a nutshell: innovation, social protection and social mobility. That’s the triangle you want to achieve,” he says. Listening to him is like hearing Macron speak.Macron’s parents were left-leaning agnostics who did not baptise their children. At the age of 12, probably under the influence of his surroundings at La Pro, Macron asked to make his First Communion. A black-and-white photograph provided by one of his teachers, Gérard Banc, shows the future president making his profession of faith.Macron’s intellectual affiliation has been with the Christian left, with Ricoeur and Esprit magazine, for which he wrote a half-dozen articles, and whose board he sat on. French media interpreted gestures at Macron’s campaign rallies as signs of mysticism, for example when he asked his followers to “show benevolence”, or ended rallies Christ-like, with outstretched arms. On the night of his election, he concluded his speech in front of IM Pei’s glass pyramid at the Louvre with the words, “I will serve you with love”.During his evening with the Presidential Press Association, I asked Macron if, 28 years after his baptism, he still has faith. Personal belief is a taboo subject in secular France. Embarrassed laughter rippled across the room, but he addressed my question.“I believe in something we don’t see, yes,” Macron said. “I have faith in the generic sense of the term. If one doesn’t believe in one’s lucky star, in good fortune, in one’s country, one doesn’t do what I’m doing. I believe in a form of transcendency.”Following Macron’s April 9th speech to French bishops, leftists and Freemasons accused him of attacking la laicité, which has been France’s official policy of state-enforced secularism since 1905.“We share the confused feeling that the link between church and state has been damaged, and that it is as important to you as it is to me to repair it,” Macron said.\u0026nbsp The purpose of laicité was “certainly not to deny spirituality” he argued. \u0026nbsp“For biographical, personal and intellectual reasons, I have the highest opinion of Catholics.”There is something Jesuitical, indeed monklike, about Macron. Unlike his predecessors, he shows no need to eat, sleep or chase women. Asked what has been the “greatest trial” of being in office, the French president said he has “measured the weight and the solitude and the end of innocence” that come with power.“I do not think it is a trial,” Macron continued. “The French have authorised me to do what I committed to do. One thing is certain. There is no respite, which may explain why I sometimes look pale. I do not feel authorised to enjoy any form of leisure. I take time to reflect. I read and write. But in the times we live in, there is no room for respite. That may be the trial of power, though I don’t live it as such. There is undeniably a form of asceticism.”Macron sees his rise to power as the result of a troubled epoch. “I don’t forget where I come from and why I am here today,” he said. “I am the fruit of a form of brutality in history, of a break-in, because France was unhappy and uneasy. If I forget that for one moment, it will be the beginning of the trial.”"},{"url":null,"title":"us uk and france launch strikes on syria","story":"  April 14, 2018US ambassador to UN says US \u0026lsquolocked and loaded\u0026rsquo if Syrians further use chemical weapons   April 16, 2018Luxembourg meeting condemns \u0026lsquorepeated use\u0026rsquo of chemical weapons by Syrian regime "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3480684.1525202031!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"davis says eu and uk may be unable to resolve border issue before october deal","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBrexit secretary David Davis  giving evidence to the House of Lords EU committee  on  UK withdrawal from the EU. Photograph:  PA WireBritain and the European Union may be unable to resolve the future of the Border before they agree a deal on their future relationship in October, Brexit secretary David Davis has said. Mr Davis told the House of Lords EU committee that the viability of the first of three options for the Border outlined in last December’s joint report depended on whether Britain and the EU would have a comprehensive free trade agreement.“If we have a tariff-free free trade agreement and a light-touch customs agreement that makes Northern Ireland simpler than if we don’t have those things. So it’s all three we want, because truth be told I would consider it not a success if we were falling back on option C,” he said, referring to the so-called “backstop” that would see Northern Ireland remain in regulatory alignment with the EU after Brexit.“I can see why the Irish Government wants it as a guarantee, but we have to have all three. Now ,whether we can do all that by June, I’m not at all sure. But we are certainly aiming to complete it by October.”Mr Davis admitted that the EU had “pushed back” on the British government’s two proposals for a future customs relationship, confirming a report in the Daily  last month. He said EU negotiators did not understand how a “customs partnership” would work, with Britain collecting tariffs on behalf of the EU, and feared that the other proposal could encourage smuggling.Mr Davis will join other senior ministers on Wednesday for a meeting of the cabinet’s Brexit sub-committee that will focus on options for a customs relationship. Brexiteers want Theresa May to take the “customs partnership” off the table because they fear it is unworkable and could lead to Britain remaining indefinitely in the customs union.International trade secretary Liam Fox said on Tuesday that remaining in the customs union after Brexit would be worse than remaining in the EU itself.“If we were in a customs union with the European Union we would have to accept what the EU negotiated in terms of market access to the UK without the UK having a voice. That’s worse than the position in which we found ourselves today in the European Union. I don’t think there is a customs union that could ever be acceptable,” he told the BBC. Downing Street said the government would offer a “robust” response to a House of Lords vote to\u0026nbspgive MPs the power to stop Britain from leaving the EU without a deal, and to order the prime minister back to the negotiating table if they do not like the deal she secures.The Daily Mail on Tuesday described the Lords as a “house of unelected wreckers”, accusing pro-European peers of acting “in cahoots with Brussels” as they sought to derail Brexit.In the House of Commons on Tuesday, a Conservative MP accused the founder of the pro-Brexit Legatum Institute of being a Russian agent. Bob Seely used parliamentary privilege to quote from Monaco security files that identified Christopher Chandler, a New Zealand-born billionaire, as an object of interest.“According to the French security services as recorded by their colleagues in Monaco, and clearly I am confident that these documents are genuine, Mr Chandler is described as having been ‘an object of interest to the DST since 2002 on suspicion of working for the Russian intelligence services’,” Mr Seely said.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph launches next phase words chosen brand campaign","story":"The  has launched the second phase of the Words Chosen Well brand campaign which aims to showcase its award-winning quality journalism and raise brand awareness.The campaign started with a new television advert debuted during the commercial break of Channel 4’s Gogglebox on Friday 20th April. Created by adam\u0026ampeveDDB  in collaboration with The ’s in-house marketing and creative teams, it builds on the success of last year’s campaign with a bigger and bolder creative that utilises important cultural references and leans on some of the most emotive and impactful events of our times, highlighting iconic moments when words have been considered and chosen well.The ’s new campaign seeks to demonstrate the influence and importance of the spoken and written word, and the role that quality journalism plays in providing news, insight and analysis.

Built in 1830, a new top was created in 1969 with large windows, and a partial glass roof, to allow spectators to see the passengers.Col Browne added: The fair weather option, the Ascot Landau, it was selected because it\u0027s a wonderfully bright, small, lovely carriage. Very easy for people to see, the passengers can sit up quite high - so there\u0027s lots of visibility for everybody.It was built in 1883, it\u0027s one of five that we have, most of them are down in Windsor, we always keep one in London for occasions.He explained the Landaus are also used at the end of the annual St George\u0027s Chapel Garter Service to drive members of the royal family up the hill to Windsor Castle, and Harry\u0027s carriage is in pristine condition as it was refurbished last year.Six horses, Windsor Greys, will be included the procession ride.A team of four, Milford Haven, Plymouth and father and son Storm and Tyrone, will pull the Landau and two others - Sir Basil and Londonderry - will be outriders.All have been involved in high profile events before, including the Spanish state visit last year, Royal Ascot, Trooping the Colour, the State Opening of Parliament and the Lord Mayor\u0027s Show. Storm is a veteran of Royal weddings, also working on the streets of London for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in 2011. Prince Edward and Sophie during their Windsor wedding carriage ridePhilip Barnard-Brown, Senior Coachman to the Queen, will ride Milford Haven for the procession and describes him as a “special horse”.He said: “He normally has a lead position because he’s a very quiet horse and you’ll naturally try and put your quietest horses in the lead.“Because it’s going to be a very busy day and very noisy, we always choose our safest, most reliable horses. We tend to go for the older horses that have been around and done it before and we know are reliable.”The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge at their weddingThe Crown Equerry added: We\u0027ve always had two outriders and traditionally they acted to clear the path and herald the arrival of the principal in their carriage.They will be just a short distance in front of the carriage itself and of course in front of them and behind the carriage will be the Household Cavalry travelling escort.Other members of the Royal Family will not join the carriage processionA postilion rider, sat on one of the two lead carriage horses, will drive the coach and another rider will sit behind him on a Windsor Grey in the second row. Two footmen will sit behind the newlyweds at the back of the Landau.State cars from the Royal Mews include Bentleys, Rolls-Royces and Daimlers and they will be used to transport members of the royal family on the day.Royal Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan MarklePrince Harry and Meghan MarklePlease review our commenting policyInquiry into death of Sheku Bayoh dubbed a \u0026#39national disgrace\u0026#39 as family launch case against policeBoy Scouts of America changes its name to welcome girlsIndia becomes one of world\u0026#39s top five defence spenders, amid tensions with China and PakistanUS troops \u0026#39will stay in South Korea\u0026#39 even if peace treaty is signed with NorthFortnite: Battle Royale season 4 skins and Battle Passes - all you need to know about the latest game updateNHS should treat sex addiction as a medical condition, charities sayThis lesser-known Chinese airline is poised to take on the world (and they\u0026#39re offering free upgrades)Chinese Weibo users defend US teen’s cheongsam prom dress as ‘cultural appreciation, not appropriation’  India’s top court orders government to seek foreign help to fix ‘worrying colour change’ at Taj MahalUniversity worker found guilty of murdering his boss before scrawling \u0026#39bully\u0026#39 on her foreheadEurovision: every single UK entry ranked, from worst to bestBritish safari park owner attacked by lion after entering South Africa enclosure in front of touristsGovernment at risk of \u0026#39collapse\u0026#39 as May warned by 60 Tory MPs Brexit customs partnership will sink herChina says Taiwan has \u0026#39an axe to grind\u0026#39, after Beijing accused of using $3bn aid pledge to woo Dominican RepublicThe Split, episode two, recap: All is fair in love and wine for Hannah and her sistersJohn Bercow \u0026#39should consider position\u0026#39 amid bullying claims as Theresa May calls for an investigationDonald Trump dictated letter describing his health as \u0026#39astonishingly excellent\u0026#39, claims president\u0026#39s former doctorGeorge Michael\u0026#39s family asks fans to remove tributes from \u0026#39trampled\u0026#39 Highgate parkComment: It\u0026#39s a crisis for democracy that Manchester has become a one-party Labour state.

It means that she thinks our culture is beautiful.I think she looks stunning. And if Western people are saying that she can\u0027t wear Chinese clothes, does that mean Chinese people can\u0027t wear Western clothing - such as a wedding dress? That would be stupid.Ms Daum responded to the Internet backlash in a Tweet, saying: To everyone causing so much negativity: I mean no disrespect to the Chinese culture.I’m simply showing my appreciation to their culture. I’m not deleting my post because I’ve done nothing but show my love for the culture.The qipao, or cheongsam dress, became hugely popular in China during the 1920s and 1930s, but fell out of favour in the early years of Communist China as it was believed to be \u0027bourgeoise\u0027.It has made a comeback in recent years, with Western celebrities and Peng Liyuan, the wife of Chinese president Xi Jinping, helping to make the dress popular.Meanwhile, US media is reporting that officials at a Catholic high school in a Detroit suburb will require female students to wear “modesty ponchos” at prom if their dresses are too revealing.WJBK-TV reports that some students at Divine Child High School in Dearborn are calling the policy a form of body shaming, according to the AP.The pink and multi-coloured ponchos are on display inside the school with a note saying they will be handed to girls wearing dresses that violate the school’s code.The report doesn’t outline the school’s dress code for the May 12 prom, but says a teacher will check for compliance at the door.Additional reporting by Christine Wei.Please review our commenting policyInquiry into death of Sheku Bayoh dubbed a \u0026#39national disgrace\u0026#39 as family launch case against policeBoy Scouts of America changes its name to welcome girlsIndia becomes one of world\u0026#39s top five defence spenders, amid tensions with China and PakistanUS troops \u0026#39will stay in South Korea\u0026#39 even if peace treaty is signed with NorthFortnite: Battle Royale season 4 skins and Battle Passes - all you need to know about the latest game updatePrince Harry and Meghan Markle pick carriage for Royal Wedding processionNHS should treat sex addiction as a medical condition, charities sayThis lesser-known Chinese airline is poised to take on the world (and they\u0026#39re offering free upgrades) India’s top court orders government to seek foreign help to fix ‘worrying colour change’ at Taj MahalUniversity worker found guilty of murdering his boss before scrawling \u0026#39bully\u0026#39 on her foreheadEurovision: every single UK entry ranked, from worst to bestBritish safari park owner attacked by lion after entering South Africa enclosure in front of touristsGovernment at risk of \u0026#39collapse\u0026#39 as May warned by 60 Tory MPs Brexit customs partnership will sink herChina says Taiwan has \u0026#39an axe to grind\u0026#39, after Beijing accused of using $3bn aid pledge to woo Dominican RepublicThe Split, episode two, recap: All is fair in love and wine for Hannah and her sistersJohn Bercow \u0026#39should consider position\u0026#39 amid bullying claims as Theresa May calls for an investigationDonald Trump dictated letter describing his health as \u0026#39astonishingly excellent\u0026#39, claims president\u0026#39s former doctorGeorge Michael\u0026#39s family asks fans to remove tributes from \u0026#39trampled\u0026#39 Highgate parkComment: It\u0026#39s a crisis for democracy that Manchester has become a one-party Labour state.

Photos of the happy couple are strewn around the walls: Jane and Serge kissing in the back seat of a car on a rainy day in Paris Jane and Serge beaming into the camera on a lazy summer’s day, after a long, languid lunch. Jane looks beautiful, an English rose, the epitome of a carefree era when anything seemed possible. Serge looks incroyable, like a gargoyle or a goblin. No wonder the French press called him l’homme à tête de chou (the man with the head of a cabbage).From 1968 to 1980, Birkin and Gainsbourg were Europe’s most glamorous creative couple. They could scarcely have been less alike. She was young and lovely, health and innocence personified. He was seedy and dishevelled, yet he oozed Gallic élan. They appeared together in movies and fashion shoots, but the thing that made them famous was the song they sang together, “Je T’Aime… Moi Non Plus” (I love you… neither do I).Gasinbourg wrote “Je T’Aime” for Brigitte Bardot, with whom he had a brief romance in 1967. In 1969, he released the song with his new love, Jane Birkin. It was a Succès de Scandale, on account of Birkin’s contribution, in which she simulated the sounds of female arousal (20 years before When Harry Met Sally – quelle horreur!). If you’ve never heard it, it sounds awful – but, remarkably, it was a masterpiece. A conversation between two passionate, nihilistic lovers, it contained poetic pearls like “You are the wave – I am the island”, and Birkin’s heavy breathing, of course.Driving through Oxfordshire, on the road to Blenheim Palace in 1969“Je T’Aime” was condemned by the Vatican and banned from the radio in Britain and several Continental countries. France was a bit more enlightened. The song was played on the radio, but only after 11pm, and you had to be over 21 to buy the record. Even then, it was sold in a plain wrapper, like a porn mag or a blue movie. Naturally, this furore was wonderful exposure. A broadcast ban is fantastic for sales, giving a hit single a rebellious cachet that no amount of advertising can achieve. All these years later, “Je T’Aime” still stands proud in the pantheon of brilliant records banned by the BBC, from “God Save the Queen” by the Sex Pistols to “Relax” by Frankie Goes to Hollywood.  The record reached number one in Britain, and all across the Continent. Serge told Jane that the Pope was their greatest PR man. “He loved it!” she says, remembering Gainsbourg’s reaction to the controversy. He had a terrific appetite for mischief, and he knew no publicity was bad publicity.Jane \u0026amp Serge: Family album by Andrew BirkinJane \u0026amp Serge: Family album by Andrew BirkinJane and Serge kissing in the back seat of a car on a rainy day in Paris 1969 - Andrew Birkin: Serge seemed to know the hidden underside of the photo shoot and, clearly better than me, the readers of Jours de France: nothing too subtle. We looked for the Oxford bus depot, which was deserted at the weekend, and bribed the caretaker to close his eyes while Serge sat in the driver\u0027s seat in the bright red double-decker bus, Jane at his side. Buying him a hot dog was the not-too-subtle but sufficient reward, before setting off for Oxford, a true place of learning.\u0026#131974 - Andrew Birkin: Serge received some good news from his agent... and bad news in a Sunday rag, which quoted him as saying: You\u0027re not my wife, darling... I love my freedom too much! . Black had always been my favourite colour: when I was at school, I had painted my bedroom walls black and I thought about doing the same in this hideous house I had bought in London. Serge stole a march on me by covering his recently purchased house in the Rue de Verneuil in black from floor to ceiling. \u0026#13On the road to Blenheim PalaceSerge entertaining Jane and Régine during a lunch party in 1969Photography by Andrew BirkinJane in 19691977 - Andrew Birkin: Jane had bought an old presbytery in Normandy, somewhere she could impose her own taste rather than always approving Serge\u0027s style. Serge\u0027s love for the countryside was short-lived and after just a few days, he was itching with the idea of returning to Paris... Or at least the idea of reviving himself with a “Marcel Proust” cocktail at the bar in the Grand Hôtel in Cabourg. \u0026#13Serge and Nana in 1977That was nearly 50 years ago, but the memories of that hedonistic era still burn bright, and now Birkin is revisiting that heady époque in a new show called Jane \u0026amp Serge here in Calais. It’s an exhibition of photos of the couple by her brother, Andrew Birkin, taken from the late Sixties to the late Seventies. Andrew is an eminent filmmaker (his biggest hit was his haunting film of Ian McEwan’s novel, The Cement Garden) and he has a director’s eye for drama. Andrew has always been close to Jane and he became close to Gainsbourg too. Consequently, these photos are incredibly intimate. Each frame preserves a particular mood, a unique atmosphere. They not only capture the essence of their relationship but the spirit of their age.Andrew is here too, for the opening of the exhibition, and he takes time out to show me and a few other hacks around. “He was a provocateur,” he says, of Serge. “He was always on.” This isn’t a criticism, merely a statement of fact. Twenty-seven years since Gainsbourg died, of a heart attack, aged just 62, Andrew’s deep affection for the legendary chanteur endures. “That streak of melancholy was one of his most attractive facets.”Half a century later, Jane Birkin is still striking – the same fine features half hidden beneath a cascade of tousled brown hair. The laugh lines around her almond eyes merely add to her allure, and her rich voice is full of joie de vivre. Although she left Gainsbourg in 1980, on account of his escalating alcoholism, they remained friends thereafter, united by the child they had together, the actress and singer Charlotte Gainsbourg, and she speaks of him with fondness, and admiration.Jane in the grounds of Blenheim Palace in 1969 – the archetypal English rose“Andrew was around on all our holidays – and all the rather bad films I did!” she recalls, looking at the photos of her younger self that surround her, reducing her to a pale replica of the image on the wall. “It’s a bit weird. You feel as if you’re dead.” Everyone laughs, but it’s not so funny. Her youthful fame has eclipsed her, leaving her public persona stranded in a time that’s long since passed.She still spends most of her time in France, and today she seems more French than English. Watching her being interviewed by French reporters, speaking fluent French, she seems more natural, more at ease. It looks like an admirable life, from a distance, but she’s had her share of sadness. Kate Barry, her eldest daughter, from her first marriage to the composer John Barry, died in Paris in 2013 after falling from a fourth-floor apartment.Jane left Serge for the French director Jacques Doillon, with whom she had another daughter, the actress and singer-songwriter Lou Doillon. She still sings, and last year she released an album of songs written for her by Serge – he wrote some of his finest songs about her after they’d parted. “Which, for me, are the most beautiful,” she says. “Everything on Baby Alone in Babylone, which was perhaps the best record I ever made.”That was two years after they’d split, and she’d already given birth to Lou, but the aura of their romance lived on in Serge’s songs. “I liked the ones after I left more, perhaps, because they were really about what he was feeling, and I felt it was deeper.” It felt emotional, singing them in front of him after a parting which caused them both such pain.What made him so significant as an artiste, I ask her. “He really rediscovered the French language,” she tells me. “That’s why I think every writer these days is bound to mention his name.” She likens him to Picasso, passing through so many styles. “He never repeated himself.”Jane and Serge in 1977, in the old presbytery that she bought in NormandyLike a true poet, he loved ambiguity. “There were always two meanings, and sometimes a third.” Yet he far preferred to simply call himself a songwriter. “He didn’t want to say he was a poet. He thought that was for Baudelaire and Apollinaire. The people he really appreciated were classical musicians.” He said that songwriting was a minor occupation. She found such modesty refreshing.Time’s up. Jane has another appointment. A French TV crew are waiting. I return to Andrew and his photos. “The problem with photography is that it starts to overwrite your memories of what you didn’t photograph,” he says. I think I know what he means. The more you look at these photos of his sister, the more unreal the real person becomes.Jane Birkin asks Hermès fashion house to rename luxury Birkin bagsSimon Price on Jane Birkin: Jane reignites her flame for SergeJane Birkin: \u0027I was no Lolita,\u0027 says Britain\u0027s BardotHowever Andrew has a very clear memory of his final meeting with Serge Gainsbourg, about six months before he died. “I bought him a 1910 bottle of Absinthe from Sotheby’s.” Andrew went to see him in his home in Paris, and they watched a film together. “He was asleep within five minutes of putting on the video, so I got up, crept out of the black house and into the black street and that was the last time I saw him.”In the end, it was the same old, sad old story. “The main problem with Serge is just that he became an alcoholic, and had no particular interest in stopping himself.” So what was the connection between his sister and the chanteur? I ask him. “Sex,” he says, and everyone laughs, but he then stops and thinks about it. “It was the attraction of opposites, in a way.”Jane \u0026amp Serge is at the Musée des Beaux Arts in Calais (calais.fr) until 4 Novemberor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

However, animals were not the only threat. Kenya was at the time a British colony.During the Mau Mau uprising of the 1950s, white families were fair game to the rebels thanks in no small part to the brutal nature of colonial rule. (In 2011 William Hague expressed “sincere regret” for the thousands who had been detained and tortured.) When Sheldrick was nine months pregnant she survived an ambush by Mau Mau fighters.Chained and tortured: The horror inflicted on India’s elephantsSo when a wild elephant she had mistaken for one of her hand-reared orphans turned on her in 1994, she took it in her stride.“I opened my eyes. I could feel the elephant gently insert her tusks between my body and the rocks,” she wrote in her autobiography, Love, Life and Elephants: An African Love Story, in 2012.“Rather than a desire to kill, I realised that the elephant was actually trying to help me,” she added. “I knew then and there that I had an absolute duty to pass on my intimate knowledge and understanding of Africa’s wild animals and my belonging to Kenya.”Born Daphne Marjorie Jenkins, Sheldrick came from a family of settlers who left rural Scotland for Africa in the mid-1820s. Her great-uncle Will, a successful farmer in South Africa, began the family’s connection with Kenya after meeting governor Sir Charles Eliot. Eliot was offering free land to families prepared to move to his new colony. Among the families that subsequently boarded the boat to Mombasa were Daphne Sheldrick’s great-grandparents.The author’s work on the Ban the Bloody Ivory campaign drew in stars including Joanna Lumley (front, centre) (Rex)The settlers arrived to an uncertain future in a country with none of the comforts of home. They could not move their livestock inland without first swathing them in cloth to foil the tsetse fly. The new railway was notorious for the number of workers eaten by lions during its construction. And the 5,000 acres of virgin bush gifted by the British government were in fact already home to the Masai. After an arduous four-month journey to get there, Sheldrick’s family had to move on again.I knew then and there that I had an absolute duty to pass on my intimate knowledge and understanding of Africa’s wild animals and my belonging to KenyaBy the time Sheldrick was born, third of Bryan and Marjorie Jenkin’s four children, the family was established on a farm in Gilgil in the Great Rift Valley. Marjorie Jenkins was determined to instil in her children a love for the natural world. Family walks included not just the farm dogs but an impala, a waterbuck and Rikki-Tikki-Tavi, a brown-furred dwarf mongoose. At the age of four, Sheldrick was given responsibility for the care of an orphaned infant bushbuck.It was an idyllic upbringing but it was hard to run a European farm among African predators such as lions and leopards. At the same time, the global picture was changing rapidly. With the Second World War reaching Ethiopia, the British government looked to Kenya to feed the troops. Bryan Jenkins was tasked with shooting thousands of wildebeest and zebra in the Southern Game Reserve. He set up a portable biltong factory, assisted by two Italian prisoners of war. It was while camping nearby that six-year-old Sheldrick was woken by lions. Attracted by the smell of meat, they stayed to lick salt from the tarpaulins.The author’s work on the Ban the Bloody Ivory campaign drew in stars including Joanna Lumley (front, centre) (Rex)As soon as she was old enough, Sheldrick, who could speak Swahili, was sent to boarding school. She was a keen student, graduating eighth in her year and winning a university bursary. However, she was already in love with Bill Woodley, a student from her brother’s school, and chose instead to leave full-time education to be with him.Khurshid Drabu: Britain’s first Muslim judgeRemembering Avicii, Swedish superstar of electronic dance musicLeila Abashidze: Georgian actress who became a star of Soviet cinemaJanka Nabay: Musician who brought Sierra Leone’s bubu to the worldIsao Takahata: Japanese animation master who co-founded Studio GhibliAt around the same time, a state of emergency was declared in Kenya after Mau Mau guerrilla fighters, drawn from the Kikuyu, Meru, Embu, Kamba and Masai people, rose up against white colonial rule. The insurgency was put down with shocking brutality by British colonial officials and Kenyan “home guards”. Thousands of civilians were rounded up in mass detention camps and subjected to beatings, sexual assault and even castration, allegedly sanctioned at the highest level. (Finally, in 2013, after a long legal campaign, the British government apologised.)Mau Mau retaliation was equally bloody and Sheldrick’s family did not escape the violence. During a Mau Mau raid on her great-aunt’s farm, five people, including three children, were burned alive. Sheldrick’s grandparents were beaten and left for dead in an alleged Mau Mau robbery. Meanwhile, a worker on the Jenkins’ farm wasted away and died, convinced he was cursed after refusing to kill his employers at the Mau Mau’s behest.The David Sheldrick Trust has been reintroducing orphans back into the wild at Tsavo National Park since 1987 (Rex)In the midst of this unrest, Sheldrick married Woodley, visiting the United Kingdom for the first time on their honeymoon. After their marriage they moved to Tsavo National Park, where they worked as wardens. In January 1955, Bill took the now heavily pregnant Sheldrick back to visit her family in Gilgil. Returning in darkness, they were ambushed. “A terrifyingly loud sound erupted and in the arc of the headlamps we could see crazed, menacing figures, clad in skins, coming towards us in a great swirl of anger and noise. Some were wielding pangas, some were hurling enormous boulders and others were firing at us from point blank range.”Sheldrick continued working into later life (Rex)Bill Woodley saved his wife and unborn daughter, Jill, by driving straight through the Mau Mau attackers. A year later, the capture of Mau Mau leader Dedan Kimathi marked the official end of the “Emergency”, but the rebellion continued underground for almost a decade.The Woodleys survived the ambush but soon after their marriage foundered. Sheldrick, still Mrs Woodley as she then was, had fallen hopelessly in love with her husband’s boss with whom she had much in common. David Sheldrick was a keen naturalist dedicated to ending poaching. During his anti-poaching campaign, more than 25,700lbs of ivory was recovered and in 1959 and he was duly awarded an MBE. Meanwhile, Bill Woodley’s passion for hunting, so much at odds with his role as warden, was beginning to grate. Sheldrick left him for his high-minded superior.Sheldrick married David in 1960. Their family quickly expanded to encompass a variety of furry and feathered orphans, such as Gregory Peck, a buffalo weaver-bird, and Old Spice, a civet cat with a passion for the aftershave that bore his name. Soon after came a human daughter, Angela.We had come to Kenya as children of pioneering families who had lived through difficult times as their parents struggled to farm the land, and when grown had served Britain with distinction in its world warsDavid Sheldrick had already raised two orphaned elephants, Samson and Fatuma. His observations of the pair formed some of the first studies on elephant diet and migration. Daphne Sheldrick took charge of further orphans including one she named Aisha. In an interview, Sheldrick explained: “She came to us as one of the smallest elephants I had ever seen, with soft fuzz and ears as soft and pink as petals. When she arrived, my heart plummeted as we had never been able to save an elephant this young.”The Sheldricks had already discovered that elephants do not thrive on traditional baby formula and after a few days on glucose and watered down cow’s milk, Aisha was wasting away. As a last resort, Sheldrick tried coconut oil. It worked. Aisha began to thrive on Sheldrick’s recipe and the future of many more orphaned elephants was assured.Sheldrick leaves two daughters, four grandchildren, and a huge family of elephants, rhinos and many more (DSWT)By the early Sixties, the Mau Mau Uprising may have been over but the “winds of change”, as referenced in Harold Macmillan’s 1960 speech in South Africa, were blowing across the continent. When it came to Kenya, the British government decided that continuing colonial rule required more force than they were prepared to expend and Kenya was granted independence in 1963. The Duke of Edinburgh presided over the handover to Jomo Kenyatta.They suffer loss and heartbreak on an almost daily basis, they grieve and mourn the loss of loved ones just as deeply as us, but they turn the page to focus on the living, and I try to emulate thatThe change of rule caused much anguish for the white settler families, who, as Sheldrick described, “had come to Kenya as children of pioneering families who had lived through difficult times as their parents struggled to farm the land, and when grown had served Britain with distinction in its world wars. Britain began to turn its back on those people – even the daily BBC programme previously announced as ‘Home News from Britain’ became ‘News From Britain’, a subtle change that did not go unnoticed.”Sheldrick’s husband was among those who struggled to renew his British passport at the time. David Sheldrick put the situation succinctly: “There was no question about me not being British when the Second World War broke out and I was called up to fight for your bloody country.”In 2016 Sheldrick warned that if the ivory trade continued, the African forest elephant could be extinct by 2025 (Rex)The Sheldricks worried that the transition to independence would adversely affect Kenya’s national parks but it was their success in making the park a safe haven for elephants that caused the next problem. The elephant numbers at Tsavo had grown dramatically – from an estimated 5,000 to 15,000 – and the increased competition for food led to the devastation of much of the forest landscape. However, David Sheldrick firmly resisted the idea of an artificial cull and, in time, the more open grasslands created by the elephants’ indiscriminate browsing attracted new species, including antelope and buffalo. The Tsavo lions thrived.Money, corruption, greed and ignorance motivates the evil ivory and rhino horn tradeIn 1976, the parks were finally brought under government control, merging with the Government Game Department. Sheldrick explained that for the park’s “wild inhabitants, especially rhinos and elephants, who became instant targets, it was the death knell”. Shortly afterwards, David Sheldrick was offered a desk job in Nairobi and the family left Tsavo to an uncertain fate.David Sheldrick died that same year. After his death, devastated Sheldrick began to raise funds in his memory to continue the work that meant so much to him.‘Born to be Wild’, narrated by Morgan Freeman, shone a spotlight on the rehabilitation efforts in Kenya (Getty)The first official fundraiser was a film by former warden Simon Trevor. Somali gangs, armed with AK47s, had been gunning down entire Tsavo elephant herds, turning the park into a no-go zone. Trevor’s film on the crisis, Bloody Ivory, came to the attention of President Arap Moi, who agreed to attend the premiere. Alas, Moi was a no-show, but a few months later the Vatican proposed a papal visit to Kenya, during which the pope wished to bless an elephant and a rhino calf. Sheldrick obliged. The logistics were difficult but the publicity was priceless.Sheldrick was named one of the most significant conservationists ever (DSWT)In 1987, the David Sheldrick Memorial appeal became The David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust (DSWT), with a mission statement declaring it “embraces all measures that compliment the conservation, preservation and protection of wildlife”. Over the next 30 years the trust expanded to three sites: the elephant nursery at Sheldrick’s home in Nairobi, and two centres in Tsavo where the orphans were reintroduced into the wild.There was no shortage of infant elephants to be reared. Though President Moi tried to signal an end to the ivory trade by publicly burning Kenya’s stockpile in 1989, the international appetite for ivory remained undiminished. Between 2003 and 2013, the DSWT saw a 500 per cent increase in the number of orphans rescued, driven by demand for ivory from China. In an interview in 2016, Sheldrick lamented that elephants were being killed at a rate of 50 a day, telling Bohotraveller: “Money, corruption, greed and ignorance motivates the evil ivory and rhino horn trade.”UK ivory trade ban a positive step but what next for Africa’s elephantConservationists warn its too early to celebrate elephants\u0027 safetyEurope must choose: elephants or ivoryYoung Kenyans care for nature but are detached from conservation Wildlife conservancy grows cattle feed to fend off droughtFamily of elephant conservation pioneer pledge her legacy will live onSheldrick spread the word about the crisis facing the elephants with numerous television appearances. She published four books, including her autobiography. Meanwhile, her work was recognised all over the world. In 1989, she was appointed MBE. She was awarded an honorary doctorate in veterinary medicine by Glasgow University. In 2001, the Kenyan government awarded her the Moran of the Burning Spear and in 2006 Sheldrick became a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire, “for services to the conservation of wildlife, especially elephants, and to the local community in Kenya”. Her knighthood was the first to be awarded in Kenya since the country’s independence in 1963, something that Sheldrick said “left me dumbfounded but nevertheless extremely proud”. At the time of Sheldrick’s death in April 2018, the DSWT hand-reared more than 200 orphaned elephants, more than 100 of whom were successfully released into the wild. As the trust approached its 40th anniversary last year, Sheldrick told Eluxe magazine: “I have always turned to the elephants for inspiration in the face of adversity. They suffer loss and heartbreak on an almost daily basis, they grieve and mourn the loss of loved ones just as deeply as us, but they turn the page to focus on the living, and I try to emulate that.”As Sheldrick wrote in her autobiography: “Elephants are, indeed, just like us, and in many ways better.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Others were able to log in but, when they did, some or all of their account details had disappeared.Customers have also reported that they could access other people’s accounts, including account numbers, sort codes and transaction histories.TSB apology after customers complain of online banking ‘data breach’​TSB could not say how many people were still locked out of the service or when the problems would be fully resolved.The ongoing IT disaster began with botched upgrade work on Friday, but has developed into one of the worst technology failures to hit a UK retail bank and has left many of TSB’s 1.9 million customers furious.Some said they were falling behind with bill payments.Others said they were worried their money had simply disappeared.Many customers expressed frustration that the bank was not being clear about what had happened.That came after Paul Pester, CEO of TSB, tweeted on Wednesday morning: “Our mobile banking app and online banking are now up and running. Thank you for your patience and for bearing with us.”Our mobile banking app and online banking are now up and running. Thank you for your patience and for bearing with us.MPs demanded answers from TSB on Tuesday. Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury Committee, said: “The reports of unauthorised transactions, access to other customers’ accounts and failures of in-branch services have all the hallmarks of an IT meltdown.“This is yet another addition to the litany of failures of banking IT systems. Potentially, millions of customers could be affected by uncertainty and disruption.“It simply isn’t good enough to expose customers to IT failures, including delays in paying bills and an inability to access their own money.”A spokesperson for the Financial Conduct Authority said on Tuesday that the watchdog was “aware of the issue and liaising with the firm”. A spokesperson for the Information Commissioner’s Office said: “We are aware of a potential data breach in relation to the TSB and are making enquiries.”Mr Pester said on Tuesday that he was “truly sorry” about the problems caused. “We’re still seeing issues with access to our digital services,” he added. “One of the steps we need to take to resolve this is to take our mobile app and online banking down for a few hours.“We did this at around 10.30 this morning and we hope to be back up later this afternoon.”The problems stemmed from a switch to a new online banking system. TSB had rented the technology behind its app and online banking from Lloyds Banking Group since the two companies split. Over the weekend, TSB moved customers to a new platform which experienced some teething problems.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

This crime is complex and a piecemeal approach will not cut it. Police warn modern slaves ‘staffing nail bars across UK’ as Vietnamese gang jailed in landmark case“The government must get a grip on what works and what doesn’t – when things change, it must be sufficiently informed and agile to respond.”Ms Hillier said long waits for officials to make decisions on whether people should be treated as victims of modern slavery was compounding their distress, while monitoring of support services is poor and there are “worrying variations” in the response of local police forces.“Brexit may complicate the picture further and it is critical that government acts swiftly on the concerns set out in our report,” she added.The Modern Slavery Strategy was introduced in 2014 to reduce the prevalence of practices including human trafficking, forced labour, sexual exploitation and domestic servitude.Gang members who used teenager ‘as a commodity’ to deal drugs jailedAnyone can report potential victims to the National Referral Mechanism for their cases to be assessed, but the system is inefficient and leaves slaves waiting for too long to receive help, the Public Accounts Committee said. Care has been contracted out to the Salvation Army for £90m until 2020, but there are no minimum standards, formal inspections or deadlines for when a decision should be made, with the current average standing at 134 days. The committee warned that prevention work was being damaged by slow progress understanding the crime, which is evolving quickly with changing techniques and nationalities involved. MPs attacked the government’s “hands-off approach” to how businesses comply with laws on transparency in supply chains, which were introduced in 2015, saying monitoring was being left to charities, investors and customers themselves.They said the approach was “clearly not working” because only an estimated 30 per cent of businesses required by law to publish a commitment on the issue have done so. There are also extreme variations between the number of modern slaves being reported by the 43 police forces in England and Wales, varying between more than 900 and fewer than 10 since the National Referral Mechanism started in 2009.MPs said the figures suggested some forces were not treating the issue as seriously as others, with only 6 per cent of related crimes recorded in the year to March 2017 leading to charges and dedicated funding running out in a year’s time.Modern Slavery in the UKModern Slavery in the UKNCA has launched a touring photographic exhibition which aims to portray the signs of slavery and exploitation. Entitled ‘Invisible People’, the exhibition will tour the country as part of the National Crime Agency’s campaign to raise awareness of modern slavery and human trafficking.Child trafficking for sexual exploitation\u0026#13Some workers in the farming sector, harvesting grains or root vegetables, tending livestock or fruit picking, are being exploited every day in the UK.\u0026#13Polish or Slovakian men are brought to the UK with the offer of employment and, after arrival, gangmasters seize documents, opening multiple bank and utility accounts in their names – but\u0026#13Labour-intensive sectors like construction, where temporary and irregular work are common, are high-risk sectors for forced labour. With new homes, offices and buildings being constructed or upgraded in great quantity, labour exploitation is the second most common type of modern slavery, after sexual exploitation.\u0026#13In the tough maritime industry young men, often Filipino or Indian, Eastern European or African, are promised a better life, but instead find themselves in a cycle of debt and exploitation.\u0026#13Each year, women from across Eastern Europe and West Africa are lured to the UK by the dream of a better life. Whether by fake migration services or unscrupulous iniduals who befriend and then betray them, women fall into a dark spiral of sexual exploitation and forced, unpaid prostitution, unable to escape.\u0026#13The cannabis industry hides a dark secret in the house next door. Gangs bring young boys to the UK from countries like Vietnam and deliver them to a house where, once in, they won’t be able to leave. Forced to tend cannabis plants that fill specially rigged houses, the boys are often locked in and forced to work, sleep and eat in one confined and dirty room. The chemicals used on the cannabis are poisonous, and often victims don’t know where they are or how to get help if they do escape. The eyes, ears and compassion of the local community are essential.\u0026#13Some workers in the farming sector, harvesting grains or root vegetables, tending livestock or fruit picking, are being exploited every day in the UK.\u0026#13Spot the signs of forced prostitution:\u0026#13Spot the signs of exploitative labour in the maritime sector:\u0026#13Photographer Rory Carnegie, said: “This image communicates utter exhaustion and dejection. We can see how dire his situation is. He has no protective gear on, and we can see the extreme tiredness that leads him to a place of anxiety and distraction, where he doesn’t care about whether he’s operating machinery safely, or putting himself at risk.”The exhibition comprises a series of large, freestanding cubes displaying images capturing snapshots of life within different types of modern slavery - in agriculture, construction, maritime, cannabis farming and food processing, child trafficking for sexual exploitation and forced prostitution.\u0026#13The committee said the Home Office must work with groups including the National Crime Agency, Crown Prosecution Service and independent anti-slavery commissioner to urgently develop a set of practical steps tackling regional gaps.It demanded “immediate action” to enforce rules on transparency in supply chains, potentially including publishing a list of firms who are not complying.MPs called on the Home Office to ensure a reformed referral mechanism is in place by January next year, cut waiting times, bring in standards for victim care and a means of tracking the amount of public money spent.The committee also said better understanding was needed to prevent modern slavery and work must take account of the potential impact of Brexit. Police failure to tackle modern slavery laid bareThe Local Government Association said the National Referral Mechanism could not manage the number of cases, which has almost trebled since 2013, and backed calls for reforms.The chair of its Safer and Stronger Communities Board, Simon Blackburn, said: “These reforms must be backed up with resources. “Councils can play a key role in supporting trafficking victims, but we would like to see the government provide clarity over how local authorities are expected to respond and for these responsibilities to be properly funded.”The Public Accounts Committee report came four months after a separate probe by the National Audit Office found the government’s bid to tackle modern slavery was ineffective, calling its strategy “unclear” and “inadequate”.A previous warning came from HM Inspectorate of Constabulary in October, when the watchdog found police forces were failing to identify victims and leaving perpetrators free to continue to exploit them.The UK is the first country in the world to have dedicated legislation in place to tackle modern slavery and there are more than 600 live modern slavery police operations underway.A Home Office spokesperson said: “The Public Accounts Committee recognises that the UK is ahead of many countries in responding to modern slavery and the government’s Modern Slavery Taskforce will consider its recommendations carefully. “We have recently announced reforms to the National Referral Mechanism to make sure it supports more victims at a quicker pace and we are taking action to eradicate modern slavery from the economy, including requiring large businesses to report on how they are tackling and preventing this crime in their supply chains.”And last April, the Work and Pensions Committee found that “inexcusable” shortcomings in the UK’s modern slavery strategy were leaving victims reduced to destitution while their abusers escaped because they were not adequately supported to testify against them.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

First of all, there isn’t a lot of evidence that signing new free trade agreements would deliver an economic boost anything like enough to compensate for the hit from leaving the EU single market and customs union. The Institute for Fiscal Studies says “simple arithmetic” and “a basic understanding of trade” show the gains from such FTAs are likely to be small.But another problem is that countries aren’t exactly queueing up to do deals with Britain – or where they seem to be, things aren’t as straightforward as they appear.Donald Trump been enthusiastic about a trade deal with the US (AP)Donald Trump has said he wants a “big and exciting” trade deal with the UK, which sounds promising. In reality, however, the price of such a trade deal could be so high as to be unworkable. A previous US-EU attempt at a trade deal, called TTIP, failed after Mr Trump suspended negotiations because it wasn’t favourable enough to the US. But on this side of the Atlantic even that deal was equally controversial because of US stipulations on scaling back welfare and hygiene rules for farm animals, as well as opening up public services like the NHS to US private corporations.With polling showing the public firmly against US foodstuff like chlorinated chicken coming to Britain, any deal likely to be acceptable to Mr Trump would be sure to contain extremely unpopular and controversial elements – particularly if it were to be negotiated at speed.The UK has a huge trade deficit with China, the workshop of the world (Reuters)China’s approach to post-Brexit trade has been cautious, despite multiple visits from senior British politicians to pay their respects and drum up support.The country’s envoy to the EU Zhang Ming has specifically said that China would not open trade negotiations with Britain if the UK did not manage to conclude a withdrawal agreement with the EU – which some Brexiteers are pushing for.President Xi Jinping called for a “golden era” of relations before Britain voted to leave the EU, but enthusiasm has been less obvious since the referendum. Following Britian’s decision to leave Liu Xiaoming, China’s ambassador to the UK, warned Chinese firms operating in the UK they should now take “precautions” – widely interpreted at coded support for the defeated Remain campaign. Japanese car firms have invested heavily in the UK in recent decades (AFPGetty)Japan, which has invested heavily in the UK in recent decades, has been among the most vocally negative about Brexit and explicitly said it would prioritise the EU for trade deals over Britain. The country, which reportedly sees Brexit as an act of “self-harm”, said doing a deal with the EU – which would now not apply to Britain – would be “first and foremost priority” over negotiating anything with the UK, according to its diplomatic minister.Japanese companies are particularly concerned about the UK’s exit from the single market and customs union, which is seen as important for industries like car-making, which rely on frictionless trade set to come to an end under current government plans.Businesspeople from the country who met with Theresa May earlier this year told her openly that they would leave the UK if they could no longer make a profit under the new arrangement.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau with Theresa May in Ottawa (AFPGetty)Canada’s prime minister Justin Trudeau has said he wants a “seamless” trade deal with the UK – aiming to “flip over” a new agreement between Canada and the EU so that it still applies to Britain.This sounds positive, but there are three significant things to bear in mind. The first is that even if this goes well, there would be no gain for Britain – it would merely be replicating an existing trade deal that the UK already benefits from as an EU member.The second is that it may not be as simple as it sounds: little progress has been reported so far on issues like what share of the EU’s quotas belongs to Britain. The third is that Canada is not a huge economy, equal to one of the larger 28 EU member states – its GDP sits roughly between Italy and Spain. British objections to sky-high tariffs on Scotch whisky held back an EU-India trade deal (Getty)Yashvardhan Sinha, India’s high commissioner to Britain, has specifically said it is not in a “rush” to do a trade deal with Britain after Brexit. India, whose economy is set to overtake Britain’s in size over the next few years, has been in trade talks with the EU for a trade deal since 2007.In fact, the country does see Brexit as an opportunity to do a deal – with the EU. Britain has been holding up a trade deal between India and the EU by opposing the more liberal immigration and visa regime sought by the south Asian country’s government. Another sticking point is the sky-high tariffs on Scotch whisky imposed by India, which Britain would not accept as part of a deal.Despite a series of limited commercial agreement already inked between the two countries, both these obstacles would remain to a full UK-India deal after Brexit – indeed Delhi has specifically said it wants visa liberalisation as a condition.British beef producers could face competition (Jo Turner)Mercosur is a South American trade bloc that includes Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay – who must be dealt with collectively for trade deal purposes because they’re in a customs union together.Brazil and Argentina have both expressed an enthusiastic interest in doing a possible deal with the UK – with the most notable outcome a flood of cheap south American beef into UK markets. That means lower prices for UK consumers, though potentially difficult times ahead for British beef producers.The South American bloc is already negotiating a separate trade deal with the EU, having re-launched stalled negotiations in May 2016 as the UK voted for Brexit. A trade deal with Britain might be more simple to conclude than one with the EU, however because the UK has fewer and weaker agricultural interests than most European countries. The EU\u0027s new trade deal with Mexico includes agricultural produce between the two blocs (REUTERS)The EU and Mexico reached an agreement on a trade deal in April of this year, getting rid of practically all tariffs. The deal is currently being finalised into a legal text. Liam Fox has said he wants to roll over this EU trade deal to keep its benefits after Brexit – but as with Canada’s EU deal, the process might not be straightforward, and there has been little reported progress so far.South Korea already has a trade deal with the EU (Alamy Stock Photo)South Korea is in a similar situation to Canada: the EU has a trade deal with the east Asian country already, and Britain wants to roll it over once it leaves to keep the benefits. As with the other countries in a similar situation, this will not be straightforward – but British business have notably raised concerns that South Korea in particular will ask for concessions and favourable terms from the UK to keep continuity. or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

He added: “Without him it would have been a much longer, tougher, process!”China is North Korea’s sole major ally, but trade has declined by about 90 per cent after Beijing implemented economic sanctions due to Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile tests.In March Mr Kim visited China by train, meeting Mr Xi and the pair – according to the state-run China Daily – agreed a plan to develop relations between the two countries, and to address the North’s nuclear programme.The 36-year-old dictator is anticipated to meet Mr Trump at some point in May or early June, though no date has been announced for the encounter the Republican accepted on the spur of the moment earlier this year.On Twitter Mr Trump suggested he was considering the Peace House, on the border between North and South Korea, as the intended location. It is where last week’s summit between Mr Moon and Mr Kim was held.He tweeted: “Numerous countries are being considered for the MEETING, but would Peace HouseFreedom House, on the Border of North \u0026amp South Korea, be a more Representative, Important and Lasting site than a third party country?

Seoul began blaring anti-Pyongyang broadcasts and K-Pop songs via border loudspeakers, and Pyongyang quickly matched the South’s action with its own border broadcasts and launches of balloons carrying anti-South leaflets. Seoul’s announcement came a day after it said Mr Kim had told Mr Moon during the summit that he would shut down his country’s only known nuclear testing site and allow outside experts and journalists to watch the process.Additional reporting by agenciesor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

and it went up to £7.38 from April 1, 2018.The wage increased from £5.60 to £5.90 for 18 to 20-year-olds, and from £4.05 to £4.20 for under 18s.However, apprentices were only entitled to £3.50 if they are under-19 - this increased to £3.70 from April 1, 2018.In April 2018, the minimum wage for 25-year-olds rose from £7.50 to £7.83 an hour.The national limits are legally binding.Anyone who thinks they are not getting the National Living Wage or National Minimum Wage should complain to their employer in the first instance.If this does not get anywhere, the next step is to take the complaint to HMRC who will investigate.Those who are self-employed, voluntary workers, company directors and family members who live in the home of the employer and do household chores do not qualify for either rate.There is no difference in pay for those that live in London compared to elsewhere.The only discrepancy is for people working in agriculture or horticulture.Workers already employed before October 1, 2013 are entitled to the pay set under their contract of employment.This is a voluntary scheme aiming to recognise the actual cost of living, to which 3,000 employers have signed up.Under it, the lowest rate of pay is calculated according to the cost of living in the UK based on the changing cost of a basket of groceries.The amount is set by the charity Living Wage Foundation, and accredited employers include local authorities, NHS trusts, banks, retailers, charities and construction companies.The foundations calculations put the real Living Wage at £8.75 an hour - and £10.20 in London.These rates also apply to over-18s in recognition that young people face the same living costs as everyone else.And while companies are not legally entitled to pay more than the National Living and Minimum Wages, those which have signed up to the real Living Wage scheme have pledged to pay all workers those rates.The rate is calculated every November, and accredited employers are committed to any increases.While theres no legal obligation for your employer to pay you more than the National Living Wage (£7.50 from April 1, 2017), if your company is accredited by the Living Wage Foundation you should be receiving more than that.The foundations head of partnerships Graham Griffiths said anyone concerned can use their online whistleblowing service, and any employer not adhering to the Real Living Wage faced losing its accreditation.Graham said one area where it was challenging to pay the living wage were retail and hospitality but pointed to Ikea, Aldi and Lidl, which have agreed to pay the same rate.The scheme was launched in 2001 by parents in East London, and the foundation was set up in 2011.In 2005 following a growing interest from employers, the Greater London Authority established the Living Wage Unit to calculate what the lowest pay should ideally be.In 2008 Trust for London selected the scheme as a special initiative and made a grant of more than £1million to campaign for it and set up an accreditation scheme for employers.In April 2016 it became the inspiration for the governments higher minimum wage rate, which it rebranded the National Living Wage.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Fizzy drinks today, sausages tomorrow.”He added: “Where will it end? It’s high time the government recognised these people for the cranks that they are and gave them the cold shoulder.”The global livestock industry is said to cause 15 per cent of all global greenhouse emissions.Meat taxes have already been discussed in Germany, Denmark and Sweden. China cut recommended meat consumption by 45 per cent in 2016.Analysts last December warned that “sin taxes” on meat to reduce its impact on climate change and human health looked inevitable.Meat and meat products are almost all exempt from VAT – though the sales tax is charged on restaurant dishes and treats such as sausage rolls heated up in takeaway shops.Reverend Rayner is a Professor at the Nuffield Department of Population Health at Oxford. The official was among a panel hired by the Department of Health last year to assess the impact of the Sugar Tax.Campaigners argued his appointment was “inappropriate” because he once claimed God asked him to push for the levy.Speaking to The Sun, he admitted it could take years for the Government to come round to the idea of slapping a levy on meat.But he said: “It will come.“The Department for Environment doesn’t acknowledge the need to cut down on meat in the diet.Last month the Sun revealed that in 2012, Reverend Rayner said the Almighty was “calling me to work towards the introduction of soft drink taxes in this country”.“In all of this I see a sacred dimesion,” he said.He then removed the blog post - because it was “being used by the food industry” to try and delay the levy.Culture Secretary Matt Hancock was said to be backing the plans. Downing Street originally blocked calls for a ban in August 2016.

She was reported to be building a war chest in the event of the PM being ousted. For Ms Rudd this humiliation is a nightmare.But the simple truth is that she has been toppled because she was simply not up to the job.Misleading parliament over routine targets for deporting illegal immigrants is the least of it.Ms Rudd was already marked with the Black Spot.Her real blunders were the failure to act far quicker on both the Windrush victims and the knife massacre in London.The Home Office is the infamous “political graveyard” which chews ministers up and spits them out.Theresa May is the rarity who not only survived but used it as a springboard.Now the famously cautious PM needs to carry out emergency repairs with flair and imagination. She needs a new Home Secretary today.The right man for the job is Environment supremo Michael Gove.He has rebuilt his reputation, almost destroyed by his assassination of leadership rival Boris Johnson.He is the most articulate heavyweight minister in Cabinet and has proved that he can handle big responsibilities with both flair and courage.But Amber Rudd’s department has smashed the delicate Cabinet balance between Brexiteers and Remainers.It exposes deep divisions within Tory ranks over the roubled negotiations currently under way with Brussels.A handful of Remainers are threatening to defy the government in a critical vote over remaining in the EU customs union.Meanwhile Brexiteers who have remained silent are plotting a leadership coup if Mrs May gives in.The departure of Ms Rudd could explode all of this into open warfare.Will Mrs May risk putting potential rival Michael Gove in one of the really Great Offices of State?Jezza’s empty promise to crack down on anti-Semitism followed Commons applause for tearful Labour MPs as they read out vicious Jew-phobic abuse from JC4PM supporters.The answer to Mrs Merton is that Labour, with a 22 per cent poll lead, expects big things in London on Thursday, perhaps including scalps in Tory crown jewel boroughs Westminster and Wandsworth.JC doesn’t want a row over Jew-baiting to spoil a good night for Labour.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But yesterday he ascended to one of the great offices of state.What makes Javid’s appointment so remarkable is that Theresa May cares about the Home Office — which she was in charge of for six years — more than any other department and she and Javid have not seen eye to eye over the years.If the Prime Minister was at the peak of her powers, he would not be the new Home Secretary.When Theresa May made Amber Rudd Home Secretary, it was on the implicit understanding that she would continue her legacy at the Home Office.Rudd accepted this trade — and swallowed her own doubts about several of Mrs May’s policies.This approach was, ultimately, what did for her. Javid, a far more independent-minded politician, will not repeat that mistake.Indeed, no senior member of the Cabinet offered the job would now be prepared to make the trade that Rudd did back in 2016.Mrs May simply isn’t powerful enough to demand that kind of loyalty any more. Rudd’s departure exposes Mrs May in two ways.First, the firebreak between her and the Windrush scandal has been removed. Any further revelations about what has gone wrong will end up on the Prime Minister’s doorstep.Second, it has shown how Mrs May now has to reach out in even her most senior Cabinet appointments, promoting those who have clashed with her in the past.When the political Cabinet met for the first time after Mrs May’s Election disaster last year, Javid was ABSOLUTELY BRUTAL in setting out what was wrong with the way she and her team had run Downing Street.The Prime Minister was left in no doubt as to Javid’s frustration with how her team had undermined him.But the reason why he was briefed against is fascinating, given his new job.Javid’s offence was not to kowtow to Mrs May.At the height of the May ascendancy, when she was the most popular Prime Minister since polling records began, most ministers went along with whatever she wanted, whether they agreed with it or not. Javid did not.He argued ferociously against what he saw as her anti-business proposals.He fought particularly hard against her desire for tests for foreign takeovers of British companies.In meetings he sided with Chancellor Philip Hammond in arguing that Britain shouldn’t become like France, a country where the government stopped foreigners buying a yoghurt-making company on national interest grounds.Mrs May now finds herself presiding over a Cabinet where ministers know they can push their own positions with little consequence.So Jeremy Hunt and Gavin Williamson have both campaigned publicly for more money for health and defence respectively.Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has openly set out the kind of Brexit he wants, unafraid to get ahead of the Prime Minister’s position.David Davis, the Brexit Secretary, is now letting it be known what the differences are between his approach and that of the Prime Minister’s chief adviser on the negotiations, Olly Robbins.If Javid was prepared to stand up to Mrs May at the height of her powers, what will he do now?He certainly won’t be her patsy at the Home Office. He’ll be determined to put his own stamp on the department.A more ruthless politician than Amber Rudd, he won’t feel any compunction about breaking from the Prime Minister’s Home Office legacy where necessary.Why, then, has Mrs May appointed him?Well, I understand her initial instinct was to consider Karen Bradley, the Northern Ireland Secretary, for the job.Bradley is a May loyalist: She was one of her junior ministers at the Home Office, an enthusiastic backer of her leadership bid and is her most reliable ally in the Brexit inner Cabinet.However, senior figures at No10 persuaded the Prime Minister that appointing Bradley would look like she was circling the wagons — that it would project an image of weakness, not strength.With a growing feeling among the Cabinet that Mrs May has retreated into the Downing Street bunker, listening more and more to officials such as Olly Robbins and less and less to ministers, appointing a cipher to be Home Secretary would have caused dangerous levels of anger and resentment. Mrs May, to her credit, listened and the decision to appoint Javid was made.His instincts on immigration are different from Mrs May’s.He doesn’t regard it as a numbers game and is one of the Cabinet ministers most privately sceptical of the PM’s aim to reduce immigration to the tens of thousands.If Mrs May was in a stronger position, she would have appointed someone more prepared to defer to her views on this subject than him.Javid will be his own man as Home Secretary, not the Prime Minister’s. Mrs May, who knows the Home Office so well, will find that hard to take at times.But his appointment is a recognition that she isn’t any more in a position to dictate to her senior ministers.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But in my view, the Appeal Court was wrong.As a lifelong campaigner for LGBT rights, and as someone with gay friends in Northern Ireland who want to marry, I obviously strongly disagree with Ashers’ opposition to marriage equality.But in a free society neither they, nor anyone else, should be compelled by law to promote an idea they object to.These bakers didn’t turn away their gay customer – they gladly agreed to make Gareth a cake but declined to decorate it with the pro-gay marriage wording he wanted.As much as I deplore their opposition to marriage equality, Ashers should not be forced to promote same-sex marriage, given that it goes against their religious beliefs - nor should they be obliged to endorse a LGBT equality movement they do not agree with.This case doesn’t just affect the LGBT community it has wider, dangerous implications for the whole of Britain.If the Supreme Court insists that the bakery should be required to promote a pro-gay rights message that they find objectionable, this would presumably also mean that a Jewish publisher could be obliged to print a book that propagates Holocaust denial.Likewise, Muslim publishers (who believe that the Islamic prophet must never be depicted in art or drawings) could be legally pressured, against their will, to print the Danish cartoons of Mohammed that Muslims find deeply offensive.It could also encourage far right extremists to demand that businesses facilitate the promotion of their anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim opinions.Although most Christians in Britain now support same-sex civil marriage in register offices, the McArthur family, which owns Ashers bakery, does not.They say their faith requires them to oppose gay marriage and anything that endorses it.Using the law to force Ashers and others to aid the dissemination of ideas that conflict with their conscience sets a dangerous, authoritarian precedent.The equality laws invoked in this case are intended to protect people - not ideas - against discrimination.A business providing a public service, such as a bakery, has a legal duty to do so without discrimination based on a person’s race, gender, disability, faith, age, sexuality and so on. That is right and proper.But Ashers did not discriminate against the customer, Gareth Lee, because he is gay.His sexual orientation was not an issue – it is the message he wanted on the icing that is at the heart of this sticky moral dilemma.The logical consequence of the Appeal Court’s judgement against Ashers is that businesses cannot lawfully refuse a customer’s request to propagate a message, even if it is sexist, xenophobic or anti-gay - and even if the business owners have a conscientious objection to it.This case is different from the Christian B\u0026ampB owners who refused to accommodate a same-sex couple or the town hall registrar who refused to perform a gay civil partnership.Both were offering a public service but refused to provide that service to LGBT people. The courts found that they had discriminated unlawfully.Their refusals involved direct discrimination against people because they were gay.If the law rules against the bakery it will undermine the principle of freedom of expression, which includes the right to not support ideas you disagree with.Just reverse the roles and imagine that an anti-gay rights campaigner had asked for a cake with a homophobic slogan on it.I do not believe that a gay baker, or any baker, should be legally forced to decorate a cake with a message against LGBT equality.Discrimination against people is always wrong and is rightly unlawful.But in a democracy, it’s vital that people should be free to say no when asked to spread an idea they dont agree with.If they cant, the implications are frankly terrifying.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And this is true across the animal kingdom - its not limited to primates - and humans do the same thing.When we feel powerless we do exactly the opposite.We close up and make ourselves small.But its not just about projecting power over other people - Amy says we can fake it till we make it and convince ourselves that we are more confident and dominant just by consciously adopting a bold power stance.When you pretend to be powerful, you are more likely to actually feel powerful, she explains.Powerful people tend to be more assertive, confident and optimistic, and they take more risks.The body can shape the mind. In her own research, Amy has taken groups of people and asked them to adopt high or low-power poses, without telling them why.The famous legs-spread Tory stance is an example of a high-power pose, while low-power poses could include seated positions with the limbs tucked in.After two minutes in this pose, subjects were asked to play a gambling game, and the choices of the high-power and low-power groups were compared.Cuddy found that 85 per cent of the people primed by just two minutes in a power pose were prepared to take risks, while just 60 per cent of the low-power group took the same risks.By swabbing the mouth before and after a two-minute pose, researchers also found that testosterone, the male sex hormone associated with physical strength, increases by 20 per cent after adopting a high-power pose.This is true of both men and women, meaning anyone can gain a rush of masculine power just by standing with your legs spread.And on the flip side, testosterone levels tend to dip by around 10 per cent after two minutes spent in a low-power pose.Meanwhile, cortisol levels, which are associated with stress, decrease after a few minutes in a dominant pose, and rise after taking a cowering, submissive pose.In another test, Cuddy put a group of people through a mock job interview, with half of the group spending a few minutes in a power pose before they went in, and the other half adopting a low-power pose while waiting for the interview to start.She found that the people who had prepared with a power pose were more likely to get positive feedback from the test interview - suggesting that power stances can be useful to boost your own confidence, as well as to project your confidence to the world.By taking an exaggerated Javid-style power stance (sometimes dubbed the Wonder Woman pose) before you go into a meeting or give a speech you can improve your own confidence and presence.It can also make you come across as more comfortable, passionate and authentic - which explains why its so popular among big-name politicians.However, Cuddy explains that youre not necessarily meant to strike this exaggerated power pose while youre delivering a big speech - as Tory ministers are prone to doing.Its more something which you should do for yourself, in private, to gee yourself up before a big event.As Cuddy says: For two minutes before you go into a high-stress situation, try doing this: in an elevator, in a bathroom stall or at your desk, behind closed doors.Configure your brain to do the best in that situation and get your testosterone up.Of course, you dont have to be a government minister to benefit from this psychological boost - anyone can try a few minutes of power posing before a stressful or intimidating event.Just take a moment to privately adopt a big, space-hogging Alpha pose, and youll find that youre that bit more calm and composed when it comes to crunch time.Cuddy says: Tiny tweaks can lead to big changes. You dont just fake it till you make it, you can actually fake it until you become it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They told her that I was wanted by the Home Office for deportation.“She told me that she had to suspend me because they had told her that that they could be prosecuted and fined if they kept me on the books.”It then took him several days to get through to the Home Office - leaving him unable to work during that time.He said that when he got through: “I explained the situation.I was hysterical. I told him that the idea of me being deported to Uganda was ridiculous.“I was passed on to a manager who said that they had no idea how or why it had happened.”Amber Rudd resigned as Home Secretary on Sunday night in the wake of the Windrush generation crisis.Today it was claimed that up to 7,000 foreign students may have been wrongly accused of cheating and kicked out of Britain.A spokesman for the Home Office said: “Mr Herbert was sent a letter in May 2015 incorrectly warning that he was the subject of enforcement action.“When the mistake was identified in October 2015, we wrote to Mr Herbert to acknowledge the error and apologise.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/nintchdbpict0003294979392.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"weird wacky small parties local elections 2018","story":"Thousands of council seats are up for grabs on Thursday, with Labour set to make gains in the capital, and the Tories elsewhere in the leafy suburbs.And while Jeremy Corbyns anti-Semitism problems could cost him dearly, Theresa Mays just lost her close ally the Home Secretary Amber Rudd and is in a fight with her Brexiteer MPs over the Customs Union.Theres all to play for as the polls open at 7am tomorrow morning.But if youre growing tired of red vs blue, and dont fancy the yellows or greens either, dont worry.Theres plenty of other weird, wonderful and wacky parties to put your cross next to - if thats what takes your fancy. Yes, they are still going - but unfortunately with six candidates across the UK.Known for their huge rossettes, mad outfits and nutty nature, the Loonys have been a feature of British politics for years.Previous policies have included raising cash for the police by selling castles to the French, getting tax payers to receive Nectar points from HMRC and banning all leeks from the Welsh Assembly canteen.Upon the election of Jeremy Corbyn in 2015 they came up with a bright new policy - handing him over to the Argentinians.But just a few months later the joke party accused him of stealing THEIR policies, when Jez announced plans for an extra bank holiday. The man who once challenged Nigel Farage to a duel, Polish Prince John Zylinski, has set up his own party.The property tycoon, who also has a taste for ballet dancing, said he wanted to give the Polish community in Britain a voice.Party policies included calling for a new criminal offence for hate crimes to do with Brexit, and a memorial in Hyde Park to honour Polish pilots in World War II. These guys say their mighty shire has been left behind by Westminster and want to go it alone and become a devolved state.They promise a Yorkshire Parliament to speak up for their own area, and will promote the areass businesses on the world stage. The party was only forged in January this year but is already putting up candidates this week.It was created by two-time Ukip leadership candidate John Rees Evans, who is most famous for once claiming that a gay donkey raped his horse.The partys logo even features a donkey too. The party claims it is the the first time a radical, Marxist-Leninist working class organisation has stood in elections of any form in many years - and if thats not reason to break out your little pencil, we dont know what is.They call society a dictatorship is an evil which must be overthrown, and the workers must become masters of British society.Snubbing other socialist parties, they claim to apply Marxist science to all of their work, and they are not scared to tell it how it is.You can probably can only vote for them in Birmingham, however. Shame. New anti-Brexit party Renew officially kicked off in February, but the official launch turned out to be a total flop.Inspired by French President Emmanuel Macron, who swept to victory with his movement En Marche! in 2017, the new grouping wants to convince MPs to vote down Theresa Mays Brexit deal.Just a handful of people showed up though - even though they claimed to be able to field around 200 candidates for this weeks vote.And to make matters worse, one of the three leaders walked out part-way through the press conference - reportedly to do a media interview.The party opposes Brexit and will fight to reverse it. Founded in 1999 they campaign against same sex marriage and abortion - as part of trying to live by the followings of Jesus.Leader Sidney Cordle hit the headlines back in 2014 when he suggested that storms in the UK could have been caused by Gods anger to gay marriage.But they did campaign in 2015 for all married couples to get a £10,000 grant when they tied the knot. And dont forget there are many hundreds of independent candidates running across Britain, free of any political allegiances whatsoever.Not bound by party politics or in-fighting, independents can vote how they want.But its harder to get things done in council unless you can work with other people, as party folk will always stick together.The 2018 local elections are taking place on Thursday May 3 - polls open at 7am and close at 10pm, although if there’s a queue at the polling station you can still vote after 10 as long as you arrived before the deadline.Around 150 councils are holding elections, with a total of 4,370 seats up for grabs.Most of the local elections are focused in urban areas - Greater London, Greater Manchester, the Newcastle area, the Leeds region, and the West Midlands.A number of smaller cities and towns such as Cambridge, Hull, Milton Keynes, Oxford, Plymouth, Reading and Southampton are also holding council elections.And directly elected mayors will be chosen in four London boroughs and Watford.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She made the mistake of posting pictures of herself wearing a red silk Chinese dress to her high school prom.One twitter-warrior complained: My culture is NOT your goddamn prom dress. Another asked What’s the theme of your life? Ignorant”?And it was only a matter of time before Keziah was branded with the R-word! One troll asked, Was the theme of prom casual racism?Evidently, for social justice warriors, wearing clothes or costumes from another culture constitutes a crime that goes by the name of cultural appropriation.In recent times universities have become the hot-bed of the crusade against cultural appropriation.As a professor who has worked universities for many decades, I was taken aback by the speed with which a tiny group of cultural crusaders have succeed in gaining power over campus life.The rhetoric of cultural appropriation plays an important role in the performance of outrage. And everybody is at it.In some universities guidance is offered to students about what costumes they can and cannot wear on Halloween.Forget about organising a Latino themed party. On both sides of the Atlantic the wearing of sombreros by university students has been condemned as a cultural crime against Mexico.At one university, yoga classes were suspended because it might cause offence to Indians. A campaigner helpfully offered to change the title of the course to mindful stretching.Recently Oxford university decided to cancel a cannabis themed party amid concerns about cultural appropriation.Critics of this party encouraging guests to dress as pop-icons like Snoop Dogg or Shaggy claimed that the event would cause offence to minority students.Last month, students at Bristol University, who hosted a 21st birthday party themed A night at the Maharaja’s Palace, were denounced for committing a cultural crime. Critics were particularly galled by the sight of European students wearing glamorous Indian costumes.In recent years celebrities have become a favourite target of the culture police.White models and actresses, including Kim Kardashian, who wear their hair in cornrows are slammed for exploiting black culture.Iggy Azalea the Australian singer was attacked for rapping with a blaccent. Selina Gomez was crucified for wearing a bindi. Bruno Mars was accused of stealing black music.All celebrities – not just white – risk being accused of cultural appropriation.No sooner did Beyoncé appear portraying a Bollywood actress in Coldplay’s video Hymn for the Weekend, before the all too readily outraged social media warriors accused her of offending Indian culture.So what’s going on?Until recently people were delighted when those from another culture adopted their tastes and habits.Most civilisations - such as the Greeks, the Romans – praised foreigners who adopted their mode of dress, fashion, eating habits and customs.Throughout most of history the act of cultural appropriation was associated with enlightenment and progress.No one regarded hairstyles, costumes, music or indeed most cultural artefact as the sacred property of a chosen people.A civilised society is open to different cultural influences and is ready to share its own culture with others.Sadly, current crusade against appropriation turns every form of cultural interaction into a potential site for conflict.Even food has become the target of the culture police. Students no longer simply moan about the quality of food dished out in their canteens.At Pembroke College in Cambridge University, students condemned their institution for serving “culturally insensitive food” with “inauthentic combinations of ingredients”.Elsewhere complaints have been made about cooking fried chicken, Vietnamese sandwiches and sushi in a culturally inappropriate manner.Unwittingly the crusade against cultural appropriation serves to undermine the genuine multicultural impulses in our society.The policing of culture turns different cultural experience into no-go areas.Its ultimate objective is to build cultural fences and distance different people and ethnic groups from one another.Worse still, the policing of cultures creates a climate where the free and open attitude towards how people live their lives, decide what clothes they wear or what kind of hair-style they adopt becomes a highly charged political issue.If allowed to go unchecked, this horrible crusade will lead to cultural segregation.It will create a climate of hostility and suspicion were conflicts over who gets to decide what you can eat or wear becomes the new normal.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I was the sort of person who would run up six flights of stairs at work as a hospital pharmacy assistant, instead of waiting for the lift.“But I noticed my energy levels were beginning to go down and down. I never seemed to recover from the virus. “I could only just manage to walk up one flight of stairs, let alone run. “I was constantly exhausted and lethargic.“I was signed off work for two weeks, then I tried to go back but after a month but I was barely able to function. “One weekend I got into bed on a Friday evening after work and basically didn’t get up again.”Speaking to The Suns Putting it Right team, who are always keen to help readers going through difficult times, Connor explained how three months after he first fell ill, doctors diagnosed ME – a chronic illness which causes exhaustion and muscle and joint pain. Aged just 19 Connor found himself bedbound, living in a hospital bed in his mum’s front room. He had to give up his job and withdrew completely from football.He said: “I was devastated, it was an awful time. “I became very depressed, and except for physio appointments I didn’t leave the house for two years. I missed football more than I can say.”Medics hoped former right back Connor’s symptoms would improve within 12 months, but instead he lost the use of his legs, and was told he would never play football again. “Hearing that was the worst moment of my life, he says.“When I tried to walk, pain would shoot up my feet and my legs making it unbearable. That’s still the case now and I use a wheelchair most of the time. Determined to fight his illness, Connor raided his savings and moved out of his mum’s house and now lives alone in Dumfries. He initially had carers to help him three times a day but asked them to stop coming as he battled to regain his independence.In 2014, Connor was asked if he would return to coach the Heston Rovers junior team – who he had worked with before his illness – as their previous coach had left.And it was an opportunity he felt he couldnt turn down - even though he would have to coach from the sidelines, which he often does on his knees.Connor says: “I had barely left the house in two years, except for hospital appointments. But I was determined to try to get back to doing what I loved.“At first, I started by assisting just one coaching session a week which left me exhausted, then built it up to two sessions - and now I manage the team. “It’s been the best decision I’ve ever made, the lads mean the world to me.“At first I was worried how they would take to me, they were all aged around 12 when I returned. “Before I left I could show them specific drills or set pieces and I thought they might think a coach stuck on the sidelines, not even able to kick a ball, would be useless.”Instead, Connor worked hard on learning how to explain the drills in detail, and he gets out of his wheelchair and on to his knees at the side of the pitch to better connect with the team.He said: “They were all brilliant. Without these boys I would still be stuck at home in bed. “They have given me the motivation to make something of my life again.“I’m not afraid to make jokes about myself and now they do too, we all have a good laugh together.“The lads are happy to fetch all the balls, cones and the goals to set up training and then put all the equipment away again at the end of the session as they know I can’t manage that. “They are brilliant.”And while Connor credits the team with helping him rebuild his life, the admiration is mutual.Hamish Bremner, 16 is a member of Connor’s 20-strong U17 junior squad, who began playing with the team aged six. He says: “Connor has inspired us to keep playing football. “Some of us might have given up a few years ago if it wasn’t for him.“He has kept us going, he’s like a brother.”Managing coaching sessions and attending matches with the team every weekend leaves Connor exhausted, and he needs at least two days in bed at home to recover. But for him the sacrifice is more than worth it. When The Sun learned of Connor’s commitment to his team and how the boys are helping his recovery, we wanted to do something for them all. This season is Connor’s last with the team before the boys graduate to the senior level. The season has gone better than they expected. With three games left to play, they’ll finish in the top half of the league and one player’s clocked up 20 goals after recently coming back from a broken ankle.But while their performance has been strong, their appearance has been on Connor’s mind.The lads have all outgrown their strips and despite their coach’s best efforts to raise some cash to buy new ones, there’s just not enough cash in kitty. So The Sun decided to Put It Right and reward them all for dedication to each other and Connor’s recovery by making them look the part.So we sent our team up to Dumfries to join the lads at a breezy evening training session at the Heston Rovers training pitch, at the ground they share with Scottish Championship side Queen of the South. Seeing the boys in action as Connor energetically coached them from the sidelines on his knees was inspirational stuff. And it’s not just us who are impressed. Once the session came to its end and we headed back to the changing rooms to hand out the new gear - everything from shirts, shorts and socks to training tops - to the delighted players and their proud coach, someone very special wanted to convey a message to the whole team.Unable to be there in person, the voice of Scotland head coach Alex McLeish rang out as assistant coach Garry Duff presented Connor and boys with the team’s new kit.He said: “I’ve heard about all the incredible work you do for Heston Rovers. That’s why we’d like to give something back by providing you and the boys with a new set of strips you’ve been waiting for for so long.”Connor, a Queen of the South and Celtic fan, said: “It was amazing. I’m a big Scotland supporter and I used to go to all their home matches so it was incredible to hear from him.“And the lads look a million dollars. They are thrilled with their new kit and say it makes them feel like professionals. They were all desperate to put it on as soon as they received it.”Looking forward, Connor is hopeful that the lads will progress to the senior team, and he is keen to carry on his coaching journey.He says: “Getting back into work is my biggest goal. I’ve achieved my level C coaching certificate and I’d love to continue to become a professional coach, but I’ll need to see how my health is and how I could do it financially, as the training is very expensive.“I’ve also been approached to  start coaching a new junior team next year.“But whatever happens I’ll still be there watching the lads play every Saturday. It’s like having a whole team of little brothers.”Do you know someone who either needs our help or a reward for going above and beyond?Nominate them now by filling in the form below.For the chance to be featured in the next instalment of our Putting it Right campaign, tell us what makes them so special to you, or your community, and what we can do to help. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Margaret Thatcher sent two aircraft carriers – HMS Hermes and HMS Invincible – to help take back the Falklands in 1982.They were accompanied by an array of British destroyers, frigates and subs. A new £3.5 billion HMS Queen Elizabeth carrier is nearing the end of its trials and a second HMS Prince of Wales is still under construction.But critics claim at least ten more escort ships are also needed. Challenged yesterday, Sir Mark signalled the intention was only ever to use both carriers as part of an international taskforce when they are operational.Speaking to MPs on the cross-party Defence Committee, he said: “We will see what happens in the circumstances but that is part of the thinking about the use of the carriers“It is projecting them as a British sovereign capability but one that will almost inevitably - I would actually say inevitably - be used in a context of allied operations of some kind if used in a contested environment.”Lord West said it was clear the Government need to “put its money where its mouth is”. “I have always said we should have 30 escorts – indeed that number came out of the Strategic Defence Review in 1998. We have 19.”He stormed: “There may well be an occasion where we have to do something on our own. We would cobble together whatever taskforce we could. But we haven’t spent enough on escorts.”Downing Street last night insisted that Britain’s Navy did have enough ships.A spokesman said: “We are clear that our aircraft carriers are a sovereign capability and that we have the ships to allow them to deploy independently.“What the National Security Adviser was saying was that we are a member of Nato and have close defence relationships with allies and so such a scenario is unlikely.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The second is an attempt by MPs and peers — regardless of what ministers decide — to impose on the Government the very solution Theresa May has already rejected: they want Britain to form a customs union with the European Union.At first, this might sound appealing. It would mean no tariffs on goods traded between Britain and the EU, no routine customs checks at the border, and less hassle for firms doing business in Europe. But there are significant downsides. We would stay tied to the EU, because a customs union would mean having to sign up to European rules and regulations, over which we would have no say.And we would be unable to sign our own trade agreements with other countries, so we would not make the most of one of Brexit’s key advantages.But a customs union with the EU — when we are no longer members of the EU — brings an even bigger problem.It would allow the European Commission, in its own negotiations, to give away trading access to Britain without getting the same access to other countries for our firms.This is what they do to ­Turkey, which is the only big country to agree even a partial customs union with Europe. The Turks are not allowed to negotiate trade agreements with other countries unless the EU has reached its own deal first.European negotiators surrender access to the Turkish ­market, but do not even try to win market access for Turkish companies. When Turkey tries to conclude its own deals, it has nothing to rely on but the generosity of the other side.Other than Turkey, the only country outside the EU to form a customs union with it is Monaco: whose population would fill less than half of Wembley ­Stadium.Not even countries like Switzerland, with its close relationship with the EU, and Norway, which is a member of the EU’s single market, are in a customs union with the EU.This is because they know what a bad deal it would be for them.It would be a bad deal for Britain, too. And as ministers have always said, “no deal is better than a bad deal.” They need, therefore, to face down the rebels in Parliament, and tell Brussels we do not seek a customs union.To do that, the Government first needs to decide its own preferred customs policy. So far, ministers have floated two proposals. Both would run alongside a free trade agreement, which would guarantee zero tariffs and mutual recognition of standards for trade between Britain and Europe.The first proposal is a “highly streamlined customs arrangement”, which would involve some customs checks between Britain and the EU, but use technology and policy solutions to make trade as smooth as possible.The second is a “new customs partnership”, which would see Britain effectively act as the EU’s external border, running dual customs checks for goods bound for Britain and the EU.This second proposal was a creative way to reimagine the way customs checks operate. But after months of scrutiny, it seems unlikely to work. The EU has dismissed it as impossible, and it involves significant risks for Britain.It would almost certainly require “full regulatory alignment” with the EU, meaning that after Brexit we could not change our laws and regulations in a long list of ways. It would create a bureaucratic burden on businesses and some may choose to use higher EU tariffs, or avoid importing and exporting altogether.And, because of the need for alignment with EU regulations and the complexity of dual customs checks, it would be much harder to negotiate trade deals with other countries.So today, when Theresa May chairs her Brexit Cabinet Committee meeting, she should lead ministers to a clear decision about the Government’s favoured customs policy.That decision should be to reject the “new customs partnership” and pursue instead the Government’s own alternative proposal: its “highly streamlined customs arrangement”.As politicians and customs experts from around Europe have said, this approach is not only workable but desirable.As Bertie Ahern, the former Irish prime minister, says, it would help avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland. And it would minimise bureaucracy and limit new barriers to trade with Europe. But it would also guarantee Britain could pursue an independent trade policy and strike trade agreements with the world’s fastest- growing economies.If we are still in a customs union, however, and unable to adopt an independent trade policy, many will conclude that we have not truly left the EU. And that will have enormous political consequences.So rebel Conservative MPs need to be careful what they wish for. A partial Brexit would almost certainly see the next election fought on a need to “finish the job”. It would see the future of the Conservative Party dominated by Britain’s relationship with the EU.  And it would surely mean Theresa May’s successor will be an advocate of a clean break.That is surely not what Remainers want. For Britain to make the most of Brexit, for our new relationship with Europe to be sustainable, and for the Tories to focus on vital economic and social reforms, Brexit really must mean Brexit — ministers and MPs must reject the customs union.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I like the word prison because slavery goes too direct to the idea of blacks.It is like slavery, holocaust. Holocaust, is Jews, and slavery is blacks. So prison is something that unites us as one race.Black and whites, one race. It is like we are one with the human race, we are human beings and stuff.TMZ reporter Van Lathan hit back at Kanye, saying: I think what youre doing right now is actually the absence of thought.Youre entitled to believe whatever you want but there is fact and real world, real life consequence behind everything you just said.And while you are making music and being an artist and living the life that youve earned by being a genius, the rest of us in society have to deal with these threats to our lives.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I carried her coffin at her funeral but we were told there was very little left of her.It was sickening.“It infuriates me that Reed has got off so lightly.”Donna, who now lives in Bradford, said she looked up to Vicky and idolised her as children. They were inseparable growing up.She said: “As we got older, we’d go out together and we became such good friends.“Vicky had a very troubled up-bringing and she had her problems. But she had a heart of gold.”Donna, from Preston, added that Vicky had struggled after her husband Steve’s death from an epileptic fit in 2013 – and met Andrew a year later.She said: “She confided in me that they were arguing a lot and I was worried about her.“She said he wasn’t treating her very well. She was quite vulnerable and I wish now, looking back, I had done more to try to talk her into leaving him, there and then.”One week before she went missing, in October 2015, Vicky called Donna and asked if she could go and live with her.“I blame myself, because she was supposed to come and live with me she was days away from a new start. Maybe I could have saved her.”Donna was the last person to speak to her and the last known person to have any contact with her.She said: “Vicky told me she’d had enough of Andrew. We made plans for her to come and live with me. I was looking forward to it, and I knew she’d be much happier if she was single again.”Donna then didn’t hear from Vicky for a fortnight – and became increasingly worried about her whereabouts.“I began to worry I asked around and nobody knew where she was. I called the police but they didn’t seem to take it seriously they went to the house but couldn’t find her.”Police eventually launched an appeal but the case seemed to make no progress.Donna says: “Vicky had vanished into thin air. We couldn’t work it out. I was so worried about her as time went on, I knew she had to be dead. It was the only explanation.”In January 2017, Vicky’s body was found in a cupboard at her home and Reade was arrested on suspicion of murder.Donna says: “I was preparing myself that she was dead. But I could never have been prepared for what had happened to her.In June last year, Andrew Colin Reade, 43, pleaded guilty to concealing the body of Victoria Cherry for 15 months and preventing her burial.The cause of death could not be ascertained because it had decomposed, but a pathologist concluded she may have died as a result of strangulation as injuries to her neck were detected.Reade admitted intending to pervert the course of justice by giving misleading and inaccurate information about the whereabouts of Victoria Cherry to police officers, pharmacists, and family members.The sicko also cashed in £1,000 of employment benefits sent to Vicky in the three months after her death."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000401239622.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"ebay russia world cup 2018 completed panini sticker books","story":"The offers represent a bargain considering a professor recently calculated that filling the much-loved book by buying packets of stickers from shops and not doing swaps with pals would cost as much as £773.The price could be reduced to £250 if duplicates are swapped with 10 friends.However full books are now listed on the auction site for between £50 and £150.The Italian sticker giant also sells some individual stickers online for around 22p each.Dozens of books are available for sale on eBay – some with the stickers loose so at least buyers could experience the enjoyment of placing the players into the album themselves.Others already had the 682 labels already in place.A maths prof from Cardiff calculated that filling this year’s sticker book will cost collectors £773.60.Prof Paul Harper devised a formula that suggested, given the probabilities of getting duplicate stickers, on average an individual would need to buy 967 packets or 4,832 stickers to get the set.As well as pictures of the 32 squads of players competing in Russia this summer, there are special stickers for national badges, team group shots and host city posters, making a total of 682 stickers needed to fill the book.He said 137 packets of stickers costing £109.60 would be enough to complete the collection, providing you didn’t get any doubles.But that is an unlikely scenario.Many collectors of the sticker book have been critical of the price rise in this year’s stickers.

Being on the centre ground really freaks them out.How are you going to deliver better services when you’re driving out people who create wealth? They still think that the biggest issue is about keeping the jobs down the mines!None of those who spoke to us can bring themselves to vote Labour next time around - saying theyll back whichever party can keep Mr Corbyn out of power.Nimco - who joined Labour when Gordon Brown was leader - said: I’m happy to back the Tory party to keep Corbyn and his Shadow Cabinet out of power.The Labour party doesn’t represent the people that it says it speaks for. I want them to change - but there’s no hope for them.Robbie added: I would actively vote Conservative at elections to undermine Corbyn’s Labour party.I think Jeremy Corbyn is very much a red line in terms of ever supporting the Labour party again.And Sam - despite being a Labour official until recently - concluded: I would have to vote against Labour because it comes down to a choice between party and country.

It may or may not be the same car, but we are very keen to identify this car.The investigation team would also like to hear from anyone who was living in the Paderborn area who owned a green saloon car in 1981, so that they can be ruled out of the teams enquiries.She had been shopping for her second birthday tea treats with her mum Sharon at the Schloss Neuhaus NAAFI supermarket when she disappeared.The case, which has chilling similarities to season two of BBC drama The Missing, remains unsolved.Sharon, now 64, said the toddler was “gone in a matter of seconds”. She added: “It’s living a nightmare that you never wake up from.“Nearly 37 years ago we became members of an exclusive club we didn’t ask for membership of — we became parents of a missing daughter. I would dearly love to be able to revoke that membership.Fighting back tears, Sharon told The Sun: “Although I would like a fairytale ending to our story, I fully appreciate that might not be.“But at the end of the day, we will have closure and any emotions that come from that closure we will learn to live with and deal with as we have for the past nearly 37 years.“The next five weeks is a double-edged sword for us as a family. We desperately want Katrice to be found but we also know that if anything is discovered during this search then my daughter’s life would have been ended in very unsavoury circumstances.“That’s another emotion we have to learn to live with.”Katrice’s dad, a Staff Sergeant of the King’s Royal Hussars, was posted in West Germany at the height of the Cold War.On November 28, 1981, the NAAFI was rammed on the last payday before Christmas. Sharon said: “If you wanted English goodies, that was the time to get them.Katrice wouldn’t sit in the trolley, so I carried her all the way around in my arms doing my shopping.“When we got to the checkout I realised I’d forgotten crisps.“I put Katrice down and said to my sister Wendy, ‘Just keep an eye on her while I go back to the crisps stand’. It wasn’t far away. It took me about 40 seconds, a minute at most. When I got back I asked, ‘Where’s Katrice?’.“My sister said, ‘I thought she was with you. She ran and followed you’.“I went back down the aisle and she wasn’t there. Panic started to set in. I couldn’t see her anywhere. There was so many people. I was calling her name. Katrice couldn’t be found — she wasn’t there.”The Royal Military Police and German cops worked on the assumption the little girl — wearing red wellies, a turquoise duffle coat and tartan dress — wandered off, fell into another nearby river, the flooded Lippe, and drowned. But a hunt proved fruitless.Statements from shop staff were not taken for six weeks and details of an eye condition Katrice had were not released.The case was reopened in 2000 and led to the arrest of a former soldier. But he was released without charge and the case closed again after three years. There were further inquiries in 2012."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000402011522-e1525273091433.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"kim jong un korea summit peace south drink wine","story":"Buoyed on by the success of the Inter Korea Summit, Kim was seen knocking back alcohol like a teenager on a Saturday night.Reports have emerged revealing how the North Korean leader slamming shot after shot as he let his hair down during a celebratory dinner.Officials from both sides gathered together to party at the Peace House in Panmunjom, in the demilitarised zone between the two nations following promises of a united Korean peninsula.Kim Jong-un was seen accepting every drink that came his way, and knocking it back in one shot.One South Korean official said: “When South Koreans approached him with a drink, he stood up from his seat, let them pour for him and drained it all in one shot.“He never turned it down, whoever came.”Among the drinks on offer were Dugyeonju, a rice wine made with azalea petals, and Munbaesul, a “royal wine” that can be 40 per cent alcohol.Although known as a notorious chain-smoker, Kim only stepped out for a cigarette once during the whole evening.Aside from a steady stream of alcohol and a cheeky cigarette, Kim was entertained by a South Korean magician who managed to turn a Korean bank note into US currency.The celebrations came off the back of productive talks between the Koreas on how to move forward as a united peninsula.History was made as Kim crossed into the South for the first summit for more than a decade.During the talks, the Koreas announced they would seek an agreement to establish permanent and solid peace on the peninsula, which would see a total denuclearisation of the region.The declaration included promises to pursue military arms reduction, cease hostile acts, turn their fortified border into a peace zone, and seek multilateral talks with other countries, such as the United States.In his first ever press conference in front of the worlds media Kim Jong-un said:“We are one nation we cannot be separated. We share the same blood.We are living with each other. We are brothers.”The Koreas said they hope the parties will be able to declare an official end to the war by the end of this year.President Moon said that the two countries would work to re-unite families who had been separated by the decades long conflict as Kim did what his father and grandfather never managed.The dictator said his heart was throbbing as he became the first North Korean leader to cross the 38th parallel since the Korean War ended 65 years ago.Kim even quipped about his missile tests saying he wouldnt disturb the Souths early morning sleep anymore."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/05/2048x1152/skynews-port-talbot-pollution_4298564.jpg?20180502051235 ","title":"first pictures of harry and meghans royal wedding carriage","story":"Although the weather on 19 May is expected to be sunny with some clouds, a backup carriage has been chosen in the event of severely wet weather.If it does rain, Harry and Meghan will travel in the Scottish State Coach.Built in 1830, a new top was created in 1969 with large windows, and a partial glass roof, to allow spectators to see the passengers.
