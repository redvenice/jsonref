Almost 160 years later, a coronavirus outbreak has killed 17,000 Americans and infected hundreds of thousands more.Widmer, distinguished lecturer at Macaulay Honors College of the City University of New York, will not be riding the rails himself, to college towns and bookstores.“I’m just biding my time and trying to talk about the book. I just started an Instagram for the first time in my life. So, I’m trying to do my part.”A conversation with Widmer would be fascinating in less trying times – or more. He speaks with evident delight of a common phenomenon: a fascination with Lincoln formed “as a fourth-grade boy”, on reading “a picture biography” and “feeling drawn even to his face”.Lincoln is the president who really did come from nothing, who went to Washington from what was then the wild and unruly west, who spoke of government of the people, by the people, for the people, who oversaw the preservation of the union and the end of slavery, and who was killed in cold blood on Good Friday 1865.“There is this feeling of sadness inside Lincoln that we don’t get with most of our famous leaders,” Widmer says. “And this sadness shows a deeper capacity for reason and someone who’s experienced a great deal in life, which was true.“Later I graduated to reading his speeches and so many of them are beautifully written. I think we still consider him the most eloquent of our presidents.”Widmer wrote speeches for Bill Clinton and advised Hillary Clinton when she was secretary of state. He happily accounts himself a “speech nerd”, so we happily discuss one of Lincoln’s lesser-known addresses, which he gave at Independence Hall in Philadelphia on 22 February 1861.But there’s something to get out of the way. The place of Lincoln, and books about him, in a nation jaggedly ided again.Lincoln’s life, Widmer says, “is a story of incredible survival against adversity. And more than survival, really, sort of winning on every possible front. And whenever we fail again, which we do pretty routinely, I think he still speaks to us and helps us to be better than we might be otherwise.”You may see where this is heading. Covid-19 is ravaging the land and to some Lincoln’s successor in the White House, the 45th president, seems to be losing the fight.I ask the inevitable question, prompted by interviews with historians of Lincoln and Frederick Douglass but also the Holocaust and Jean-Paul Sartre. Does Widmer’s book contain lessons for readers in America under Trump?“Well,” he says, picking his words with care, “I hope it does. I think one of the reasons we read history is for insights into our present.”Maybe such caution is born of Widmer’s Clintonian background – he’s an alumnus of the same White House as Sidney Blumenthal, now three volumes into a five-volume life of Lincoln but a bete noire for many Trump supporters. Maybe it isn’t. Widmer continues.“I don’t want to be too nakedly political. I want to reach out to all Americans from all backgrounds, I really do. While writing this book I was conscious of how much I learned from my Republican grandmother.“I think Lincoln’s example shows how important it is to be an ethical person, which he was, very unusually for politicians in his own time as well as ours. He was uncomfortable talking about himself and he tried to give the credit to others.“But he also had a long view. He tried to say to Americans, ‘It’s really important to get democracy right, because so many other people are depending on us, not just people in this country, with and without political rights, but other countries who are trying to become more democratic.’“… And he was thinking a lot about the future too. He mentions the 20th century in a few speeches. And so I think he was trying to reach out to us. And I think we should not be ashamed about looking back to him.“How can we be the most ethical people? How can we choose the wisest leaders? How can we get back to factuality? There are facts that bolster Republican arguments and there are facts that bolster Democratic arguments. But to at least admit the facts will make us a better country.”Back to Philadelphia. I suggest Lincoln’s speech there in 1861 should be better known.Before Independence Hall, Lincoln had spoken as a candidate, in his great debates with Stephen Douglas, and he had spoken as a lawyer, when he went to Cooper Union in New York and took the case for slavery to pieces. But when he spoke in Philadelphia, he spoke as a leader – as the president he was about to become – for the very first time.The key to the speech lies in the simple statement that Lincoln “never had a feeling politically that did not spring from the sentiments embodied in the Declaration of Independence”.It’s actually a lawyerly bit of phrasing, a neat dodge of those who point out that the Declaration doesn’t say “women” and that Thomas Jefferson, the man who wrote “all men are created equal”, owned slaves himself.Widmer calls it “the most sublime statement of what it means to be an American, of the human rights that belong, in fact, to all people on Earth.“And Lincoln says it beautifully and in a very short speech, but by doing that he brilliantly takes the problems of 1861 and sets them in a much wider frame. He also sidesteps the constitution with all of its awkwardness on racial questions and slavery and he just goes right to the core of the national experiment, that we are trying to make democracy work for all people. Because slavery was a complete contradiction of those claims to human rights inside the Declaration.“It was a pretty short distance from that speech in 1861 to the Gettysburg Address in 1863. So I argue that he really had worked out something very important.”Widmer started out aiming simply to portray “Lincoln moving in a fast-moving conveyance, a train, in a very dangerous situation”. It “felt cinematic”, he says, and indeed it does, as the places Lincoln saw – Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Baltimore and its nests of would-be assassins – slide past.But then he “realised Lincoln was changing in important ways along the way and Philadelphia’s the key to that. He’s giving better and better speeches, though there were a couple clunkers, and I like that because it shows a human Lincoln.“He gave a very bad speech about the economy in Pittsburgh and he nearly lost his inaugural speech in Indianapolis. He had a lot of problems. But then he starts about what it means to be an American.”Around Lincoln’s odyssey, quoting Homer liberally, Widmer wraps a richly written account of the concurrent journey of the Confederate president, Jefferson Davis ersions on train-travel in the 19th century (Widmer is a passionate defender of 21st-century Amtrak) and portrayals of those who Lincoln met, who recorded their thoughts in diaries, letters and long-lost local papers.There is also “a lot about the building, Independence Hall, and what a difficult history it had”.“At a time when Americans are being whipsawed by the news, Lincoln goes into the most sacred building of American political history, where the Declaration of Independence was written and signed, and he gives an absolutely beautiful speech on George Washington’s birthday about how this is the document that has guided him throughout everything he’s ever done in politics.“So that building had become tainted in the eyes of a lot of Americans. And Lincoln, I argue, cleansed it and gave it back its integrity.”A tour of Independence Hall is a moving experience. But on the bright February morning when I took one, at least, that dark chapter was not mentioned.Though the life and times of Abraham Lincoln have been exhaustively studied, new approaches are still to be found."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa6aecebfdac301deaa083799fe1d20db8dbe34c/0_27_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9357e561050498f1356249cac7495f8e","title":"lift lockdown uk east asia coronavirus pandemic","story":"Data from east Asia shows testing, tracing and isolating people with coronavirus is the best way to tackle the pandemicWhen will the pandemic end? The future is uncertain, but it seems likely that over the next 18 months the UK will experience a cycle of national lockdowns while it awaits a vaccine. This is far from ideal. Repeated lockdowns could lead to mass unemployment, rising national debt, uncontrolled bankruptcies and widespread social unrest as people grow sick of draconian measures. Many people are now asking how quickly the lockdown can be lifted – and how soon we can return to normal.Monitoring the reproductive rate of infection figure, R0, will be crucial to any decision about lifting the lockdown. The figure indicates how contagious an infection is. As the R0 number drops below one, each existing infection causes less than one new infection eventually, the outbreak will decline and die out. When R0 remains steadily less than one, governments may decide to gradually loosen restrictions, with the lockdown relaxed earlier in lower intensity areas and later in hotspot cities such as London.New data published this week in the Lancet, from a team of researchers at the University of Hong Kong led by the clinician Gabriel Leung, shows that the spread of infection in China outside Wuhan, measured by the R0 in four major cities (Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Wenzhou) fell below one within two weeks of partial lockdown. This is good news it shows a partial lockdown can quite quickly suppress transmission of the virus. Our national lockdown and social distancing measures may already have brought the R0 down across much of the country.Moreover there’s a crucial difference between the response to coronavirus in China and that in the UK. From the beginning of the outbreak, the Lancet researchers note, “only residents were allowed to enter residential communities, face mask-wearing was made compulsory, and non-essential community services were shut down”. Health authorities also found cases, traced contacts and isolated them, monitoring their quarantine closely.So it was not just a lockdown and social distancing that were responsible for bringing down the R0 number in China, but the country’s community surveillance approach. Scarred by memories of the Sars outbreak in 2002, China and other east Asian states acted with greater speed, imposing total or partial lockdowns supported by a protective shield of community measures – finding people with the virus, isolating them swiftly, and tracing those they contacted.In South Korea, this took the form of mass testing and digital contact tracing in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Vietnam, health authorities identified cases based on people’s symptoms, and used testing when available. Strict isolation of cases and contacts was monitored by phone apps and home visits. Rather than enforcing a one-size-fits-all approach, China varied the lockdown across different regions. While Wuhan was under total lockdown, other provinces had more autonomy, and focused on quarantining the household clusters where most transmission took place.Despite Britain’s slow start, there are reasons for hope. Behind the scenes, general practices and public health workers are working at tremendous speed to build our own protective shield. They’re finding places to treat infected patients who aren’t sick enough for hospital but can’t be nursed at home, visiting those with long-term conditions or coronavirus symptoms, and building a picture of community spread using 111 data. The UK should also be able to roll out contact tracing using the new NHSX app and the popular Zoe Covid symptom tracker.We have four to six weeks to ramp up testing and build our community shield before we lift the lockdown. After this, we can then get most people back to work, focus on quarantining inidual cases and contacts, and suppress outbreaks if they arise. Hopefully this approach will help us avoid further national lockdowns. But it will take a long time before life returns to normal.• Anthony Costello is professor of global health and sustainable development at University College London"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38fda813e25e25d19b49fbfe2503307f3e96ce96/0_145_4352_2614/master/4352.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4cf36a82e999d698ac44c4652ca1b18c","title":"sunbathing park deep moral questions philosophers coronavirus individual","story":"Coronavirus gives fresh urgency to philosophers’ struggle with the conflict between inidual choice and the common goodSunbathing in the park, normally the most innocent of pleasures, is causing outrage. The police are involved the parks may be shut.Lockdown is never easy, but when the weather is good, the urge to be outside, to feel the sun on your face, to lie on the grass, under a tree, is almost irresistible. To close your eyes and pretend just for a little while that life is normal. How can this be wrong?Extreme libertarians think it is not. They say that freedom is so important that losing it is worse than death (other people’s deaths, at any rate). Most of us don’t agree. We accept the need for social distancing. But even so, the lockdown rules don’t require us to stay in all the time. There are exceptions. Why not just one more, just for me, my family, our suntan cream and picnic basket? If my local park is empty, my family and I can enjoy our picnic  in the open air. We refresh ourselves and don’t harm anyone else – they chose to stay at home anyway. What could possibly be wrong with that?Moral and political philosophers have long struggled with the conflict between inidual choice and the common good, between general rules and exceptions, and have come to very different conclusions about the right answer.It is plainly rational, game theorists say, to make some people better off (me and my family) and no one worse off (everyone else). Some moral philosophers have thought it morally right too. According to utilitarians, rules are made to be broken, when you make people happier by breaking them. Our fundamental moral duty, John Stuart Mill said, is to produce the greatest happiness of the greatest number. In the time of coronavirus, that means staying away from other people.But if you can do that while making yourself happier – by sunbathing or picnicking, because everyone else has obeyed the lockdown – it is not just permitted but actually morally right to go for it. Of course, seeing my family reclining outdoors may send onlookers into a righteous fury, reducing the total happiness (though righteous fury can be pretty enjoyable too). Also we may inspire others to break the rules themselves, and if everyone thinks this way, the park will be full. That is dangerous for us all and it would be better to stay at home. But all this means is that I ought to be discreet. If I am, no harm, no wrong.Can that really be true? Immanuel Kant thought the fundamental moral question was a different one: what if everyone did that? Kant thought it was right to act only in ways that could be a universal law. We know that if everyone picnicked in the park, no one could do so safely. When I do it anyway, I am acting in a way that could not be for everyone. I am relying on everyone else abiding by the rules, exploiting their conformity to benefit myself. I am treating myself as an exception, a special case. This is not a way of treating other people with respect. This is not fair.If we accept that morality is not only a matter of harm and benefit, but also respect and fairness, we can see what is wrong with picnicking in the park at the present time. But once we start to think in these terms, we need to look at a much broader picture. As political philosophers such as Karl Marx emphasise, our inidual decisions are made against a social background that we have not chosen. Lockdown is a very different experience for different people, depending on their personality, their family circumstances and their living conditions. It is easier to stay at home in a large, roomy house with a pleasant garden than in a cramped high-rise flat with no outdoor space.Lockdown reinforces existing social inequalities. It is even less excusable for the more fortunate to break the rules. Though we should all keep to the guidelines, it doesn’t follow that we should heap blame on those who don’t, not knowing what staying at home is like for them, not knowing their reasons for being out. Of course they should comply, but be kind most people are doing their best.It is a mark of the crisis we are in that simply sunbathing in the park raises the deepest questions about what truly matters in our lives: the happiness of all, even if I rely on others obeying the rules, as utilitarians would say. Or respect and fairness, as Kant would reply. The role of inidual responsibility within a social context, as Marx would insist.Finally, we can draw on another value very important to Marx (and Rousseau and Hegel too): the value of solidarity. There are huge disparities between the burdens a few are being asked to bear for the sake of the many. Doctors, nurses and other key workers constantly risk their lives to look after the sick and to keep essential services running. For the rest of us, there is very little that we can do to make a difference in this global crisis. It is easy to feel helpless and overwhelmed. But in fact, sitting at home, we can stand in solidarity with those who are doing more. We are doing our part, and treating fairly everyone else who is doing the same. It is the most, and the least, we can do.• Alison Hills is a fellow and tutor in philosophy at St John’s College, University of Oxford"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69a0f49438b82ad283bbd92e99df528d494ada4d/262_221_3719_2231/master/3719.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=312d7b554fb4aa4a6e701a94f1957a40","title":"marcus brigstocke funniest things","story":"The comedian and actor on the things that make him laugh the mostI supported Bill Bailey on tour for a while and his shows are sublime.

Two weeks ago she got a call saying the interview was cancelled. “I feel so sad and frustrated. I’d been nervous about leaving uni and getting an interview was really exciting,” she says.Many are in similar positions. Alice Cole (not her real name) is in her final year at the University of Brighton and wanted to go into the NGO sector as a researcher. She was feeling confident about her prospects after graduation and there were jobs available, but the outlook has changed rapidly. “Because of coronavirus, funding for NGOs is getting smaller and there are fewer jobs at entry-level positions,” she says. “It won’t be possible anymore.”Students are starting to realise they will be graduating into a global recession. According to the Institute of Student Employers (ISE), many firms have scaled down their recruitment of entry-level staff and more than a quarter of businesses are reducing the number of graduates they hire this year.While some firms are moving assessments and interviews online, the majority have cancelled them. “Thousands of young people are supposed to be entering the labour market from July and they could be left without work and nothing to do while coronavirus is sorted out,” says Stephen Isherwood, chief executive of the ISE. “We need to make sure that a whole generation isn’t lost.”One graduate recruiter says they have already retracted offers. “Firms are being realistic and most are putting recruitment on hold. No one wants to offer an opportunity which might not be there in three months’ time.”James Turner, CEO of the Sutton Trust, says although we don’t know the full extent of the virus on the graduate job market yet, shrinking opportunities tend to be bad for social mobility, with students unable to access internships and other work experience placements. He says: “Internships are increasingly necessary for many graduate jobs, and there is a risk that young people with professional connections may be able to find work experience while other, openly-advertised, opportunities cease to exist.”Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute, says although most companies will feel the impact, there will be some big winners and some losers depending on the sector. “Even in this crisis, some employers are booming. Technology companies, the food sector and logistics firms are busier than ever,” he says. “You might not end up with the job you hoped for but you can get a job.”Students can also rely on their university careers’ services, and Kim Connor Streich, marketing director of the Debut Careers app, thinks it is vital that applicants practice video interviews and presenting on camera.Others, however, think we will see more students deciding to take master’s degrees or further courses of study. In other times of recession, staying on at university has been a good alternative to struggling to get a job, with the hope that iniduals will emerge not only with improved skills but into a recovering jobs market. Cole thinks this is her only option. “I live in a rural area of Wales so there are very few job opportunities around here. I’m currently looking into doing a master’s,” she says. “The easiest thing to do right now is to delay entering the job market by a year so things have a chance to get back to normal.”James Catchpole, director of the legal practice course at the City Law School, thinks the end result may be a more highly skilled workforce. “We need to make sure we prepare them even better than we have done and turn them into even better candidates,” he says.Hillman agrees. “You can get government-backed loans for postgraduate study, and unis will be falling over themselves to recruit home students as international numbers will be down significantly.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5605e1aa6d7dc026ca42a4910c6f78bfd0c3b80b/0_0_4495_2997/master/4495.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=794ea6296f4f80caf2236a5039c2aac6 1760w","title":"clare waight keller meghans wedding dress designer leaves givenchy","story":"Next move unclear for British creative, who also dressed duchess for Ascot and Remembrance SundayClare Waight Keller, who designed Meghan Markle’s wedding dress, has left Givenchy. The British-born designer, who had previously been the creative head at Pringle of Scotland and Chloe, became the first female leader of the French fashion house when she joined in 2017.In an exit statement, Waight Keller said: “As the first woman to be the artistic director of this legendary maison, I feel honoured to have been given the opportunity to cherish its legacy and bring it new life.”Succeeding a line of stellar design talent, such as John Galliano, Alexander McQueen, Julien Macdonald and Riccardo Tisci, Waight Keller became known for bringing couture back to the house. “Under her creative leadership … the maison reconnected with the founding values of Hubert de Givenchy and his innate sense of elegance,” said Sidney Toledano, the head of the LVMH group, which owns Givenchy.Waight Keller’s relationship with the Duchess of Sussex extended beyond her wedding day: she dressed her for Ascot, the trooping of the colour ceremony and Remembrance Sunday. And when Waight Keller, 49, won the British Designer of the Year award in 2018, it was presented by Meghan in a surprise appearance while heavily pregnant and wearing a black, off-the shoulder Givenchy dress.Waight Keller’s wedding dress for the duchess was simple: a sculptured, silk tulle dress that nodded to her former life as an actor and her future life as a member of the royal family. Visually, it seemed to nod to Audrey Hepburn’s wedding dress in Funny Face, a bit of old Hollywood glamour that was actually created by Hubert de Givenchy. At the time, Waight Keller said that its white veil was a “vision Meghan and I shared”. It was embroidered with all 53 flowers of the Commonwealth countries, plus flowers which represented Kensington Palace and Meghan’s home of California. Underlining the significance of the duchess choosing her to design her dress and the parallels between Meghan’s own change of life, Waight Keller said: “As a British designer at a Parisian haute couture house … I am extremely proud of what we’ve accomplished.”On Friday, the 49-year-old posted a video on Instagram from her final show, the autumnwinter 2020 women’s show, held on 1 March at Paris fashion week with the caption: “With love, Clare.”It is not known what Waight Keller’s next move will be.

One of The Fabricant’s clients, Tommy Hilfiger, is among brands already testing avatars, holograms and augmented-reality formats internally, the company’s CEO, Daniel Grieder, told fashion trade title WWD.The world’s first entirely virtual fashion week, Shanghai fashion week, took place last month. Despite some technical glitches, one designer, Angel Chen, demonstrated the possibilities of the format with a thrilling five-minute presentation featuring real models and computer-generated graphics. Models were directed and styled via video link, because the designer was self-isolating.Moscow fashion week was also shown virtually earlier this week, with 830,000 people streaming its shows. The British Fashion Council also confirmed that it is to replace its London fashion week men’s showcase in June with a digital event. Helsinki fashion week, in July, will also be digital, a decision taken prior to the pandemic for environmental reasons, with all collections to be created by a 3D artist.Shows could become even more immersive and hi-tech as the discipline evolves 3D avatars wearing digitally created clothing, real models’ faces beamed on to 3D bodies and real models wearing real or digital clothing are all options. “There is no wrong answer and brands don’t need to use the catwalk format specifically – they are forced to be creative,” says Murphy.Murphy firmly believes that 3D clothing will soon become a mainstream consumer pastime, too, as technological advances allow those without 3D modelling skills and software to digitally style their own outfits. Last week, his company launched a beta platform, Leela, that aims to automate this process, enabling users to scan a picture of their face on to a 3D digital body and choose clothing for it to wear.Digital fashion “is going to be as big as retail”, insists Murphy, who argues that paying for digital clothing had already been normalised for players of Fortnite. “Everyone has a virtual identity, and that is only going to get bigger.”Digital fashion has clear sustainability benefits, enabling customers to buy “fantastical” outfits to express their identities on social media, without wearing an outfit once then consigning it to landfill, a trend that has become prevalent on social media.“There’s enough clothing in the world. This way brands can sell fewer physical items – can produce less stuff – but keep margins the same,” says Murphy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/954b065e29645d1982cd1b9b72adee38a98beb73/0_807_5404_3240/master/5404..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=58b3642d2b95971da805746dd46c5f60","title":"top 10 lockdown beauty tips sali hughes","story":"Try an avocado face mask, a home manicure or a jawline-enhancing beard, says Sali Hughes There’s something nice about letting hair do what it wants, within reason. My hairdresser, Luke Hersheson, agrees. “Stepping back from the blowdryer and straightening or curling iron is easier, saves time, preserves condition and very often looks better,” he says. The trick is to place hair where desired when soaking wet. “Comb it through, apply any product, part it where you like, tuck behind the ears, twist, shake it out – but then leave it alone until it’s dry. Then you can disturb it, taking a piece or two to style with tools, but don’t bother with the back – only the front matters in Zoom meetings.”Don’t waste your eggs, ignore the internet’s devotion to turmeric unless you’d like to turn yellow, and don’t go near lemon, lime or vinegar as they can play havoc with your skin. If you want to nourish your face with non-greasy moisture, half a mashed avocado with a teaspoon of honey works fine (slather on and leave for 15 minutes before removing with a wet flannel). Adding a tablespoon of fresh plain yoghurt can impart an extra glow.1. Remove old polish and wash hands (but don’t apply hand cream).2. Choose something about an hour long to half-watch on television (this ensures you don’t get up too early and smudge).3. Clip or cut and, with an emery board, file nails in one direction only, into a “squoval” (square along the top, curved at the sides).4. Apply a thin layer of clear base coat.5. Apply colour. Remove the brush and stroke it on either side against the neck of the bottle (the brush should never be dripping) to get rid of surplus polish. Paint three strokes – left, middle, right – in the shape of a nail. This is very important: you should disregard your natural nail shape and leave small unpainted gaps between the sides of your nail and your skin. This looks heaps better than pools of polish in the gutters. Don’t worry about streaking at this stage this coat is for colour density, not neatness. Leave to dry for a few minutes.6. Second coat. Repeat step five, this time taking great care not to streak. Stick to the shape you painted with the first coat and go nowhere near your nail beds, leaving a little gap all around the edges of polish. Move fast. Don’t go back and paint over polish you have just laid down. Wait at least 15 minutes.7. Apply clear topcoat, this time taking it over the colour’s edges to seal it, then finish whatever you were watching. You can clean up with a remover-soaked cotton bud, but avoid hand cream for a good hour.On a slim face, you should hold a 3-4mm Kent comb at a 2 o’clock angle to the skin, and trim above it. For fuller faces, hold the comb vertically and clip downwards, leaving no more than a quarter of an inch of bristle. “Don’t forget the nose, ears and brows,” Chapman adds. As someone who routinely trims my husband’s brows, I find the best technique is to brush them upwards, trim any overlappers with nail scissors, then use small clippers to remove any traces of monobrow.Chapman doesn’t hold with beard oil unless someone has very thick, coarse bristles. Instead, he follows a good skincare routine and rubs his facial moisturiser well into his beard to keep it conditioned and tame. If you feel the need to colour it, Chapman urges caution to avoid the Lego-look: “Use two shades lighter than you think, do it in three stages, and fleck on the dye with an old toothbrush.”If one of the few benefits of this period is not having to bother with hairstyling and makeup, then all power to you. But many of us feel better for the sense of structure and normality these beauty routines bring. A good compromise is “dress up Fridays”, where ponytails, bare faces and trackies can be upscaled once a week with a cursory blowdry, a face of makeup and a non‑elasticated waistband.Self-tan no one can see: why bother? “Because people have cancelled their holidays in the sun, and their weddings, and shouldn’t have to miss out on the golden glow, too,” says Jules von Hep, of Isle of Paradise. He has tanned Kate Moss, Sienna Miller, Stacey Dooley, and spent three years hosing down all the Strictly Come Dancing contestants. “When people look in the mirror, many of them want to see the person they saw before, and to observe the same rituals.”So if a little extra colour makes you more cheerful, then you will need to master it yourself – and this is the perfect time to practise. For Von Hep, that means thorough exfoliation for a smooth, even base. If you’re out of body scrub, mix a handful of brown sugar or coarse salt into body wash or olive oil, massage into skin, then shower. Straight afterwards is the best time to self tan. Von Hep believes in moisturising only hands, knees, elbows and feet, then leaving for five minutes to soak in. Then take your tan – tinted for beginners, clear for the more experienced – and saturate the skin with product. Put on a tanning mitt (or use a household sponge) and blend using sweeping, upward strokes, never circular motions. Do face, arms, legs and torso for your back, either enlist a helper or tape the mitt to a wooden spoon to reach. Brush through brows with an old mascara wand and use an inside-out sports sock to buff around the hairline and ears to remove excess.Leave to dry, then repeat everywhere except your face, and wear loose, cool clothes for two to six hours. “Remember, tanning isn’t just for the pale,” adds Von Hep: darker shades of self-tan will give a glow to darker skin. “We’re all looking a little ashy right now from being indoors. And many of us are a little pink from drinking wine in the evenings. Tan will correct all that and restore your glow.”  This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

To prepare it, hold the thick end of the stem in one hand and clasp the fingers of your other hand around the base of the leaf, then pull up hard to strip off the leaf and put to one side. Repeat, piling up the stems in a stack, then finely chop them into 5mm pieces. Cutting the stems crossways shortens the fibres, much as with a tough steak, making them perfectly edible and preventing waste. Cut this way, the stems can be cooked in the same way as the rest of the leaf: sauteed, boiled or steamed.The thick stems of a kale leaf make up a large proportion of its mass. Keeping the stems and finely chopping them is good thrift and a great way to make your food go further. In this recipe, the cooked kale leaves and stalks are pureed to make a vivid, green sauce that could easily be thinned to make a soup or, as it is here, used to dress barley.Barley is a delicious alternative to rice, and it’s locally grown, too. It’s easy to cultivate and has a strong, deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion. It’s also an affordable and nutritious grain. Use it to bulk out broths, as a base for a wholegrain salad or in “risottos” that are known in Italy as barleyotto or orzotto.1 glug extra-virgin olive oil80g green leek tops, washed and finely sliced80g onion, finely sliced1 garlic clove, peeled and crushed200g pot barley½ unwaxed lemon, zested and juiced2cm piece dried kelp (optional)200ml white wine200g kaleBreadcrumbs, to servePut the oil into a large, heavy-based pan over a medium-low heat, then gently sweat the leek tops, onion and garlic for five minutes, without colouring. Add the barley, half the lemon zest and the kelp, if using, and cook, stirring, for a minute. Pour in the wine and bring to a boil, then pour in enough boiling water to cover and simmer gently, stirring regularly, until all the liquid has been absorbed. Top up with more boiling water and repeat, still stirring regularly, until the barley is cooked – about 45 minutes – then leave to rest.Bring a pan of water to a boil. Wash the kale and strip the leaves off the stalks. Finely shred the greens and cut the stalks into 5mm pieces, boil for two minutes, then drain, reserving the cooking water. Blend the kale to a puree, adding a little cooking water to loosen, if necessary. (You can keep any leftover cooking water as stock in your fridge or freezer.) Stir the puree into the barley and season well with salt, pepper and lemon juice to taste. Spoon into bowls, top with the remaining lemon zest and the breadcrumbs, and serve."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/297e4e0ca2be08892846b6250497890d7ec470d3/0_46_2980_1789/master/2980.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=a0c4a75940264468fd0f250c346d4f93","title":"carry on leonardo easter lockdown festival pizza oven","story":"From staging a festival to worshipping together to building a pizza oven, we gather your stories“It was like a Carry On film,” says Jane Redman of her family’s attempt to recreate Da Vinci’s Last Supper. Inspired by the recent social media trend, Jane, her husband Chris, their son Nick and daughter Amy – who are all in lockdown together – set themselves an Easter challenge to recreate a classic artwork using things they already had at home.To achieve the image, they took four separate shots in their back garden – changing costumes and poses between each – and then stitched the photos together digitally. “My husband kept saying: ‘We’ve got to be quick because the light keeps changing.’ He was putting us under loads of pressure. We were all wearing different bits of sheet and he was saying ‘Come on, get changed!’ and we’d say ‘Where’s my arm supposed to be? Where am I looking?’ … You’d probably only do it in a lockdown.” As people across the UK must continue to stay at home because of the coronavirus, we asked  readers how they are planning to celebrate Easter in lockdown.Dozens of churchgoers told us that they had discovered new ways to worship together, and will be tuning into online services and prayer meetings.A group called Student Cross has adapted its annual pilgrimage to the Anglican and Roman Catholic shrines in Little Walsingham, Norfolk. “We normally walk in 11 different groups, carrying a cross and stopping to share refreshment and reflections with those we meet,” says Laura Mitcham.But with the pilgrimage cancelled this year, participants can instead go online to log their steps from walking around their home or local area as part of their daily exercise, as well as taking part in daily Zoom liturgy services. “It’s not the same as the physical pilgrimage, says Mitcham, “but it’s something special that will be remembered due to its unique nature and the way the community has pulled together.”Many people across the country are baking hot cross buns and Simnel cakes, decorating houses with homemade ornaments, and organising indoor Easter egg hunts.“My daughter absolutely loves rabbits so Easter is her favourite time of year,” says Rachel Acres from Bradford-on-Avon. On Thursday, she and Bethany, seven, dug out leftover cardboard from their garage to make into giant rabbits and decorate their front garden “to wish all passers-by a happy Easter”.In Cornwall, Sarah Parmenter is staging a mini-festival for her four-year-old son who has loved doing Easter egg hunts with his cousins and friends in previous years. “The bunting will be out, magical Easter egg plants will have grown in the garden and of course the bunny will have visited – apparently he has a special sleigh which allows him to comply with social distancing requirements,” says Parmenter. “We already have an Easter tree decorated with a special sign, reminding the bunny to stop here.”For Millie Jones and her housemates, this weekend marks not only Easter but also the end of their two-week self-quarantine after one started showing symptoms. To celebrate, they’ll have “a very tame blowout” and recreate a typical Christmas day: Bucks Fizz and croissants in the morning, films and chocolate in the afternoon, then a huge roast dinner.“We want to make it as fun as possible,” says Jones. “It feels like we’re all living in the week between Christmas and New Year anyway, so we want to create a festive day, celebrating each other, in this time of lockdown.”Rik Sterken and his family had planned to spend a few nights on the Welsh coast this weekend. Instead, they’re taking a mini-camping trip into their back garden. “We reckon the tent just about fits,” says Sterken. “We’re trying to keep a sense of normality but also a sense of adventure as well.”On Friday night, Sterken, his wife and two children will eat pizzas from their home-built, wood-fired pizza oven for the first time this year, and enjoy barbecued bacon butties on Saturday morning. “The kids are really excited, although we haven’t told them yet they’ll be sleeping on camping mats,” he says.And unable to go to France on holiday, Crista Hazell and her husband Jon will be donning rabbit ears and painting on whiskers to be the Easter bunny for their older neighbours.“We know they can’t see their families so thought we’d help them find a smile on Sunday by placing a few Easter eggs (with clean hands) on doorsteps before the sun rises,” says Crista, an author and education consultant from Bristol. “It’s something a bit daft, but hopefully we can give them a little love and enjoyment.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a35b881663181acdfec38771bbfe53152cdda9e/13_0_582_349/master/582..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=80fb4e7a7de42feefa769cfde375a51d","title":"so long box fresh yeezys from now on wearing gruffalo slippers and boxers romesh ranganathan","story":"It’s as if my mission brief was to stop my wife ever having a feeling of sexual desire for me againI would never have described myself as vain. When I got my first standup spot on television, I returned home to find my wife and mother waiting to stage a hair intervention, immediately taking me to get it cut. I had apparently left it so long that my wife described my look as “recently released political prisoner”. Similarly with clothes: once we had children, I discovered that anything nice had a life expectancy of about an hour before one of them smeared ketchup, snot or a concoction that could only be identified by sending it to a lab, all over it, sometimes accidentally. So, for a long while, I just gave up on wearing nice stuff.Since then, I have started to get my hair cut more frequently and make a sartorial effort. My wife would argue that I have gone too far the other way, as it is fair to say I have developed something of a trainer addiction. I recently wore a box-fresh pair of Yeezys to Chessington World of Adventures, which my wife and kids insisted would lead to the day being ruined by me crying over getting any kind of mark on them. Yeezys are the only fashion item I have ever possessed where, before deciding whether to wear them or not, I have to check the news to see if the designer, Kanye West, has said something twattish.But I ignored my family’s protests. What’s the point of getting nice things if you’re not going to wear them? Half an hour after arriving, a woman in a wheelchair ran over my foot, emblazoning my trainers with a tyre mark, and my family said, “I told you so” a combined total of 1,500 times.What the lockdown has shown me, apart from the importance of not reading the news just before bed, is that I never really left the slob in me behind. Freshly trimmed and smart-clothing Romesh is my Bruce-Banner, and the pants-dwelling, hairy, unkempt, eating-like-an-animal-about-to-go-into-hibernation Romesh has been biding his time until a global pandemic would allow him to re-emerge: the Disgusting Hulk.Obviously, I haven’t had a haircut for ages, but I also haven’t shaved since all this started. At first, I would wear tracksuits and comfy hoodies nice loungewear that, at a push, you might pop to the shops in. Those were the halcyon days. Since then, I have stopped giving any kind of thought to what the outfit looks like, merely ensuring I make some sort of effort to cover my genitals. I have started wearing whatever comes to hand. I type this while wearing a very smart shirt, Gruffalo slippers and boxer briefs. This morning, I walked downstairs in this outfit as if my mission brief was to stop my wife ever having a feeling of sexual desire for me again.Everyone I know has been talking about how they are going to head straight out and aggressively socialise as soon as this is over. I would actively campaign, however, for an extra week or so of lockdown for people to adjust to doing their hair, picking out clothes that are suitable for public consumption, and dressing in a way that won’t lead to arrest. If we don’t have that time allocated, I fear that, for a while, we are going to see people at bars and in shops wearing swimwear and dressing gowns. If that does happen, I will be doing my very best to make shirts, slippers and boxer shorts a thing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb7effdf35ae99ce2399c017e80fe33a27ee12d8/0_0_4032_2419/master/4032..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8084473a6e86957ab48f97bc3cb808f4","title":"tim dowling houseparty app","story":"I realise I’m one technical glitch away from not knowing anyone hereI’ve tried to occupy myself in the garden these past weeks, but gardening turns out to be an activity best enjoyed in the context of a busy life, because germination is slow. I spend a lot of time on my hands and knees, eyeballing the bare earth and thinking: grow, you bastards.I go out once a day to tramp the empty streets, for exercise, or just to get away from the seeds. It’s a bit more public exposure than I’m used to, but it’s exhilarating to find the world remade to suit my social skills. Not only is it OK to cross the street if you see someone coming the other way, it’s polite. You’re actually allowed to stand outside a shop door and wait, just because there’s someone in there already. They’ve got signs up, but you don’t need to teach me the new etiquette. I’ve got a knack for it.I know this isn’t good for me. If my social reluctance isn’t regularly challenged, I will quickly become irretrievably weird. After a circuit of the neighbourhood, I return home. My wife is in the sitting room, engaged in some furious form of needlework.“Did you remember lemons?” she says.“There are no lemons out there,” I say. “It’s a post-lemon environment.”“What’s in the bag?” she says.“I got an artisanal loaf,” I say. “And limes. They had shitloads of limes.”“That’ll do,” she says. My phone pings in my pocket.“Christ,” I say. “People keep sending me links to the Houseparty app.”“Not really your sort of thing,” my wife says.“What isn’t?” says the youngest one, leaning his head through the door.“Dad’s got to go on Houseparty,” my wife says.“I tried it last night,” he says. “You just sit there in little squares, drinking.”“I can’t think of anything worse,” I say.At 7.30pm, I am watching the news when my phone pings again, with another link.“I’ve gotta do this,” I say.“Not here,” my wife says. “Go in the kitchen.”I fill a glass of wine to the brim, open my laptop and download the app. I locate my friend’s account and click on it. He appears in a square, with his glass of wine.“Hey!” he says. “There he is!” He is with his wife, and they are talking to my agent.“I’ve been meaning to speak with you,” my agent says. This seems less like a virtual party and more like a staged intervention.“Hi,” I say. “I don’t really get this.” A flurry of overlapping, distorted speech follows. Another box appears, with another friend in it, someone I have not spoken to in months.“What are you doing here?” he says.“I don’t know,” I say. Another square opens, this time with a complete stranger in it. My agent introduces us.“Hello,” I say. A stranger arrives, then another. This is like the kind of party I would leave early, but it’s followed me home. Actually it’s worse than that, because I can see my own face. Do I always look that panicked?Suddenly, with a gust of feedback, my original friend’s square freezes, turns blue, and disappears.“Uh-oh,” I say. Another square goes blue. I realise I’m one technical glitch away from not knowing anyone here. I imagine a worst-case scenario in which, after a series of accidents, I am left alone in a virtual room with Margaret Atwood. She doesn’t suffer fools gladly, I hear. We are unlikely to hit it off.“I should really start cooking,” I say.“Yes, me too,” says my agent. I close the lid of my laptop as my wife walks in.“Well, I’m never doing that again,” I say.“I’m not sure why you did it in the first place,” she says.“If you need me, I’ll be staring at my seeds,” I say.

It’s a welcome distraction in lockdownEveryone who’s taken part so far has said it’s like doing a gig. There’s the trepidation beforehand, then an hour of craziness, and finally a period where you’re kind of decompressing. The only difference with this is that nobody’s nicking your beers!We’ve done about 30 so far, including our debut album Some Friendly, and there have been some great moments. My personal highlight is me not realising that I’d played Reading festival in 1999 – I still can’t remember it now, even though people have been telling me exactly what happened.I also loved Dave Rowntree revealing his collection of laminated artefacts from the Parklife era – old photos, gig tickets. He made so much effort and that really upped everything because the listening party became a visual thing. The Cribs did one for Men’s Needs, Women’s Needs, Whatever and were showing their old tour diaries and lyric sheets. Those are the kind of insights you don’t often get in a magazine – bands probably wouldn’t want to show those at the time of release anyway, but now there’s a bit of history involved and they feel more relaxed.What I like is that it’s giving people the opportunity to listen to an album in its entirety again. Musicians I talk to, even the younger artists, all want to make an album that’s a masterpiece, that has a theme running through it, a start and a finish. That has been crushed in a way because people felt they didn’t have enough time on their hands. But now all we have is time, so it’s a beautiful thing for this moment.We’ve had listeners from all over: New Zealand, Japan and even Antarctica. Part of the reason we do them at 10pm is because that’s when Japan is waking up. The other reason is because that’s when the 10 o’clock news is on, and I wanted people to have an alternative to that – you can watch the news at any time these days this is a way of offering up an alternative good time instead.It’s not the only thing I’m doing at the moment. I’ve got a new solo album, I Love the New Sky, coming out in May. I spoke to the label about whether we should postpone it, but we agreed it was a good time to put music out, to have something to look forward to. I’ve also been doing some home schooling with my six-year-old. But I’m not a teacher and I don’t think I should try to be. Instead we just go for a walk every day and talk about volcanoes, tornadoes, the coronavirus and the environment. That’s not a bad start, is it? He’s also got into wrestling, so we do a bit of that.But most of my time is spent on these listening parties. I’m always working on them. All day I’m getting direct messages and emails and I’m normally up until midnight answering questions. The listening party itself keeps you on your toes. I usually have a few tweets lined up beforehand – that way I can answer everyone’s questions while it’s live. It’s hard to keep up. There’s so many people out there saying things like “where are we now?” and I have to be on hand to say “two minutes and 34 seconds into track four ... no, it’s two minutes and 36 seconds now!”It’s growing every day. We could keep this going until Christmas. Sleaford Mods have just said they want to do all of their albums, every Thursday at 8pm. That’s what I love about it, it’s all about impulsive decisions and it spirals into a thing of its own.When I was first starting out, I would listen to Harvest by Neil Young to learn how to write songs.

Tie Me Down!. “Hollywood (and Madonna) had fallen in love with him.”Madonna had the flamenco party Almodóvar had arranged for her filmed for the documentary Madonna: Truth or Dare (also known as In Bed With Madonna). “She didn’t ask for permission to use our images, and she even dubbed me, because my English mustn’t have been that good,” Almodóvar complains. “I don’t mind if this seems like a settling of scores – if it had been the other way round (me filming Madonna and her team and making a film with all that material which I would then premiere around the world), I would have taken such a hit in the form of a lawsuit I’d still be recovering from it. Madonna treated us like simpletons and I had to say it one day.”He said Madonna decided on the seating plan and placed Banderas’s then-wife Ana Leza far away from him, with herself by his side. “Antonio’s harassment was one of the main storylines and she, obviously, edited in how she dispatched Ana Leza with only one sentence. At the end of the dinner, Ana dared to get close to our table and told the ine blonde sarcastically, ‘I see you like my husband, it doesn’t surprise me, all women like him, but I don’t mind because I am very modern.’ To which Madonna replied: ‘Get lost.’ All this may seem frivolous, and it is.”He also says Madonna also asked Banderas, who didn’t speak English then, a provocative question via Almodóvar. “Ask him, she told me again, if he likes women to hit him … Antonio made the same gesture, which meant neithernor, but that he was at the service of ladies’ desires.”Madonna has not responded to his post.  has contacted her UK representatives for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/87c33812b429f365e027c4f124acdb26abb360df/0_0_7288_4371/master/7288..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d4abdbddc41c0954e542d549917c9b35","title":"world health organization who v coronavirus why it cant handle pandemic","story":"Attacked by Trump and ignored by many of its most powerful members, the World Health Organization is facing a major crisis – just at the moment we need it most. By  Stephen BuranyiIf, like me, you have been confined to your home, glued to the news and nursing ever greater anxiety about the state of the world, you have probably become familiar with the sight of the World Health Organization’s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, and his daily press briefings. Tedros, as he is known, is a calming presence in the midst of the crisis. Flanked by an international cast of scientists, he always seems confident that if we have hope, listen to the experts and pull together, we will get through this.Watching this reassuring spectacle, it is possible to imagine a world in which every nation respects the WHO’s authority, follows its advice and lets it coordinate the flow of information, resources and medical equipment across national boundaries to areas of greatest need.That is not the world we live in. “The W.H.O. really blew it. For some reason, funded largely by the United States, yet very China centric,” tweeted Donald Trump on 7 April, summing up just one of the many lines of criticism the WHO is currently facing. It is not just Trump – even some of the WHO’s supporters in government, academia and NGOs argue that since the start of the coronavirus crisis, it has caved in to nationalist bullies, praised draconian quarantine measures and failed to protect the liberal international order of which it is a linchpin. “You’ve got a situation where it looks like WHO doesn’t want to exercise its authority,” said David Fidler, a fellow in global health at the Council on Foreign Relations and a regular consultant to the WHO.Meanwhile, the WHO is desperately struggling to get its 194 member states to actually follow its guidance. The WHO’s leaders are “very frustrated,” said John MacKenzie, a virologist and adviser on the WHO’s emergency committee. “The messages come out loud and clear, and some disregard the warnings. The US largely did, the UK largely did.”On 11 March, the day Tedros declared the coronavirus a pandemic, he spoke darkly of “alarming levels of inaction” from many countries. Pressed by journalists to name them, Mike Ryan, the usually no-nonsense Irish trauma doctor who heads the WHO’s Covid-19 response, demurred. “You know who you are,” he said, adding that “we don’t criticise our member states in public”.There is a simple reason for this. For all the responsibility vested in the WHO, it has little power. Unlike international bodies such as the World Trade Organization, the WHO, which is a specialised body of the UN, has no ability to bind or sanction its members. Its annual operating budget, about $2bn in 2019, is smaller than that of many university hospitals, and split among a dizzying array of public health and research projects. The WHO is less like a military general or elected leader with a strong mandate, and more like an underpaid sports coach wary of “losing the dressing room”, who can only get their way by charming, grovelling, cajoling and occasionally pleading with the players to do as they say.The WHO “has been drained of power and resources”, said Richard Horton, editor of the influential medical journal the Lancet. “Its coordinating authority and capacity are weak. Its ability to direct an international response to a life-threatening epidemic is non-existent.”At the same time, the international order on which the WHO relies is fraying, as aggressive nationalism becomes normalised around the world. “All the previous rules about global norms, public health and understanding of what’s expected in terms of an outbreak has crumbled,” said Lawrence Gostin, director of the WHO Collaborating Center on National and Global Health Law. “None of us know where this is leading.”The WHO was born during the moment of hopeful internationalism that followed the chaos of the second world war. The idea of global collaboration in fighting disease was not new – in the 19th century, at periodic International Sanitary Conferences, countries had standardised quarantine procedures for cholera and yellow fever – but the WHO constitution, adopted in 1948, envisioned a far grander global mission, nothing less than “the attainment by all people of the highest possible levels of health”.One of the WHO’s favourite success stories is the role it played in eliminating smallpox, a disease that was still killing millions each year in the 50s, despite the existence of a vaccine. Although the WHO worked on immunisation research, its most vital role was organisational and diplomatic. In 1959, it convinced the Soviet Union to manufacture 25 million vaccine doses, which the WHO would distribute. Not to be left behind, the US donated millions of dollars to vaccination programmes, both directly and through the WHO. By the late 60s, every nation in the UN was sending a detailed weekly report to WHO headquarters on their number of smallpox cases and recent progress. And in 1979, WHO declared smallpox eradicated, a first in world history. The WHO didn’t provide the most money, immunise the most people, or invent key technologies such as the bifurcated needle, but it is hard to imagine smallpox having been defeated without it.If the story of smallpox eradication shows the WHO acting as something like an international ministry of public health, it doesn’t explain its current position as an emergency service, surveying the world for disease outbreaks and springing into action to contain them. That is a more recent addition to its portfolio, which came after a period, in the 80s and 90s, when the WHO seemed to be losing its earlier dynamism. The diseases it was partly created to address – smallpox, yellow fever and the plague – had either been eradicated or were in decline, and it was slow to identify new threats such as HIVAids. Under the leadership of Dr Hiroshi Nakajima, from 1988 to 1998, the organisation stagnated, and some member states complained about poor management and alleged petty corruption.Two things happened at the turn of the century that would shape the WHO we now see tackling the Covid-19 crisis. In 1998, the fiery former prime minister of Norway, Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland, was elected director general. And in 2002, a farmer in China’s Guangdong province became sick with a deadly, never-before-seen respiratory disease that quickly spread among the hospital staff who had treated him, and went on to become the first pandemic of the newly globalised 21st century: one that arose suddenly, had no treatment or cure, and spread with the speed and reach of international business.Given the WHO’s sprawling structure, vague mandate and reliance on diplomacy, its director general holds immense power to shape it. Even before she took on the role, Brundtland was comfortable on the world stage. “I was already a political leader, and I was used to this kind of authority,” she told me. Like her friend Kofi Annan, the charismatic UN leader, Brundtland believed that international bodies should be prepared to lead when necessary, rather than being bossed around by powerful nations. “If the job is to direct and coordinate global health, it’s not a question of what one or several governments ask you to do,” she said. “We are working for humanity.”Brundtland pushed the WHO to use its local contacts, diplomatic channels and the emerging internet to locate potential outbreaks, all of which made the organisation less reliant on national governments for information. Within just a few years, this strategy proved its worth. In November 2002, when the Chinese government became aware of the first cases of a novel respiratory disease, later named Sars, it failed to alert the WHO. But, as part of Brundtland’s new approach, WHO staff were monitoring Chinese medical message boards and news media anyway, and were aware of what was then thought to be an atypical pneumonia outbreak. Adding to their suspicions, on 10 February 2003, David Heymann, who was then executive director of the WHO’s communicable diseases cluster, received an email from the son of a former WHO staff member in China warning of a “strange contagious disease” that had already killed 100 people, but which was “not allowed to be made known to the public”. The WHO took the information it had to China, which made its first official report to the WHO the next day.Although the WHO had no formal powers to monitor and censure its members, Brundtland wasn’t shy about doing so anyway. In the ensuing months she would accuse China of withholding information, claiming that the outbreak might have been contained “if the WHO had been able to help at an earlier stage” and exhorting the Chinese to “let us come in as quickly as possible!” With remarkable speed, China fell in line and shared its data with the WHO. “After her statements to China, no other countries hesitated,” said Heymann.In March 2003, as the disease spread – reaching Hong Kong, Vietnam and then Canada – for the first time in its history, the WHO issued advice against travelling to affected areas. (Before then, the decision to advise on travel had always been left up to member states.) Despite having no formal powers to ground planes, the measures worked. “Passengers and flights dropped dramatically as soon as we issued the recommendations,” said Heymann.The WHO’s response to Sars was considered a huge success. Fewer than 1,000 people worldwide died of the disease, despite it reaching a total of 26 countries. The pandemic was defeated not with vaccines or medicines, but with NPIs, or “non-pharmaceutical interventions” in WHO parlance: travel warnings, tracking, testing and isolating cases, and a huge information-gathering operation across multiple countries, all made possible by the WHO’s willingness to wield authority that it had, in a sense, created simply by speaking it into existence. “Brundtland did things the WHO had no authority doing. She just did them,” said Fidler. “She sort of used Sars as a way to test drive some very radical changes.”“After Sars, the WHO’s position was essentially: that was great, let’s formalise it,” said Clare Wenham, a professor of global health policy at LSE. In 2005, the WHO drew up a new version of the International Health Regulations (IHR), the central legal document that all member states are bound by. According to Fidler, the updated IHR, which is in force to this day, is a radical document. It asks its members to prepare for public health threats according to standards set by the WHO, and to report any outbreaks and all subsequent developments. It also allows the WHO to declare a public health emergency of international concern (or PHEIC, pronounced, incredibly, “fake”), using its own information, over the objection of any single country. During an emergency, countries are expected to take the lead from the WHO’s guidelines and report any deviations to the organisation. All of these requirements, bar the reporting of outbreaks, were new.But the document stopped short of giving the WHO real power if states refuse to comply. “The WHO isn’t Nato, it’s not the security council,” said Gian Luca Burci, who was the WHO’s legal counsel until 2018. The US, fixated on bioterrorism after 911, supported giving the organisation some extended powers, but was opposed by Brazil, Russia, India and China, which were wary of US influence. There was a general reluctance to hand an international organisation any more power. “WHO members were happy with the actions that were taken during Sars, but there was definitely a sense afterward of ‘What if that was us in China’s spot?’,” explained Catherine Worsnop, a professor at the University of Maryland School of Public Policy. In short: thanks for stopping the pandemic, but we don’t want to be told what to do.If the WHO has seemed at times weak or tentative – very un-Brundtland-like – in its handling of the coronavirus crisis, it is partly because of its bruising experiences during the past decade. From 2009 onwards, the WHO faced condemnation from the press and the international community for its handling of successive crises, all during a decade when the financial and diplomatic order that sustained it began to break down.First, there was the outbreak of H1N1, or “swine flu”. The novel influenza virus was discovered in Mexico in March 2009, and by June, when the WHO declared a pandemic, there were more than 28,000 cases in 74 countries. Over the next year, the WHO coordinated the global response – less aggressively than during Sars – and on 10 August 2010, it declared the pandemic over. Almost immediately, the WHO’s approach came under scrutiny. The death toll – 18,500 confirmed deaths worldwide – was far lower than initially expected, particularly given the disease reached more than 200 countries. “Suddenly you have people saying: ‘Wait a minute, you really cried wolf on this,’” says Wenham. The media and several prominent European politicians demanded inquiries as to whether the WHO had mistakenly rung the alarm, and “cost huge amounts of money and frightened people unnecessarily”, as Paul Flynn, the former Labour MP who chaired one of the inquiries, told the Times in 2010.To this day, opinions are split as to whether H1N1 was a crisis headed off, or a false alarm. “The WHO is always at risk of being criticised as doing too much or too little,” said Keiji Fukuda, the former WHO assistant director general who led the H1N1 response. Most of the former WHO staff and academics I spoke with agreed, proposing some version of the following as an iron law of public health: act slowly and you will be criticised for failing to stop preventable deaths act aggressively and stop an outbreak before it becomes serious, and you will be accused of having overreacted. (After all, in the latter case, nothing too bad happened, so what was the big deal in the first place?)Fidler, who largely approves of WHO’s quick action during H1N1, believes that the backlash led the WHO, which was then under the command of director general Margaret Chan, to become too tentative about calling for action in the future. This was a period when the fallout from the 2008 financial crisis was also starting to take its toll on its budget. “There was a big funding shortfall,” said Andrew Cassels, director of strategy at the WHO between 2008 and 2013. “Cuts made to the emergency response programmes, personnel cuts.” The funding gap stood at nearly $300m in 2012. Entire offices were shut, including a team of social scientists working on pandemic response.When the Ebola outbreak struck west Africa in 2014, the combination of the WHO’s greater caution and reduced budget resulted in disaster. In contrast to the previous pandemic, this time the WHO was slow to act, and was widely perceived to have lost control of the situation. In the end, the US and several other nations deployed more than 5,000 military personnel at the request of the affected countries, and an ad-hoc UN committee was created to take over responsibilities from the WHO. The outbreak eventually killed 11,310 people, the vast majority in just three countries – Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone – paralysing their health systems for months, and causing panic across the world. Prominent scientists judged the WHO’s response an “egregious failure”.Much of the blame fell on Chan herself. She appeared shell-shocked, stressing to the press that the WHO was a technical advisory body, and that it was national governments that had ultimate responsibility for their citizens’ health. “She wanted the WHO to be an apolitical agency – more like technical support. There was a hesitancy there to push the full powers of the WHO,” said Sara Davies, a professor of global health at Griffith University in Australia.The bold, proactive culture established after Sars had seemingly faded. Fidler believes that by delaying calling Ebola an emergency, and thus failing to organise an international response at a crucial moment, the WHO’s leadership had shown they “no longer had any faith in their authority”.Today, under Tedros, the WHO finds itself in uncharted territory. Not only is it facing by far the biggest pandemic in its history, it is also having to defend itself from the nations on which it most depends. “In my 25-plus years of working on global health issues, I cannot recall the leader of a prominent developed country threatening to punish WHO in the manner President Trump did,” said Fidler, referring to the recent press conference in which Trump suggested putting “a very powerful hold” on US contributions to the WHO. In the same press conference, Trump accused the WHO of concealing information, being too slow to react to the virus, and, above all, showing favouritism towards China.Since the crisis began, Tedros has been repeatedly accused of being soft on China. Senator Marco Rubio recently told Fox News that the Chinese government had “used the WHO to mislead the world”, and claimed that the WHO “is either complicit or dangerously incompetent”. The US senator Rick Scott put it more bluntly, accusing the WHO of “helping Communist China cover up a global pandemic”. (Tedros, meanwhile, has warned of the dangers of politicising the virus.)Until very recently, the WHO was seen as a relatively neutral arena for China to extend its power. “China likes to find ways within the global system to give it a leading and benevolent image. The WHO was an uncontroversial place to do it,” said Rana Mitter, the director of the University of Oxford China Centre. No longer. The extent of the initial coverup is still unclear, but there is no question that at least at the local level, Chinese officials knew about the outbreak of a novel disease for weeks before it was reported to the WHO. During that time, Chinese doctors were prevented from speaking out.John MacKenzie, the WHO’s emergency committee adviser, told me that the organisation was “a little misled” about the Wuhan outbreak. He says that by the time the government alerted the WHO on 31 December, scientists in China had already determined via genome sequencing that the outbreak was caused by coronavirus. Yet the government didn’t confirm that until 7 January and the full genome sequence was not officially shared until 12 January. “That’s very slow,” MacKenzie told me. “For at least two weeks, we could have been making far more kits and so on for testing.” MacKenzie added that the number of cases officially declared by the Chinese in the first week – 59 in the week ending 5 January – was “nowhere near as many cases as you’d expect”. (The statistics released by the Chinese government continue to be questioned, with some reports suggesting they may have seriously understated the number of coronavirus deaths.)Despite mounting frustrations – in mid-January, China also refused the WHO’s request to send a team of scientific observers to Hubei province, the centre of the outbreak – Tedros has never come close to doing what Brundtland did and calling China out. Instead, on 28 January, he had a closed-door meeting with Xi Jinping in Beijing, and two days later, he praised Chinese efforts to contain the disease, declaring that China is “setting a new standard for outbreak control”. That same day, 30 January, the WHO declared a Pheic, and began issuing prescriptions to countries around the world. On 8 February, China finally allowed WHO observers into the country. For Tedros’s supporters, this was vindication of his strategy of keeping China onside. For his critics, it was too little, too late.Elected as WHO director general in July 2017, Tedros was supported by a bloc of African and Asian countries, including China, which has considerable influence with those members. (Tedros is himself from Ethiopia, where he served as health minister and then foreign minister between 2005 and 2016.) It was a “really nasty” election, said Davies, in which the powers that have traditionally shaped the WHO, such as the US, UK and Canada, lent their support to one of Tedros’s rivals, the British doctor David Nabarro. During the campaign, Tedros was criticised for having served in a repressive government with a poor human rights record, and one of Nabarro’s backers even accused Tedros of covering up a cholera epidemic during his time as health minister. (Tedros denied the claim, describing it as a “last-minute smear campaign”, while Nabarro told the New York Times that he had never authorised his team to make this accusation against Tedros.) In response, Tedros’s supporters mounted “a collective pushback”, said Davies, against the UK and its allies, eventually winning out. Tedros became the first director general from a so-called developing country since the Brazilian Dr Marcolino Gomes Candau in 1953.While his background is in politics, Tedros is not forthright or confrontational like Brundtland. In Ethiopia, his political party, the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) was mostly comprised of ex-revolutionaries, men that “seemed carved out of a rock”, said Fantu Cheru, a professor at American University and former advisor to the Ethiopian government. Tedros was different – jovial and accessible, said Cheru, and able to make personal connections easily. “He is not very ideological, he believes he can work with anyone,” said Mehari Taddele Maru, a professor at the European University Institute in Florence, Italy. Cheru also sees Tedros as a pragmatist. “He’s not in the Chinese pocket. The Americans in particular wanted to destroy his image. Tedros knows how this game works. You need to have more allies than enemies, and those allies may not have a good track record.”“I don’t think Tedros did anything previous director generals would not have done,” said Anthony Costello, the director of the UCL Institute for Global Health. “He needed a good relationship with China in order to get in.” Even Lawrence Gostin, who has been a prominent critic of Tedros in the past, told me that “his high praise for China is understandable. He is seeking to coax China into cooperation.” He went on to note, though, that this strategy “does risk the credibility of WHO as an objective agency.”If the WHO thought it could sacrifice a bit of its credibility – overlooking China’s obvious blunders in December and January in exchange for its compliance in February – and move on, it was mistaken. The argument over China’s influence has been raging for weeks, not least since the government of Taiwan claimed that the WHO had ignored its own early reports of human-to-human transmission of coronavirus as part of a larger history of appeasing China – which has blocked Taiwan from joining the WHO (and the UN) for decades.Now that Trump, scrambling for an answer to explain why the US now has more cases of coronavirus than any other nation, has alighted upon the WHO and China as his preferred scapegoats, these questions will not go away. “I don’t think we will see the US government cut off funding,” said Fidler. “But what’s happened with this pandemic – with the WHO caught between the USChina rivalry – is not a good omen for the WHO going forward.”While the focus has been on what happened between China and the WHO in January, in epidemiological terms the crisis has moved on. Covid-19 has spread fastest and furthest in the US and Europe, through the very rich nations that largely fund and staff the WHO. Before the outbreak, the WHO struggled to get these same nations to prepare for future pandemics. Now the pandemic is here, and they are at the centre of the crisis, the WHO has been unable to keep them following its advice.Richard Horton of the Lancet said that after the WHO declared a public health emergency, “countries, especially western countries, didn’t listen. Or didn’t seek to understand what was actually taking place in China.” On 5 February, the WHO asked for $675m to fund its Coronavirus response through to April. Anthony Costello of UCL said that when he met with Tedros on 4 March, the WHO had received only $1.2m. (Tedros announced last week that the funding goal had finally been reached, around the time the number of worldwide cases passed 1 million.)Even the decision to declare a pandemic on 13 March – a largely rhetorical distinction, since calling a Pheic already requires WHO members to respond – was calculated to wake its member states up. In the UK the Premier League was still playing games, and the previous week the US had held primary election contests. “They declared a pandemic because countries weren’t taking the advice,” said Adam Kamradt-Scott, a professor of global health at the University of Sydney.The WHO stresses that the ideal response to the crisis is relatively simple. Inidual states should limit public exposure, especially by tracking and tracing all known cases – a strategy that worked in South Korea and appears to be working in Germany. On an international level, states should share scientific information and resources. These are the mantras Tedros goes back to in his briefings: “Test test test” and “solidarity solidarity solidarity”.But countries have repeatedly ignored WHO advice. In the UK, the response has been erratic, lurching between the WHO’s norms and its own strategies, such as the now-discredited pursuit of “herd immunity”. The US didn’t recommend school closures or avoiding travel until 16 March. In Sweden, restaurants are still open.Many wealthy nations have not only pursued their own national strategies for public health, but have also withdrawn from the globalised world of diplomacy and trade that they themselves set up. Earlier this year, for instance, the NHS ordered millions of masks from a French company named Valmy SAS. But in early March, the French government requisitioned all masks produced within the country, so the masks never reached Britain. This week, Germany accused the US of seizing a shipment of masks bound for Berlin from a port in Thailand while Germany previously sent inspectors to the factory of an American company in Jüchen to ensure their medical masks weren’t being exported against government orders.The WHO is battling against a breakdown in international cooperation that is far beyond its capacity to control. “Governments have retreated to national policies, and this problem predates this crisis,” said Clare Wenham, the health scholar. States have been turning away from international institutions for a long time. The WHO hasn’t driven globalisation in the same way as the WTO or IMF, but in a way it has administered it – quietly promising to take on the outbreaks that arise in an industrialised and interconnected world, and relying on the often unspoken norms of international collaboration that underlie it.Ironically, it is most needed now, at a time when faith in the other administrators and overseers of the global order are in decline – a trend that Covid-19 only seems to be accelerating. “As it’s gone on, you see the WHO becoming less important,” said Wenham. “No one is thinking about reducing the global numbers, only their own. The WHO is a global force, but people aren’t thinking globally.”• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28eadaa17df1152397aadc29209f2162f6afa498/0_0_6199_4133/master/6199.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=f578402de2c5504ef3d93a39b02af157 960w","title":"lifting lockdown uk options graded return normality","story":"Life is unlikely to return to normal overnight even once the battle against the virus is won, but several gradual approaches have been suggestedWhile ministers and their medical advisers refuse to be drawn on an exit strategy from the UK lockdown, discussions are under way in Whitehall to explore how a graduated return to work could soften the economic blow while avoiding an upsurge in deaths from the virus. What options are available?Young workers are among the most resilient to the virus, but often the hardest hit financially. A “youth first” policy would aim to release them first, at least in part, so they can get back to work and soften the financial impact of the epidemic. Research from Warwick University this week made the case for easing restrictions on people in their 20s and 30s who no longer live with their parents. Andrew Oswald and Nattavudh Powdthavee estimate that the move would allow 4.2m people to return work, 2.6m of whom are in the private sector, and get the economy moving again. “A young workforce release of this kind would lead to substantial economic and societal benefits without enormous health costs to the country,” the authors write.As recent deaths have shown, however, the young are not impervious to the disease. The Warwick group calculate that their youth-first policy could lead to 630 premature deaths. But if all goes well, others could follow them back to the workplace, their order determined by age and type of work.Shutting schools reduces the spread of coronavirus among pupils and teachers breaking up the social bonds that inevitably build up between parents. But it has a significant impact on economic activity, as so many working parents need time off for childcare and home schooling.An influential review published this week found a “remarkable dearth” of data on the value of school closures during the outbreaks of Sars and Mers, but noted that the measure seemed to have relatively little impact on the spread of those coronaviruses.Government to back £330bn of loans to support businesses through a Bank of England scheme for big firms. There are loans of up to £5m with no interest for six months for smaller companies.Taxes levied on commercial premises will be abolished this year for all retailers, leisure outlets and hospitality sector firms.Britain’s smallest 700,000 businesses eligible for cash grants of £10,000. Small retailers, leisure and hospitality firms can get bigger grants of £25,000.Government to increase value of universal credit and tax credits by £1,000 a year, as well as widening eligibility for these benefits.Statutory sick pay to be made available from day one, rather than day four, of absence from work, although ministers have been criticised for not increasing the level of sick pay above £94.25 a week. Small firms can claim for state refunds on sick pay bills.Local authorities to get a £500m hardship fund to provide people with council tax payment relief.Mortgage and rental holidays available for up to three months.More sophisticated options are available than simply reopening schools en masse, which would risk fuelling a second wave of infections. A more cautious approach may see schools staggering their opening hours, lunch and break times, keeping playgrounds closed and class groups constant, introducing more space between students and having a shorter school week.There is a case for opening primary schools first: they tend to be smaller than secondaries and it is predominantly younger children who keep adults from working. That said, the impact of closures on mental health and education are more severe for secondary students.“One problem is that we don’t have much information to guide us,” said Professor Russell Vine at UCL, an author of the review. “We need to get the clever modellers looking at this, and looking at how these might interact with other elements. But I think society also need to discuss it.” Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https:audio.guim20200408-57750-gnl.sci.20200409.ms.covid_19_lockdown.mp3 Britain desperately wants an effective antibody test that reveals who has had the virus. Those who test positive for coronavirus antibodies will presumably have some immunity and in principle might be allowed back to work. It could make a dramatic difference for NHS staff and other carers who work with vulnerable people.Immunity passports are not straightforward, though. A positive antibody test does not mean someone is well protected, or protected for long. What the immune response means in the case of this particular disease is still unknown. Another concern with immunity passports is that they blur the rules of the lockdown and encourage others to take the restrictions less seriously.A gradual easing of restrictions on shops and businesses would help the economy, but the spectre of a second wave of infections is ever present. Certain types of shops could reopen, but with strict limits on hours and numbers. The construction and manufacturing industries have already been sent new guidance from Alok Sharma, the business secretary, who said work could continue if done in line with social distancing rules “wherever possible”.Health officials will be watching European countries that are stating to relax their own lockdowns. In Austria, where new cases have been falling for some days, the schools will remain closed, but small shops, DIY and garden centres are due to reopen after Easter.• Coronavirus and volunteering: how can I help in the UK?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8af2641ab90761fd30bd1d95dd2569f85bea02ea/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=81ccb50f395ce8a1fc9072e718704d00","title":"matt hancock urges public not to overuse ppe","story":"Health secretary says protective equipment should be treated like ‘precious resource’ The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has urged NHS staff not to overuse personal protective equipment, sparking criticism from doctors’ and nurses’ leaders.“We need everyone to treat PPE like the precious resource it is,” he said on Friday. “Everyone should use the equipment they clinically need, in line with the guidelines: no more and no less.”After weeks of criticism over the lack of vital equipment, Hancock told the daily Downing Street briefing a “herculean effort” was under way to ensure every health and social care worker dealing with coronavirus has the equipment they need.The government does not recommend the general use of protective face masks to slow the spread of disease, and Hancock warned the public against overusing protective equipment.He reiterated that hand washing, social distancing and staying at home are the best ways to avoid infection. “A front door is better than any face mask”, he said.Hancock and the chief nursing officer, Ruth May, declined to give a figure for how many healthcare staff have died after contracting the virus.The health secretary said a nationwide delivery system had been set up, with the help of the armed forces, to distribute masks, aprons and other equipment to 58,000 healthcare providers.He said: “We’ve had to create a whole new logistics network, essentially from scratch.” Within a week, every NHS hospital would be receiving daily deliveries, he added.The shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth, welcomed the promise that more PPE would reach the frontline but pressed Hancock to ensure his target was met.Ashworth said: “This isn’t the first time ministers have given NHS and social care staff big promises on PPE. But there has been a mismatch between statements at Downing Street press conferences and the realities facing health and care staff on the ground.“Staff have been raising the lack of PPE for weeks. We hope the government’s plans today deliver the adequate supplies of PPE our brave healthcare staff deserve.”Doctors’ and nurses’ leaders criticised Hancock’s plan as inadequate, given the growing death toll of NHS staff from coronavirus. The British Medical Association said PPE shortages could spell “real disaster” for doctors. It also took issue with Hancock’s insistence that the NHS has enough PPE to go round but needs frontline staff to use “no more and no less” than they clinically require.Dr Chaand Nagpaul, the BMA’s chair, said: “We are dealing with an unknown, highly infectious, and potentially deadly virus that has already claimed the lives of several healthcare workers, including 11 doctors in the UK.“It is absurd that the people trained to treat this disease are the ones who are not being appropriately protected – and without them, we face real disaster.“We note the government’s announcement this afternoon … However, PPE should not be a ‘precious resource’ and for NHS staff facing shortages of protection they need today, they don’t want to hear of a plan, but that this vital equipment is made available to the frontline now.”Susan Masters, director of nursing at the Royal College of Nursing, also voiced scepticism that Hancock’s pledges would end the supply problems that are causing alarm among staff, and denied nurses were misusing PPE. Masters said: “These figures on deliveries are only impressive when nursing staff stop contacting me to say what they need to use wasn’t available. The calls are still coming through – people are petrified. They have seen colleagues die already.“Things have improved in recent days and I credit the government with that. But the safety of nurses and care staff must not be compromised. They are pretty clear about what they need to do to stay safe and they will be angered by any suggestion they cause shortages by misusing kit.”As well as promising to tackle what he acknowledged was the “enormous challenge” of ensuring PPE reaches those who need it, Hancock said lab capacity had been increased sufficiently to allow any health or social care worker who needs it, to be tested.He visited a newly opened “mega-lab” in Milton Keynes on Thursday and said 15 drive-through testing centres were available.He stressed the complexities of meeting demand for PPE against the background of rocketing global demand, and without a significant domestic supply sector.Diplomatic staff around the world have been pressed into service trying to source equipment, Hancock said, with Whitehall officials in London trying to organise transporting it to the UK.He praised firms, including Burberry and Rolls-Royce, which have turned their facilities to manufacturing PPE – and urged others to do so, based on requirements published by the government. “If you’ve got production facilities, and you can meet our published specifications, we want to hear from you,” he said.Appearing alongside Hancock, May underlined the toll, both physical and mental, that treating the virus is having on her frontline colleagues. But she said they were heartened by the public’s support. “The rainbows and NHS signs in the windows lift me, and they lift my colleagues,” she said.She and Hancock emphasised the importance of the public continuing to use the NHS for conditions unrelated to the coronavirus."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18e272edf850b09ed6b81d04ccf6fd343246255c/0_66_2016_1210/master/2016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5bf83b5c4a02c08a64e513520fd343a9","title":"rugby union england rescheduled japan tour expanded six nations","story":"England could move their summer tour of Japan back to October and take part in a bumper “home and away” Six Nations beginning in November as part of a radical overhaul of the calendar because of the coronavirus crisis.Eddie Jones’s side have a two-Test tour of Japan in July but while that will almost certainly not go ahead the Rugby Football Union chief executive, Bill Sweeney, has revealed England could travel to east Asia in October instead.Sweeney also said if the southern hemisphere nations are unable to fulfil their autumn fixtures a wider Six Nations tournament, that would also include next year’s fixtures, may be introduced.Those proposals could put the RFU on a collision course with Premiership Rugby, who may either be trying to finish the current season or start the 2020-21 campaign in the autumn. If that is the case, England internationals could be unavailable for their clubs for weeks on end, given the 2020 Six Nations tournament also needs to be completed, raising questions over player welfare and player release. The scenario could mean England playing anywhere up to seven matches in October and November.Any proposal to restructure the season would have to be put to the Premiership via the Professional Game Board but a senior source said that in the autumn “there will be a massive compression of club and international fixtures and it’s not all going to fit”.“If we weren’t able to travel to each other we’d want to do something to fill our gap, so we’re looking at a range of different contingencies. An obvious one is: do you stage a Six Nations in the autumn but link it into the Six Nations the next year, and you have a home and away series?”The Japan tour was to be a developmental opportunity for fringe players with England’s World Cup squad rested but Jones has recently suggested that is no longer the case in light of the enforced break. He will have guaranteed access to England players for the rearranged Six Nations match against Italy but it may need to be negotiated for rescheduled summer tours.“The situation is hypothetical,” said an RFU spokesperson. “As you would expect the RFU is talking to all parties to consider every possibility in the best interests of players and fans. The impact of Covid-19 requires cooperation and compromise and there may be opportunities for both club and country from rescheduling the calendar.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd3c74de5a33618be726bc41db1416afb78795af/91_45_2993_1796/master/2993.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1f0790d21b2be90965d2959862f5f399","title":"the masters tiger woods 2019 comeback unforgettable success augusta","story":"No one who witnessed the American’s astounding comeback victory at Augusta in 2019 is likely to forget what they sawThe propensity of the Masters to deliver moments in time is beyond golfing parallel. They needn’t always arrive at the tournament’s 72nd hole. If the Hogan Bridge, Butler Cabin and Magnolia Lane define Augusta National, its celebrated tournament also has reference points throughout the sprawling acreage.When Ian Poulter is taken back to the Masters Sunday of 2019, he recalls his view from the 13th tee. Poulter was one of a quartet from the tournament’s closing two groups – each consisting of three players, unusually – to find water at the 12th. Behind him Tiger Woods played safe on the world’s most famous par three and found dry land.“I looked across as he hit his shot into the middle of the green and from that point he had control of what he was doing,” says Poulter. “It was inevitable.”“It” was a 15th major championship, Woods’s first since 2008 and a conquest for which words barely deliver justice. The intervening 11 years had witnessed adultery shame, fitness woes and a form slump that triggered the widespread depiction of a fallen hero. Tremors reverberated beyond sport as this instantly recognisable figure conjured the ultimate redemption tale amid wild, uncharacteristic celebration.Courtesy of a win in 2013, Adam Scott has automatic entry to one of sport’s most exclusive spaces: the champions’ locker room at Augusta National. Having signed off with a 73 for a share of 18th, 12 months ago, Scott seized an unexpected opportunity. The Australian discovered “seven or eight” past Masters champions gathered round a television. “I came in having finished and they were all sitting there,” says Scott. “I thought: ‘This is cool.’ I mean, you don’t all hang out that much. You don’t get that group of people together very often. There was definitely a fraternity feeling. Everyone was very excited that Tiger was doing what he was doing.“As I was finishing my round you got a sense, as he was taking the lead on the back nine, that something special could be happening. There’s always an electricity in the air at Augusta on a Sunday, but then when Tiger or certain people are in the mix there’s something more. All of us were definitely cheering hard for Tiger to win. You just had that sense it was a significant moment in the sport again.”This was no standard Masters denouement even before Woods set pulses racing. Storms forecast for Augusta ensured early tee times and those three-balls as opposed to pairs. Woods started day four two shots adrift of Francesco Molinari, tied with Tony Finau and one ahead of Brooks Koepka. “We had never really been in contention on the last day of the Masters so it didn’t feel ‘different’ for us,” says Ricky Elliott, Koepka’s caddie, of a dawn alarm call.From a personal nadir – Woods was found by police slumped behind the wheel of his car in May 2017 and charged with driving under the influence – there had been traces of a full professional recovery. Woods won the Tour Championship at East Lake in late 2018. Shortly before the Masters, Woods knocked Rory McIlroy out of the WGC Match Play in Texas. “He played very well,” says McIlroy. “I could see him as one of the Masters favourites on the back of what I saw there. He was driving the ball better. With how good his iron play is, if he drives it well he will always have a great chance at Augusta.” Woods had Georgia on his mind all right. “Augusta started probably back in October, November,” he said last February of his Masters planning.You cannot win the Masters on Thursday or Friday but you can sure as hell lose it. A 70 and a 68 had Woods one stroke from the halfway lead, held by a quintet including Scott, Molinari and Koepka. “There wasn’t much conversation with Tiger during those first two rounds,” says Jon Rahm, one of his playing partners. “But that isn’t unusual at a major.”A Saturday pairing with Poulter led people to highlight the “new” Tiger. In 2018 the duo were also third-round companions but nowhere near Masters contention. “He shot five under, I shot four under and I played great,” says the Englishman. “At that point I was thinking: ‘If I can have another day like that I might have a chance.’ He was ready, he had all the shots and was pretty damn good. He had more of his game together than a year earlier, by a mile. There was a buzz out there all day Saturday. Playing with him was fun, but you could sense he was lurking.”Poulter had Koepka and Webb Simpson for company in the penultimate group. Koepka’s threat to Woods was obvious: the Floridian arrived at the 83rd Masters having won on two of his previous three major outings. With Molinari holding a two-stroke lead, Koepka and Woods were level at 11 under par before disaster, namely Rae’s Creek, struck for the reigning US Open and US PGA champion at the 12th.“We were a couple behind Frankie so I think Brooks felt he had to do more and changed his line a little bit,” explains Elliott. “He maybe lost a bit of patience. If he had been in the last group and seen everyone in front dunk it in the water he might have thought differently.”Molinari’s horrid capitulation also started at Golden Bell. The Italian, who brushed Woods aside en route to Open Championship glory the previous July, shared fifth from such a commanding earlier position. “Having the Claret Jug and winning a major not long before already told me I was able to do it,” Molinari says. “In some ways it made the disappointment a little bit bigger that time I wasn’t able to close it out.”Elliott can reel off Koepka’s closing stretch as if it were yesterday. “Eagles 13, great chance at 14 and left it short, 15 I thought he had holed it for eagle, 16 the ball just stayed above the slope ...” The key, though, is that Koepka was “right back in it”. Woods delivered a crushing blow to all the young pretenders with a glorious for-the-ages tee shot at the par three 16th, almost resulting in a hole-in-one. The Olympic swimming legend Michael Phelps, in the gallery directly behind Woods, was among those caught in the moment.Elliott adds: “We were on the 17th tee when Tiger’s shot came in. We were pin high, standing on tip toes watching it. It looked like it was going in the hole. So it’s incredible to be there, in that moment even though Brooks was still in the hunt. Tiger now had a two-shot lead but that’s no gimme at Augusta.“We were playing catch-up all day and it didn’t really feel like we gave it away. In hindsight, if he had holed a couple of putts it could have been a backdoor win. We were never ahead, always behind, so we weren’t kicking doors in afterwards. It was an unbelievably exciting day.”Woods’s playing of the last was conservative. And rightly so. A bogey five would be sufficient for victory, meaning the champion-in-waiting found himself short and right of the putting surface in two. “When I was walking up on the green, to see my family and friends there through the chute, I started to get a little bit emotional,” Woods says. “I had to rein it back in and say: ‘Hey, it’s not quite over yet.’”When it was, Woods couldn’t anticipate he would have to wait at least 19 months for a title defence. Through horrible, unforeseen circumstances, this somehow manages to add to the allure of what transpired on 14 April 2019. An enduring story has been allowed a broader canvas. No one who witnessed this will ever forget it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e4cc98a8b7bb4248172b689b3e36c6673e948d4/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef87416d4639999e5a24573b9a62fd4b","title":"vacuum month sport that never was barney ronay","story":"In the weeks since sport came to an abrupt ending, its only significant story has been its own cancellationThe best way to annoy a group of scholarly historians, if you ever have an urgent need to annoy scholarly historians – perhaps in some kind of emergency situation – is to propose a counterfactual analysis of events.You know the kind of thing. What if Winston Churchill had died of a heart attack in 1941? What if skiffle, rather than the music of the Beatles, had seized the imagination of the world in 1963?This is an inflammatory line of reasoning, interesting to readers of alarming pulp novels about the Third Reich taking over the world, but likely to cause an outbreak of pipe-chewing, tweed-flapping rage within the common rooms of Big History. It is also an interesting dynamic when applied to sports writing and sports analysis. Most of it would collapse if the counterfactual analysis were outlawed.What is Expected Goals, or the Expected Points Table, or a counterintuitive stats-based gallery of the leading creative left-backs in Europe (No 5 will surprise you!) if not the type of “unhistorical shit” that so enraged the 20th-century historian EP Thompson? What is a revisionist colour sidebar take on the managerial achievements of José Mourinho, but the kind of counterfactual “parlour game” EH Carr, chronicler of the early Soviet Union, would have raged against?And yet right now counter-facts are all sport has. In the ’s pages this week you will have seen detailed analysis of a significant staging point: 100 days since coronavirus took hold and changed the world. This has mainly been a business of hard facts, sifted out from an overload of actual real-world news.But not in sport. It is a month now since the first cancelled Premier League Saturday, a month since sport basically stopped. And this is the one significant event sport has to offer, its own cancellation. The story didn’t happen. That’s the story. It feels like counterfactual history in action. The best way to understand what happened in sport between March and April 2020, is to understand what didn’t happen.At which point wind chimes tinkle, the screen starts to dissolve, and we’re back in the undoctored timeline, the one where sport still exists, where the talk of an illness in China remained talk of an illness in China, and where the wheels of Big Sport have continued to grind on.In counterfactual April 2020 more than 300 unplayed professional men’s and women’s football fixtures have been played in the last four weeks. Close to £1bn in revenue has still been raked in.In the Premier League Liverpool stuttered a little, then romped across the line, clinching the title with victory at Manchester City on 5 April, a moment that confirmed once again in its sheer operatic sweep that Premier League football is, and always will be, the most important thing currently happening to human civilisation.Pep Guardiola declared himself “so very, very happy”, albeit in a murderous, glassy-eyed sarcastic whisper. The Liverpool board announced that the title win was “vindication for a community club where finances take second place to our football family – and let’s face it nothing’s ever likely to test this idea so there you go.”Elsewhere news of Cristiano Ronaldo’s agreement to sign for Manchester United on a world record weekly wage led to questions in parliament over footballers’ salaries. “We have always backed the right of the market to decide how much iniduals earn, this is all good for Britain,” Matt Hancock, MP for West Suffolk, announced, to cheers from the benches.England’s cricketers continued to rebuild the Test team along strict attritional lines, battling out all 10 days of the two-match series in Sri Lanka to seal a triumphant 0-0 series draw. At home the ECB continued to plan for the Hundred, the nonexistent tournament involving nonexistent teams played out in front of nonexistent fans, which actually doesn’t sound such a weird idea these days.Meanwhile, in the one really astonishing turn of the non-Covid timeline, Formula One announced that it would cease to function with immediate effect, having re-evaluated its place in human society, renounced its role as a carbon-fed playground for the mega-rich, and apologised in particular for the last decade of watching the best car win in dubiously-framed locations around the world. So congratulations, there, Formula One.Away from all this the real business of sport didn’t un continue. It was announced that a combined one million miles would not go un-run in the postponed London Marathon, and £50m of charity donations not be deferred in the process. Around the country 350,000 amateur cricketers would not miss their final winter nets, and continue to look forward to another endless summer.The FA would not cancel completely the seasons of at least 100 leagues in men’s and women’s non-league football. Similarly the results of the entire sub-pyramid of the amateur game – hundreds of leagues, thousands of clubs – were not declared null and void and scrubbed from the record.In the wider world hundreds of thousands of coaches, teachers and volunteers did not stop working away at grassroots sport and the shared health of the nation. A combined two million people from the age of four upwards didn’t fail to participate in cancelled parkruns. And beyond this an unquantifiable mass did not fail to take their first step into sport or to come back to some kind of a more active life.This, then, is the counterfactual history of sport March-April 2020, a month of urgent unhappenings and eventful nonevents. There will be quite a bit more of this to come from here. The important part, when it all starts up again, will be to remember which of those absences seemed to matter the most."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db1062ef09a74c4bbb62158549222dbe2bf317df/0_10_4247_2550/master/4247.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9ad01cd5aa8550dff53f50727e9d9aa3","title":"talking horses perfect match the answer to hong kongs sunday card","story":"French jockey Antoine Hamelin looks poised to make a big start to his hastily arranged career in the regionAntoine Hamelin may be able to make a dream start to his career in Hong Kong, having been handed the ride on Perfect Match (10.45am London time) in the Austin Handicap, the final and most valuable contest on Sunday’s fixture at Sha Tin. The card is to be screened live in Britain on Sky Sports Racing and is expected to attract plenty of interest from fans of horse racing here, starved of local action for weeks and likely to remain so for some time. made a tentative initial foray into Hong Kong tipping on Wednesday’s card at Happy Valley and found it entertaining without being especially rewarding, though the final winner spared our blushes. Sha Tin is not as sharp as Happy Valley, being a mile and a quarter around, and there is generally less trouble in running, though the draw can still play its part. There is a straight five-furlong course which can favour those drawn high, towards the stands’ rail.Hamelin is among those who may find these thoughts helpful, since he hasn’t ridden in Hong Kong for years and was drafted in from France last month when it became clear that they were in danger of running out of jockeys. Having made it there just before the border closed to incoming foreigners, he has had to spend a fortnight in isolation before being allowed to compete.Hopefully, he has been studying the form and keeping fit because Perfect Match has an obvious chance. The four-year-old has had six tries over seven furlongs at Sha Tin, yielding five wins and a neck defeat. His career best effort came in January when he made all to win a Class 1 contest.Given a 62-day break after that, he never got into the argument when stepped back to six furlongs a fortnight ago, his wide draw not helping. But that may set him up for a better effort at his favoured distance, just as a defeat over six appeared to do in November.Beauty Legacy, the mount of Joao Moreira, will have his supporters, having won a similar race in January. But he has looked regressive since then and it is a concern to see the hood and tongue tie ditched this time.5.30am No local form to go on here but Smiling Face is a plausible winner on pedigree, being the first foal out of a half-sister to Lily’s Angel and Zurigha, who were both precocious enough to be running in Group races as juveniles. Smiling Face has had three barrier trials and managed to win one.6.00am It’s been a long slide down the ratings for Roman Odyssey, who started on a mark of 70 when arriving from Australia three years ago and got all the way down to 34 before scoring at the Valley in January. He’d been second on his previous start, so it looks like the step back to the minimum distance has also helped, and the removal of the hood may also have been a factor. This is his first try over five at Sha Tin since June, when he was in a higher grade.6.30am There has been a recent return to some kind of form by the veteran Amazing Agility, who used to compete at a much higher level. He was a nearest-finish second over this course and distance in February, so it was counter-intuitive to step him back in distance last month. He finished like a train and might only have needed another stride. This could be his day.7.00am Moreira is legged up for the first time on Noble Desire, who finished powerfully over five furlongs at Happy Valley a fortnight ago. This return to six should help and he may be a value alternative to Good View Clarico, an impressive winner on the straight course last time but not certain to appreciate this extra furlong.7.30am Another chance here for Moreira, who gets on Leading Fortune after the horse achieved a career best last time, running on gamely over six. The extra furlong can make a difference.8.00am A few interesting youngsters here, including Chevalier Prince, who could be a threat on this Hong Kong debut. But Colonel looks like one going the right way in light of his second to a hot favourite in mid-March and Zac Purton is an encouraging booking.8.35am Here’s an early chance for Hamelin to make his mark, as Best For You scored over this course and distance just two starts ago. He could never get in from his wide draw when stepped back to six last time and got carried very wide in the straight, ruining any chance he might have had, but ran on dourly and can do better from stall two.9.05am In his last five runs at Happy Valley, Naboo Star has shown sustained improvement, twice winning handily and knocking on the door the rest of the time. He needs to show he can reproduce that improvement back at Sha Tin but if so the extra time to make his challenge could be useful.9.35am With form figures of 1411, Trust Me is not hard to spot. Ditching the hood and fitting blinkers seems to have triggered plenty of improvement and the manner of his two latest wins suggests there is more to come.10.10am In similar vein, Fantastic Show looks one to stick with, for all that this is a step up in class on his two recent successes, both of which came after the fitting of blinkers. He is much better drawn than an obvious rival in Joyful Heart and, with Moreira back in the saddle, can make it three in a row."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9268bbaf07368817b86df4c06e1ba2df4d045cd/1_0_2601_1562/master/2601..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e25184c2d9aaa983a5f5acd01cc4a4b8","title":"dont let a weak bladder stop you doing the things you love","story":"Avoiding playing vigorous sports? Sex life gone from G-spot to pee spot? The London Clinic’s Jane Simpson explains what we can do to tackle incontinence – including kegel exercises that you can do wherever you are As a continence nurse specialist, I’ve seen firsthand how overwhelming and upsetting incontinence can be. Patients visit me when things have gone too far – their behaviours change and they’re suddenly avoiding activities such as playing tennis, having sex or even going to the cinema because they’re worried about having to race to the toilet. When you start avoiding things you enjoy, it’s time to take action.Of course, leakage can be troubling at any moment, but during sex it’s particularly distressing (it tends to happen during an orgasm or because of the physical pressure). But the good news is, it doesn’t mean the end of your sex life. In fact, patients always say they wish they’d sought treatment sooner. Even if you don’t experience leakage, sexual sensation and satisfaction can be improved, too – and who wouldn’t want that? As well as increasing blood supply to the vagina and penis, pelvic floor muscle training (or “kegels”, as they’re also known), can improve muscle tone and maintain nerve activity, meaning better sex.When it comes to treatment for accidental leakage, it depends on the type of incontinence people are dealing with. “Stress incontinence” is when we suffer leakage while doing things such as sneezing, coughing or laughing, and it’s common for women to experience this after having a baby, when the pelvic floor is weakest. Leaking during sports or sex falls under this category, due to weakened pelvic floor muscles. The other common type is an overactive bladder, or “urge incontinence”, which feels like you have to urinate suddenly and often.Pelvic floor exercises can help in both instances, but it’s really important to make sure you’re doing them properly – speak to a women’s health physiotherapist or a continence specialist if unsure. They’re simple – just squeeze, lift and hold the anus and vagina, count to five and repeat five times. Improvement is fast – you’ll notice a change in six weeks if you do them regularly. There’s also a brilliant app called MyPFF, which reminds you to do your exercises.If an overactive bladder is the problem, lifestyle changes are key – symptoms can be worsened by too much caffeine, alcohol, fizzy drinks, spicy foods and stress, for example. Certain medications can also play a part, as well as conditions such as constipation, urinary tract infections and vaginal atrophy. Bladder retraining is great – when you have an urge to pee, you teach yourself to hang on, which slowly expands your bladder capacity. It might also be worth avoiding high-impact sports until your pelvic floor is stronger, since too much exercise can make things worse. Medication and surgery could be considered with a specialist, too.I definitely sense a change coming in the way we discuss women’s health issues and incontinence, and it’s great the conversation is becoming more open. There shouldn’t be any shame or stigma around it any more – this sort of condition affects so many of us. I hope people realise improvement is possible and that once the issue is tackled, it really can be life-changing. Recently, a woman visited me in my clinic and said that just having a treatment plan in place has made her feel better. It really is the very least we deserve.As incontinence affects one in three women over 35, we should all be having more open conversations about this everyday condition that impacts women of all ages.

And for many women that means that things get decidedly less dry.Unlike when a girl starts her period, which in many cultures is celebrated, and in the UK is now respected with a government campaign to provide sanitary products in schools, when a woman’s periods begin to end, it’s seen as a change towards old age, towards a body that’s “done”. And even for those going through menopause, it has often felt pretty taboo to talk about the daily problems – especially bladder weakness.“Don’t make me laugh, I’ll wet myself!” might seem like an age-old joke, but it’s one that’s true for menopausal women. And when it comes to our sex lives, it’s no laughing matter. There’s fear and shame and women shut down, choosing not to be intimate for fear of leaking urine during a passionate moment.After all, when do you slip “I’d love to have an early night but I’m worried I’ll wet the bed!” into the conversation, whether you’re with a long-term partner or someone new?The good news is this conversation is being reclaimed by women in the spotlight, who are starting to talk about the final menopause taboo of bladder weakness. Well, we talk so much about starting our periods – why would we not talk about stopping them, and how this affects your love life?It seems there has been a realisation that no matter whether you grace the red carpet and TV screens or you’re on the school run with grandchildren or off to the office, menopause will happen to every woman. Take Gwyneth Paltrow, for example, who released a video for her wellbeing site Goop, saying: “I think menopause gets a really bad rap, and needs a bit of rebranding.” Her video Madame Ovary spoke about mood swings and sweats, while British actress Emma Thompson has joked how hot sweats mean she’s not cold on the red carpet.OK, so the conversation is shifting – just like we can now see a tampon string in a TV ad (thanks to Sport England’s This Girl Can campaign), women are no longer sitting quietly while they deal with the side effects of menopause. But there is one subject that still has to work hard to find its way into our vocabulary – bladder weakness.We can talk hot flushes, night sweats, mood swings – all with increasing honesty. But then there’s Nadia Sawalha, who struggled with incontinence in silence. The usually outspoken TV presenter kept quiet about bladder weakness until she was forced to speak about it after having an accident on national TV.Why is it the one part of menopause women can’t talk about? Well, leaking during the day is one thing – the embarrassment of needing to find some alternative underwear, for example – but when it comes to sex, it’s a different matter altogether. Women who have bladder weakness and might have an accident during sex are likely to close off to their partner, so worried they’ll spoil the intimacy that they don’t have sex and even make up excuses, or “blame” menopause. Intimacy is not synonymous with leakage.After all, when you’re not sure whether you might lose control of your bladder, being intimate isn’t always top of the list. Talk about mixed messages! Women are encouraged to embrace their ageing, to love who they are and how they look – to go grey with glamour and grace, or to wear a bikini with pride. Just don’t mention the bladder weakness, right?!As periods end and change, we have to adjust. The problem is, the world doesn’t seem to adjust with us. And women are left in a strange quagmire of going through something so natural and even primal in silence and, often, shame.And with two-thirds of women over 40 affected with bladder weakness, and many revealing it has affected their mental health, it’s time we became more open and honest about how bladder weakness affects us.Meg Matthews, who has been campaigning about the menopause and runs megsmenopause, says: “Bladder weakness, also called bladder incontinence, is a very common consequence of menopause. It’s not easy to talk about this topic, and, because women don’t always feel confident talking about it, they can feel alone. We need to understand that having bladder weakness is OK. This is the message we need to spread.”But just like when we’re younger, confidence can come back when we use the right products. Once a girl knows she can use a tampon or pad, she’s less worried about her period affecting her day-to-day life. And for women with bladder issues, it’s about a pad that can help you forget there’s even a problem. Then you’ll feel freer to have those more difficult intimacy conversations that you’ve been putting off – and perhaps that early night …As incontinence affects one in three women over 35, we should all be having more open conversations about this everyday condition that impacts women of all ages.

Covid-19, the virus that had been detected on German soil for the first time two weeks earlier, was not among them.Yet the coronavirus is the single reason why the carnival session in Gangelt is now drawing close attention from scientists from around the world: seven people who walked out of the event later tested positive for the virus. A 47-year-old man who performed in the “male ballet” at the Gangelt carnival was the first person in Germany admitted to intensive care with the infection.Gangelt is in the Heinsberg district, which is home to 42,000 people and has since had 1,442 infections and 43 fatalities, more than any other administrative district in the country. The national media has started to refer to it as “Germany’s Wuhan”.A hundred days after a Chinese government website announced the discovery of a “pneumonia of unknown cause”, it has become clearer that the dynamics behind the virus’s rapid expansion across the globe has relied heavily on such “cluster effects”.Each of the countries most heavily hit by the pandemic has reported similar stories of social, cultural or religious gatherings where large numbers spent numerous hours in close company – holding hands, kissing, sharing drinks from the same glass – which then turbo-charged the spread of the pandemic.“One pattern we are seeing across the globe is that wherever there was singing and dancing, the virus spread more rapidly,” said Prof Hendrik Streeck, a virologist at the University of Bonn whose team of researchers has spent the last week carrying out the first “Covid-19 case cluster study” in Heinsberg.“Most infections didn’t take place in supermarkets or restaurants,” Streeck said of his preliminary findings. In Heinsberg, his team of coronavirus detectives could find scant evidence of the virus being transmitted via the surfaces of door handles, smart phones or other objects.Early theories that the virus at the carnival party in Gangelt could have been transmitted through the dishwater in the kitchen turned out to be a red herring: most guests drank their beer from bottles.Instead, he said, transmission took place at “events where people spent a length of time in each others’ close company”, such as apres ski parties in the Austrian resort of Ischgl, the Trompete nightclub in Berlin and a football match in northern Italy.“Mass events are a perfect opportunity for the virus, as people meet total strangers,” said Niki Popper, a mathematician at Vienna’s Technical University whose team has been developing a simulation that could help governments predict the development of the pandemic more accurately.Instead of merely multiplying the number of daily cases by a certain factor, Popper’s example tries to account for what he calls the starting point of “local epidemic networks”.“If you have 100 or 200 people spend enough time in a room with a person carrying the virus, then for example 20 might walk out with the new infection and, after a few days’ incubation time, pass it on to their families and workmates, let’s assume 10 more people each. Within a few days, the virus can thus multiply 200 times with only one new incident - and then continue.”Large parties played a key role in the pandemic’s rapid expansion not just in central Europe, but also in the US and Australia. New York may now be the centre of the US outbreak, but the traditional festivities around Mardi Gras is thought to have been a catalyst for a large outbreak in New Orleans.On 25 February the entire city, with almost 400,000 residents, and an estimated tourist crowd of 1.4 million people from all over the world were swallowed up in a tide of music, floats, extravagant costumes, cocktails and revelry for the climax of carnival.As is traditional in this Louisiana city on the Mississippi, gatherings and parades had begun weeks before, from 6 January onwards. Many people flung the doors of their houses open and crammed in friends, family, neighbours, strangers – all jostling, dancing, hugging, eating and drinking together.There were no social restrictions during carnival. Only weeks later, on 20 March did the mayor of New Orleans issue a stay-at-home order for the city, with Louisiana ordering statewide restrictions two days later, closing schools and all non-essential businesses. “Mardi Gras was the perfect storm, it provided the perfect conditions for the spread of this virus,” said Rebekah Gee, head of Louisiana State University’s healthcare services ision. For health authorities that were still trying to track and contain inidual infections at this stage of the pandemic, party clusters represented a particular challenge since revellers would often travel from and return to other regions, other countries or even other continents.In Australia, for example, at least 30 people including backpackers became infected after attending a crowded dance party at Bondi Beach’s Bucket List pavilion on 15 March. The party took place the night before restrictions came into force on gatherings of more than 500 people, during a weekend of mixed messages from the authorities. Australia’s prime minister was urging people not to gather in large numbers, but also saying he would go to a football game.Many of those who attended the “Back to Boogie Wonderland – Tropicana” event, which told people to release their “inner Caribbean dancer”, later retired to local backpacker hostels with dorm rooms and shared facilities.The Waverley council area, which encompasses Bondi and its backpacker community, has now become a hotspot for Covid-19, with many of its 140 cases linked to bars, clubs and restaurants, including the Bucket List.In many countries, partygoers and organisers have found themselves on the receiving end of a backlash. In Australia, the Bucket List’s Facebook page is full of livid comments condemning “idiots” who gathered to party. In Germany, cars with Heinsberg number plates have had their windows smashed and have been jeered as “corona spreaders”.But the novel coronavirus did not require social gatherings to have an overtly hedonistic character to flourish. In the week of 17 to 21 February, around 2,500 worshippers gathered at the Porte Ouverte Christian church in the Bourtzwiller district of Mulhouse, in Alsace, eastern France, for one of the most anticipated events in the evangelical calendar.They came from far and wide including from France’s overseas territories and Corsica, for a week of fasting and prayer – held annually for the last 25 years.“During the five days, the worshippers greeted each other, pecked each other on the cheeks, and held hands, sometimes while praying during the services,” Nathalie Schnoebelen, spokesperson for the church said afterwards.At the time, nobody thought more of it it would be almost a month before France went into a national lockdown. A small cluster of coronavirus cases had broken out in the unfortunately named Contamines ski resort in the Alps, but most coronavirus cases were still confined to China.“Contrary to what certain politicians have said, we didn’t ignore the basic rules because at the time there were not any,” Schnoebelen said.It was only after the congregation at the Porte Ouverte had dispersed and several worshippers tested positive for the coronavirus that concerns were raised. Among those who tested positive were the church’s main pastor, Samuel Peterschmitt (son of Jean Peterschmitt, who founded the Porte Ouverte church in 1966).In total 18 people from the Peterschmitt family tested positive for Covid-19. Samuel Peterschmitt’s son Jonathan admitted that worshippers had been in close confines for a week in “conditions relatively ideal if a virus wants to develop”.By the time it had been identified as a cradle for the virus, church worshippers had unwittingly passed it on to others. A nurse who had been at the Porte Ouverte is believed to have originated a cluster that contaminated 250 colleagues at Strasbourg University hospital, where she worked.Two retired worshippers returned to their home in the Ajaccio region of the Mediterranean island of Corsica. There are now at least 263 positive cases and 21 deaths on the island.A delegation of five church-goers from French Guiana, led by their evangelical pastor Gilles Sax, returned to the French overseas territory on the north-east coast of South America, on 25 February. Sax said he felt ill and was “trembling like a leaf” as soon as he returned..Other worshippers returned to cities and towns across France - Orléans, Besançon, Saint-Lô, Belfort, Dijon, Mâcon, Briançon, Paris. By 8 March, around 100 coronavirus cases had been linked to the church prayer week.Today, Mulhouse is one of the worst-hit areas in France with local hospitals overwhelmed by patients with the coronavirus.Christophe Lannelongue, until yesterday director general of the regional health authority, said: “It was a kind of atomic bomb that fell on us at the end of February and we didn’t notice it.”In Italy, which has recorded the highest number of deaths as a result of the virus, a Champions League football match between Atalanta and Spanish team Valencia on 19 February in Milan has been described as the “biological bomb” that turned the north of the country into the centre of the country’s outbreak.But scientists like Massimo Galli, the head of the infectious disease unit at the Sacco hospital in Milan, believe the spread is more likely to have accelerated in smaller clusters in the valleys around Bergamo.“We know Covid-19 is particularly efficient at transmitting within familial groups,” Galli told the . “In osterias crowded with elderly people, it would have found a perfect environment.”A similar gathering that brought together older and younger citizens preceded an outbreak of the virus in Italy’s south-east. On 3 March, hundreds of people gathered to pay their last respects at the funeral in San Marco in Lamis, a small city of 13,000. The 74-year-old man being buried had died after complications of what seemed to be a case of seasonal flu.Until that day, there had been seven cases of coronavirus infection in Puglia, the heel of Italy’s boot. The photos of patients in the red zones of northern Italy, and the first fatalities in Lombardy, seemed unimaginable, much like the national lockdown that was extended a few days later across the entire country.However, soon after the funeral, the man’s wife, who had just begun mourning the death of her husband, received a call informing her that her husband had tested positive for coronavirus.According to Ludovico Vaccaro, head of the public prosecutor’s office in Foggia, “a postmortem revealed the man was infected with Covid-19, but the result came out only after his body was released to the family for the funeral. They should have waited for the result of the test before handing over the man’s body.”Authorities said that, a few days earlier, the man had travelled to Cremona, in the north of Italy, to visit his daughter. Upon returning, he began to experience flu-like symptoms.According to doctors and investigators, the man had infected his daughter and wife before he died. At the funeral, they then came into contact with dozens of relatives and friends who gave their condolences to the family with handshakes and hugs, opening a gateway for one of the first clusters in southern Italy. As a result, 110 people were quarantined, dozens of whom tested positive for coronavirus. Two have died.The prosecutor’s office in Foggia has begun an investigation into what the governor of Puglia has called a “catastrophic error”. Behind one of the most dramatic cases of the virus’s spread is human error: if doctors had waited for the test results before handing over the body to family members, perhaps dozens of people could have avoided infection.Thinking of the coronavirus pandemic as a process that can speed up dramatically through human clusters also affects the considerations of policymakers who are plotting a route out of the current lockdown. When governments start to relax the current social distancing measures, can they also afford to allow large social, cultural or religious gatherings to go ahead?“The image of the Covid-19 epidemic as a curve has taken hold in the collective imagination, but my fear is that we are actually dealing with a loop,” said mathematician Popper. “As soon as restrictions are loosened, there could be new clusters that allow the spread to accelerate again.”The story of the pandemic in Vietnam serves as a cautionary tale.The south-east Asian country recorded its first cases of coronavirus on 23 January, a development that prompted swift action from officials. Vietnam kept many schools closed following the traditional lunar new year holiday late in January, and banned flights to and from China on 1 February. It also became the first country outside China to introduce a mass quarantine, when, on 12 February, officials isolated villages about 25 miles (40km) from Hanoi that were home to 10,000 people.Vietnam had detected no new cases for three weeks when a flight from London touched down at Hanoi’s Noi Bai international airport on 2 March. Among the hundreds of passengers onboard was a 27-year-old Vietnamese woman returning after a trip to attend exclusive fashion week events in Europe. Along with her sister, she had sat among guests at a Gucci show in Milan, and watched Yves Saint Laurent in Paris, documenting her travels on Instagram.The woman later told the New York Times that she had flown to Milan on 18 February and that, at the time, “no one was talking about the virus”. She travelled to Paris on 25 February, she added, and said she felt fine when she flew home that week.Days after arriving back in Vietnam, she developed a cough and tested positive for coronavirus, becoming the country’s “patient 17”. As of 7 April, Vietnam has 245 confirmed infections. The effort to trace and contain the virus has to start all over again.• This article was amended on 9 April 2020. An earlier version said it was the Champions League football match between Bergamo and Valencia on 19 February that was described as a “biological bomb”. The match, which was played in Milan, was between Atalanta and Valencia.

Situated close to the town of Grindavík and the popular Blue Lagoon tourist attraction, and only nine miles (15km) from Iceland’s international airport, the region last erupted about 800 years ago (though there have been more recent eruptions offshore). Geological evidence shows the area is fed by five volcanic systems, which seem to come to life in a coordinated way roughly every 1,000 years.The last period of volcanic activity on the peninsula began in the 10th century and continued until the 13th. Unlike typical Icelandic volcanoes, which tend to wake for a few years and then die down, when this region gets going it appears to splutter on and off for up to 300 years, producing eruptive episodes (locally known as “fires”) lasting a few decades. Long thin cracks known as fissures extend up to five miles (8km), producing fountains of lava, usually without large amounts of ash or explosive activity.The most recent “fires” occurred between 1210 and 1240 and covered about 50 sq km of land in lava. At least six separate eruptions occurred, each lasting weeks to months, interspersed with gaps of up to 12 years with no activity. Volcanic rock fragments and particles were carried tens of kilometres by the wind and written sources report the rockfall causing problems for livestock in the area.If a similar series of eruptions occurred today, the Iceland GeoSurvey calculates that runways at Keflavík airport could be coated in 2cm of ash, temporarily halting all flights.“Wind direction during times of ash production is critical – anything with a slight northerly aspect is going to cause problems for the international airport and the metropolitan area of Reykjavík,” said McGarvie.“The worst-case scenario is if lava flows towards the town of Grindavík,” said Kristín Jónsdóttir from the Icelandic Meteorological Office. “There is also other important infrastructure in the vicinity including a geothermal power plant. Hot and cold water supply may be at risk, along with roads, including the road between Reykjavík and Keflavík airport.”Icelanders are rarely fazed by volcanic activity, but they will be keeping a close eye on the Reykjanes peninsula. Because the eruptions are likely to be relatively small and occasional they will be easier to cope with than massive and sudden outpourings of lava like the 1783-84 Laki eruption, but if the pattern is indeed about to repeat, it will present a new kind of challenge for Icelanders.“People on the Reykjanes peninsula, and their descendants for several generations, may have to be on their guard and ready to evacuate every so often,” said McGarvie."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/554d67f612c9fcb5ad3ead4924749df48fbc33ef/0_159_2730_1639/master/2730.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=15ceb9e070023816b87e13fe0857fedf","title":"britons evacuated from wuhan regret coming home coronavirus","story":"Some who left Chinese city as coronavirus hit wish they were still there now that lockdown has liftedLike many of the Britons who were evacuated from Wuhan, the centre of the coronavirus pandemic, it was a difficult journey for Anthony May-Smith, involving a frantic last-minute dash to the airport through the locked down city in January.All those repatriated from Wuhan underwent two weeks of quarantine in the Wirral, and after a brief stint of normality, May-Smith is now back in lockdown, wishing he had stayed put in China.“It’s just really weird, getting thrown back into it,” the 26-year-old from Lichfield said.He never imagined that the UK would end up in a lockdown: “It just makes you think, all the hassle that we went through to come back, was it really worth it?”He was in Wuhan visiting his girlfriend, Yenny, and had been offered a job teaching English there. Now he’s working as a truck driver and regularly sleeps in his vehicle to avoid the risk of infecting his grandparents at home.“Looking at it now, I wish I hadn’t come back,” he said. “I would be coming out of lockdown now, and instead I’m just going into one.”He’s not alone. Fellow evacuee Matt Raw, 38, is enjoying life in lockdown in Knutsford, but said if he’d known how bad the outbreak was going to get in Britain, he would have stayed in China.“It feels a little bit like out of the pot, into the fire,” said Raw, who was living in Wuhan with his wife, Ying, and 75-year-old mother, Hazel, who suffers from dementia. “We made the wrong decision coming back here. We should have stayed in China.”He said the UK was “slow to act” and he was surprised the UK didn’t quarantine people flying into the country. “I just sat watching the news incredulously every single day. What was the point of putting us in quarantine?”He said he feels lucky to be living through lockdown in a spacious house with a garden, adding that his home in Wuhan was more cramped, and like many inner-city apartments in China, had little natural light.“We made our decision based on the best information available at the time. Hindsight is a wonderful thing.” he said. “Yes, I wish we’d stayed there. But by the same token, it’s also nice to be back over here again.”Jeff and Sindy Siddle, now in lockdown in Prudoe, Northumberland, also questioned whether leaving Wuhan had been the best course of action, but decided that – despite their nightmare journey – it was the best thing to do.“Overall I think we still made the right decision, but certainly we have asked the question,” said Jeff.The couple, along with their 10-year-old daughter, Jasmine, had been visiting Sindy’s family in a village in Hubei province, three hours drive from Wuhan, when the lockdown took effect.“Here, we can stay at home, we can do our jobs no problem,” said Sindy, an accounting assistant. “And Jasmine can do her school work. Back in Wuhan I was worried about her being the only one off school for a long time, but now all the kids are off, so I’m much more relaxed.”The one positive to come out of their Wuhan ordeal is their preparedness for the outbreak over here. “I think we are probably more cautious than a lot of the people in the UK because we’ve been through it before,” said Jeff.“We’ve been much more worried about it and we go out a lot less than our friends and family. We’re so worried we don’t go out beyond the garden, other than to the supermarket once a week, and we do click and collect to avoid going in.”The family originally faced being split apart, when Sindy was told she wouldn’t be allowed on the UK repatriation flight as she had a Chinese passport.Chris Hill, another Briton out in Wuhan, faced a similar problem after the Foreign Office was unable to confirm whether his wife and four-year-old daughter, both Chinese nationals, would be able to join him on the flight home.He decided to stay put.“I made the choice to stay because I didn’t want to risk leaving them,” said the 38-year-old from Sunderland, who has lived in Wuhan for 12 years and works as an English language teacher. “I did falter a couple of times and I would start having regrets. But I knew the lockdown wouldn’t last forever.”After nearly 76 days stuck inside, and tight restrictions on movement still in place, he’s confident he was better off in China. “I’m still glad I made the decision to stay,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0246147ac890dff176b2a8b6b453f5394b1cd10a/0_220_6702_4021/master/6702.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3cb55b9bc94e694182a01a6ed93461a9","title":"chinese writer fang fang faces online backlash wuhan lockdown diary","story":"Internet users accuse Fang Fang of handing foreigners ‘a giant sword’ to attack ChinaA Chinese writer who published a diary during her time under lockdown in Wuhan has been subjected to widespread online criticism for publishing her book in English and German.Fang Fang has been accused of contributing to a negative international narrative on China’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic.The popular Wuhan writer began chronicling the lockdown in late January, including criticism of the official response.“How many people have died in Wuhan and their families destroyed?” she wrote on 31 January. “But so far not a single person has said sorry or taken responsibility. I’ve even seen a writer use the phrase ‘complete victory’. What are they talking about?”Her posts were shared widely on social media even as each was quickly deleted by censors, according to the Diplomat magazine.Her Weibo account, which had more than 3.8 million followers, was shut down in February.

Maybe she does not admit that she is unpatriotic, she thought we were extreme, in fact she was just a stupid old lady.”On Weibo, “Fang Fang Diary” has had 380m views, 94,000 discussions, and 8,210 original posts, peaking last week. On Twitter, the hashtag #wuhandiary shows hundreds of critical posts.“The attack on Fang Fang is so vehement and hateful that it’s scary to watch,” said Li Yuan, a New York Times columnist. “Fang Fang herself said that it reminded her of the Cultural Revolution.”On Wednesday, China’s English-language state newspaper said it was “shameful” to see Fang Fang praised in western media that had been dedicated to defaming China’s pandemic response.Citing “observers”, the editorial said her diary was “biased and only exposes the dark side in Wuhan while ignoring the efforts that local people made and the support extended across the nation”.Additional reporting by Pei Lin Wu"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7200859fb487792e1336e456cb1a1b0c126614c/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c3503426875ecac8614c1ddb0a46742","title":"coronavirus at a glance","story":"A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreakKey developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, at least 102,026 people have died as a result of the pandemic. The Baltimore institution says at least 1,681,964 people have been infected, while 374,509 have recovered.The French death toll passed 13,000, the health ministry director Jérôme Salomon said. A further 554 deaths were confirmed in French hospitals and 433 in care and retirement homes.Restrictions will remain in place in Italy for another three weeks, the country’s prime minister has said, although a few types of shop will be allowed to reopen from next Tuesday. Giuseppe Conte said: “This is a difficult but necessary decision for which I take all political responsibility.”The US president said he is creating a second taskforce that will include a council tasked with deciding when to ease restrictions. But Donald Trump, who has repeatedly pushed the idea, insists he is not determined to reopen the economy if he is advised that to do so would endanger public health.Turkey has put in place a two-day lockdown in 31 provinces, including Istanbul, Ankara and other major cities, its interior ministry said, adding that the curbs will begin at midnight and end at the same time on Sunday.

The health secretary, Matt Hancock, said about 19,000 tests are being carried out each day.The UK prime minister has been “able to do short walks, between periods of rest, as part of the care he is receiving to aid his recovery”, Downing Street said. Johnson was moved out of an intensive care unit on Thursday.Hancock said the government is issuing guidance on who needs personal protective equipment and who does not, adding that it will only be used when there is a clinical need. He promised that equipment will be distributed to hospitals daily from next week and production and imports will be increased for the future.Ministers have come under increasing pressure over their continued failure to provide all health workers with the means to protect themselves."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c4a879b5b777ed05ea4f1750756bf84b8bb9b5b9/256_0_3306_1984/master/3306.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=267d5b0ae0318b76cd59d5dbb4bf37e7","title":"coronavirus good news upside blessings covid positive","story":"Though our blessings may be well disguised in this pandemic, we must still count them“Everything bad in life is eventually a blessing.”I’m not sure where I read this – it may well have been in this wonderful novel by Taffy Brodesser-Akner.

A breakdown, a miscarriage, a job lost – they all led to better things.The phrase reminds me of something Winston Churchill supposedly said on losing the 1945 election. His wife apparently told him that defeat may well have been a blessing in disguise. “Madame, if this is a blessing, it is indeed well disguised,” he replied.And yet a blessing it was. Britain got Attlee, the welfare state, the NHS. Churchill got a rest, and then his swansong six years later. The rest is history.And so to the present. Though our current blessings may also be well disguised, we must count them.

Its earliest findings suggest younger children (aged four to 10) are more worried than those in the 11-16 age group. According to parents’ perceptions, their older children are significantly less worried, though researchers point out it can be hard for parents to know what their adolescent children are feeling, in contrast with younger children who may express their fears more openly to their parents.“But one of the things we can see here is that the majority of children are not worrying excessively about it, but seem to be taking it in their stride. There are, however, a significant sub-group who are reporting high levels of worry.”“Research has provided valuable information about how parents and carers can support their children’s mental health in general,” said Creswell. “However, at this point, we know very little about what might be most effective in the current context of Covid-19. We hope to have more than 10,000 parents and carers across the UK complete the new online survey. Their responses will help us really understand how families are coping and what support could make all the difference to children, young people and their families at this time.”Wendy Minhinnett, who leads a support group for parents of young people who struggle with mental health difficulties, said many parents were struggling. “People are feeling really, really isolated and alone. When you are supporting a child with mental health issues, that puts extra pressure on you.”She said families where grandparents normally played a key role but no longer could because of the lockdown had been severely affected, as had families with children diagnosed with autism whose routines had been entirely disrupted.“One parent said, ‘My son will not let me go anywhere because he is so frightened of me catching something’. People are really, really anxious about it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a73d6da193cefdbbc3532068aa6acda3e87b0f7/0_105_3756_2254/master/3756.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e5a770e663d599118e36864245be313","title":"less than 1 of austria infected with coronavirus new study shows","story":"Research appears to scotch hopes of countries being close to relying on ‘herd immunity’The government-commissioned study, reportedly the first of its kind in continental Europe, was led by the polling company Sora, which is known for projecting election results, in cooperation with the Red Cross, the Medical University of Vienna, and other institutions.The study made it possible to estimate the prevalence of acute coronavirus infections in Austria among those not in hospital at the beginning of April, and was designed to provide a clearer picture of the total number of infections, given gaps in testing.The research, if replicated and confirmed elsewhere, would appear to scotch hopes of countries being remotely close to relying on “herd immunity” – where enough of the population is exposed to the virus to build up a combined immunity – as a viable policy option.The study stands in contrast to controversial modelling by researchers at Oxford University who, in one scenario they examined, suggested most people in the UK might already have been infected with Covid-19. Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https:audio.guim20200408-57750-gnl.sci.20200409.ms.covid_19_lockdown.mp3 However, researchers, speaking at a press conference to release the results, said the study provided only a “snapshot” and did not account for asymptomatic infections, or people who were immune.“We did not find out how many people are immune, but only how many people in Austria are currently acutely infected,” said Günther Ogris, from Sora.The issue of the proportion of asymptomatic infections in the population remains highly contested, with a World Health Organization report in February suggesting truly asymptomatic cases were relatively rare. However, another small Chinese study, reported in the British Medical Journal earlier this month, posited that up to four-fifths of all infections could be without symptoms.Ogris said Sora had “defined the population as all people living in Austria”, and added that the youngest test subject was not yet a year old, and the oldest was aged 94.Commenting on the result, the science minister, Heinz Fassmann, said it indicated a low rate of immunity, which meant that without controls there was a continued risk of an exponential growth in infections.“The mountain is higher than expected and we are not yet on the safe side,” he said.Austria’s current policy is to test people with symptoms, especially if they have been to a known hotspot or in close contact with an infected inidual. That means many people, such as those with no symptoms, or no known contact to an at-risk area, go undetected.The country reacted early to the outbreak, closing schools, restaurants, theatres and other gathering places more than three weeks ago, and telling people to stay home.Hospital admissions have stabilised, with the daily percentage increase in infections in low single digits. There have been 319 deaths and 13,337 confirmed cases, of which about 7,000 people are still infected. The study estimated the current number of infections was more than four times that, however, at around 28,500 people. It excluded those in hospital, currently about 1,000 people.The study, conducted from 1-6 April, tested 1,554 people. It did not involve antibody tests, which can tell whether a person was previously infected and is therefore probably immune. Future studies should involve antibody tests, the government has said, to inform policy as the country starts to reopen shops from 14 April.The education minister, Heinz Fassmann, whose portfolio includes research, said: “We must monitor whether there is a second wave and the number of infected people starts to rise again. We are still in a very, very sensitive situation. This study shows that, too. Corona is in our society.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48b0f66b158280333567af408302a7db7fcd3b15/0_7_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=c4a9dacf314c4272d0bfa1012e3081d2","title":"mafia distributes food to italys struggling residents","story":"Organised crime groups offer support to quarantined families who have run out of cashAs Italy struggles to pull its economy through the coronavirus crisis, the Mafia is gaining local support by distributing free food to poor families in quarantine who have run out of cash, authorities have warned.In recent weeks, videos have surfaced of known Mafia gangs delivering essential goods to Italians hit hard by the coronavirus emergency across the poorest southern regions of Campania, Calabria, Sicily and Puglia, as tensions rise across the country.“For over a month, shops, cafés, restaurants and pubs have been closed,” Nicola Gratteri, antimafia investigator and head of the prosecutor’s office in Catanzaro, told the . “Millions of people work in the grey economy, which means that they haven’t received any income in more than a month and have no idea when they might return to work. The government is issuing so-called shopping vouchers to support people. If the state doesn’t step in soon to help these families, the mafia will provide its services, imposing their control over people’s lives.”The ramifications of the lockdown in Italy are affecting the estimated 3.3 million people in Italy who work off the books. Of those, more than 1 million live in the south, according to the most recent figures from CGIA Mestre, a Venice-based small business association. There have been reports of small shop owners being pressured to give food for free, while police are patrolling supermarkets in some areas to stop thefts. Videos of people in Sicily protesting against the government’s stalled response, or people beating their fists outside banks in Bari for a €50 (£44) loan are going viral and throwing fuel on the crisis a fire the mafia is more than willing to stoke.From the first signals of mounting social unrest, the Italian minister of the interior, Luciana Lamorgese, said ‘‘the mafia could take advantage of the rising poverty, swooping in to recruit people to its organisation’’. Or simply stepping in to distribute free food parcels of pasta, water, flour and milk.In recent days, the police in Naples have intensified their presence in the poorest quarters of the city, where men tied to the Camorra, the Neapolitan mafia, have organised home delivery of food parcels. Magistrates have already begun an investigation against a group of people who were questioned while distributing food to local residents.In Palermo, according to La Repubblica, the brother of a Cosa Nostra boss allegedly distributed food to the poor in the Zen neighbourhood, an area with an established mafia presence. When the news broke, the man defended himself on Facebook, claiming that he was only doing charitable work and attacking the journalist who first reported the news.“Mafias are not just criminal organisations,’’ Federico Varese, professor of criminology at the University of Oxford, said. “They are organisations that aspire to govern territories and markets. Commentators often focus on the financial aspect of mafias but they tend to forget that their strength comes from having a local base from which to operate.”The question of distributing food parcels is a tactic as old as the mafia itself, where in the south of Italy bosses have customarily presented themselves to the people as benefactors and local power brokers, initially without asking for anything in return.“Mafia bosses consider their cities as their own fiefdom,” Gratteri said. “The bosses know very well that in order to govern, they need to take care of the people in their territory. And they do it by exploiting the situation to their advantage. In the people’s eyes, a boss who knocks on the door offering free food is a hero. And the boss knows that he can then count on the support of these families when necessary, when, for example, the mafia sponsors a politician for election who will further their criminal interests.”Dozens of investigations in the south have led to the arrests of politicians who have aided and abetted the mafia, and who were elected with the support of local Mafiosi who forced citizens to vote for them in exchange for services, such as a simple food parcel.Varese said: “These handouts by the mafias are not gifts. The mafia does not do anything out of its kind heart. They are favours that everyone will have to pay back in some form or another, by aiding and abetting a fugitive, holding a gun, dealing drugs and the like.”“Consider what happened to El Chapo, the Mexican narco,” said Gratteri. “He trafficked tons of cocaine and commissioned the murder of hundreds of people but in his hometown he was known for his benevolence, because people said that he provided medicines to families or built roads. The same thing happens here.”This week, Itay’s antimafia prosecutor’s office said bosses would offer their virtually endless criminal capital to businesses in need, and then swallow them up. Then, they will use those businesses for money laundering profits from the criminal activities.Varese said: “The mafias might be able to benefit in other ways from the current lockdown and especially from the future, when Italians will all be able to return to work, spend more money, and get the economy on its feet again. But surely the story exemplified by the handouts of food parcels in Palermo and Naples shows their true nature, and it tells why they are so dangerous.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37f49628e3071361a7028e1ca26a26087cd30107/0_21_2144_1286/master/2144.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca29798b78a0faec80f9f6ae530271ac","title":"newsround cbbc kids tv is responding to the coronavirus","story":"Shows such as CBBC’s Newsround are trying to alleviate anxieties children have about the pandemicChildren’s TV and radio presenters are finding new ways to stop their audiences feeling stressed, following reports that young children are become increasingly anxious about the coronavirus pandemic.The BBC’s long-running Newsround programme has seen its audience rise substantially for its three daily broadcasts on the CBBC channel and its dedicated website, with its reporters trying to find ways to provide optimistic takes on the news without sugarcoating the situation.“So many kids now have anxiety issues,” said Ricky Boleto, a presenter on the programme. “We’re letting kids know that we focus on what’s happening in their homes and gardens without making them feel they have to sort out the world’s problems … They’re sending questions such as ‘Is my grandmother going to die’? We’ve been trying to put them at ease.”He said children “have a very good moral compass, probably better than most adults” and Newsround aims to cover stories without patronising audiences: “The most important thing for us is to tell stories in a way that doesn’t presume knowledge, doesn’t patronise, and makes young people feel that this is their programme.”The programme has seen an increased emphasis on asking children to submit their own material on how they are dealing with the lockdown while schools are closed: “There’s scary headlines elsewhere but Newsround is a safe space for kids to turn to while coronavirus changes everything about our lives. We try to be a positive platform as well and focus on what good is being done.”Other changes are having to be made to children’s output. Amid the ongoing travel restrictions, the CBBC broom cupboard – the location where presenters introduce the next programme on the kids’ channel – has been transferred to presenters’ homes for the first time in 44 years. The BBC is also preparing to launch an enormous range of educational programmes from 20 April onwards.Matt Deegan, who runs the independent national children’s radio station Fun Kids, said he has had to change the station’s output to reflect the new reality: “Our presenters refer to the fact that they’re broadcasting from home and talk about the positives and sometimes the negatives.”He has also launched a daily children’s podcast called Stuck at Home, which has suggestions like using what’s in the recycling bin as as source for collages or creating Zoom quizzes for other family members. It has also become the first piece of content from a commercial radio station to be made available on BBC Sounds.Deegan said young children pick up on the severity of the situation: “I think there’s an awareness by them that parents think it’s serious and their sporadic anxiousness often gets eye rolls. The sheer volume of news drives parents to discuss things more openly than perhaps they normally would.”Boleto, the Newsround host, said explaining the news in simple terms for children was a real challenge: “Nick Robinson and Evan Davis have said that writing scripts for Newsround is harder than their day jobs. You have to go from the start, not presume any knowledge, and tell the story.”However, there is still space for some lightness on the show amid the pandemic gloom. He said: “We do still throw in the odd skateboarding dog and panda birth.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/34720868ddfdb4a0102015b602c10075db62bb82/0_133_4474_2685/master/4474.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc0d3729915f17b2fbc9d5f20ebc6c1a","title":"rihanna cardi b taylor swift celebrity donations coronavirus","story":"In a country failing to provide adequate care, celebrities are stepping up to fill in the gapsIn tough times, people with money show their true colors. For Rihanna, that meant donating $2.1m to domestic violence charities in a crisis that has threatened to keep victims trapped inside with abusive partners.Cardi B’s donations came in the form of a giveaway: she promised to donate $1,000 every hour for the next 42 days, a total of about $1m, to people badly affected by the pandemic. She came up with the idea after getting messaged by fans in need, but, she warned: “I’m going to make sure you really do need it, so don’t be lying so you can lend your fucking boyfriend some money!”Taylor Swift has similarly, although more quietly, been donating $3,000 packages to fans in need.As thousands across the US struggle to sign up for unemployment cheques, it is no wonder that celebrities feel obligated to step up. But they are also standing in for a country failing to provide adequate care.When Rihanna donated personal protective equipment to healthcare providers in New York (as well as a $5m donation to global organizations protecting healthcare workers and marginalized communities), she was giving what authorities should have been providing. Nonetheless, the New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, showed his gratitude by tweeting: “We’re so appreciative of your help and that of so many others who have stepped up.”Less powerful iniduals are also taking on officials to demand better. While Trump was busy pointing the finger at healthcare workers, accusing them of having stolen masks, vigilante groups of ravers were handing them out to people in New York. In Chicago this week, after human rights campaigners fought for it, prisoners won the right to be provided basic hygiene supplies such as soap and sanitizer during the pandemic.To appreciate the work of iniduals does not contradict the desire for the state to do better. It is lovely to see this show of solidarity, especially when it is our favorite celebrities doing it. But when it is the Mark Zuckerbergs, Bill Gateses and Jeff Bezoses of the world giving out millions in donations, it gets a bit more worrying. Why? Because it underlines a transfer of responsibility from the state to iniduals. Do we really want to live in a world where tech billionaires have as much power as the government?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3640c2cb134a1236e456d2136a5a5d0d0621148e/0_240_6454_3873/master/6454.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=acb89a2f7e1d245d6387b18cdca32183","title":"tech giants struggle stem infodemic false coronavirus claims","story":"Critics say efforts are too little, too late as research reveals vast majority of false claims appear onlineClick over to Google, type in “coronavirus”, and press enter.The results you see will bear little resemblance to any other search.There are no ads, no product recommendations, and no links to websites that have figured out how to win the search engine optimisation game. Government, NGO and mainstream media sources dominate.Algorithms and user-generated content are out gatekeepers and fact checking are in.Silicon Valley has responded to the “infodemic” with aggressive intervention and an embrace of official sources and traditional media outlets.Across the social web – on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Reddit, Instagram and Pinterest – search results related to Covid-19 are similarly predetermined.Instagram delivers a pop-up urging US users to go to the website for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) – or UK users to the NHS – rather than look at the memes and pictures tagged with #coronavirus.On Facebook, a dedicated “Information Center” includes a mix of curated information and official medical advice. On Pinterest, the only infographics and memes to be found on topics such as “Covid-19” or “hydroxychloroquine” are those made by internationally recognised health organisations, such as the WHO.It is a stark contrast to how social media platforms have dealt with misinformation in the past.US-based platforms, shaped by Silicon Valley’s libertarian ethos and protected by the first amendment, have long been reluctant to take a proactive editorial role or censor speech that could be considered political.They have had to be pushed, prodded, cajoled, protested, and shamed into addressing hate speech, anti-vaxx propaganda and the harassment of victims of mass shootings.On coronavirus, they have competed to be responsible and reliable sources of information. Yet still misinformation continues to adapt and spread, largely on social media.A conspiracy theory falsely linking 5G to the coronavirus pandemic has led to real-world consequences, including threats and harassment against telecom engineers and petrol bomb attacks on telephone poles.Carl Bergstrom, a University of Washington professor of biology who also studies and has written a book about misinformation, says the efforts of the social media companies are too little, too late.“They’ve built this whole ecosystem that is all about engagement, allows viral spread, and hasn’t ever put any currency on accuracy,” he said. “Now all of a sudden we have a serious global crisis, and they want to put some Band-Aids on it. It’s better than not acting, but praising them for doing it is like praising Philip Morris for putting filters on cigarettes.”Some of the more radical steps taken by tech companies include Twitter’s new policy to remove misinformation that contradicts official public health advice, such as tweets encouraging people not to follow physical distancing guidelines, and WhatsApp’s strict new limits on message forwarding.The platforms feel they can be much more aggressive on coronavirus misinformation than they have been on political misinformation, said Claire Wardle of the non-profit organisation First Draft.“There are no two sides with coronavirus, so they don’t have people on the other side saying: ‘We want this,’ the way you do with anti-vaxxers or political misinformation,” said Wardle. “They are freer to act.”It is also relatively simple and straightforward for the platforms to select trusted sources of authoritative information – the WHO, NHS, CDC, etc – without appearing politically biased.Wardle faulted the tech companies for not being better prepared for the crisis, however. Facebook has long ignored the conspiracy communities that organise using Facebook groups, such as anti-vaxxers, followers of QAnon, and people who believe 5G is harmful. Coronavirus misinformation is rampant in those communities.And while the scientific nature of the crisis may lessen some of the external political pressures over how to moderate speech, it also brings with it a slew of challenges. The coronavirus is brand new, and the scientific understanding of it changes daily.Bergstrom described this conundrum as an “uncertainty vacuum”. “Any reasonable authority will not give you a straight answer” to certain questions about the pandemic, “not because they’re trying to mislead you, but because they don’t know yet,” he said. Another complicating factor is that normally trustworthy sources are not providing reliable information.“We’ve seen the US government, particularly the White House, becoming a significant purveyor of misinformation around the virus,” Bergstrom said.Facebook and Twitter have removed posts by prominent and powerful people over coronavirus misinformation, including the Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, but the real test of their resolve will be whether they ever take action against misinformation by Trump.“We planned for years for this pandemic, but we never realised that we would be fighting a war on two fronts,” said Bergstrom. “One against the pandemic, and one against all the disinformation and hate and fear that is being amped up and enflamed by political opportunists.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5f62b64ffe5550738eeb72485c039400a35c26c/0_92_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=668e778840bb4ee1d25df1dd462ccf13","title":"uk curator criticises misleading reports about looted items","story":"British Museum expert rejects claim that Europe is flooded with recently stolen artefactsReporting of the illegal trade in antiquities from Iraq and Syria is leading to a false impression that the European market is flooded with looted items, according to a British Museum curator.“There’s a very strong tendency to say that all objects without provenance are the produce of recent looting,” he said. “But some objects have been circulating for decades, if not longer. It’s a case of assessing each item on its own merits.”Simpson said that in his role as an adviser for UK law enforcement on items that have been seized on exit or entry into the country, there has yet to be a proven case of a recently looted item from Syria being discovered in Britain.He said: “I think the really telling statistic is that over the last eight years of the Syrian civil war we have yet to prove any objects have come into Britain that demonstrably come from looting in Syria,” he said. “We are investigating cases at the moment but that is a remarkable figure.”In March, a UN-backed report stated Germany had become an international destination for trafficking illegal antiquities from the eastern Mediterranean, including Iraq and Syria, with almost half of the 6,000 examined items coming from the two countries.Markus Hilgert, general secretary of the foundation, said the report’s findings were shocking, especially in light of EU trade restrictions in place for both Iraq and Syria. “In view of the ongoing, extensive destruction and looting of archaeological cultural assets in Iraq and Syria, this is an alarming finding,” Hilgert added.Simpson said in Syria there had been “ad-hoc and opportunistic looting” but the picture painted by the German foundation’s study was down to “rather simplistic” reporting. “Put it this way,” he said. “I would like see every one of those objects personally to be confident that they are from recent looting rather than older items or fakes.”The curator said the situation in the UK is completely different from the 1990s, when large numbers of looted Iraqi items were sold. He called for “caution and curatorial intelligence” to be used when deciding when and where items originated.“Some of these objects floating around on the western market could actually come not from recent looting, they’re probably coming from 1990s or 2003 looting,” he added.The British Museum recently launched the Circulating Artefacts project, to “counteract looting and trafficking of cultural artefacts”. It created a database of objects designed to help curb the trade in illicit objects from Sudan and Egypt.But it has also been criticised for items in its collection that were acquired by looting, such as the Benin Bronzes, which were taken in a “punitive expedition” led by British troops in 1897.Senegalese academic Felwine Sarr co-authored a report that recommended a restitution programme to transfer hundreds of items from European institutions to Africa. He criticised the British Museum for acting like “an ostrich with its head in the sand” after not addressing calls for items acquired by colonial-era looting to be returned.In response, a spokesperson for the British Museum said it welcomed a “transparent focus on the provenance of objects”, adding that the museum agreed with the report’s call for the establishment of “new and more equitable relationships between Europe and Africa”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d3cfbda2a7a0fcb476054adbb4d9c2af05872ec/0_5_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8e47c6f0eb4865ff1b3d69ff20dcaac","title":"how are you affected by coronavirus in the south west of the uk","story":"If you live in the south-west England or Wales, we’d like to find out about the impact of coronavirus on you and your community.

Refusing to share debt across the eurozone threatens the union’s futureEurope suffered a historic defeat on Thursday night. After weeks of impasse, the Eurogroup gathering of finance ministers, whose countries share the euro, reached a decision on their collective response to the coronavirus pandemic’s economic impact. Besides constituting an epic dereliction of duty, the Eurogroup’s decision dealt a decisive blow to the foundations of the European Union – much to the delight of Europe’s critics and enemies.Most of continental Europe using the euro is in lockdown. The economic shockwaves caused by a lockdown do not care what currency we use. Just as in the United Kingdom, the United States or Japan, the precipitous falls in private incomes must be counterbalanced by substantial increases in public expenditure. If governments fail in this, the sum of private and public expenditure (which equals aggregate income) will crash even faster, bankruptcies will burgeon and government tax revenues will collapse further in the medium turn.The challenge facing the 19 countries of the eurozone is unique. The massive boost in public debt that is now so necessary is hampered by the quaint arrangement of sharing a central bank that, on the one hand, has no common treasury to lean against and, on the other, is banned from backing directly the 19 treasuries that must borrow in euros to fight the crisis. The euro crisis that began in 2010 stretched this monetary architecture to its limits. The coronavirus recession is now pushing it beyond them.With the countries worst hit by Covid-19, such as Italy, being the most indebted and thus the least able to shoulder the necessary new debt, an impossible conundrum emerges: the new debt needed to revive the private sector will push the state into default, so destroying the banks whose capital is mostly government debt and, in short order, the rest of the private sector. The only way out of this trap is for the new debt not to fall on the weak shoulders of the most indebted eurozone countries but to be shared across the eurozone. Except that this debt-sharing is banned by the treaties that created the eurozone, at the insistence of the northern european countries running a trade surplus with the rest.Before the Eurogroup met, hope was in the air that Europe would, at last, change its rules to save its greatest creation: the European Union. Unlike in 2015, when I was alone in the Eurogroup in demanding a common instrument for restructuring public debt, in the past few weeks the governments of eight southern states, plus France, demanded a rethink on debt-sharing without which the eurozone will remain an iron cage of austerity for most and a source of economic stagnation for everyone. Belatedly, but correctly, they demanded a so-called “eurobond”: a common debt instrument that allows total long-term debt to shrink by transferring a portion of it from member states, which have a lot of debt, to the eurozone, which has none.This debate is now dead in the water, killed off by the Eurogroup’s decision to rely almost entirely on new debts falling squarely on the member states’ weakened shoulders. The only concession to the nine governments suggesting debt-sharing was that the new ESM loans will have no strings attached to them. This is, alas, a red herring as the conditions will come later, once the eurozone’s fiscal rules bite again.The message today to Italians, Spaniards and Greeks is: your government can borrow large amounts from Europe’s bailout fund. No conditions. You will also receive help to pay for unemployment benefits from countries where employment holds up better. But, within a year or two, as your economies are recovering, huge new austerity measures will be demanded to bring your government’s finances back into line, including the repayment of the monies spent on your unemployment benefits. This is equivalent to helping the fallen get up but striking them over the head as they begin to rise.The EU is, of course, a lot more than a monetary area. It is a peace project, a realm of shared culture, a source of identity and an opportunity to stem toxic nationalism. Nonetheless, if its economic foundation buckles, powerful centrifugal forces already in play are ready to tear the union apart. Thursday’s Eurogroup verdict, besides being macroeconomically insignificant, was politically irresponsible and a fantastic boon for Eurosceptics in Europe, the UK and indeed in the White House.• Yanis Varoufakis is the co-founder of DiEM25 (Democracy in Europe Movement) and former finance minister of Greece"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/10390413e0494f666c9eb180aec86d9824d7ae3b/1257_646_5463_3278/master/5463.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=314af9802cfbd0976dd4006d273dfa53","title":"the uk coronavirus lockdown by guardian and observer photographers","story":"From an unusually quiet Millennium bridge to dawn swimmers on Portobello beach, the sights and ambience of lockdown"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d4a6172bb5e6113fdb61453cd17bc9e3682e3a1/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a4272a7f1c314b592cbec4cc4c2d70a2","title":"how coronavirus spread across the globe visualised","story":"From early beginnings in China, the Covid-19 pandemic has spread rapidly across the globeSince New Year’s Eve the world has lived through 100 days of Covid-19. There have been over 1.3m confirmed cases, and over 75,000 deaths. Billions of people are confined to their homes and stock markets have plummeted. Here is how the crisis unfolded. Note: Data for the first 20 days is reconstructed from early WHO situation reports and the later progress of the disease. The case counts for the remaining days comes from the open source Johns Hopkins data repository.There are some tentative indications that “the curve is flattening” in Italy and Spain, as the number of new cases each day falls. But the UK and the US have so far seemed to be about two weeks behind Italy in the progress of the disease, so their worst days may well be yet to come. Similarly, although the Chinese city of Wuhan is gradually reopening after two months of lockdown, it is by no means clear when or how other countries will begin to return to normal. In the meantime, scientists are working on several fronts to develop treatments and possibly vaccines some of those trials may start to show results in the next month or so, but a viable vaccine could still be 18 months away.Data caveatsThe case counts come from data compiled by Johns Hopkins University, one of the most reliable sources. The figures reflect the available data at the time this article was first published. Occasionally there are differences in the case counts between the Johns Hopkins website dashboard and the open source data repository used here. For the first 20 days, the evolution of cases is reconstructed from early WHO situation reports and the later progress of the disease. But the data should be treated with caution throughout as countries take different approaches to testing, and scientists believe many people may have been infected with the disease without suffering symptoms."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4226180.1586534920!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"better coronavirus testing key to society returning to some kind of normality","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tOfficials have been unforthcoming about the   figures, but it is clear that there are serious delays in getting a test, and in the results of these tests being processed. Photograph: Alan BetsonSo, as we enter possibly our strangest Easter since 1916, how are we doing?In summary: well enough to feel proud of our achievements in stemming the spread of coronavirus but, unfortunately, not well enough to justify lifting restrictive measures yet.To recapitulate what I’ve written in previous columns, the good things we’ve done include: reacting early following an evidence-led strategy allowing the experts to lead our response introducing step-wise measures and adhering to them invoking radical changes when these were needed ramping up capacity to deal with a surge in cases and pulling together as a nation.Against this, we have not excelled in some areas: by failing to limit foreign travel early in relation to protecting staff, through widespread provision of protective equipment and other measures protecting nursing homes and other vulnerable environments providing widespread, fast testing and providing widespread, speedy contact tracing.Worldwide PPE shortageSome of these problems involved circumstances beyond our control, to some extent, such as the worldwide shortage of personal protective equipment, and reagent for testing, or internal EU politics that allowed free movement of people to continue for too long.As a result, our performance is more mid-table in terms of international comparison, rather than the “top tier” asserted by officials in relation to our testing capability.Currently, we rank 21st in Europe for the number of tests carried out relative to population, just behind Denmark and Italy, and ahead of the likes of Spain, the Netherlands, France and the United Kingdom.As for deaths per 1 million of population, we rank in a respectable 12th position in Europe.There are all sort of caveats to be applied to these kinds of international league tables for example, some countries are counting Covid-19 deaths only if they occur in hospital.However, they give some indication of the progress we have made – and the road still to be travelled.It is hard not to be envious of the countries that are winning plaudits for their responses. Iceland, for example, is testing over nine times as many people as we are at present New Zealand, an island nation with a similar population to that of Ireland, has recorded two deaths against our 263.Some countries have managed to keep more sectors of society open – such as schools – thus lessening the economic and social disruption involved, although their results have varied.But even countries that have been lauded for their speedy response to coronavirus, also known as Covid-19, when it first emerged have hit a few speed bumps. Singapore, which used tough travel restrictions and efficient contact tracing to put a stop to the spread of the virus, has seen cases jump in recent days, mostly linked to migrant workers living in cramped accommodation.Here in Ireland, we have managed thanks to the Government-imposed restrictions to reduce the reproduction number, the “R naught”, to about 1, from 4.5 several weeks ago. This means that whereas 4.5 people used to contract the disease from each sick person, now just one other person does.Better positionThis is the best measure we have for estimating how far and how fast a virus is likely to spread through a population. If the R0 drop below 1, the virus peters out if it rises above this number, it takes off again.We can see from this figure that our fate remains finely balanced Norway, to take one example, is in a better position with an R0 of 0.7.The other obstacle to lifting restrictions is the continuing failings in testing. Officials have been unforthcoming about the figures, but it is clear that there are serious delays in getting a test, and in the results of these tests being processed.The wider significance is that we are not in a position to lift restrictions because that might risk a rise in cases, and we have to be able to detect these cases quickly. That can only happen when we have a comprehensive and responsive testing process in place.The better we can do testing – including of people without symptoms – and selective quarantines, the more we can forego social distancing and get society back to some kind of normality.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: Brian LawlessPA WireA massive effort is under way to scale up the tracking of Covid-19 cases so restrictions on economic and social life can be eased early next month.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar on Friday announced an extension of the current, two-week-old shutdown for another three weeks, until after the May bank holiday weekend, in order to further slow the spread of the virus.Mr Varadkar said that the Government was working and planning towards a relaxation of the restrictions, but declined to say when this would happen.But public health officials say any easing of the restrictions will depend on our ability to test widely for the disease and to trace the contacts of confirmed cases so these can be quickly followed up.“We simply have to be in a situation where we’re able to do a substantially greater number of tests in the future than we are doing now,” chief medical office Dr Tony Holohan said last night.With the testing system bedevilled by lengthy delays over the past month, Dr Holohan said the HSE was redoubling its efforts to deliver a “fit-for-purpose” testing and contact tracing system. People were working “day and night” on the sourcing of reagent – a vital chemical used in tests – and on the development of laboratory capacity in Ireland and abroad, he said.“We can’t be in a situation where delays of three to four days occur” in the testing of people suspected to have Covid-19, he said, and testing capacity and information capacity would be scaled up to address this challenge.HSE chief executive Paul Reid took the unprecedented step of appointing an external management consultant, Niamh O’Beirne, to oversee the ramping-up of Covid-19 testing and contact tracing.Ms O’Beirne, of consultants EY, who is being seconded to the HSE executive management team for six months, is also tasked with devising operational plans for “a phased return to business as usual”.Last night, the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) reported the deaths of another 25 patients diagnosed with Covid-19. There have now been 288 coronavirus-related deaths in the Republic.YoungestThe youngest person to die with Covid-19 so far was 32 years old, and the oldest was 105, according to a breakdown released by NPHET.NPHET also reported 480 new confirmed cases on Friday, the second-highest daily total. The total number of confirmed cases now stands at 7,054 – or 8,089 when tests processed in Germany are included.Of the deaths that have occurred so far, 54 per cent arose in nursing home settings. In nursing homes affected by outbreaks, one in five staff, and one in six residents, have tested positive, Dr Holohan revealed.In a press conference at Government Buildings on Friday, Mr Varadkar said that on the advice of public health experts, the restrictions have been extended until Tuesday May 5th.Mr Varadkar said Ireland had “slowed the spread of the virus considerably, but unfortunately we have not stopped it”.If progress continued over the next three weeks, then “we can be hopeful” that the restrictions would be eased. He added, though, that there was no guarantee that this would happen.Minister for Health Simon Harris confirmed he would extend the regulations empowering the Garda to enforce the current restrictions for the same period, until midnight on May 4th.He said that at the beginning of the outbreak, infected people had been in contact with on average 20 people.“That reduced to 10, then to five, then to three and now to two,” he said. The number of cases was growing at a rate of 33 per cent a day, he said. Now it was below 10 per cent. “But we have to get it lower again.”‘Deadly resurgence’The Government’s decision to extend restrictions chimes with advice on Friday from the World Health Organisation (WHO), which warned lifting lockdown measures too early could spark a “deadly resurgence” in infections.“The way down can be as dangerous as the way up if not managed properly,” WHO director Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned. Internationally, the number of deaths from coronavirus passed the 100,000 mark.Meanwhile, the Government is to allow private-sector medical specialists treat their existing fee-paying patients in the public system on condition they do not charge them.In revised Government proposals, the HSE can also pay to use private rooms which consultants may have outside of private hospital premises if such arrangements are deemed necessary and represent value for money.The National Virus Reference Laboratory (NVRL) has sourced a new supply of chemicals that will enable it to carry out up to 10,000 tests a day.The NVRL has reached agreement with Genomics Medicine Ireland for the supply of reagents used to test swab samples taken from suspected Covid-19-infected patients.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Long regarded as a food for the poor, seaweed is now in demand for cosmetics and pharmaceuticalsEasing of restrictions after May bank holiday will depend on ability to test widely for casesSchool managers urge candidates to take complete break from study over EasterU2 singer is just one of number of people the Government has sought crucial help fromASTI says it \u0026lsquowill be seeking clarifications\u0026rsquo over rescheduling of examsIreland\u0026rsquos fate remains finely balanced as we enter possibly our strangest Easter since 1916\u0026lsquoOur approach to ministry with the sick has had to change ... to slow spread of the disease\u0026rsquoKilcrohane usually relies on visitors but the usual welcome is temporarily suspendedBreweries to pick up tab for undrunk pints amid bar bumper stocks since St Patrick\u0026rsquos DayVolunteers at Sikh Gurdwara in Dublin say they have capacity to cook hundreds of mealsLogistical issues mean payments will not now be made until April 24thGood Friday fatalities bring Covid-19 toll to 288 \u0026ndash with average age of today\u0026rsquos deaths 85Main parties make \u0026lsquoreally good progress\u0026rsquo on joint framework document for governmentChild taken to hospital with suspected head injuries after fall from Dublin 7 apartmentsDublin-based NVRL reaches agreement with Genomics Medicine IrelandFive students give their thoughts about the decision to run the exams later in summerPeople suffering from Motor Neuron Disease at high risk during Covid-19 pandemicIrish households asked to shine a light out windows in tribute to Covid-19 victimsStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4226375.1586549066!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"garda%C3%AD inspecting caravan parks in popular holiday spots","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSculpture overlooking the N7 at Naas carries a Covid-19 message. Photograph: Crispin RodwellGardaí have been inspecting caravan parks in popular holiday spots in Wicklow and Wexford, to ensure people are adhering to restrictions on non-essential travel ahead of the upcoming bank holiday weekend.There had been significant concern that large numbers would travel from populated areas such as Dublin to holiday homes outside of the capital over the Easter weekend.However, amid the heightened fears several caravan parks say they have seen little to no incoming visitors. Similarly local politicians have played down fears of large numbers of people travelling to holiday home locations from Dublin and elsewhere.Gardaí have set up checkpoints across the country and along motorways and have visited several caravan parks to monitor whether the coronavirus restrictions on movement are being followed. EmptyAnn Hall, who runs Laburnum Caravan Park in Gorey, Co Wexford, said she managed 115 mobile homes between two sites which were both empty. “We’ve two parks and we’ve not a sinner in either of them,” she said. Ms Hall said while caravan parks in the popular holiday area seemed to be empty “there is a bit more traffic on the roads”, which she said could mean people were travelling to holiday homes.Pat Fitzgerald, an Arklow-based county councillor, similarly said he had not seen significant numbers travelling to holiday homes or caravan parks in the Co Wicklow town.One of the larger mobile home sites in the area, Arklow Caravan Park, has a number of residents staying in the park to cocoon due to underlying medical conditions. Of the park’s 290 mobile homes, about 40 are occupied by people who have been staying for several weeks. New powersGardaí have been given new powers to instruct people to return home, if they are travelling outside of 2km of their home without a valid, essential reason, with penalties for people failing to adhere to the orders. While Garda sources on Friday reported a high level of compliance with the restrictions on movement, the PSNI said they had fined a number of people for breaching the social distancing rules in Northern Ireland. As well as increasing patrols this weekend the PSNI has launched a dedicated website – www.psni.police.ukcovid19 – where people can report instances where social distancing is not being observed.Assistant chief constable Alan Todd encouraged people to use the new web process “sensibly” to report when the rules are being flouted. He said that in the week to Friday, police received 906 complaints of the restrictions not being followed.Speaking on Friday evening, and amid concerns that people might seek to travel to their holiday homes for the weekend, Mr Todd said a considerable number of people had been stopped by police patrols and instructed to return home. “The vast majority have taken advice and done the right thing and returned home,” he told BBC Radio Ulster.Three people didn’t heed police advice, however, and were fined, he said. Fines start at £60 but will be reduced to £30 if paid within 14 days.Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4226258.1586539221!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"west cork on holidaymakers we re hoping they won t come","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tElaine Spillane in Kilcrohane, west Cork: ‘It’s surreal. Spring is here but it’s like it’s still winter and we’re all in hibernation’Businesswoman Elaine Spillane normally swims year-round with a boisterous group of women called the Chilli Dippers.However, each day since the start of the Covid-19 crisis, Spillane has entered the lapping waves alone from a deserted pier near her home on the remote Sheep’s Head peninsula in west Cork.The tiny village of Kilcrohane, where she has lived and worked for 26 years, is a gateway to the renowned Sheep’s Head Way, a picturesque and rugged trail that attracts thousands of walkers from all over the world.The Easter bank holiday weekend is normally the start of Kilcrohane’s bustling summer season the tables outside Frank’s Shop and two local bars are usually thronged with visitors, the local B\u0026ampB is booked out and the Old Creamery and Bridgeview restaurants buzzing.These days, however, everything is shut. Spillane says the place is eerily quiet. “Although the Sheep’s Head Way is still open, there are no walkers because of the 2km travel ban.“The shop and post office are open but the coffee shop is closed. There are no tables outside the cafe, outside the Bay View or Eileen’s Bar. The Old Creamery and the Bridge View B\u0026ampB and restaurant are closed.”By the second half of the week, Garda checkpoints have been established in both Kilcrohane and in the village of Durrus, farther east, turning away visitors to the peninsula.“We have a very elderly population here a lot of people who would be vulnerable to Covid-19. Our nearest hospital is Bantry hospital, which is small and covers a huge area. Cork University Hospital is the nearest acute hospital and it’s nearly two hours’ drive from Kilcrohane village.“It’s surreal. Spring is here but it’s like it’s still winter and we’re all in hibernation. We have sunny days and blue skies – but silence. There’s no buzz and no craic on this coast this Easter.”Striking silenceSpillane is the owner of local property company Peninsula Properties, which is deeply involved in the rental and management of holiday lets in Kilcrohane and the nearby village of Ahakista. She says that once Frank’s Shop closes for the evening, “the silence is striking”.Spillane handles about a dozen rental properties scattered around the peninsula, all of which are empty.“Bookings for the rental properties have been cancelled for April and May.“I haven’t received cancellations for June, but I’m expecting them.“We need our visitors financially, and we want them from a personal and emotional level,” she adds. “They add to the buzz and the life in the village but we have to be grateful to our visitors, many of whom would be regular people, for staying away now. We need people to come. We want them to come, but we’re very grateful they’re not coming.”Some people who own holiday homes came some weeks back, she said, but Spillane has not spotted many strange cars in the area lately.This is in contrast to some west Cork towns such as Bantry and Skibbereen, where significant numbers of Dublin and UK-registered vehicles have been seen in the streets and supermarket car parks.“There’s no one coming into Kilcrohane now, nobody,” says another local business owner who complains that last weekend the village was “crawling with people even though there was nowhere open except the shop”.“We’re hoping that they f***ing won’t come that’s the honest truth,” the business owner says, adding that locals were relieved that new arrivals were now being turned back at Garda checkpoints.“At the moment there are a few people around who shouldn’t be here. It’s not right.”No invitationVisitors need to be mindful of the “special relationship” they have with permanent communities in their holiday destinations, advises Cork city-based psychotherapist Margaret Lenihan.“Going to another community in this climate could be likened to entering another person’s home without invitation, which can lead to feelings of resentment and can create difficulties in relationships,” she says.“We need to be mindful of not just our inidual safety but that of others as well,” adds Lenihan, who won’t be travelling to her family’s second home near the village of Durrus on the peninsula.“We have a choice to nurture it or cause a rupture in it,” she says, adding that any ruptures caused by the breaching of Covid-19 travel restrictions could last longer than the virus itself.“People in rural areas want to be taken into account they want others to respect their fears for their safety and for their health,” she says. “People think a change of scene won’t do any harm. But there’s a lack of awareness that there are people there who are in genuine fear of becoming ill.”Roberta Tobin (53), a nurse and mother of three teenagers, has regularly visited the family holiday home on the Sheep’s Head Way for the past 14 years. This year, however, she is staying at home in Mallow.“All it will take to bring it in is one person – and it destroys the goodwill of the people in that community.“There are two kinds of people – the people who are taking Covid-19 very seriously and who are terrified and isolating themselves, and the people who just don’t seem to understand the seriousness of the situation.“There are people out there putting their lives on the line to care for people who are seriously unwell or fighting for their lives. All we’re being asked to do is stay in the luxury of our own homes.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Delayed response to coronavirus outbreak had consequences for Chinese city and the worldChina\u0026rsquos appointment like making \u0026lsquopyromaniac the town fire chief\u0026rsquo, says watchdogVirus lockdown lifted on Wuhan but imposed on Suifenhe on Russian frontierSurge in new cases in city-state and Hong Kong leads to tough new restrictionsCleric (78) to be freed from jail after Australian court quashes child abuse convictionsAuthorities work to stave off second wave amid struggle with ongoing outbreaks in WuhanScientists say survey shows damage more widespread than any preceding eventsMaha Vajiralongkorn was given permission to self-isolate with a 20-member harem in BavariaTokyo at centre of outbreak that has seen cases nearly double over past weekHospitals and morgues full as hundreds of deaths reported in city of GuayaquilDay of mourning sees country suspend all entertainment, observe three-minute silenceMove in Shenzhen after Beijing banned wildlife trade over outbreak\u0026rsquos link to Wuhan market\u0026lsquoWe must not be afraid to hold this regime to account,\u0026rsquo writes Cardinal Charles BoAs cases rise, experts warn that hands-off approach to containing outbreak is failingPrivileged and middle-classes continue to live comfortably in larger towns and citiesObservers sceptical of Pyongyang\u0026rsquos claim that country has had no cases of Covid-19Video adds to Taiwan\u0026rsquos grievances, including accusations health body ignored its early virus warningsCoronavirus crisis drives many poor workers to walk hundreds of kilometres to villagesLaunch described as \u0026lsquocrucial work of very great significance\u0026rsquo for national defence\u0026lsquoI couldn\u0026rsquot even tell you what we\u0026rsquove done, but somehow we got through it\u0026rsquoStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4206213.1584564281!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eu sets out proposals for close uk ties after brexit talks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEuropean Union chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier and the British prime minister’s Europe adviser David Frost in Brussels on March 2nd. Photograph: Oliver HosletReutersThe European Union released a draft of its hoped-for future relationship deal with Britain on Wednesday, setting out ambitions for a tight relationship on trade and security.The 440-page document crosses several of Britain’s red lines, spelling out the bloc’s ambitions for Britain to agree “uniform implementation” of state subsidy rules, with the European Court of Justice remaining the adjudicating authority.It also makes reference to the so-called “level playing field”, provisions to ensure fair competition by keeping rules aligned, which London has already rejected.“The Parties recognise that the establishment of conditions that ensure a level playing field between the Parties is necessary for trade and investment between the Union and the United Kingdom, ” the draft reads.The EU’s draft envisages reciprocal access to waters for fishing rights, with negotiations held each year by December 10th on fishing opportunities for the following year, another contentious point.The UK negotiating team said it had also sent a draft to the EU. This includes a free trade agreement with annexes, as well as agreements on aviation safety and air transport, and a civil nuclear agreement.“We are sharing ours in confidence as a negotiating document, as part of the ongoing negotiating process,” a government spokesman said.“Teams will now analyse each other’s texts and we expect further conversations between the teams next week.“We will keep under review which documents it is appropriate to publish during the course of negotiations and whether it is useful to make them availablle more widely.”Though Britain has left the EU it is is currently in a transition period, continuing to adhere to prior norms pending the agreement of a deal on the future relationship. If none can be agreed, it will automatically begin trading on World Trade Organisation terms from January 1st, 2021, with potentially severe effects on the Irish economy.The government of prime minister Boris Johnson has until July to request an extension to the transition period, but has insisted it will not do so even as the Coronavirus pandemic delayed talks this week.Both sides said they were examining options such as using video conferencing in place of face-to face talks.“The negotiations can still proceed given all of the logistical arrangements that have been put in place,” British foreign secretary Dominic Raab said on Tuesday.“We’re confident that we can get this done and, actually, I don’t think delaying Brexit negotiations would give anyone the certainty on either side of the Channel that they need.”Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4226276.1586545824!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"germany lifts ban on foreign workers to salvage harvest","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSeasonal workers heading to Germany wait outside Cluj airport, Romania. Photograph. Photograph: Raul StefInquam Photos via ReutersGermany has launched special flights to bring in tens of thousands of seasonal workers from eastern Europe amid fears that travel restrictions imposed to fight the coronavirus pandemic could badly disrupt farming and affect food supplies.Hundreds of Romanians were on board the first such flights on Thursday and Friday, and daily services are scheduled from Romanian airports to several German cities throughout April and May.Germany hopes to attract 80,000 farmhands from Romania and nearby countries, having lifted a ban on the arrival of workers from abroad over concerns for the imminent asparagus harvest and other produce that will soon be ripe.About 300,000 foreign workers usually pick fruit and vegetables in the German season, and farmers warned that a labour shortage caused by the Covid-19 outbreak could lead to a smaller harvest, higher food prices and planting delays.“This is important and good news for our farmers because the harvest does not wait. Sowing cannot be postponed,” said federal agriculture minister Julia Klöckner.“To provide consumers with sufficient and high-quality local food even during the coronavirus pandemic, farmers have to rely on the help of seasonal workers from abroad – these are specialists in their field.”The BOGK association of German fruit and vegetable processors had warned: “What is not harvested cannot be processed ... supplies for the population would no longer be secure from summer 2020.”“We certainly need our specialist workers from countries such as Bulgaria, Romania and other countries,” the group added.Harvest helpersAn online system has been created to match foreign workers with German farmers, and the Eurowings airline – a subsidiary of Lufthansa – has a “harvest helper” page on its website where Romanians can register for flights.Officials in Germany say foreign farmhands will undergo health checks and work separately from other employees for the first fortnight, and they will be expected to observe distancing rules at all times. Their accommodation has been adapted to provide more space for all occupants.Ms Klöckner called it “a pragmatic and goal-oriented solution which meets two justified requirements: protection from infection on one side and securing the harvest on the other side.”The first workers’ flights from Cluj airport to Germany on Thursday saw up to 2,000 people cram into the airport car park before being allowed into the terminal, in what Romanian prime minister Ludovic Orban called an “unacceptable” breach of current health guidelines.“What should we do? Die from hunger before the virus ends or what? We’re not dying from the virus but from hunger,” one worker, Vasile Stan, told Romania’s Mediafax news agency at the airport.“I’m scared of catching the virus,” said Loredana Bica, another worker. “But I’m more scared of having nothing to put on the table for the kids.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons april 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter -

His team simulated 89 school drop off and pick up trips in Guilford, Surrey and walked just over 1.2 miles during morning and afternoon school runs.The research published in Environment International journal did offer a solution to parents as it found pushchair covers reduced concentration of small-sized particles by as much as 39 per cent.Prof Kumar added: There is cause for some optimism, as our study confirms that pushchair covers and upping the buggy heights appears to have shielded children from an appreciable amount of pollution under certain conditions.Previous research conducted by the university last year found toddlers are typically exposed to 60 per cent more toxic particles than their parents when travelling in low-slung buggies, because doing so \u0027puts them closer to the level of exhaust pipes\u0027.Researchers warned at the time that persistent exposure can potentially damage the brain’s frontal lobe, which they said could impact on cognitive ability and neurological development.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"france turns back holidaymakers took private jet london riviera","story":"French police have turned back a private jet from London after a group of high-flying passengers tried to holiday on the Riviera only to be told they were breaching confinement rules.The group of seven men aged between 40 and 50 years old and three women aged between 23 and 25 years old had boarded the jet chartered in the UK capital by a Croatian man who said he worked in finance and real estate.The holidaymakers were also of French, German, Romanian and Ukrainian nationality.They had hired a villa in Cannes, according to local media reports.As soon as the plane hit the tarmac at Marseille airport, however, police refused the group of ten entry on the grounds that anyone entering France must prove their trip is essential via an international travel certificate.They were coming for a holiday in Cannes and three helicopters were waiting for them on the tarmac, the head of the border police service of Marignane told local media.But we notified them that they were not allowed to enter the national territory and they left four hours later.A police source told BFMTV that they had tried to make use of their connections, they made a few phone calls before eventually returning to London on the jet. One member of the party took a separate private flight to Germany.They were not fined as “legally they hadn’t entered French territory yet (as still on the runway),” said a police source.However, the pilots of the three helicopters that the group had arranged to ferry them to Cannes were fined for conducting non-essential travel.The incident took place last Saturday but French police only went public with it on Thursday to drive home their message that they are closely monitoring the arrival of private jets in the coming days.French authorities have warned nationals not to try and move around the country over the Easter weekend amid concerns some may try to join family members or reach second homes flouting confinement that has been in place since March 17.Currently, all those seeking to enter France require an international travel certificate and can be asked to present the document when boarding or entering French territory. French nationals and their immediate family can return to their country but the rules for foreigners are far stricter.Travel to second homes in France is not considered “essential”.People travelling to their main residence in another EU state are allowed through, as are commercial carriers, diplomatic and health workers.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"german region reopen schools opposition lockdown mounts","story":"The German region of Saxony is to begin reopening schools after the Easter holidays amid signs of growing opposition to the country’s coronavirus lockdown.The Saxon regional government said schools in the state would gradually reopen from April 20 so pupils could take their final exams on time.The state is the first in Germany to break ranks and announce an easing of the lockdown.With the scheduled dates looming for the Abitur, Germany’s equivalent of A levels, regional governments are under pressure to reopen schools or delay the exams.“This was not an easy decision to take. The exam situation is clearly different from previous years,” Christian Piwarz, the regional minister of culture said.The first written exams are scheduled for April 22 in Saxony. Schools will initially reopen only for those pupils sitting the exams, and the entire school buildings will be made available to them so social distancing rules can be observed.The move by the Saxon government came as Christian Lindner, leader of the opposition Free Democrats (FDP), became the first senior politician to speak out against Germany\u0027s continuing lockdown.“The government is talking to us like children who are left in the dark about what is really going on,” Mr Lindner told Bild newspaper.“The time for the opposition to keep quiet is coming to and end ... After Easter there has to be a new balance between security and freedom. The way our freedom is currently restricted is becoming less proportionate every day.”Mr Lindner pointed to a German study which found many more people have been infected and already have immunity to the virus than previously thought.Chancellor Angela Merkel urged Germans to stick to the lockdown ahead of the Easter holidays, warning: “We could very quickly destroy what we have achieved”.But Mr Lindner said lockdown measures that were appropriate three weeks ago were no longer necessary and called for a “gradual relaxation” and a “smarter approach” focused on protecting the most vulnerable and increased testing.A court on Friday overturned a regional ban on people visiting the beach in the north-eastern state of Mecklenburg-West Pomerania.The regional government ordered a ban amid fears people would crowd to the beach with warm temperatures forecast over the Easter weekend, but the court ruled it was disproportionate.In most of Germany people are free to visit parks and beaches as long as they follow social distancing rules.  More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"jealous shall young let loose rest us","story":"To all the other dizzying transformations caused by Covid-19, add this: the young may soon be the only people allowed out, while their parents are grounded indefinitely.A new research paper by economists and behavioural scientists at the University of Warwick argues that part of the population must be allowed to return to “normality” fairly soon if we are to avoid a catastrophic recession. The ideal cohort, they suggest, is people aged 20 to 30, so long as they are not living with their (more Covid-susceptible) parents.Young people, even if they catch the virus, are less likely to get seriously ill and require hospital treatment. They should therefore be released back into the wild to work and socialise and restart the economy.Well, someone has to go first, I suppose. But what a strange new world it will be with only youngsters in it. What will Generation Z do with all this freedom, all this unaccustomed power? When they get back to the office will they spin around in the boss’s chair, put their feet up on his desk, rummage through the pills and paper clips in his desk drawer? Will they listen obediently to their elders, trapped in our Zoom windows, squawking about strategy? Or will they – Heaven forbid – find they can get on perfectly well without us?My God, how jealous we will be. Every time a pair of smart shoes clacks along the pavement at a commuting hour every time a pub door opens again and a convivial roar escapes. It’s one thing to be part of a collective lockdown quite another to watch the young inherit the earth while we press our faces to the windowpane.Still, mustn’t grumble. The longer this lockdown goes on, the luckier I realise I am. Not just lucky – spoilt. I live in a nice house with a garden, three healthy children and a husband who (among his other excellent qualities) doesn’t beat me. If this were lockdown poker, I’d be holding the royal flush.On social media, I notice, many of my middle-class friends have fallen abruptly silent. They, like me, now realise they have nothing to complain about – and no appetite for boasting either. There are no snaps of restaurant food or holiday sunsets. No one wants to see your eclectic interior decor, let alone the rural idyll in which you may be self-isolating, and even wry self-deprecation falls on stony ground. So what if your feral children are covered in mud? You’re lucky to even have access to mud.It’s not just guilt that silences me: it’s also the surprising force of genuine gratitude. GK Chesterton once wrote that, as well as thanking God before every meal, “I say grace before the concert and the opera, and grace before the play and pantomime, and grace before I open a book, and grace before sketching, painting, swimming, fencing, boxing, walking, playing, dancing, and grace before I dip the pen in the ink.”I don’t believe in God, and I don’t know who to thank except luck and the class system. But the blessings of my life, big and small, have seldom seemed more vivid. When I’m playing swingball with the kids in our little patch of garden, with our washing flapping and dazzling in the spring sunshine, a sudden happiness seizes me which, I think, can only be called grace.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

The lamb will be out, a leg perhaps. Sticklers for good cooking practice will be bringing it to room temperature, before reaching for a sprig of rosemary, some garlic, olive oil and even a few little anchovies to pop into small cuts made in the flesh. Then into the oven it goes and in due course the kitchen will fill with the glorious scent of fat, oil and herbs as the meat starts to cook.But before you slam in that lamb, let me ask you a delicate question. Where is it from?In these trying times, some may think it churlish, preachy – pompous, even – to raise an eyebrow about provenance. Surely returning from the shops virus-free and providing for one’s family right now is the top priority.Except that now more than ever we should be supporting British farmers.Appalling stories are emerging of millions of pints of milk being poured down drains, of crops rotting in fields, beef going to waste. These issues are being caused by disruptions in logistics, staff shortages, lack of business agility and bureaucracy. The NFU president, Minette Batters, says, the situation is becoming “untenable”.Part of the problem, of course, is convenience and price. Look again at that label you just put in the bin. Can you spot the words “New Zealand”? If so, you may have paid less for your leg, but at what cost? As one (British) sheep farmer friend seethed: “Freezing lamb, putting it on a ship and sending it on a 12,000-mile journey to a country that produces the best lamb in the world is simply ridiculous.”Supermarkets would retort that they stock the best cuts, when in season – which suggests there is not enough British lamb currently available. The real problem is that they don’t want to pay British farmers a decent amount for their meat, as they don’t think consumers would stomach the price.Breeds such as the Dorset, for example, can lamb in November, but a lack of grass in winter makes the meat more expensive as farmers have to pay for feed. By failing to invest properly in farmers in this country rearing these types of animals in favour of cheaper meat from, say, New Zealand, the supermarkets are causing a vicious circle: there’s less British lamb available out there, so demand remains low and prices stay high.But, since you’re not eating out these days, may I humbly suggest that you can fork out a bit more for British produce? Buy your Easter roast from a farm shop that supports local producers, or do some label research on your supermarket shop?Yes, a British leg of lamb might be more pricey, but it’s better-reared, fed on better grass and tastes better. Not only that, but by buying it you’d be supporting our farmers – and they sure as hell need it right now.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

The “guard of honour” was a tribute in part to the fact that Mr Murray-Philipson’s mother and sister had also been ill with the disease, and that having been on the verge of death himself, he had not been able to attend his own father’s funeral.Robinson asked him about his time in intensive care. Mr Murray-Philipson said: “One of the very powerful images I had was the image of Jesus calming the storm on the Sea of Galilee and that just came to me and I like to think that it was Jesus Christ coming to me and helping me in my hour of need.”Robinson retorted that this was “partly because of the drugs you have to be on on a ventilator machine which plays tricks with your mind, doesn’t it, really?”This seemed a strange rebuke to a sane and serious man who had just had such a powerful vision so close to death. Mischievously, an image came into my mind of Nick Robinson in a tempest-tossed boat on the Sea of Galilee cross-questioning Jesus (“I’ll have to hurry you, I’m afraid”) on his disciples’ preposterous demand that he still the waters – and then falling silent as Jesus does exactly that.You would not, after all, have to share Mr Murray-Philipson’s religious beliefs to recognise the importance of such experiences. We all know that enduring extreme illness requires not only medical care, but also understanding, courage and love. Billions of people find those qualities in the God they worship – and even, in many cases, in a God to whom they have not previously paid much attention. It is as well to respect this, not least because it can save lives.One of the worst horrors of this virus is that you die alone (even, in some cases, when it is something else that is killing you). The knowledge that you will do so can itself be fatal. A doctor friend who is working in a hospice tells me that when the patients are isolated from the people they love they go downhill extremely fast. The same applies to those deprived of prayer and of the sacraments.This week, the rector of St Bartholomew the Great in London wrote a moving article about how the clergy can, with protective clothing, safely minister to the sick and dying, but that this was being discouraged by the Church authorities. It is part of the aim of a Christian to “make a good death”. This must be bitterly hard to do unaided.In less acute form, this sense of being cut off from the ine goes way beyond the hospital wards this Easter. The Passion story told yesterday and the Resurrection one told tomorrow is the deepest account ever given of the pain of death and the victory of life, and of how the one relates to the other. Yet in 2020, for the first time since St Augustine reached Kent in 597, we shall not be allowed to listen to that story in church on Easter Sunday.Obviously churches cannot be exempt from public-health needs. They are gathering places and, as such, dangerous at this time. But it has been a little depressing to see the eagerness with which Church leaders have shut up shop. They told their clergy not to conduct services in their churches, even if alone, but to stay at home, though there was no government order to do this. An impressive exception has been the Bishop of London, Sarah Mullaly, who was herself the chief nursing officer for England. She has urged her clergy to enter their churches, if there is a safe means of doing so, and live-stream their services from there.It is also reasonable to question whether it is always necessary to keep churches shut at all times for the duration of the virus. Surely arrangements could be made in some of them so that people can pray there alone, or with their households. Most country churches, for example, are visited by very few people each day: the risk of them passing on Covid-19 must be trivial compared with that in Sainsbury’s or Tesco.My wife is a churchwarden in our village. As such, it is her duty to check the church to make sure that all is in order and no birds are trapped inside. Since we do not have to distance from each other, I accompanied her yesterday. She unlocked the door and we entered. It was extraordinary to feel almost furtive in a church in England. I suppose it is a bit like what millions felt in eastern Europe under communism and still feel in independent churches in communist China today.There were no stray birds to deal with. We sat in the chancel and my wife read out the Book of Common Prayer collects for the day, one of which prays that the ministers of the Church “may truly and godly serve thee”. Then she read out the Epistle (Hebrews 10.1), which says “Let us hold fast to the profession of our faith … not forsaking the assembly of ourselves together” and last the Gospel in which St John tells how Jesus was killed because the crowd called for it and Pilate, who represented the civil power, let it happen, though he knew it was wrong.Tomorrow, the Easter Day service says: “For since by man came death: by man also came the resurrection of the dead”, but no one will be there to hear it.It is certainly hard to know how best Christian leadership can be given at this time, though Boris Johnson – by accident of his illness and by his cheerfulness – has embodied the ancient Judaeo-Christian idea of leading through suffering.We have been lucky that such leadership has come from the Queen. Her message last Sunday was not explicitly Christian (indeed, I felt the one good word missing from it was “Easter”), but it worked better than a sermon.What the Queen does, in these rare public pronouncements, is to put herself in the right place. It may seem banal to express sympathy for victims of a disaster such as this virus, but if you think of her words as a prayer, they make a deeper sense. She is remembering everything which should be remembered, setting out, in some detail, who should be consoled, who should be thanked and what blessings can be counted (“the opportunity to slow down, pause and reflect”, and to pray, which comes with self-isolation). Then she seeks what can unite all of us (our “national spirit”) and how we can come through it (“self-discipline …quiet, good-humoured resolve …fellow-feeling”).Finally – and this is the leadership bit – the Queen gently establishes her authority to help. I first spoke to you 80 years ago, she says, when we were at war, and I was a girl. She was speaking then to comfort children evacuated from their homes. Today, in a different way, there is again “a painful sense of separation”. Now that she is an old lady who has seen it all, she can comfort us, with modest confidence: “We will be with our friends again we will be with our families again we will meet again”. All shall be well.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

This year, however, we are obsessed with a radically different take on how each of us is approaching this bank holiday break.The equanimity and tolerance for which our nation is rightly famed has become one of the first casualties of the Covid-19 crisis. Social media is full (“logjammed”, you might say) of furious condemnation of those irresponsible people who – and you may want to make sure the smelling salts are within easy reach before you read this next part – are defying government advice not to visit local parks and enjoy the sunshine.Such people are the very worst of society, apparently, endangering the health of their neighbours, as well as NHS workers, just to indulge their selfishness.So allow me to suggest a new rule for those who choose to enter a state of high dudgeon at such behaviour: only those who live in a tiny London flat with no balcony and no private garden, and who have at least three children living with them, have the right to comment adversely on such behaviour.I lived in London (part time, anyway) for 14 years during my time as an MP. The flats I lived in at the time were, as a 1980s estate agent might say, “compact and bijou”. Aside from school holidays, I rarely had my children stay with me, but even so, I found the heat of the city unbearable. Opening all the windows hardly helped. When the boys and their mum did visit, we had to spend as much time as possible outside, spraying ourselves with water to keep cool. Night times were particularly stressful, especially when the boys were toddlers.Had we had an actual house, similar in size to the one we occupied in Glasgow, things would have been different, especially if we also had a similarly sized garden. But the reality for too many people – and this is not confined to the metropolis – is that being told by police and government to remain in a small, often badly ventilated flat, during a hot and balmy spring weekend is pretty near unbearable.Imagine how bad the situation will be if, by high summer, we’re enduring the same record-breaking temperatures as last year.But still, those who are privileged (and let’s face it, wealthy) enough to enjoy a comfortable self-isolation experience are spending too much time castigating other, poorer, citizens for seeking some comfort outside their family homes. In the vast majority of cases, such refugees from cheek-by-jowl habitation are behaving responsibly. Yes, some idiots are holding karaoke parties and family barbecues, and the police are rightly dealing with such nonsense. But most people who visit parks to soak up some rays and top up their essential vitamin D supplies (good for the immune system, you know) are doing so while respecting all the rules about social distancing.If they’re walking to a local park and not driving (risking road accidents and piling on pressure on the NHS), what, exactly, are they doing wrong? More to the point, have we really considered the alternatives?The pressures on families, especially larger ones with numerous children, are already considerable, thanks to the devastating economic impacts on inidual bank accounts as a result of the whole economy going onto life support. And now we’re demanding that such families – and remember: those whose livelihoods have been most severely affected, those on zero-hour contracts, for example, are also the most likely to be living with their families in cramped, claustrophobic accommodation – stay where they are with no prospect of the relief of fresh air or sunshine.Are we really going to be surprised when the number of domestic abuse incidents and orce rates spike? In an age of alleged increased awareness of and concern for mental health, do we reckon the consequences on families and iniduals – not to mention the health service – can be set aside as of no consequence?The police have a duty and a responsibility to ensure that when we’re outside, we do what we can to avoid physical contact. We must all play our part in that effort. But it says something pretty small-minded about the person who spies a family enjoying, at a safe distance from others, the relief of some sunny spring weather, and indignantly interprets that as an existential threat to the nation.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Just a couple of days later came a blast and the words that would shock and fascinate the world:\u0026nbspOK, Houston, we\u0027ve had a problem here.Nasa is marking the anniversary of the mission it refers to as a successful failure, which represents one of its most high-profile disasters and its most famous miracles. It is a part of space history that is celebrated even today, with the story of the mission continuing to captivate the world.It was 11 April\u0026nbspthat marked the day the astronauts blasted off on their way to the Moon, and 13 April that an oxygen tank explosion started the mission to save the astronauts from being stuck in space.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesOn 17 April, nearly exactly six days after the mission began, the astronauts fell back through the Earth\u0027s atmsosphere and arrived safely back on Earth. It was an unlikely end to an unlucky mission.While it is now remembered as one of the most important moments in Nasa\u0027s history, the mission began in relative obscurity for a trip to the Moon. Apollo 11 had already managed to get to the lunar surface, and so what just a couple of years before was regarded as a near-impossibility was by that time relatively unexciting.Astronauts on screen from The Right Stuff to Apollo 13 and GravityBut hours later, television stations around the world were giving rolling updates on the mission\u0027s status, following closely as the astronauts and Nasa engineers back on Earth tried to save them from disaster.As well as being a relatively unwatched mission, the first couple of days of the journey were almost tediously straightforward. After two days of flight, one of the Nasa staff in mission control joked the astronauts that the spacecraft was in such good shape that they were bored to tears.Problems began on Apollo 13 when the astronauts were nearing the Moon and heard a bang and felt a shudder through their spacecraft. During what should have been a routine stir, one of the oxygen tanks on the spacecraft had burst and exploded.(After the mission was over, the explosion was traced back to overheating while the spacecraft was being tested on the ground, but there was no way to know that at the time.)The explosion also knocked out the fuel cells that should have been powering the spacecraft, and sent voltage in its circuits plunging. Engineers watching the mission from Mission Control saw the pressure in the damaged oxygen tank drop instantly.OK, Houston, we\u0027ve had a problem here, said\u0026nbspJack\u0026nbspSwigert, the command module pilot who had actually joined the mission as a last-minute substitute for a colleague who had become sick just before the mission took off.Houston, we\u0027ve had a problem, said Jim Lovell, the commander of Apollo 13.Almost immediately, it became clear that the astronauts would not be landing on the Moon, as planned. But that was a relatively unimportant challenge compared with the more pressing job of staying alive.In many ways, the explosion happened at the best possible time, and the astronauts would later say they considered themselves lucky. If it had happened earlier, they would have run out of power later, and the blast could have happened in lunar orbit or on the surface of the Moon.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

It would require them to slingshot around the Moon – coming frustratingly close to the surface they were supposed to land on – and then whip back around and float back home to Earth.In the meantime, mission control got to work putting together a rescue plan while the astronauts on board attempted to put out of their mind just how likely it was they would now die in space, something they say they never discussed.Flight controllers told the astronauts to shut down their command module and climb into Aquarius. That module was supposed to be the box that took the astronauts down to the lunar surface – but was refashioned into a lifeboat in an attempt to conserve power.Because it was never meant for so many people for so long, the lander was low on space. It was also filled with carbon dioxide, as the astronauts breathed inside their new, tiny spacecraft.One of the most famous breakthroughs came as engineers tried to find a way to fix that problem, by using the air purifiers from the now abandoned capsule in the lander. The two were the wrong shape to fit together – they were literally trying to fit a square canister into a round hole – but engineers back on Earth came up with a way of using various pieces of spacecraft to push the two together.Even once that was fixed, conditions inside the lander were miserable, without the energy for heating or other improvements to their conditions. They were stuck inside of a frigid box that was never meant to hold them, stuck\u0026nbspfor days with little to do but wait and see if the various last-minute solutions to their desperate situation would actually work.(The astronauts have said they didn\u0027t argue during this time, despite the miserable conditions, and didn\u0027t talk about the possibility of getting stuck floating in space and waiting to die either Lovell wrote in his autobiography that they were too busy struggling for survival. He also denied that they had poison pills hidden away in case of becoming lost.)Eventually they arrived back near home for what is traditionally one of the most perilous parts of the journey: dropping back through Earth\u0027s atmosphere to come home. They had enough power to switch on the command module and wait as they went through the gruelling, hot ordeal of slamming back down to Earth.As they did, the communications blackout that comes from the extreme conditions of the Earth\u0027s atmosphere lingered for much longer than usual, leaving flight controllers in the dark as to whether the three astronauts and their hacked-together spacecraft had survived.But eventually they appeared in the air, the spacecraft being cradled by three parachutes as it fell through the sky and down to Earth. They were picked up and all three completed a journey whose legacy – one of inventiveness and luck that became mission control\u0027s greatest achievement – is still celebrated by Nasa today.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

About half of applicants were seeking work after losing their livelihoods due to Covid-19, Concordia said.When can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?Listen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastThe latest round of jobs will start from the beginning of May when the UK’s soft fruit season begins with harvests of strawberries, raspberries and other summer fruits.Recruitment website Totaljobs has reported a record 50,000 searches for farm jobs last week. Searches for “fruit picker” and “farm worker” rose 330 per cent and 107 per cent respectively.The site has seen an 83 per cent jump in job applications for agricultural work over the past month.Steve Warnham of Totaljobs said he had noticed “a trend of workers who have been temporarily displaced due to Covid-19 who are now looking for roles they can take on in other sectors to keep Britain moving.”Other jobs designated as key by the government, including healthcare and logistics, have also seen a surge in interest.Mark Bridgeman, president of the Country Land and Business Association,\u0026nbspsaid it was “wonderful news” that tens of thousands of people had come forward but warned that many more were needed.“We all know this is a deeply concerning period and we are all determined to do all we can to help the country through it. In order to do so, we must recognise that farmers’\u0026nbspsupply of labour is in jeopardy,” he said.“A shortage of 80,000 workers is something we have never seen before. This is why we are calling for a ‘land army’ of workers to support farmers in feeding the country.”The campaign comes in the midst of one of the sharpest rises in unemployment on record, with more than 1 million new universal credit claims registered over the past three weeks despite government efforts to keep people in jobs by paying wages.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

About half of applicants were seeking work after losing their livelihoods due to Covid-19, Concordia said.When can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?Listen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastThe latest round of jobs will start from the beginning of May when the UK’s soft fruit season begins with harvests of strawberries, raspberries and other summer fruits.Recruitment website Totaljobs has reported a record 50,000 searches for farm jobs last week. Searches for “fruit picker” and “farm worker” rose 330 per cent and 107 per cent respectively.The site has seen an 83 per cent jump in job applications for agricultural work over the past month.Steve Warnham of Totaljobs said he had noticed “a trend of workers who have been temporarily displaced due to Covid-19 who are now looking for roles they can take on in other sectors to keep Britain moving.”Other jobs designated as key by the government, including healthcare and logistics, have also seen a surge in interest.Mark Bridgeman, president of the Country Land and Business Association,\u0026nbspsaid it was “wonderful news” that tens of thousands of people had come forward but warned that many more were needed.“We all know this is a deeply concerning period and we are all determined to do all we can to help the country through it. In order to do so, we must recognise that farmers’\u0026nbspsupply of labour is in jeopardy,” he said.“A shortage of 80,000 workers is something we have never seen before. This is why we are calling for a ‘land army’ of workers to support farmers in feeding the country.”The campaign comes in the midst of one of the sharpest rises in unemployment on record, with more than 1 million new universal credit claims registered over the past three weeks despite government efforts to keep people in jobs by paying wages.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

think about what you are putting online, and who could potentially see this information.Over time this adds up, and you may find that you have placed much more information about yourself online than you first thought.It comes amid a spate of scams linked to the pandemic, as criminals seek to capitalise on people\u0027s fears.Created with Sketch.Coronavirus culture from rooftops, windows and balconies Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A rose is delivered by drone to a woman on Mother\u0027s Day in Jounieh, LebanonWomen dance on their balcony as a radio station plays music for a flash mob to raise spirits in RomeA skeleton stands on a balcony in Frankfurt, GermanyThe film Le ragazze di Piazza di Spagna is projected on a building in RomeA woman uses a basket tied to a rope to pull a delivery of groceries up to her balcony in Naples, ItalyDJ Francesco Cellini plays for his neighbours from the rooftop terrace of his flat block in RomeA woman gestures from her balcony in BarcelonaCellist Karina Nunez performs for her neighbours at the balcony of her flat in Panama CityDJ Nash Petrovic live streams a set from his roof in BrooklynPeople applaud medical workers from their balconies in Modiin, IsraelA Brooklyn resident relaxes in a hammock hung on their balconyResidents toast during a safe distance aperitif time between neighbours in Anderlecht, BelgiumMusician Adam Moser plays for neighbours from his balcony in Budapest, HungaryA man and his son on their balcony in BrooklynA man sits alone on a roof terrace in RomeA rose is delivered by drone to a woman on Mother\u0027s Day in Jounieh, LebanonWomen dance on their balcony as a radio station plays music for a flash mob to raise spirits in RomeA skeleton stands on a balcony in Frankfurt, GermanyThe film Le ragazze di Piazza di Spagna is projected on a building in RomeA woman uses a basket tied to a rope to pull a delivery of groceries up to her balcony in Naples, ItalyDJ Francesco Cellini plays for his neighbours from the rooftop terrace of his flat block in RomeA woman gestures from her balcony in BarcelonaCellist Karina Nunez performs for her neighbours at the balcony of her flat in Panama CityDJ Nash Petrovic live streams a set from his roof in BrooklynPeople applaud medical workers from their balconies in Modiin, IsraelA Brooklyn resident relaxes in a hammock hung on their balconyResidents toast during a safe distance aperitif time between neighbours in Anderlecht, BelgiumMusician Adam Moser plays for neighbours from his balcony in Budapest, HungaryA man and his son on their balcony in BrooklynA man sits alone on a roof terrace in RomeFake food shopping vouchers and a bogus text telling iniduals they have been fined for going out during lockdown are among them.The Covid-19 pandemic has led to a surge in all kinds of scams, ranging from the doorstep to email, telephone and social media and everyone should be extra cautious of what they communicate online at this unprecedented time, added Leon Livermore, chief executive of the CTSI.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But more than anything it’s just been a real good time for us to connect together again.”One Direction’s former members have all released solo music since leaving the band, with Liam admitting last year that he felt they needed at least two years to work on their own projects before staging a reunion.“I think at some point we will get back together,” he said. “I think we will, for sure.

I translated it for him. Antonio doesn’t say anything, he mumbles, and he pulls a face as if to say, ‘I am a Spanish gentleman and I’ll do whatever a lady asks me to do.’”He called this “the most amusing moment of the night”, and said he was coming forward with the story as footage her team filmed of the evening ended up being used for\u0026nbspthe singer’s documentary, Madonna: Truth or Dare (also known as In Bed with Madonna), without Almodóvar’s permission.“I don’t mind if this seems like a settling of scores – if it had been the other way round,\u0026nbspI would have taken such a hit in the form of a lawsuit I’d still be recovering from it.

Here’s how to take the perfect picture of it:Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesUse a landmark to get perspectiveEveryone will be taking pictures of the supermoon by itself, but some of the best pictures show the moon next to a land mark or trees and houses, which is what helps to give the picture “a sense of place”, says Nasa’s senior photographer, Bill Ingalls. “Think of how to be creative – that means tying it into some land-based object. It can be a local landmark or anything to give your photo a sense of place.”Created with Sketch.9 best images of the 2016 supermoon Show all 9Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The moon rises over the O2 Arena in south-east LondonA commerical jet flies in front of the moon on its approach to Heathrow airport in west London on November 13, 2016.A super moon rises over the Statue of Freedom on the Capitol dome in Washington, DC November 13, 2016.The supermoon, the closest the moon comes to Earth since 1948, rises over the Power and Light building in downtown Kansas City, Missouri, U.S., November 13, 2016A woman sits on the rooftop terrace of a house during the supermoon in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, November 13, 2016The moon rises behind the eagle sculpture high atop LeVeque Tower in Columbus, Ohio, Sunday, Nov. 13, 2016The moon rises beyond the Arch in St. Louis as seen from the Compton Hill Water Tower on Sunday, Nov. 13, 2016The moon rises behind Reunion Tower in downtown Dallas, Sunday evening, Nov. 13, 2016.The moon rises over the harbor of the costal town of Lambert\u0027s Bay, South Africa, Monday, Nov. 14, 2016The moon rises over the O2 Arena in south-east LondonA commerical jet flies in front of the moon on its approach to Heathrow airport in west London on November 13, 2016.A super moon rises over the Statue of Freedom on the Capitol dome in Washington, DC November 13, 2016.The supermoon, the closest the moon comes to Earth since 1948, rises over the Power and Light building in downtown Kansas City, Missouri, U.S., November 13, 2016A woman sits on the rooftop terrace of a house during the supermoon in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, November 13, 2016The moon rises behind the eagle sculpture high atop LeVeque Tower in Columbus, Ohio, Sunday, Nov. 13, 2016The moon rises beyond the Arch in St. Louis as seen from the Compton Hill Water Tower on Sunday, Nov. 13, 2016The moon rises behind Reunion Tower in downtown Dallas, Sunday evening, Nov. 13, 2016.The moon rises over the harbor of the costal town of Lambert\u0027s Bay, South Africa, Monday, Nov. 14, 2016Pick the best spotLocation isn’t everything, but it can definitely help with getting a perfect picture of the supermoon if you have time to plan it. You can look up the best monuments or statues in your area to photograph the image of the moon against, like Mr Ingalls does in Washington D.C., where he lives. “It means doing a lot of homework. I use Google Maps and other apps – even a compass – to plan where to get just the right angle at the right time,” he told Nasa.Use an app to find the moonUnless you\u0027re an astronomer, the best way to know where the moon will rise or set is to use a app on your smartphone to locate it. There are several free or cheap options you can choose from, each using your phone\u0027s inbuilt accelerometer to know which way you\u0027re facing.The apps can also tell you what phase the moon is in, while some even give other celestial details, like the location of planets and star constellations. Decent options for iOS and Android devices include Star Chart, Sky Safari and Skyview.Get the right exposureIf you’re taking a picture on your camera, control the light balance by first tapping the screen where the moon appears to get the camera to focus on the object before dragging your finger up and down to play with the exposure. “You’ll usually want to drag it down for underexposure to be sure you have all the highlight detail,” National Geographic photographer Michael Christopher Brown said.Use a tripod for your camera or rest your phone on a solid surfaceDavid Reneke, an astronomer and writer for Australian science magazine told ABC.net that if you’re using an SLR or DSLR then it’s important to play with aperture settings on your camera to photograph the supermoon, but that using a tripod is essential.It’s worth using a tripod for taking pictures with a smartphone too, as any camera shake can compromise the quality of the pictures – but if you don’t have one to hand you can simply rest your phone on a window ledge.For older smartphones that use a digital zoom rather than an optical zoom, it’s generally best not to use the zoom as it could compromise the quality of the image. Instead, take the picture and then crop it.Newer phones like the Huawei P30 and P40 series feature incredible zoom capabilities that can take detailed pictures of far away objects. Other cameras come with special features to improve pictures of the night sky, such as the Google Pixel 4’s Astro mode.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Yet some arts charities have switched gears and stepped in to help, delivering emergency food packages to people in desperate need.The Auckland Project – an organisation delivering cultural and education programmes in the northeast town of Bishop Auckland – is now leading a huge emergency food operation to deliver supplies to vulnerable people in County Durham.The Independent’s Help The Hungry campaign has been supporting the work going on across the UK to ensure that everyone has enough to eat during the outbreak, backed by figures such as London mayor\u0026nbspSadiq Khan, Labour MP\u0026nbspJess Phillips\u0026nbspand TV cook\u0026nbspNigella Lawson.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Auckland Project is an impressive example of how small groups are adapting to the crisis. Based at Auckland Castle, the kitchen staff at the visitor cafe are now cooking 500 fresh meals a day. More\u0026nbspthan 10,000 of the frozen meals have been dropped off at homes in the area over the past few weeks.“We knew a big section of the community would be hit hard by this, so we felt getting food out to those in need was the best way to help,” said Liz Fisher, one of the directors at the project. “It means big changes, but the staff wanted to do all they could – they really stepped up.”How to support our campaignThe Auckland Project’s team of 17 staff and volunteers has been busy working in the kitchen, preparing dishes such as cottage pie, lasagne, mince and dumplings and carrot cake for distribution.There is a move to grow food locally, too. Two acres of the castle’s walled garden has now been set aside for planting potatoes, beans, leeks, cabbages and asparagus.“Hopefully we can start getting the food we grow here into our meals, and possibly even have a celebration dinner once we get past the crisis,” said Ms Fisher.The charity has teamed up with the South Durham Enterprise agency and another local charity called Health Express to work out which iniduals and families need support.Chris Bowron – owner of The Miners Arms on the outskirts of Bishop Auckland – is also part of the emergency food drive. His closed-up pub acts a distribution hub for the local “mutual aid” group, and Mr Bowron and a team of volunteer drivers deliver around 150 frozen meals from The Auckland Project each day.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We have teamed up with The Felix Project – a start-up charity we helped launch in 2016 – to deliver produce to community hubs in London boroughs.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Independent is also asking food charities across Britain to contact helpthehungry@ to tell us about your project and help build a directory of ways that our readers can help the hungry in their area – through money, volunteering and food donations. Food banks, which were already struggling to meet the need for emergency food parcels, have seen a huge surge in demand in recent weeks, while at the same time coping with dwindling donations, supermarket rationing systems, and a loss of many volunteers to self-isolation – yet none of the government’s rescue money goes to them.British households have stored more than £1bn worth of goods in their homes in response to the pandemic, creating shortages for food banks as shoppers ignore assurances that supply chains are robust.How to support our campaignJess Phillips, the Labour MP who recently ran for party leader, has backed our campaign, saying: “Nobody should be in the position of not being able to get enough food. In my constituency, London and in places all around the UK the coronavirus pandemic is placing extra stress on a system that was already straining.“We should all do what we can to help food and other essentials get to those that need it. That is why I’m backing the Help the Hungry campaign – please give if you are able.”Pastor Obi Onyeabor, the manager at Barking Foodbank, part of The Trussell Trust’s national network, said his pool of around 50 volunteers has been reduced by a dozen or so people currently self-isolating at home. Yet he and his team have kept their two church hall food banks open, and are now making home deliveries on Tuesdays and Thursdays to make sure the most vulnerable get supplies.“We have been scrambling for the past couple of weeks, doing all that we can – but we’re appealing for more people to come and help,” he said. “Out of fear people have been buying for themselves and their families, but I’ve seen some real generosity too.“I hope that if we can get past the panic buying stage, more people will want to give money, food or some of their time too.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailIn London, charities like The Felix Project donate 10 tons of food – or 22,000 meals – to the needy every day. But funding has dropped since the outbreak of Covid-19, limiting their capacity to carry out vital work at a time when it is more important than ever. As part of the London Food Alliance, along with FareShare and City Harvest, The Felix Project will coordinate deliveries in London boroughs in order to distribute surplus food to the elderly, poor and vulnerable. The charities will deliver food to the hubs, where local volunteers will package up parcels and arrange “last-mile” deliveries to the homes of the vulnerable.Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, has backed our campaign to help in the capital in partnership with our sister title the Evening Standard. He said: “In a city as prosperous as London, everyone should have enough food to feed themselves and their families – but unfortunately the coronavirus outbreak means some Londoners are facing even greater difficulties. It’s commendable these organisations are joining forces to help ensure surplus food isn’t wasted and instead reaches those who need it most. I urge Londoners to support this crucial initiative.”Mark Curtin, CEO of The Felix Project, said: “Our role is to pick up large volumes of nutritious surplus food from the commercial sector and deliver it to community hubs to ensure there is enough food for vulnerable people for as long as this health crisis ensues. We will be working all hours doing our bit – and it would be wonderful if your readers can get behind us so we can do this job for London.”Emma Revie, chief executive of The Trussell Trust, which supports 1,200 food banks, appealed for help from the public to get vital food to people who cannot afford the basics, and to boost volunteer numbers in areas where they are needed.“Our main priority as coronavirus unfolds is ensuring the safety of everyone who comes to a food bank – whether it’s someone needing help, someone volunteering their time, or someone making a donation,” said Ms Revie. “Until we are confident that adequate government protection against poverty is in place, food banks provide an essential community service to people unable to afford food. But this should not fall to food banks.“Our benefits system could be the life raft people need now. That’s why it’s more important than ever that we end the five-week wait for universal credit. While incredible food bank volunteers continue to help people unable to afford the basics, we would ask our government to take this essential step and end the five-week wait now. It’s five weeks too long.”Sabine Goodwin, coordinator of the Independent Food Aid Network UK, which oversees 834 independent food banks, said the charitable services were “struggling to stay above water” in the current climate and accused the government of so far “failing to act” to prevent an ever-increasing number of people falling into poverty.“Food bank use was rising before the coronavirus outbreak and the impact of job losses can only make matters far worse. But this catastrophe in the making is avoidable,” she said. “We’re calling for an income-based solution to this crisis which would mean that the Herculean efforts by volunteers across the country wouldn’t be needed.“FareShare, the UK’s biggest food redistribution charity, is also calling for more volunteers to help with packing and making van deliveries. The organisation takes food from the food manufacturers that can’t be sold in shops, either because of packaging errors or overproduction, and gets it out to food banks, hospices, homeless hostels and other charities.Commercial director Alyson Walsh estimates around 1,200 people have got in touch over the past week. “We have quite a lot of older volunteers who have had to stay at home, but we are now seeing a wave of interest in new people willing to fill in.”Ms Walsh added: “We know we have the capacity to do more – we have the warehouse\u0026nbspspace and the chillers. But the government needs to help the food industry do more in terms of all the bagging and boxing and delivery of food that needs to be done.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The £1m you have donated will help us help The Felix Project feed NHS workers, care workers, the poor and the vulnerable. Thank you.How to support our campaign“But I have to report that I have been out delivering food with Felix today and they are seeing unprecedented demand from people who cannot afford or access food.“I went to two homeless charities, The Marylebone Project and Rhythms of Life, where our deliveries are preventing deep distress. I accompanied one of 22 Felix vans that set off across the capital, filled to the brim, to ferry over 20 tons of nutritious food to three of the giant community hubs established in Barnet, Islington and Haringey, and to more than 75 charities and schools.“That’s more than double the 10 tons a day Felix were supplying in normal times.”Mr Lebedev added: “Within days, this picture is set to change dramatically yet again. Felix say\u0026nbspthey expect another 11 community hubs in another 11 boroughs to open their doors to hungry Londoners – and with it, Felix’s output will need to double again.“That is why we at The Independent\u0026nbspare committing our resources to raise another million pounds to prevent food insecurity to people already anxious about their health and that of loved ones. That is why we say: £1m raised, £1m to go. Let’s finish the job and keep vulnerable Londoners healthy and fed.”The deliveries are part of our food appeal’s support for the charities in the London Homeless Collective, the umbrella organisation of London homeless charities that The Independent\u0026nbspis working with through our Homeless Fund.

I think that’s a mistake,” the 91-year-old told Democracy Now.Created with Sketch.Democratic candidates compete on the campaign trail: In pictures Show all 18Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Jessica Canicosa, a precinct captain for Bernie Sanders, waits to greet caucus voters at Liberty High School in Henderson, NevadaHotel workers at the Bellagio in Las Vegas get to grips with voting papers during the Nevada caucusesA caricature of Bernie Sanders is projected on to a tree during a rally in Las VegasA woman waits to have a photo taken with Elizabeth Warren during a town hall meeting in Las VegasThe threat of coronavirus and other germ-borne illnesses was on some voters\u0027 minds at the Democratic caucuses in Henderson, NevadaFormer vice-president Joe Biden takes a selfie with a voter in Las Vegas ahead of the Nevada caucusesAmy Klobuchar changes her shoes backstage after giving a speech in Exeter, New HampshireA warmly-wrapped-up dog attends an Elizabeth Warren event at Amherst Elementary School in Nashua, New HampshireBernie Sanders, who romped to victory in New Hampshire against Hillary Clinton in 2016, talks to the media in ManchesterJoe Biden was hoping to improve on his poor showing in Iowa in the New Hampshire primaryElizabeth Warren, renowned for giving time to supporters for selfies, works the crowd at the University of New Hampshire in DurhamJoe Biden takes a selfie with a supporter and his child outside a campaign event in Somersworth, New Hampshire on 5 FebruaryElizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders quarrel after a confrontation in a TV debate in which Sanders claimed that Warren was not telling the truth about a conversation in which she claimed he had said a woman could not win the presidency on 14 JanuarySupporter Pat Provencher listens to Pete Buttigieg in Laconia, New Hampshire on 4 FebruaryPete Buttigieg speaks at a campaign event in Concord, New Hampshire while awaiting the results of the Iowa caucusElizabeth Warren is presented with a balloon effigy of herself at a campaign event in Nashua, New Hampshire on 5 FebruaryA Trump supporter rides past a rally for Amy Klobuchar in Des Moines, Iowa on 14 JanuaryA man holds up a sign criticising billionaires in the presidential race in front of Michael Bloomberg in Compton, Califronia.

The former New York mayor skipped the first caucus in Iowa and instead campaigned in California on 3 FebruaryHe added: “The worst crime he committed, in the eyes of the establishment, is not the policy he’s proposing it’s the fact that he was able to inspire popular movements, which had already been developing — Occupy, Black Lives Matter, many others — and turn them into an activist movement, which doesn’t just show up every couple years to push a leader and then go home, but applies constant pressure, constant activism and so on.”Many commentators have pointed out that because of Mr Sanders’s success and the way he especially inspired young voters – he won the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada – visually every Democratic candidate was obliged to have their own policies on topics such as climate change, greater accessibly to healthcare, and criminal justice reform.As it, Mr Sanders has said his name will remain on the ballot in the primaries remaining and he will continue to collect and accrue. He said this was a deliberate tactic to try and put pressure on the committee that agrees the party’s official policy platform this summer.Mr Chomsky said if Donald Trump\u0026nbspwere elected it would be an “indescribable disaster”.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I just mentioned the Lancet figures. It will get worse. What this means for the environment or the threat of nuclear war, which no one is talking about but is extremely serious, is indescribable.”He said he assumed a Biden presidency would be a continuation of former president Barack Obama’s administration “nothing very great, but at least not totally destructive, and opportunities for an organised public to change what is being done, to impose pressures”.Israel intervention in US election greater than Russia’s, says ChomskyNoam Chomsky says antifa is gift to far right and US state repressionChomsky says Trump brought Doomsday Clock alarmingly close to midnightNoam Chomsky argues Antifa is a ‘major gift to the right’He said if Mr Biden, 77, were elected Mr Sanders and his supporters could continue to seek to put that pressure on him.Aware that he will need the backing and votes on Mr Sanders’s supporters if he is to defeat Mr Trump in November, Mr Biden immediately paid tribute to the senator after he suspended his campaign. In a statement directed at those who had so vigorously supported the veteran democratic socialist, he also said: “I see you, I hear you.”On Thursday, in what was seen as another nod to the progressives he need to win over, he unveiled two new proposals he said would help ease the “economic burden on working people”.These were a proposed lowering of the age eligibility for Medicare from 65 to 60 and eliminating student debt for some lower-income families.“In our nation’s 244 years, we have never weathered a crisis that we did not emerge from stronger,” Mr Biden wrote. “This one will be no different.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

China claims Taiwan as part of its sovereign territory, though the island is practically run by its own democratically elected government.Tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world in maps and chartsWhen can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsListen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastOn Thursday and Friday, messages started to emerge on social media purporting to be from Taiwanese people expressing remorse for the abuse of Tedros and the WHO. Most had similar wording, along the lines of: “As a Taiwanese, I feel extremely ashamed that we attacked Tedros in such a malicious way. I apologise to Tedros on behalf of the Taiwanese and beg for his forgiveness.”In a statement, Taiwan’s justice ministry said the posts actually appeared to be a coordinated campaign from the mainland, designed to drive a wedge further between the WHO and Taiwan.At a briefing, the ministry’s investigations team said the posts were suspicious because of the similarity of their wording, and the fact that they mainly feature the simplified Chinese characters more common to the mainland.“There is a concern it is a deliberate operation by overseas forces,” the ministry said. “Falsely claiming to be Taiwanese, and openly admitting to racist attacks on WHO director general Tedros and begging forgiveness, seriously damages our country’s international reputation.”Also on Friday, Taiwan’s president, Tsai Ing-wen, issued a “strong protest” against Tedros’s suggestion that the abuse he had been receiving came from Taiwan.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Donald Trump threatened this week to withdraw US funding from the agency, calling its approach “China-centric”.“They’ve been wrong about a lot of things,” he told a daily briefing, where he suggested the WHO was influenced by Beijing in downplaying the severity of the outbreak when it first began. “They missed the call. They could have called it months earlier. They would have known and they should have known and they probably did know,” Mr Trump said.Other countries, like India, have erged from WHO recommendations in a number of ways, formulating their own strategies for dealing with the virus. While Tedros said “test, test, test” was the best policy, India instead aggressively shut down first international travel and then movement within the country, while testing remained at minimal levels.In Taiwan, some internet users have used the WHO row to draw attention back to the positive ways it is seen as having responded to the coronavirus pandemic.Thanks to an early and effective prevention strategy – Taiwan was one of the places to start screening passengers from Wuhan in January – the island has reported just 382 cases of the virus to date, and on Friday confirmed its sixth death, an elderly patient with underlying health conditions.Under the English hashtag #ThisAttackComesFromTaiwan, Twitter users wrote about all the good things that come from the island, including its democratic system and being the first place in Asia to legalise same-sex marriage.And using the hashtag alongside pictures of medical supplies being offloaded from an aircraft, foreign minister Joseph Wu tweeted: “Our assistance to allies in Central America has arrived safely. The people of Taiwan are proud to help friends in time of need.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Stella was at the front - the star of todays show.It was a joyful scene, but as I shouted Say cheese!, Stella suddenly threw herself onto the floor, pulled off her knickers, pointed her legs upwards and parted them to face the camera.Shocked, Lloyd instantly put down the camera and looked at me.I felt my face crumple, as I blinked back tears.Though we had never seen anything like this before - and there was nothing in Stellas placement file about sexual abuse - we knew what it must mean: shed been sexually exploited.It was a devastating realisation - and one we promptly reported to social workers.Yet it was only one of several signs hinting at our foster daughters horrendous past.Before coming to us, I learned, Stella had stripped off in her first PE lesson at school. She had stood completely naked in front of her classmates, with bruises visible on her upper arms.Then, months into her placement with us, I found Stella had been drawing men with spiky teeth in her sketchbook. One picture showed three smiling men with big, erect penises. Another was of a man with a huge, rounders bat-style arm, reaching down towards her genital area.It was a childs gallery of abuse.Another time, I offered Stella a Lion Bar - only for her to recoil in horror.Though she looked at some foods - like lasagne - as though they had arrived from outer space, she had experienced many new things with us and enjoyed snacks as much as any child.But one glimpse at the Lion Bar and she fled to the end of the garden.It was strange behaviour, yet at the time, we could never have guessed the meaning behind it.That would come from a police investigation - sparked by our reports - which found that Stella had been exploited by a highly-organised, systematic paedophile ring, likely involving her own parents.Barely of school age, she had been photographed naked and passed around paedophiles, while her mum Shannon allegedly used a Lion Bar to control her. It was so, so warped and wrong.Though we will never know the full horror of what Stella endured, we do know she was dumped as a baby by Shannon - then a struggling -year-old mum - and left in her grandmothers care.Her dad Terry, in his late s, was in prison at the time - and when he came out, he took Stella back to live with him in his dingy flat, while Shannon carved a new le for herself where.But unbeknown to Terrys relatives, he had allegedly become involved in child sex abuse images behind bars. Now, alone with Stella, he was perfectly placed to find a child for vile purposes.Later, neighbours would notice a stream of men going in and out of the property.Yet even when Stella was discovered abandoned in the freezing flat years on - surrounded by empty beer cars, her own faeces and her dads pit bull terrier, Sharky - the abuse didnt stop.Instead, she was taken back in by Shannon - whom police believe also became involved in the abuse herself. Eager to make cash, the mum allegedly took Stella on trips to her fathers to be exploited.This will be a living hell for some, she tells Sun Online.I feel for all the women in domestic situations who are being beaten. I feel for the children who are witnessing that. I feel for the children who are being abused right now.There will be a lot of abuse going on.She also says the ageing fostering community is at risk of COVID-, which has already killed more than , people in the UK.I know foster carers that have died of the virus, she tells us.You have to factor in were an ageing workforce. They cant recruit foster carers, sadly, and a lot of foster carers are in their s and s.Louise, a best-selling author and artist who grew up in the care system in Oxford, is currently caring for two foster children.Yet while she says her own experience of lockdown is going smoothly, she acknowledges other foster families will be struggling.Ive looked after children who are deeply violent, she says.I can think of children I have looked after where,they were in lockdown with me, it would be the equivalent of domestic abuse. Weve been held hostage in our own home by an eight-year-old!There will be foster families and regular families who are going to be in a place of hell right now. Exploitation means a betrayal of innocence. It is a sullying of that clean, fresh time of being a ‘child’. There is no way to take that away again - as I know all too well myself.I was also abused as a child: my adopted mother repeatedly starved and beat me. So I know Stella will probably spend much of her le trying to recall, forget, understand and find answers.Her anguish was clear to us the day she finally used her voice.After Lily accidentally dropped some of her belongings, Stella screamed a string of shocking and violent expletives.It was like a scene from Fight Club, but with worse language.Abused children in the care system, like Stella, need to be approached inidually and sensitively.But unfortunately, they are often simply stuck in front of a therapist or another trained professional in the well-intentioned but mistaken belief it will somehow fix them.I have seen rushed psychologists try to assess kids in just a single hour.Its always budgets versus what is actually best - and budgets usually win.In Stellas case, neither of her parents were convicted over the paedophile ring - her mum vanished during the police investigation and there was deemed insufficient evidence anyway.Today, Stella has many physical scars. The abuse she suffered was so severe shes had to undergo operations - with more lying ahead of her - and will never go through pregnancy herself.But despite what shes been through, shes found happiness - both at my house, and with her adopted dad, Danny, whom shes been living with for years and lovingly calls Dad.They are so lucky to have found each other.Stella brought such joy into our house during her months with us.This week, countless other children like her will be suffering abuse under the radar.To their abusers, the coronavirus lockdown must seem like the perfect opportunity for manipulation and control. Who can help their victims at this time of crisis  Who can hear them When this is over, I think there will be a real need for many, many more foster placements.And like tens of thousands of others across the UK, Lloyd and myself, , will be there, ready to welcome a new precious child into our own blended family for days, weeks, months or even years.In , I have no doubt well receive yet more joy, laughter and happy memories.The NSPCC has more information and advice about child sexual abuse - which affects one in  children in the UK - on its website.If you are concerned about your own thoughts or behaviour towards children, you can phone Stop It Now! in confidence on    or email help@stopitnow.org.uk.If you are a child and someone is sexually abusing you, you can get help and advice from ChildLine – phone  , calls are free and confidential.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Get it on now.”So there it sits, Monday to Friday at pm. The Steph Show, hosted by the former BBC Breakfast presenter, from her Yorkshire home, with nothing for company but a mission statement: “It’s a power hour of positivity.”An easy thing to claim, an impossible thing to deliver without ideas, creativity, content or anything other than secondhand clips and the same old guestsyou’ve seen clogging up every other show recently.The Steph Show has one thing and one thing only in its favour, though. Honesty.She promised viewers it “might be a bit rough around the edges”, and has been utterly faithful to her word, starting last Monday, when Steph went hurtling round her house to show off the remote cameras and then spent the next ten minutes gasping for air.Over the following  minutes, Skype links maled, mobile phones went off and an attempt to kick off a feature about weird dreams, with Keith Lemon, was shut down as quickly as it started.“What did you ask Michael Hutchence in your dream ”“Things he did romantically with Kylie Minogue that . . . ” “OK, let’s move on.”Had you thought day two was going to improve things, you probably banished those thoughts when Steph began with her own epitaph: “If you tuned in yesterday, you’ll know this is the show that isn’t meant to be on yet.”Or any other day for that matter, although Tuesday’s episode was a technical cracker and climaxed when someone rang Steph’s doorbell, mid-episode. We never did find out who, but I’m willing to bet good money it wasn’t Bafta.And so this hypnotic mess continued throughout the week.Thursday, however, was the day the edice really crumbled, as Steph attempted to lead a mass, safe-distance dancing demonstration, from a car-park in Bristol.Until it transpired the choreographer was at such a safe distance from her CD player it’d be another minute or so before it could start.Honestly, you’ve never heard a silence so awkward or so deafening and it was hard not to have a measure of sympathy for Steph and her production team, who’ve clearly been thrown under a bus by Channel .I say a measure of sympathy, because professional northerner Steph is hardly the underdog she’d have you believe.Her close friend, Sinead Rocks, is MD for the regions at Channel ’s Leeds HQ and, while there’s no suggestion she had anything to do with her recruitment, there’s always an assumption Steph McGovern is “a good thing”.Having never concentrated on her work before I’m going to assume this is for box-ticking, rather than professional, reasons, because, based on her performance here, she’s not a good presenter.For a start, she chunters for Britain, has a knack for saying exactly the wrong thingand crunches the gears during an interview like Jack Grealish heading back to lockdown.: “Provided the last laugh in Germany, did you  What are your tips for attracting wildle ” Eh  There’s more than a hint of The Fast Show about her as well.Absolutely everything is “brilliant”, especially when it’s not. It’s her habit of thinking out loud that could be the death of The Steph Show, though.“Hey! Let’s have our own talent show. Maybe your nan can yodel, your dog can dance.”Or your sister can present daytime TV without mentioning her baby. Every. Five. Minutes. I sense a vacancy in the offing.BASKET-case football club Sunderland and its army of long-suffering fans are trapped in an abusive relationship with Netflix.Every couple of years the streaming service gets to broadcast the most heartbreaking and brilliant documentary series anywhere on television, Sunderland ’Til I Die.In , they get defeat, ridicule, embarrassment and another story of failure told largely through the bracketed series of doom-laden captions that accompany every fresh disappointment: “Indistinct chatter”, “Seagulls cawing”. “Man yells”. “Jack Ross screams”. “Men chant gregariously”, and always “Tense music playing”.You get the impression, of course, the supporters love the attention that comes with losing which, in turn, tends to attract  prophets and publicity-crazed “saviours” to the club. Series two begins with a new owner, Stewart Donald, arriving at The Stadium Of Light along with public schoolboy executive director Charlie Methven, very much the David Brent of the piece, who understands only two things, attendance figures and metaphors and should’ve been ridden out of town the moment he turned up wearing pink corduroy trousers.Improbably, Sunderland also seem to have found a brilliant striker, Josh Maja, who you absolutely know is on the first stage out of Dodge the moment he arrives to turn on Sunderland’s Christmas lights and promises: “I’ll be here next year.”From that point on, disaster’s guaranteed but has to be spelt out to Charlie and Stewart by Graham at the Roker Rapport podcast: “If Will Grigg was the manager’s signing, how come he can’t find a way to play him ”“Um . . . ”BEFORE Friday night, I was convinced a mixture of resolution and good humour would see us through this crisis.No bad thing, but they also need to ditch the host, two guestsand Paul Merton and Ian Hislop, who all appeared, via Skype and remote cameras, in front of their own chosen back-grounds, on Friday.An open invitation to reveal the inner tosspot, they weren’t ever going to refuse.Hislop had a vast library behind him, as befits the intellectual colossus he imagines himself to be, while feminist author Helen Lewis was carefully positioned in front of her new book, exploiting a global pandemic for commercial gain in a manner that seems to be perfectly acceptable to the BBC, so long as you’re left-wing.If your stomach wasn’t already turned enough, the following half hour probably did the job as the four lists and host Steph McGovern cackled demonically at the brilliance of their own route-one puns.“Hasn’t Boris got his Churchill moment now ”Hislop: “Yes. Churchill the dog! HAHAHA.”Nothing, you think, could ever look more sinister, witless and terminally self-satisfied, during this whole crisis, than Friday’s Have I Got News For You.Piers Morgan: “Joe , I’ve reached the point where I may need to join in with your workouts.” .And Piers Morgan: “Let’s move on from talking about ourselves.”Yeah, that’s enough about me, let’s talk about you.

For those of you who say this virus is nothing out of the ordinary, a big fuss about nothing – how often do we have a Prime Minister in intensive care We all wish Boris a swt recovery. The country needs a strong leader at a time like this and Boris has proved, in three short months, he is that leader.There have been calls for a national unity government. All the parties coming together to see us through this crisis. It’s happened before, of course — most famously during World War Two, when we had a coalition government led by Boris’s hero, Sir Winston Churchill. We had one during the Napoleonic Wars back in , too, when that short French tosser was causing havoc in Europe.But do we need one now I think not. The only reason people are raising the issue now is because the Labour Party at last has a leader who isn’t actually certiable.Nobody would seriously think that giving power to an oaf like Jeremy Corbyn would help us through this crisis.But there are plenty of other reasons to object. First of all, we kind of already have a unity government.The Conservatives have a whopping -seat majority. In the last opinion poll Boris had  per cent of the country behind him, thinking he was doing a good job. That’s about as close to unanimous as you will ever get in a democracy. The Government, then, has a free hand.Perhapsthis virus had struck back in October last year, there might have been a point. Then we had a paralysed government with no working majority.Battling this virus would have been nigh on impossible in such a position. But the December General Election changed all that.But then there’s this. Unity governments are usually convened when we are threatened by a foreign power — as happened in World Wars One and Two and indeed the Napoleonic Wars. There have been brief exceptions.But by and large we have a unity government to show the foreign power that the whole country is united. The virus isn’t a ­foreign power. It is an insentient microscopic parasite. It doesn’t give a monkey’s who is running the country.But the most important objection is this. We are a democracy. And democracy is no less important during times of crisis than at other times. And we need a competent opposition to hold the Government to account. Boris and co haven’t done a bad job, so far. But there are plenty of questions that could be asked. Did the Government react too slowly  Why do our frontline medical staff not have adequate protection against the virus  Why did we allow planes to land from China, back in March, when the danger was apparent.OK, you may think some of those questions unfair. And asked with the benefit of hindsight. But it is the job of the Opposition to ask dficult questions, to challenge policies and highlight incompetency.I would argue that is more vital now than at any time in the last  years.Labour’s new leader, Sir Keir Starmer appears to be a sensible bloke.He is generally behind the Government in its fight against this pandemic.But he must be allowed to question, in public, the Government’s policies.We are no less unied when dficult questions are asked of politicians.The more those dficult questions are asked, the quicker this virus will be beaten.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealLIFE will never be the same again. No, I’m not talking about this wretched virus for once.The Labour Party has got rid of almost all of its nutters from positions of influence.Diane Abbott has gone. John McDonnell has gone.So has the former chairman, the godawful Geordie Ian Lavery.Corbyn himself will be gone very soon.What are we going to do for a laugh without these clowns spouting rubbish all day long Luckily — thank the Lord! — the genuinely berserk David Lammy has been installed as Shadow Justice Secretary.It’s up to you, now David, you dingbat. Keep us chuckl­ing during these dark days.DONALD Trump has turned his guns on the World Health Organisation.He’s threatened to cut off its funding. He reckons the WHO has handled the virus pandemic very badly.The WHO told Trump he was wrong to ban flights from China at the start of the outbreak because it “wasn’t necessary”.He said: “The WHO receives vast amounts of money from the United States and we pay for a majority, the biggest portion of their money, and they actually criticised and disagreed with my travel ban at the time I did it.“And they were wrong. They’ve been wrong about a lot of things.”He may look like a morbidly obese Belisha beacon in a badly fitting wig.He may sometimes talk out of his a***hole. He may have the diplomatic abilities of a semi-housetrained wolverine.But he may well be dead right on this.SOME experts reckon we could be in a state of lockdown until well into autumn.That sounds pretty grim. But there is a silver lining.It means that tour by Genesis might have to be called off.WHO’S nicked all the flour, then  Can’t find the stuff anywhere.It’s aspeople thought: “Uh oh. Armageddon’s coming. Better make a really nice cake. Maybe a coffee one with walnuts, or something. Or a Swiss roll.” I suppose stockpiling flour is more sensible than stockpiling bog rolls. People seem to have given up on that now. Crisps, though, are selling out really quickly.As I mentioned last week, that’s because most sensible people are sitting on their sofas watching Netflix.

That explains the tragedy of young doctors and nurses dying.And also London bus drivers – nine have died so far.All the people selflessly working in frontline jobs where they meet thousands of people deserve proper protection.These PPE kits cost less than  quid per person. Not much to ask, is it I SEE that my home town is in the news.Middlesbrough has been named the place in the UK where people are least likely to obey social distancing directives.This is almost certainly because they think thatthe virus comes anywhere near them, they’ll kick its f***ing head in.“Come near me, you radged microscopic t**t, and I’ll give you a split lip.”JUST seen a report that says our pets don’t know what the hell is going on.They don’t know why we’re home all the time. And they don’t get why we’re so stressy.I tried to explain to my daughter’s hamster, Alastair, what the problem was.“It’s the coronavirus,” I told it. “We’re all a bit worried.”It looked at me levelly for a moment and said: “Well stop Chinese people eating small mammals, then,” before crapping on my hand and going back to run around on its stupid wheel.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We all need to take responsibility here. This is not about overreach.“We had scurrilous stories a few weeks ago about officers snooping through baskets and removing Easter eggs and that became a trading standards issue.“That is not what the police are there to do. As I said the police are there for public order.“I will be very candid, not everyone will get this right. It will take a few weeks to have these measures bed in.“We want our public spaces to be respected and utilised in the right way.“This is not about heavy handed law enforcement. I pay credit to the police, and the majority of the British public – these are extraordinary times.“But the fact of the matter is,you’re having a party or having a mass gathering do not be surprisedthe police come up and ask you to stop.“The police are using a common sense approach. Enforcement will always be used as a last resort.”In her interview Priti went on to accuse Yvette Cooper of playing politics and insisted she had given the Labour MP a date to appear in front of the Home Affairs Select Committee.When askedshe was concernedYvette wanted to publicly quiz her over bullying allegations made before the start of the crisis, and whether she wanted to deny those on the record, Priti answered: “This is not what this is about at all.“I have offered the chair of the committee regular briefings throughout this pandemic, including access to classied material.“It is disappointing to see this at the time of the crisis when I have already offered a date. There is politicking going on.“When you look at the work of the Home Office during this pandemic, by making  calls free of charge, through the extension of NHS visas, to ious things we’ve been doing across fraud, cyber, national security, policing every single day and the help we are giving to the front line – a lot of that is self evident.“I quite frankly think it is politicking, when we have given access to the entire committee to the department, to myself in terms of another date.“I just think it’s politics basically.”Priti also went on to give up an update about Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who on Thursday night was moved to a ward after spending three nights in intensive care at St Thomas Hospital in London.She said: “He is doing well from what we’re hearing, but we should take great heart that he is in the care of the NHS. We are rooting for him. He is really great, we just want him to get well now.”“I spoke to him last week, around the last cabinet meeting and then it was clear he was unwell and that he needed rest and recoup.“He has been working flat out leading us through this, we need to give him the time and space to recover. We wish him well.”During the interview Priti went on to say the government were considering new measures to help domestic violence victims and confirmed she would be laying out the plans next week.She said of domestic abuse victims on lockdown with their partners: “This is an absolute priority for the police.“I have spent a lot of time speaking to charities and third parties and also the victims commissioner.“There is a lot of work taking place, I have already been resourcing this area. But of course the longer the pandemic continues there will be all sorts of issues around people staying at home and victims of abuse being with their perpetrators. We are finding other ways we can give them the support but also ways we can do more in prevention and protection.“I have been doing a lot of work with this sector and charities about how we can improve our response and get resources out there on the front line in dferent ways. I will be outlining these in the days to come but I can assure you that when it comes to vulnerable children and domestic abuse victims there is a lot of cross government work taking place.”Priti also discussed the increased threats to the public from online fraudsters since the beginning of the pandemic.She said: “I spend every day looking at threats and risks to homeland security.

No Brits were on board.A police source told the BFM news outlet: They had planned to come and have a good time on the Riviera despite the coronavirus epidemic.Everything had been planned by the organiser of the trip...starting with the London-Marseille trip in a private jet that he had rented on the other side of the Channel.He then booked a luxury villa in Cannes. To get there, the man had reserved three helicopters from a company which provides private connections for privileged customers.Commercial flights are greatly reduced at airports across Europe at the moment, and the authorities are trying to stop private jets breaking restrictions.The source reported that police guarding the borders of Marseille-Provence airport asked the private jet not to come and land on its tarmac.But the plane still landed anyway, and the passengers were not allowed to leave the aircraft.The private jet used by the groups was an Embraer Legacy - a Brazilian made luxury business jet.Controlled by the border police and the gendarmerie of air transport, none had valid reasons for traveling, said the source.Crossing borders is only allowed with a legitimate or compelling reason.As well as Croatian, the other travellers were German, French, Romanian and Ukrainian, said the source.They initially argued with police, and expressed anger when three helicopters waiting for them were ordered to leave empty, and their pilots fined for breaking lockdown restrictions.The source said the Croatian had paid for everything, including the villa and plane, was  looking forward to the break, with his friends and young female escorts.When confronted by police, he offered them cash, saying: ‘I have money, let’s talk,’ said the police source.The source added: He said they all go to the villa, and lockdown there, and that there would be no problem.But it was obviously a recreational trip, and under the containment measures these are strictly prohibited.’The only fines issued were to the three French helicopter pilots.None of those on board have yet been identied by police.Nine members of the holiday party ed to London by the private jet on Saturday evening, while the tenth went back to Germany.France has been in lockdown since March  in a bid to slow the spread of the pandemic, with only essential trips allowed that must be justied with a signed piece of paper.Health director Jérôme Salomon said the lockdown was working: ‘Thanks to these measures, we are in the process of putting the brakes on the epidemic.’The lockdown, which was supposed to run until April , will be extended beyond that date, it was announced on Wednesday.President Emmanuel Macron will discuss the coronavirus situation in a live TV address to the nation on Monday.     Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

My body ached severely, I felt so heavy and was sweating with a fever.Doctors have warned that a loss of taste or smell could also be a sign of coronavirus.The British Association of Otorhinolaryngology, which represents experts in ear, nose and throat medicine, explained that an eye infection conjunctivitis may also be another sign.In a statement, the docs said: Evidence from other countries that the entry point for the coronavirus is often in the eyes, nose and throat areas.A study published in JAMA Ophthalmology found that . per cent of  patients with COVID- at a hospital in the Hubei province had eye-related symptoms - although further studies are needed on a larger scale.A number of people who go on to have coronavirus first report losing their sense of smell or tasteIts thought that losing the ability to smell or taste could be due to the virus destroying cells in the nose and throat.Experts say its something people can commonly experience after having other types of coronaviruses - such as the common cold.Prof Carl Philpott, of the Norwich Medical School at UEA, said: Coronaviruses have previously been associated with what we refer to as post-viral olfactory loss– this is smell loss that persists after a cold.There are many respiratory viruses that can potentially cause problems with the smell receptors.So far with Covid-, the smell loss appears to be transient but only as time elapses will we know how many people have a more permanent loss.Ryan Van Waterschoot ended up in hospital for  days with coronavirus, and losing his sense of smell and taste were the first few symptoms.Just a day after losing the two senses, he went from feeling tired to not being able to move in just one day, before his temperature soared and he was rushed to hospital, where he was given oxygen for five days.The -year-old said: I didn’t think I was going to make it out of the hospital. I thought it was the end of the road for me.Some people may experience brain fog, also known as mental fatigue, as another symptom of coronavirus.Its not been officially looked into as a symptom but its another indicator that those who have experienced the illness have reported experiencing.Thea Jourdan, , said she didnt experience a cough or fever - instead her introduction to Covid- began with a tickle in her throat and a dull headache,.The mum-of-three, from Hampshire, says she then started to experience brain fog.She told the Daily Mail: Initially I felt exhausted, asI was dragging myself through treacle and had no choice but to go to my bed. I had no meaningful cough and I wasn’t running a fever.But I had a peculiar sensation of something settling deep within my lungs, almost like breathing in talcum powder.I also had brain fog. I was unable even to fill out forms from the children’s schools. I just wanted to sleep.Another woman, who had recently recovered from Covid-, told the Huffington Post that she too had experienced the unusual mental block before her symptoms worsened.Christy, from Seattle, had a similar feeing of brain fog - she said her illness started with a multi-day fever that progressed into sinus congestion and a headache following it.She added: “It’s not just a cold. I’m pretty healthy and not old , and it kicked my a**.”Another symptom that coronavirus patients have reported is feeling extremely tired before symptoms develop.According to a report in the Journal of the American Medical Association, up to  per cent of those hospitalised with Covid- reported exhaustion and fatigue.Linda Carr, , from Hethersett, Norfolk, told the Mail: I felt very sick and terribly fatigued. But I didn’t have a temperature or a cough.Within two days I could barely stand. I didn’t have the energy to lt one foot in front of the other.But she knew it was more serious than a flu when she developed a tightness in her chest that left her short of breath.After visiting her GP, she was sent straight to hospital where she was kept for five days after testing positive.Linda says she is still feeling weak and remains in isolation at home.Those who develop minor symptoms such as a high temperature or continuous cough should self-isolate for seven days.If you live with others, you should also stay at home for  days from the day the first person started showing symptoms.Anyone with suspected coronavirus who becomes seriously ill should call  and in a medical emergency always call .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

our schools is one of the key issues the nation will face when it steps carefully away from this Covid- lockdown.Based on the evidence, I believe that re-opening schools should be considered early in the exit strategy because it appears they play a relatively small role in transmissions.We tend to see children as excellent spreaders of bugs, and therefore ­closing schools seems to make sense.Yet research published earlier this week shows that this isn’t necessarily true for the Covid- virus.Almost everything we know about closing schools to stop disease outbreaks comes from influenza.Flu is a very dferent virus to coronavirus, and children drive much of influenza’s transmission.Coronavirus is less likely to affect children and young people.They rarely get very sick, and they mostly get very mild symptoms or show no ­symptoms at all.During the  epidemic caused by Sars — a cousin of Covid- — the data showed that schools and schoolchildren played no role in transmitting the virus.To

getting some online teaching  —  my -year-old had brilliant support from his school before the holidays.But we know that some schools are offering much less, and I worry that it is particularly the poorest children who are ­missing out.Children also benefit from school through contact with friends and adults outside their family.Plus there is support for mental health and even in the food that they might not get at home.School closures also force children together with parents at home for weeks on end.This can be a source of great bonding, but we know that, particularly for teens, being cut off from peer groups and other adults is not good for their development or mental health.The issue of forcing key worker parents to stay home has been largely solved during the pandemic by keeping some schools open just for their ­children.But for parents who are not key workers, being forced to look after ­children for weeks at home can prevent them earning an income.Closing schools has in the past been shown to increase social contacts between children outside school, and between children and adults looking after them, particularly grandparents, who are most vulnerable to this virus.Currently, those over  should be self- isolating away from children.But there are many grandparents who are under .Andschools stay closed while we allow adults to exit lockdown first, we risk an increase in contact between children and grandparents.One of the problems is that we tend to think of schools as being entirely closed or open.Our research showed that there are a range of potential options.It would mean a partial or staged re-opening with social distancing built in.The point of social distancing for schools is to reduce the number of children in contact at any one time.Ensuring that dferent school years don’t meet would be a useful start.So have half the school attend in the morning and half in the afternoon, close the playgrounds and stagger year-group start, end and break times so that ­dferent years never meet.Then ensure that dferent classes don’t meet.This could mean staggering start times by class or alternating the ways that classes enter and leave school, and ­keeping students in form classes for all their lessons.Schools could also look at how feasible social distancing is within classes.True, most British classrooms could not fit a metre between desks.However,only half of the school is attending at any one time, classes could spread out across more than one classroom.We also need very clear rules on when not to come to school with any ­symptoms, and the need for self-isolation at homeothers in the family had been ill will be required.Teachers need to be protected, as we protect those who ­continue to drive buses, man shopping centres and work in our health ­system.And teachers should be early in the queue for testing.This may all sound too dficult.However, we owe it to our ­children to examine all of these options.It could be done more easilywe had sufficient testing to know which children or teachers had had Covid-.But we may need to proceed ­without that, given what we are currently told about antibody-testing timescales.As mentioned, our schools are already ­partially open — for the children of key workers and vulnerable children.Let’s gradually increase that “partially” in a way that’s guided by science.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

OK, I’ve only had three weeks of it and, unlike Jesus, I’ve been able to eat and drink, although Satan is tempting me every afternoon to sup unholy spirits. The gospels don’t say exactly what He did to kill time in lockdown in the Judean desert, but I’m guessing he pledged to do a lot of things, and failed. That’s my story. I told myself I’d re-discover books, but whenever I got a few pages into one I’d hear an alert on my phone, look away, spend half an hour scrolling, and realise all literature is doomedit exceeds  characters. I tried to learn how to cook something new to add to the one dish a week I make, but my paella stuck to the pan and I lashed it into the bin when one of the kids laughed and askedit was called a paella crap. I grew a beard, which I thought made me look a bit like Al Pacino in Serpico, only for my we to tell me I looked like Jon Pertwee in Worzel Gummidge. I decided to put a coat of nish on the rotting garden furniture but the three paint brushes I had were glued together with old paint, and when I drove to BQ, they turned me away because I hadn’t worked out how to click and collect from them. I never will. So I turned to Netflix, hoping to get hooked on a new American drama or documentary series and got so bored I ended up scouring US news channels to find a Donald Trump press conference for some mental stimulation.  And then a week ago I did something that finally beat the lockdown blues. I dug out my old DVD box sets and started to re-watch comedy classics. I devoured The Office, delighting again at Ricky Gervais’s glorious anti-PC creation David Brent. I stuck on Fawlty Towers and remembered how funny John Cleese used to be before he became a real-le whining malcontent. Watching the greatest political satire ever, The Thick Of It, left me marvelling at the master of the four-lettered insult Malcolm Tucker."},{"url":null,"title":"britains lockdown babies pictured mums","story":"NewsBritains lockdown babies pictured as mums give birth during UK coronavirus pandemicMums across Britain have spoken of the joy and drama of giving birth during the pandemic.

Thankfully, NHS staff have been at hand to battle the disease and letting midwives get on with the job of delivering babies. The world might seem a dark place at the moment, but these amazing babies would put a smile on anyone’s face… Jodie Mills and Rosie “From the moment we were put in lockdown, I was anxious about going into hospital and giving birth in the current situation,” says Jodie. “It was my second child and when my contractions started at am on April , my sister drove over to look after our son, Reggie,  months, and my husband, David, , drove me to Darlington Memorial Hospital. “My contractions were coming thick and fast.”  The -year-old from Catterick Garrison, North Yorks, added: “We quickly made our way up to the maternity ward on the sixth floor. However, the baby didn’t want to wait – she was halfway out when we were in the lt! “All the staff had gloves on and I managed to hold her in until we got to the double doors of the maternity ward. My husband was frantically buzzing the bell for assistance before a midwe appeared. “She ran out and quickly took off her cardigan and delivered our baby in the corridor. “Our daughter, Rosie, was born at :am. She weighed lb oz. I was very nervous because of the pandemic but the care we received at both the labour and maternity ward was second to none, they were professional, friendly and reassured you. “My husband was allowed in the labour ward, but was only allowed to stay a short while. We had to stay  hours to be monitored and then partners weren’t allowed in to collect us, so a nurse helped walk me down to the car. “I can’t thank all the staff enough – especially the midwe that took her cardigan off to catch Rosie!” Laura Gillham and baby Rudy “My labour was really quite good considering everything that is going on,” says Laura, .  “I gave birth to my first child at Darlington Memorial Hospital and the staff and midwives were amazing! “At first I had planned on having two birthing partners, my boyfriend Brad, , and my mam, Sharon. But two weeks before my due date I found out that because of the pandemic the rules had been changed so that I could only have one birthing partner. Learning that my mam couldn’t be there was slightly upsetting but understandable. “On April , I was in labour and Brad was allowed with me. After seven hours our son, Rudy, was born at :pm, weighing lb. “Brad was with me the whole time and didn’t miss a thing, he was even allowed to cut the cord. The whole experience was amazing!” Laura, from Darlington, Co Durham, added: “Mam hasn’t got to meet him yet, only through the window. She can’t wait to meet him in person for a proper cuddle!” Zoe Green and Joss “I gave birth to my seventh baby on March . I’d already been self-isolating for two weeks due to being pregnant and having bad asthma,” explains Zoe.  “When I started having contractions I went to Colchester General Hospital. “But then the contractions stopped. “I was about to be sent home when a matron came on the ward to speak to everyone and explained that from that point onwards the pandemic meant that no visitors would be allowed on the wards any more and partners would only be allowed at the birth.” The -year-old from Colchester, Essex, added: “I went home feeling a bit sad but on a mission to get my labour going before the hospital got any worse.  “The next day I did a YouTube inducing-labour exercise video, bounced on my ball every chance I got, went for a long walk and then had pineapple and to finish the day, ordered myself a hot curry and had a lavender bath... and then went to bed with my fingers crossed. I got my wish as I heard my waters pop in my sleep at .am. “I was booked in for an elective C-section and they didn’t want me going into full-blown labour. “I grabbed my bag and notes, and headed to the hospital where my baby’s dad, Dan, met me. “There was also another lady in the other room for the exact same thing so the poor midwives were going from room to room washing their hands coming in and when they left. “Our baby boy, Joss Henry Craig Green, was born at :am weighing lb oz. “All the staff we met were absolutely amazing and so lovely and reassuring.”  Angela Ahmed and Twins Trent and Tallulah “I was  weeks pregnant with twins and already had two other sons, Jamal, , and Kia, , when on March  I started suffering with cramps,” says Angela,  from Bromsgrove. “I went to Royal Worcester Hospital and I expected to be sent home with paracetamol, instead I was  centimetres dilated and they were ready to be born at just  weeks.  “Scared, I called my partner, Chris Kerr, , and he came in within two hours. Trent came out at .pm weighing lb oz and Tallulah was born at .pm at only lb oz. “We are allowed to see the babies separately and I’ve been isolated. Me and Chris can only have contact from a distance as he’s isolated at home with my other two sons. “The staff are amazing and can’t do enough for me and my babies. I would love to give them my appreciation.

Professor Paul Cosford said: “I think several weeks isn’t unreasonable. Let’s hope its sooner than that,” he told BBC Radio ’s Today programme. “All my experience dealing with any sort of infectious disease suggests once you start getting things under control, that is the time you absolutely need to continue with all your measures so you can bring the disease right down, essentially to crack it across the country.” He said the restrictions could be lted in stages. “I could conceive of circumstances in which some of the restrictions are lted sooner and some are lted later,” he said.

Now is the time we can start to see mammals and their newborns pop their heads above ground. Today Chris Packham and zoologist Megan McCubbin talk about their favourite British mammals to keep your eyes peeled for in April and May. Badgers  Badgers are active throughout the course of the year and would’ve given birth in February or March, so in the next couple of weeks the young might be coming above ground for the first time. But they’ve very shy. They live in setts in the middle of the large territory that belongs to the whole family. The main sett is where the badgers live for most of the year and where they rear their babies but they also have smaller setts which they use in the Spring, Summer and Autumn so they can sleep near to where they find food.  A family of badgers can have a really big territory - each badger terrirtory might have up to six smaller setts. They’re sociable animals and like living with each other and love to play. And they’re really good at knowing which territory is theirs by their latrines - badgers have really distinct smelling faeces which they put at the edge of their territories so other families know they shouldn’t enter. It’s quite a sophisticated set up and is essential to their survival. Bats  We have  species of bat in the UK,  of which are known to be breeding here - that’s almost a quarter of our mammal species. They’re emerging this time of year and you can see them in all areas - urban or rural. But bats are always betteryou’ve got water near you. Soyou’re near a pond, reservoir, anything like that, you’ll see they’re beginning to emerge regularly. Bat populations have suffered severe declines during the past century. Deer  We had a muntjac deer near us the other day. You can tell the dference between male and female because the males have two very distinctive dark lines down the forehead and have very short antlers. The females are slightly paler. Muntjac have these amazing curved bottoms like rabbits. They are quite pig like with very sticky legs and are one of my favourites. They’re not native to the UK and were brought here in  to Woburn Safari Park. Some of them escaped, which is why they’re quite common across woodlands in the south of England. They’re very shy and secretive animals, soyou get a glimpse make the most of it. They’re fascinating, you can see them on roadsides nibbling at the verges. But they aren’t too popular with gardeners because they go for all the tasty parts of your plants - they love rosebuds. Also just be waryyou’re out walking your dog in an area where they might be and keep your animal on a lead. Foxes  April is the time we would expect start to see our fox cubs and they start to move around out of their den. If people are lucky enough to have a den in their garden shed, this is when they’ll first see the fox cubs. They’re very unfoxy when you first see them, they have quite blunt faces with short ears. They look quite cat-like, like kittens the nose hasn’t grown down yet and they’re chocolate brown in colour, they’re not red yet. Wobbling about with their skinny tails, they try to find their balance. We’ve already had reports of that cubs have been sighted as early as Christmas and January. This is really early, which is a sign of climate change. Fellow Springwatch presenter, Iolo Williams, told me he saw very young fox cubs and that was just before or after Christmas. That’s quite unusual. Otters  Pre s, where a lot of chemicals were put into our waterways, many of them were devoid of le and it damaged the eco systems. Everything at the top of the food chain disappeared. Otters only really occurred on the western side of the UK, in Wales, Cornwall and Devon. When I was a kid in the s, otters were a rather rare animal they were dficult to see and it didn’t occur in Hampshire where I grew up. Now they have recovered their range and have been found in every UK county, all the way across from the west and now including Kent. But they have not recovered their numbers, so there’s still scope for more otters to exist in our environment, particularly now our waterways have been cleaned up. We can’t be complacent about otter conservation just because they’re back everywhere - they’re not back in numbers they were, but it’s great to see them turning up. In urban areas they have even been turning up and you can see them in daytime from footpaths. Otters were almost an enigma and now are mostly accessible. The Sainsbury’s supermarket in Andover has a path that runs alongside the river and while you’re pushing your trolley you can look over the side and see them. How to make a hedgehog house and highway  Hedgehogs are a favourite this time of year - everyone loves hedgehogs. It’s mild and now’s the time they’re coming out into the garden soyou have a trap camera, now is the time to set it up. You can also make a little hedgehog house which is really simple. Get a bucket, put some hay or straw, grass, any long organic matter, inside the bucket, just something the hedgehog can hide in. Lie the bucket on its side and keep it steady with something so it doesn’t roll. Put it under a hedge or somewhere not exposed – they’re very secretive and shy things and are much more comfortable when they feel secure.

Barred from working, she has no means of earning extra cash to help support her young daughter. She said the toddler is constantly in tears, unable to grasp why she has to stay indoors. And when Fuligdi does go out, she finds it impossible to provide for her - having to pick between food and medicines during the worst health crisis in modern times. Got a story  Email webnews@mirror The government is facing calls to help asylum seekers through the crisis by increasing support by £ a week. Fuligdi said the lockdown has brought back harrowing memories of the abuse she suffered after being detained in an army camp in her native Sri Lanka. The mum, who now lives in a room in a house in Liverpool, said that the lockdown is taking a huge toll on herself and her daughter.  She revealed: The television is broken and she hasnapost many toys - they are too expensive for us. She is sad and crying – she wants to be outside with other children and so do I but of course we canapost go out and she is too young to understand why we must stay here. And describing the challenges of making do with such a small allowance, she said: As an asylum seeker waiting status I get around £ a day for myself and a little more for my daughter so money is very tight.  We just manage but now it is much more dficult. The local shops have increased their prices – what used to be £ now costs £ – and nappies are very hard to find. The ones in the smaller shops are too expensive for us. The crisis has left Fuligdi feeling upset and isolated, as she has been forced to stop attending therapy sessions and English classes. And she said being forced to remain inside is bringing back horric memories of the torture she suffered after her  arrest, after being accused of supporting anti-government rebels.  Fuligdi, from a Tamil family who was arrested following the war between the government and rebel LTTE, said: I have been badly affected by the torture and abuse I experienced. I canapost forget what what happened to me. Night time is the worst – all the memories come back. Lockdown makes it worse. Before we could go outside and socialise. Now we are stuck inside. I am depressed and afraid I will catch Coronavirus. How would I cope then  She fled Sri Lanka five years ago, and is still waiting for an asylum decision. The mum said: The long wait and the uncertainity affects my physical and mental health. I want to stay here and live in safety with my daughter but I canapost until my refugee status is granted. She has been supported by charity Freedom from Torture, which provides a vital leline for those who suffered shocking abuse.The organisation has launched a petition, which says: No one should have to choose between medicine, food, or protection at a time like this. After Universal Credit allowances were increased to help struggling families through the crisis, the heads of more than  organisations called on the government to do the same for those reliant on asylum allowances."},{"url":null,"title":"easter shoppers stuck insane queues","story":"NewsEaster shoppers stuck in insane queues for  hours due to coronavirus lockdownMassive queues have formed outside UK supermarkets as customers - some waiting two or three hours to enter a store - load up on Easter supplies while shops enforce the coronavirus lockdowns social distancing rulesShareCommentsByChris KitchingJames AndrewsMoney Editor:,  APR Updated:,  APR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video coronavirus-patient-pamela-mills-struggles-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:,],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news easter-shoppers-stuck-insane-queues-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWe will use your email address to send you newsletters.

Long lines snaked through car parks on Good Friday as customers were forced to stay at least two metres apart and stores limited the number of people allowed inside due to social distancing rules. With many stores closed on Sunday, queues at some shops formed an hour before they opened and had hundreds of customers, and some shoppers said they gave up or didnapost bother at all because the wait was so long. Britons are facing an unprecedented Easter bank holiday weekend thanks to the Covid- pandemic and a lockdown that is now in its third week and set to be extended. Have you been affected by coronavirus  Email webnews@mirror. A Twitter user in West Sussex wrote: @Tesco Iaposve just been speaking to someone who has just finished a  hour sht on a Covid ward. She is in a -hour queue to get into your Crawley store. She is not allowed to jump the queue. How is that OK A Tesco worker replied: Although we ask our security to stick to the rules, we would also expect them to use common sense in times like these and let them through. I will contact the storeyou let me know which one it is. A man in Birmingham wrote: Queues at the supermarkets this weekend are giving me anxiety!  Looked like - hour+ queues at Asda and Sainsbury’s near me. Hope it’s just for Easter weekend and normal service resumes shortly. A woman in London wrote: Thank goodness I donapost need any more shopping now until next week.  Itaposs literally taken  hours to get a few essential bits in my local Sainsburyaposs and Waitrose. The last time I saw queues that long, I was outside Madame Tussauds during the school holidays. And another added: Waited in a queue at the butchers for way over an hour, all because I wanted lamb for Easter.A woman in Scotland tweeted: Well folk seem determined to aposovershotapos for Easter. The queue is all the way round our local Tesco’s very large car park #GoodsFriday. Photos posted on social media showed queues stretching well into car parks where barriers were set up to keep things orderly. In Cwmbran in South Wales, a man who posted a photo of shoppers waiting to enter an Aldi wrote: Queue for Aldi is insane mind.  Pictures showed shoppers queing in a car park outside an Asda in Brighton, East Sussex, long lines outside a Morrisons in Seaburn, South Tyneside, and similar scenes at a Sainsburyaposs store in Heaton, Newcastle. Shoppers told to expect long queues Families have been warned that queues to get into supermarkets might be even longer than usual on Saturday, as a result of Sunday trading laws. Shops in England and Wales - but not Scotland - have to shut their doors on Easter Sunday and Christmas daytheyaposre over  square metres in size.  And these rules apply coronavirus or not - meaning even more families than usual will need to stock up on essentials this Saturday. To make matters even worse, Friday and Monday count as Sundays thanks to their bank holiday status over Easter - meaning big shops are operating reduced hours on those days too. Throw coronavirus restrictions on the number of people allowed into shops at once and you have a recipe for the mother of all queues.  On a normal Sunday big shops can open for six hours, between am and pm. This weekend, those restrictions apply to Friday and Monday, while shops over a certain size must close entirely on Sunday. Then there are additional hours reductions as a result of coronavirus. Some shops are closing earlier so staff have more time to restock shelves. Police face criticism for patrolling supermarkets A police force is facing criticism after its officers patrolled a Tesco and found that the non-essential aisles were empty. Cambridgeshire Police officers visited the supermarket just a day after Northamptonshireaposs chief constable faced a backlash for suggesting officers could search shopping trolleyspeople kept flouting social distancing rules. Home Secretary Priti Patel hit back and said checking supermarket trolleys is not appropriate.

Grandmother Lynne Limbert was killed by coronavirus at the age of  after beating bowel cancer just the previous year. Her son Phil Limbert said his mum was tough and it was asshe knew she was dying, reports the Liverpool Echo. Phil said: My mum and dad had a long standing joke between them. My mum would go to the caravan in Wales at weekends, she loved going to the caravan. She would say to my dad, aposright, see you laterapos. He would say aposI love youapos and she would roll her eyes and say aposdittoapos. He knew she loved him, it was just a bit of a joke. But in the hospital they had to put her on a ventilator and she needed sedating. Before they did, she got one of the staff and said apostell my husband I love himapos. Itaposs a bit like she knew. She was not soft my mum. Lynne, a retired nurse, from Broadgreen in Liverpool, had beaten bowel cancer last year and was healthy and active, spending her days doting on her two grandsons and enjoying a busy social le.  But after a few days of feeling under the weather, Lynne was rushed to hospital where her lungs were unable to recover and she died on Tuesday afternoon.Administrator Phil said he was forced to say goodbye to his unconscious mum, who he described as his hero, in full protective gear. Through tears, Phil said staff at the Royal Liverpool Hospital, where he also works, were absolutely amazing, holding her hand so she was not alone and making sure she did not feel any pain. Phil, , said: She was in hospital for a total of  nights. I saw her a few days before she went in and she was complaining that she was just a bit cold. She was just like aposclose the door, Iaposm a bit chillyapos, and it just sort of came on from there. We used to message quite a lot on Facebook, and over the next few days she was still upbeat but she was saying her head was pounding and she felt like she had been hit by a train. Phil says his mum seemed to improve and remained in good spirits. However around two weeks before her death her devoted husband, Philaposs dad Paul Limbert, rang the NHS  number for advice - and based on her symptoms an ambulance was immediately dispatched. Lynne was fully aware, but by that point was so breathless she could hardly string a sentence together and was kept in the back of the ambulance for around an hour while paramedics provided her with oxygen.  That was the last Philaposs dad saw of his we. Phil, his older brother Chris Limbert and their dad Paul were then faced with the tortuous experience of waiting to seeLynne would recover while not being able to visit due to strict infection controls at the Royal. Phil says the family were kept up to speed with regular phone calls from the hospital, but after  days he received the worst possible news - all treatment options had been exhausted. He said: Then it was like wow, this is so real. We had not been able to see her, we were not there to see how it was developing. You just donapost believe it.  Phil was allowed to pay a final visit to his mum with PPE protection, but his dadaposs health conditions meant he was too high risk and Chris could not face seeing his mum attached to tubes and wires. He said: I didnapost want to stay for the turning off of the machine, I didnapost want to remember her that way and I didnapost want to see her go, although they did give me that option and said you can take as long as you need. I got to say goodbye to her and hold her hand. I had messages from all the family saying how much they missed her and how much she was loved. I told her she was going to see my grandad and nan, and that she was not in pain anymore. Lynne had no health problems, said Phil, and she loved going for walks as part of a walking group, as well as enjoying a drink with her sister Christine who lived opposite. Phil said she was devoted to her grandchildren, his three-year-old son Oscar and Chrisaposs -year-old son Zak, and would do anything for anyone.

An inquiry into the  inferno in West London found that aluminium composite cladding was the main reason the blaze, which killed  people, spread so rapidly. Inquiry chairman Sir Martin Moore-Bick concluded the ’ polyethylene cores “melted and acted as a source of fuel”. Last month, following the Mirror’s Grenfell: Never Again campaign, Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced a £billion Building Safety Fund to help cover the costs of removing unsafe cladding from all private and social sector buildings over  metres tall. But  of the fire authorities that responded to a freedom of information request revealed a total of at least  high-rise buildings are currently guarded by fire patrols because unsafe cladding has still not been removed. They also said they had attended  fires at those blocks. The National Fire Chiefs Council said: “We are concerned that dangerous cladding remains on many buildings.” While some landlords and leaseholders are paying for these patrols, others are refusing to. Rachael Loftus, , who lives in a dangerous timber-clad building in Leeds, previously told the Mirror leaseholders were forking out £, a week from the building’s sinking fund. Residents were told when that ran out they would have to pay £ per flat, per month.

Eric Roberts was visiting land near Aberffraw, Wales, and realised another vehicle was heading his way despite the lane to the beach at Porth Cwyfan, Anglesey  - despite it being closed The beauty spot is famous for its medieval church which sits on an island off the coast. Villager Eric Roberts, , explained he was checking on his sheep when he spotted a blue car parked on a hill above the beach this morning. He said: “There’s been a ‘Road Closed’ sign and cones on the lane for a few days now. The guy had obviously moved them to get to the beach.“I waited around a few minutes and watched as he loaded his kayak into the car. Then he came driving up the lane and had to move the sign and bollards again to continue his journey. “I decided to politely confront him and explain calmly why he shouldn’t have been there.” Eric filmed the stand-off in a video which has been shared almost , times and had , views on Facebook. The grey haired man - wearing shorts and sandals - is seen climbing out of his blue -plate Jaguar. Eric asks him to replace the cones and sign to prevent other accessing the beach, before telling him: “You shouldn’t be here in the first place.” The man replies: “The rules were set for big towns and cities. Here in the rural environment it’s a completely dferent kettle of fish. “I’ve done contamination control. I know what I’m talking about.” Eric tells him: “The government says essential travel only. With a kayak  Do you think that’s essential ” He replies: “No, but I am working away from other people.” The man says he lives in nearby Menai Bridge, where the tidal waters of the Menai Straits separate Anglesey from mainland Wales, and Eric asks why he hasn’t chosen to canoe closer to home. “What’s wrong with the Straits to go with that plastic thing you’ve got in the car  Nothing.” Eric says. “Why come here ” The man replies: “The current in the Straits is quite strong.”  Eric says: “Good - you’ll get a good paddle, it’ll give you good muscles.” The confrontation ends with the man ing to reassemble the roadblock. Eric said afterwards: “It’s a popular little spot in summer, we might see eight cars parked up at a time. “But there’s no reason to be down there now unless you live in the village. I couldn’t believe my ears when he tried to claim the rules only applied to towns and cities. They’re for everyone! “I was waiting for him to come back with a cocky reply, but he admitted himself that coming here with a kayak isn’t essential travel.

And it is understood that US telly powerhouse Oprah Winfrey is the favourite in the running to bag what could be the biggest interview of the decade. Meghan is in talks with several US TV networks about a “tell-all” interview, Daily Star reports.The interview, coming as it would once the coronavirus lockdown is over, is likely to be screened across the globe as millions tune to hear Meghan break her ­silence about the coupleaposs split from “the firm”. Meghan is believed to be “extremely serious” about trying to “win back the public” with the TV spectacular and Harry is said to be giving “serious consideration” to the proposal. Meghan is thought to favour allowing cameras to film their home and family le, which is a common theme in blockbuster US TV interviews, such as when Bashir famously interviewed Michael Jackson in . A source close to the couple revealed that Meghanaposs interview would be “the most anticipated global TV interview event since Diana’s famous ­tell-all chat with Martin Bashir.” The source added: “Meghan wants to donate all the money to charity – probably the NHS after the incredible efforts of all the frontline workers.  “When she was part of the Royal Family it would have been unthinkable for her to do a solo interview with anyone about her le and how being a princess has changed her world. But now she’s very much her own boss and it has put her under pressure feeling that the public have lost their ‘love’ for her and Harry ­after they took the big step of­ ­going on their own”.

Group gatherings are now totally banned with people being told to stay six feet away from others at all times. The elderly, who are especially at risk to infection from coronavirus, are among the group of the most vulnerable who have been told they must self-isolate for  weeks in a bid to keep them safe. But this can be an incredibly lonely experience for OAPs, who are unable to spend time with their loved ones or socialise.And now  people living with dementia who are separated from their families in the Coronavirus lockdown have explained how music has become a leline in keeping them connected.Moyra Tourlamain, , lives at home with her husband John, , who was diagnosed with dementia in . They have had to stay away from family and friends but have found solace in online music sessions via the Music for Dementia  campaign. Moyra said: John and I have always been into music – in fact one of the reasons I married him was for his record collection! It’s played a big part in our le and still does. Before the Covid- pandemic they would attend music classes designed to help people with dementia in their local area near Cambridge. But although John has missed out on the face-to-face connection, his symptoms – which have been heightened recently due to the isolation – have been alleviated by attending online versions of the sessions. Former BBC bureaucrat Moyra said: As Hans Christian Andersen famously said, aposwhere words fail, music speaksapos. The online sessions have been a leline not just for John but for me. They are a landmark in what are very long weeks. I think it’s really important for our general wellbeing. It’s also a whole new experience and the engagement with the computer is important for John. It’s really good to see everybody, to connect and make the music together. There are hundreds of thousands of people who are in the same boat as us who might feel lonely and isolated and their conditions may have got worse as a result. We’d urge them to go onto the Music for Dementia  website and find out how to make the most of music during this time.  Music for Dementia  – a campaign backed by broadcaster Lauren Laverne to get more access to music for the , people living with dementia in the UK – has launched a new Musical Guide for those experiencing heightened anxiety during the lockdown. And more and more people are now using Music for Dementia ’s Musical Map, which gives information about online services for those with dementia, as well as taking advantage of Dementia Discos and live streamed events. It comes amid reports that UK care homes are in danger of being overwhelmed by the coronavirus with staff warning they are at “breaking point”. Lauren Laverne said: We’ve already seen how music has played a vital role in keeping people’s spirits up across the world during isolation. It echoes exactly what the Music for Dementia  campaign has been saying - although the feeling of isolation is an ongoing situation for people with this condition. For people living with dementia, music is a leline to connect in a way that nothing  can. Don Leitch, , of Royston, Hertfordshire, has been living with dementia for seven years and has been separated from his daughter, Caroline, due to the coronavirus. Caroline, , would see her dad at least once a week before the lockdown and pick him up from his home to accompany him to weekly music sessions run by a local group Together In Sound. She said: Music therapy is one of the very few positive things added to his le since being diagnosed with dementia. My dad has lost a lot but this one positive thing that has been added, and brought us closer together. In the car on the way there, I’ll play the music he likes listening to. He loves The Shadows. Caroline explained they are join each other and other people living with dementia for online sessions – which have been just as much of a relief to her as it has to her dad. Many music organisations have already made their services available digitally and these are being added to Music for Dementia ’s digital Musical Map, an advice hub of virtual events and activities that people living with dementia can participate in. Examples of online music events include The London Symphony Orchestra, now streaming online-concerts and The Sofa Singers, a new weekly online event which sees  people come together for a -minute rehearsal where they learn a classic song and sing it together. Music for Dementia  is urging music services that are moving online to get in touch, so they can be added to Musical Map.

They include those on fixed-term contracts, zero-hours contracts, part-time workers and the self-employed. Although Chancellor Rishi Sunik has announced a multibillion pound package of support for self-employed workers, which will pay a grant worth % of earnings, this money will not be available until June. It is feared that this will come too late for many smaller businesses and freelance workers. Of the .m employees at risk of ending up jobless, some .m work in industries that have been forced to close due to social distancing rules, such as restaurants and shops. The NEF has urged the Chancellor to guarantee a minimum income of £ for all working-age adults, rather than forcing millions to apply for Universal Credit. It comes as separate research has found that coronavirus has wiped out any hope of “levelling up” the UK, with the crisis set to hit the north hardest economically. Analysis from the Learning and Work Institute suggests that the gains of five years of jobs growth – during which employment increased to a record high – have been reversed in just one month. The thinktank’s report warns that despite the measures put in place by government to protect jobs, unemployment is set to rise further and faster than during any recession on record.

A statement by Surfing England published on Friday on their website says: With the bank holiday upon us, sunshine and some clean swell, the temptation to slip into your wetsuit and walk in for a few waves will be at its max.   We all have tough personal choices to make.   Our preference is to stay out the water.   We hope you will join us, and the thousands of surfers who are standing in solidarity with the NHS, doing every little we can to help prevent the spread of Covid- and reducing the pressure on all our frontline services. The current state is temporary, it will end, and the waves will still be there for us when it does. Surfers who ignored the advice could also face further danger as the Royal National Leboat Institution has suspended beach leguard patrols aposuntil further noticeapos.

Sarah Gilbert, a professor of vaccinology at Oxford University, says she is % confident that a jab being developed by her team will be proved effective by the autumn. The Times reports that human trials are set to begin on the vaccine in a fortnight, making it one of the most promising efforts in the world.The UK government has also indicated that,results look positive, it is prepared to fund millions of doses in advance. This means thatthe tests are successful, an immunisation against Covid- would be widely available to the public immediately.Follow the latest coronavirus updates hereWith medical experts fearing that lting lockdown measures will lead to a fresh surge in infections, ato normal le relies heavily on finding a vaccine that works. Although it has been estimated this will take  months, Professor Gilbert has said that in a best-case scenario her team could have one ready by September. She had previously said she hoped it could be developed by the end of the year. I think thereaposs a high chance that it will work based on other things that we have done with this type of vaccine, she said. Itaposs not just a hunch and as every week goes by we have more data to look at. I would go for  percent, thataposs my personal view. However, she also warned that nobody can promise itaposs going to work. Prof Gilbert, who has been working seven days a week to put the vaccine through development stages, added that her researchers will need to trial it in a country with a high rate of transmission to get quick results. Her team is one of dozens worldwide who have been racing to find a way to immunise people against the devastating flu-like virus.Health experts believe that coronavirus mutates at a slower rate than other respiratory viruses, particularly flu.This has led to hopes that once a jab is widely available it will provide protection against the highly contagious Covid- and any further strains which develop, for several years.

The illegal US road race made famous by the  Burt Reynolds film is a challenge to see who can drive from coast to coast in the fastest time. Now a team claims to have done it in  hours and  minutes – beating the record by  minutes. It would mean the car averaged more than mph during the ,-mile journey from New York to Los Angeles.Fans slammed the unnamed group for taking advantage of the coronavirus crisis which has left roads empty.Previous record-holder Alex Roy said: “If you hit a truck moving medical supplies and people die because of it, that’s on you.” “People are counting on those trucks moving around right now. It’s not funny.” Motoring writer Ben Hodges added: “During the pandemic is not the time to attempt any kind of Cannonball run. “It’s not a level playing field, as with all other attempts. The ious global lockdowns are not an invitation to do this.” Others defended the run, including Ed Bol­­ian who set a record of  hours and  minutes in . He said: “Do I think this is the best use of time while the country is staying in during a pandemic  Probably not. But for me to say it’s awful is like a cocaine dealer saying a heroin dealer is awful.” Jon Ficarra, organiser of the rival  cross-country race, added: “How do you tarnish something that’s illegal and that the general public already hates ”  On social media the stunt was condemned as “scummy” but one man tweeted: “I find it hilarious that former Can­­nonball run record holders are calling this ‘grossly irresponsible’ when the whole idea is grossly irresponsible.” The team of at least three – who have not revealed themselves for fear of arrest – drove a white  Audi A with few modications apart from a huge fuel tank. They left New York around .pm on April  but have not disclosed the route they took. The race traditionally starts at Red Ball Garage in Manhattan and finishes at the Portofino Hotel and Marina in Redondo Beach, Calornia.

Covid- is believed to have mutated into three distinct strains - Type A, B and C. The original one - Type A - that was identied in Wuhan, China, is now thought to be sweeping the US, with New York now having more casesthan any country. England and Europe is believed to be battling Type C. Researchers from Cambridge University reconstructed the early path of Covid- as infection spread from Wuhan, China, in December out to Europe and North America. It shows that type A - the original virus most closely related to the virus found in both bats and pangolins - was not Chinaaposs most common. Instead Type A is now prevalent in Australia and the US.Follow the latest coronavirus updates in our live blog.China was mainly hit by Type B, which was in circulation as far back as Christmas Eve. It is believed this type mutates slowly through China, but rapidly outside China. Type B is derived from A, separated by two mutations, then C is in turn a daughter of B, the study suggests. A total of  NHS trusts in England have announced at least  deaths to date, according to figures from NHS England.As of pm on April , the totals are:- University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust: - London North West University Healthcare NHS Trust: - Kingaposs College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust: - Barts Health NHS Trust: - Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust: - University Hospitals of Derby  Burton NHS Foundation Trust: - Croydon Health Services NHS Trust: - St Georgeaposs University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust: - Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust: - The Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust: - Frimley Health NHS Foundation Trust: - Epsom  St Helier University Hospitals NHS Trust: - Lewisham  Greenwich NHS Trust: - Sandwell  West Birmingham Hospitals NHS Trust: - North Middlesex University Hospital NHS Trust: - The Dudley Group NHS Foundation Trust: - Liverpool University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust: - South Tyneside  Sunderland NHS Foundation Trust:   Type C may have spread to Europe via Singapore. The findings are published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences . Dr Peter Forster, geneticist and lead author from the University of Cambridge, said: There are too many rapid mutations to neatly trace a Covid- family tree. We used a mathematical network algorithm to visualise all the plausible trees simultaneously. These techniques are mostly known for mapping the movements of prehistoric human populations through DNA.We think this is one of the first times they have been used to trace the infection routes of a coronavirus like Covid-. Experts believe the virus, called SARS-CoV-, is mutating to overcome immune system resistance in dferent populations. Researchers found that the closest type of coronavirus to the one discovered in bats - type A, the original human virus genome - was present in Wuhan, but was not the cityaposs predominant virus type. Mutated versions of A were seen in Americans reported to have lived in Wuhan, and a large number of A-type viruses were found in patients from the US and Australia. The coronavirus lockdown is a worrying time for millions across the UK. But itaposs also bringing out the best in people who are selflessly giving their time each day to help those most in need. Our Mirror Coronavirus Heroes series wants to recognise all of those helping the most vulnerable during the crisis.

Wuhanaposs major virus type was B and prevalent in patients from across east Asia, however it didnapost travel much beyond the region without further mutations. The researchers say the C iant is the major European type, found in early patients from France, Italy, Sweden and England. It is absent from the studyaposs Chinese mainland sample but seen in Singapore, Hong Kong and South Korea. The analysis also suggests one of the earliest introductions of the virus into Italy came via the first documented German infection on January , and that another early Italian infection route was related to a Singapore cluster.

The measures, which prevent people from leaving home in all but limited circumstances, were due to expire on Easter Sunday. But Leo Varadkar said the advice from Irelandaposs national public health emergency team was to extend the restrictions until Tuesday May . He said the Government had accepted that advice and added nobody knows for certain when the lockdown could be brought to an end. Mr Varadkar thanked Irish people for the their forbearance and said every sacrice they were making was saving lives. Because the vast majority of people have heeded the advice of the experts we have been able to interrupt the spread of the virus, we have been able to shelter the most vulnerable and protect them, he said. Your sacrices are making a dference, we have slowed the spread of the virus considerably but unfortunately we have not stopped its spread. Mr Varadkar added: We all know people who are suffering and grieving at this time, too many have died and sadly more will die and get sick before this is over. So todayaposs message is that we cannot be complacent and we cannot lose focus. What weaposre doing is dficult, but it is making a dference and we have to keep going. We need to persevere and we need to maintain our discipline and resolve.  The restrictions we introduced two weeks ago were set to expire on Sunday. Today, the expert recommendation is to extend them for a further three weeks until Tuesday May . The Government has accepted this recommendation.As of Thursday, the coronavirus death toll in Ireland stood at , with , confirmed cases of the virus since the outbreak began.The current restrictions were ordered by the Government on March . They were initially in place for a two-week period ending on Easter Sunday. Experts have credited the social distancing measures with signicantly flattening the curve of the virusaposs spread. The day-on-day growth rate of Covid- has dropped from more than % to %.  The reproductive rate, the number of people infected by each infected person, had also fallen signicantly, from around four at the beginning of the outbreak to close to one. Under the restrictions, people have been ordered to remain in their homes in all but a limited set of specic circumstances. The circumstances include travelling to or from work deemed to be essential, food shopping, medical appointments, brief exercise, farming activity and vital family reasons. People who do leave their homes for exercise are prevented from travelling beyond a km radius from their homes. All people over the age of , and other people considered vulnerable to the disease, have been told to cocoon and not leave home at all. All non-essential surgery, health procedures and other non-essential health services have been postponed.  All public and private gatherings of any number of people outside a single household or living unit have been prohibited for the last two weeks and social visits to relatives beyond the family unit at home have not been allowed. The Taoiseach continued: I know many of us would like to know when things will go back to normal and le will be as it was. We are working towards that time. The Taoiseach continued: I know many of us would like to know when things will go back to normal and le will be as it was. We are working towards that time.

This has been dficult to accept.“The SPFL board and executive freely admit that they focused on the sporting merit of the proposal and did not take into consideration any financial fall out to their member clubs.“Fundamentally, we believe that in these exceptional and uncertain times, no member club should be worse off as a result of this proposal than they are today.“The current proposal will see member clubs cumulatively have in the region of £.-£ million pounds of lost revenue.“Amongst the member clubs there have been numerous discussions of the SPFL’s offer as well as viable, equitable proposed alternatives that could see, potentially, a neutral outcome for all clubs involvedthe season cannot be finished.“In all cases, current placement monies could be distributed to the member clubs in very short order while maintaining all SPFL obligations.“Make no mistake we would have to work quickly and diligently to ensure that members’ current needs are met and that the democratic process is followed, but it is achievable.”An SPFL spokesperson added: “It is very important that clubs consider carefully the resolution and we are grateful to those clubs who have voted already.“With the Ladbrokes Premiership and Ladbrokes Leagues One and Two isions each having approved the resolution, we await the voting slip from the one Ladbrokes Championship club that has yet to vote.“We will provide an update as soon as we are in a position to do so.”The SPFL set an initial deadline of pm for clubs to vote.However it is understood league rules give members  days to vote on resolutions – and Dundee are keen to weigh up their options.It is believed Partick Thistle and Inverness Caley Thistle were the two Championship sides to vote against the plan.As a result, Dundee appear to be in a position to set whichever agenda they please in negotiations with the SPFL.🔵 In these troubled times, when many people are struggling to get out for their paper, we are pledging to help readers by providing a FREE digital edition of the Eveningfor three months.

I was free to talk to clubs.“I spoke to Mark McGhee at Motherwell and Gus MacPherson at St Mirren.“The chance to go to England and play for that club [Coventry] came up and it was a no-brainer really.“My agent and I sat down…we didn’t need to think about it.“There were other reasons why it was more beneficial for me – you’re trying to make a living in your career.“I had three top-flight teams up here who I had the chance to go to.“Lee Wilkie was at Dundee United at the time.

I was desperate to just get in and experience it.“But it got to the point that Michael O’Neill heard I could play with Northern Ireland [through a Coleraine-born grandparent].“He called Allan Preston [football agent] and Alan called me.“I said, ‘Can you ask Craig what the chances with Scotland would be ’ To be fair to Craig, he said, ‘I’d never say it’s a definite no buthe’s got the chance to play international football then I’d take it’.“Without saying ‘definitely no’, he definitely did say no!“I’ve still got mixed emotions about it. My dad wasn’t too sure, he didn’t want me to do it.“Other people advised me to do it and I had some great trips. I got one cap but I was in the squad seven or eight times.“Getting to train with people like Jonny Evans, Steven Davis…I loved the training and I loved the trips.“I would’ve liked to get more game time but it was causing a problem to my back and ultimately that’s why I stopped.”He made his Northern Ireland debut in a - hammering at the hands of the Netherlands on June , , just weeks after his Hibs side were beaten - by Hearts in the Scottish Cup Final.McPake – who came up against Dutch stars Arjen Robben, Wesley Sneijder and Robin van Persie – said: “It wasn’t like a normal friendly, it was mayhem.“The Amsterdam Arena was packed. I’m looking at it and going, ‘Wow’.“I think in that two weeks, with the Scottish Cup Final and then that game, I got beat - on aggregate.“I had a week in Dubai between that so I suppose that makes up for it.”McPake is approaching six years at Dens Park, after initially joining as a player in May , and he didn’t envisage such a long spell at the club.He said: “If I did, I’d be living in Dundee or somewhere around about there. I often say that to Dawn [we]. I love it up there.“In terms of players, Cammy [Kerr] was there – he was only a young boy.

It is our experience, thus far, that this country’s handling of the crisis exceeds others in the mitigation of losses for businesses as well as iniduals.“In the coming days we will be implementing elements of the job retention scheme in respect of our staff and it is our intention that all are looked after fully throughout this crisis.“This includes our football players, football staff and administrative staff receiving full pay while they are on furlough for the foreseeable future.”Hello to all of the Dundee fans from all over the globe!  We hope this update finds everyone safe and well during these unprecedented and unimaginable times.  This, I have to say, is the strangest and scariest period, certainly of my letime and it has brought to the forefront, that, despite all of our dferences , we are truly all in this together and as such, we will get through this together.We at Dundee Football Club have been constantly monitoring the situation we find ourselves in due to the COVID- virus and have been taking advice, giving guidance, and implementing protocols to keep our staff, patrons and partners safe and sound as we ensure the sustainability of the club.First of all, the club do indeed have Business Interruption Insurance with specic additions of Notiable Diseases and Prevention of Access to our Commercial Combined Insurance Policy which should allow us to have options to reimburse those losses incurred due to the cancellation of matches. It would be our intention,the season is brought to an early conclusion, where practical, to reimburse those season ticket holders for the remainder of the season that was not played.  This will be further assessed for timelines, etc., as we make our way through the claims process. We have often said that the club is a family and that remains true throughout this situation.In addition to our insurance coverage, we have also sought to access ious sources of support offered by the League, the Association, Government agencies and our associates.  All that have been involved have been extremely helpful in our solidication of the club as a business.  I would like to personally thank John Bennett for his very generous and selfless gesture of suspending rent on the stadium. His call, on day one of this crisis helped to set the tone for all that followed throughout this shutdown and is the epitome of showing how we are all in this together.The UK Government and its agencies have also been extremely helpful in the offering of grants loans and providing relief through the Job Retention Scheme.  That includes HMRC. It is our experience, thus far, that this country’s handling of the crisis exceeds others in the mitigation of losses for businesses as well as iniduals.  In the coming days we will be implementing elements of the job retention scheme in respect of our staff and it is our intention that all are looked after fully throughout this crisis. This includes our football players, football staff and administrative staff receiving full pay while they are on furlough for the foreseeable future.We also think it is right to give credit to the dedicated workers at the SPFL and SFA. They have been working in an ever-changing landscape throughout this unprecedented event. They have continued to keep us informed and provide us advice on how to best navigate this predicament. They have freely shared the advice and guidance they are receiving from the government and UEFA as we all feel our way through these weeks. We continue to take advice and express our opinions on what football should look like when football resumes. Although none of us know yet what will transpire with this season, it is clear that football will be back.We’ve been inundated with requests on how people can help the club.  It’s truly been heart-warming. The one way to helpyou can – and onlyyou can # is to purchase season tickets and merchandise online.  We still have limited availability of this year’s Third Strip, which may become a collector’s item as it may never be worn.This supports the club as well as SSAFA and The Black Watch Association charities.  We will soon be launching our - kit in the upcoming days and we know it’s not enough to completely fill your appetite for football, but keep an eye on the social media sites for Dundee FC and DFC in the Community, which will provide some entertainment while we all do our part to save lives by staying home.We wish we had something more definitive to say, but we hope this brief update will provide some reassurance that we are still here and will remain here when this crisis is over.

Riverside was a shock for them on a December morning and certainly not what a guy like Caniggia was used to!“Caniggia, Ravanelli, Ketsbaia, all the top names that came into the club were brand new. They were great lads, they really were.“It was a bit surreal training against these boys. I was a bit stand-offish because I had a reputation of being a little rash and I wasn’t going to smash Caniggia in training!“He was just left to do his thing and you gave him the respect he deserves.“He basically got to do whatever he wanted around the club. Nobody was going to tell Caniggia he couldn’t do something!“We’d be at training and his five-year-old son would be up with us. We’d be doing a shooting exercise and running out of balls because Caniggia’s son had six at the side kicking them about!”Wilkie also revealed Caniggia’s free reign didn’t stop there and the Argentine was known to enjoy a pre-match cigarette in the Dens Park dressing room.He said: “We had the one cubicle in the changing-room and I used to like my pre-match toilet to just chill out and read the programme to get my mind ready for the game.“I’d always have to wait on Caniggia coming out the toilet because he’d be in there smoking a rolly-up.“He used to just come out with a wee smile on his face, shrug his shoulders and walk past you but that was just the kind of guy he was.“The Italians and the Argentines were horried the British boys would drink beer but they would smoke asit was the healthiest thing going.“They were really fit, though. Caniggia was probably the fittest guy I played with and fans could see that when he scored his first goal against Aberdeen and took his top off.“He was so strong for his age and looked after himself really well.“He was one of the biggest players in the world and it was amazing he was at Dundee.”It was a crucial time in Wilkie’s career but bust-ups with the Bonettis led to him going on loan to Plymouth Argyle, Notts County and Falkirk.But he found his way back to Dens, impressing then-Scotland manager Berti Vogts enough to get a call-up to the national team.“It was dficult for me because I was young and fiery and they were exactly the same,” Wilkie said of clashing with the Bonettis.“I had a couple of fall-outs with them that really came from nothing. It’s disappointing how it ended up because I really quite liked them.“Dario really knew his stuff as a coach and, as an ex-defender, he used to take us away to do bits and pieces in training.“I really enjoyed that. The two times I fell out with them were from silly little things in training that shouldn’t have happened.“My loan moves then came from the fall-outs but I got called back from Falkirk because they’d fallen out with Marco De Marchi and Fan Zhiyi.“When I was on loan at Notts County I’d pretty much given up. I was close to deciding I was done with football because I was fed up.“I was in a bad place. I got injured down there in my first or second game, sat stuck in a hotel and I thought that was me done.“I was only  so I was just a bit naive and immature I guess. Getting back to enjoying the game was about  per cent luck.“I was playing for Falkirk, doing OK and enjoying it in a young team in the First Division with boys like Mark Kerr and Lee Miller.“My head was still pretty much gone from the previous couple of months.

insufficient for the development proposed.“Once the required alternative consultation has taken place, a pre-application consultation report should be produced and then submitted to the planning authority at the same time as the planning application.“The report should specy who has been consulted and set out what steps were taken to comply with the statutory requirements.“The report should also set out how the applicant has responded to any comments made by those who were consulted, including whether and the extent to which the proposals have changed as a result of

with all  premier league clubs before making a decision on the current season, Aberdeen Football Club, voted for the resolution.#Crucially, this means that the lower league clubs can get the cash they urgently need, while a premature decision on the Ladbrokes Premiership can be avoided.“We feel strongly that the SPFL board should not have asked member clubs to cast a vote on this resolution with less than  hours’ notice, especially when these resolutions allow for  days.#This request was made during a one-hour video conference with no room for constructive discussion or debate, leaving us scrambling for time to review the resolution legal document and then discuss the merits of it with our board.#Open and transparent governance and communication is critical to the survival of Scottish Football and should include our most important assets, our fans. We ignore the fans at our peril.#While we, like most clubs, want a stake in the ground for the   season, we would prefer to see the league completedat all possible.#We recognise that this will be challenging, perhaps even unlikely, but there are a number of key issues that need robust debate.#For example, UEFA’s clarication on the competitions’ framework and calendar, the current position of our broadcasters and main sponsors, and whatwe have to play games behind closed doors and there’s no cross-border travel in Europe for the foreseeable future ”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/f3722638-0610-4e06-b991-4e1b0694e1ec-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/f3722638-0610-4e06-b991-4e1b0694e1ec-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/f3722638-0610-4e06-b991-4e1b0694e1ec-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/f3722638-0610-4e06-b991-4e1b0694e1ec-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"gallery the best pictures from aberdeens 1970 scottish cup win over celtic at hampden1","story":"Tomorrow marks  years since Aberdeen lted the Scottish Cup by beating Celtic - at Hampden.Fortunately there are plenty of pictures from Mount Florida that day as Eddie Turnbull#s Dons secured the famous old trophy for just the second time in the club#s history.Here are the best ones:"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column january 31 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsEver since it was #temporarily# closed to new admissions around two years ago, there has been the suspicion that plans were afoot to close Knapdale Ward completely.The HSCP claims to have consulted widely on the future of the ward, yet patients# relatives, front-line nurses and medical professionals say they were never asked for their views.

As we stood about on deck while the dishes were being washed a boy from one of the motor boats passed in his dinghy. He was wearing blue shorts and red stockings which brought from the Pilot the remark: #In Brodickyou don’t wear red stockings you might just as well be in Lamlash.#All but the Skipper and Mate went ashore on Centre Island for a stroll. The Major was still completely paralysed in his hind quarters but he was full of spirit and when the Bosun held up his hind legshe galloped along. It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions. There was a nasty little lop on the water, the northerly wind was bitterly cold, and the rain was as heavy as ever. As quickly as possible we got below and into our warm bunks, not even the Bosun wasting any time about it, though he did read for some time after all the rest were sound asleep."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast podcast episode 10 nessie and the lost golf balls","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWelcome to Episode  of the Oban Time#s BOBcast.Charting Bob#s progress  and discussing lots of things golfare  presenters Stephen Day, George Graham, Martin Laing and Keith McIntyre.

As part of this project the fund provided MACPool with seven aqua cycles and training from Hydrorider.Arriving early to take photogaphs of the others giving these bikes a go, any sense of nervousness was set aside as I watched healthcare professionals and fitness and well-being enthusiasts laugh and chat through their shot.After some quick adjustments to the bikes June, from our advertising department, and I were raring to go.Partially submerged, the feeling of being weightless combined with the resistance of the water as we began peddling was initially a bit odd. As we got used to the feeling, we started to speed things up, pretending we were racing the rest of our group to The Cairnbaan for a gin and tonic.Finding our rhythm, instructor Kathryn Craig began to lead us through arm exercises. Our co-ordination was put to the test as we carried on cycling while doing simple arm movements that felt more impactive due to the water resistance. Then for the real challenge # floating off the back of the bike while continuing to pedal – not an easy taskyou are short-legged but a workout that feels like it is doing you the power of good.For me aqua cycling is everything I hoped it would be – a fun, impactiveand enjoyable way of exercising. And I could still walk after it!With no aches and pains the next day and still smiling, I signed up for some of the classes.Classes y in intensity and are currently running on Tuesdays from .-.pm, Wednesday evenings from .-.pm and Saturdays from  .-.am.

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part 10","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat a night! All of us were agreed that never had we experienced anywhere a worse one and we were glad we had been in Loch Aline on Sunday night not in Tobermory as intended as, from what we heard, that night had been similar but twice as bad.It was a wild night lashing with rain and a big swell was rolling in from the north-east causing us to pitch and roll horribly. Everything banged and rattled and the ropes, despite their lashings, slapped on the mast, the chain rugged continuously on the bobstay, and there was one most annoying thump that kept everyone awake .We could not trace its origin until in desperation the Pilot donned oilskins, sou’wester and seaboots, and went on deck and found it was the tiller end bumping on the bulwarks. The Pilot had a very justiable grouse about this as he had suggested lashing the tiller, but the Skipper had said that he did not think it necessary and that we would lie easierit was allowed to go free.About six we heard Murdoch in Venture hailing us and the Skipper and Pilot hurried on deck. The yachts in the harbour were all lying higgledy-piggledy owing to the swell, to there being little or not wind, to the strong surface current from the swollen river, and to it being about the turn of the tide.Venture and Fulmar were lying stern to stern and what had aroused Murdoch was that the Venture had got her mizzen boom over our main boom and as we pitched we had lted it up crutch and all – how nothing was broken was a miracle. She had then swung round and her now free boom had knocked the cap off our jackstay. As the Skipper came on deck Venture again surged towards us and started pitching and her counter came down with a terric slam not six inches from our bulwarks. We put our helm over and swung clear.Murdoch and Barclay were both in their dog-house and the Pilot and Skipper stayed in ours until the new tide took charge and the boats began to swing in normal fashion and all were able to retire once more to their bunks. Luckily the rain had cleared off shortly before this episode took place.At a quarter to eight we heard the usual poor forecast but for the first time since the cruise began there was not a gale warning for any area. The glass had risen well during the night. What wind there was was from the north-west.The Skipper went ashore for the milk and rolls. The dinghy had a lot of water in it and owing to the rolling it was impossible to get into it and balance on the thwarts till it was baled so the Skipper got his feet thoroughly soaked – the simple remedy of wearing seaboots had never occurred to him. Again the rolls were sold out and again he had to take porter biscuits.On board the Pilot lit the fire then started in to get our breakfast of bacon and egg. After our meal the sky cleared and it became a beautul sunny day, and everything we had was up on deck drying off or airing. The owner of Rose came alongside and for a good time tried to get us to persuade him to go north against his better judgement, but when we heard he had the lady member of his crew of three sick in her bunk our advice was that he go south and that immediately and reluctantly he was forced to agree and half an hour later he sailed. Hervor also went out about the same time and she turned north and we were to meet her later in Iona."},{"url":null,"title":"worldwide ceilidh community sign up for tunes in the hoose","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCapercaillie founder Martin MacLeod, originally from Oban, and his son, also Martin, have came up with an innovative way to connect musicians from all over the world and allow them to play together for the enjoyment of others.#Tunes in the Hoose# was inspired by Scottish musician, and family friend of the MacLeods, Peter Wood, who was posting videos of himself playing tunes in his home during self-isolation.Having saw the footage Martin senior, called his filmmaker son to askhe had the technology and know-how to put a video together of him playing along to Peter’s video.#I run my own production company based out of Glasgow, so it’s relatively straight forward work for me ,# said Martin Junior.#From that first successful attempt, our new idea was to create an online community for all Scottish musicians to help them connect and continue to play together during these uncertain times.#Housed in Facebook, Tunes in the Hoose amassed over  followers last week with ,+ views worldwide.

Almost nobody has been untouched by it, although for some it has been more cataclysmic than others. But we are in this together, and it will be together that we pull through it.One of the real heartbreaking consequences of the lockdown has been the separation of families. Many grandparents now cannot see their grandchildren, or even their own children. Family of people who are ill cannot visit their loved ones. Each story has its own set of circumstances and sadly more is to come before it gets better.While we do need light-heartedness at this time, itrsquos also really important to acknowledge peoplersquos struggles. It was with gut-wrenching despair I realised a number of weeks ago that the arrival of Covid- in Europe was going to seriously affect so many families, my own included.I have five children, but my middle child, who is now  years old, has for the last eight years shared time between Scotland and Sweden.She went to school here until she was seven, when she began to attend school in Sweden. It was then that I had to adjust to the painful reality of less time with her, although I was still able to maintain regular time with her in Scotland and of course keep in daily touch.Itrsquos been an emotional rollercoaster, in which I have stories of me sleeping at airports, travelling through Scandinavian landscape at ungodly hours, and along the way meeting people who have helped and made a real dference. But itrsquos been worth it as it meant our blended family remained connected and my daughter hasnrsquot felt ided between two families but rather a full part of both.We were due to travel to Sweden this Friday andlater, but of course the flights were cancelled a couple of weeks ago. Explaining this to my daughter, and then not being able to say when we would be together was heartbreaking. I felt so helpless, unable to comfort her. Wersquod all counted down the days and now it seems it may be weeks, even months, before any reunion will be possible.I know that there will be families in similar or worse situations. My heart goes out to them all. My initial response to my situation was to close down with despair. The idea of not being with my child, for whom I was the equal main carer until recently, feels unbearable. Some friends have said, with good intentions: ldquoAt least shersquos safe.Yes she is, and I give thanks for that. But any loving parent facing long-term enforced separation from their child will understand the grief that such separation creates. It seeps into your being and makes it dficult to get through the day without having really dark moments. I tried to hide my emotions, but my loving and understanding we knows me too well yet she too felt helpless.There are moments in our lives when we are just overwhelmed by the impossibility of a situation and we just want to curl up and close down. I recently reached that point.Then my daughter asked me while we were talking online: ldquoI wish we could get a magic flying carpet or something dad, or ask the faeries to make a portal. She understood this wasnrsquot possible, but it was the wake-up call I needed. It made me realise I needed to get out of the pit of despair and, for her sake as well as mine, use my creativity to make that magic carpet, and that portal, to help us stay closely connected during this awful time.And the magic ingredient is stories. My daughter has always loved stories, and we have made many up together some of them have even been printed on this page. Now these stories help keep us connected and ease the pain of separation for us both.And so, with the help of technology, and, crucially, a good relationship with her mother, stories have begun to create a vital space for my daughter to be with her Scottish family, even when separated. We can all be together, even my grown-up daughters, who I miss even though they are isolating close by.We storytell to each other, make stories up and even share them in short films. Wee sister Skye, who is six and misses her sister like crazy, holds the tablet which she uses to speak to her, so they can be together while I tell stories and share riddles. We draw and add to the stories together, make fun dramas in which we film ourselves on phones acting out stories like Cinderella, and I have learnt to put wee films together which we can then watch together.Sharing stories like this has given extra meaning to our online communication. It takes us away from just asking ldquohow was your day  or ldquowhat did you do today  questions that often just seem to emphasise our current disconnection. Later, after this crisis is over, the wee films, the artwork and written stories will be memorabilia of this time our evidence that we remained close, even when forced apart.I write about this because I know there are parents and children out there in similarly dficult situations to say you are not alone in this and letrsquos be kind to each other and share the ways we keep ourselves connected. I also know others will have discovered better solutions, as Irsquom no technical wizard.Children are resilient, often more than their grown-ups are, but we need to help them manage this time emotionally, and when we canrsquot give them a hug or be physically with them in hard times, an inheritance of stories they can access can be a real support.I have often been less than enthusiastic about social media in the past, but right now people are discovering in this crisis it has become a leline in many ways.If you, or someone you know, are in a similar situation, please do get in touch. Letrsquos share our experiences, and understand that while we may be isolating, we are not alone."},{"url":null,"title":"european-stone-stacking-championships-dunbar-postponed","story":"The European Stone Stacking Championships were due to take place between April  and , with a place at the World Rock Stacking Championships in Texas next year up for grabs.However, James Craig Page, creator and director of the festival, broke the news that the event, like dozens of others across the county, had to be postponed amid concerns surrounding coronavirus.Mr Page said: ldquoIt has been postponed but we are very hopeful that we will find another venue or be able to go ahead at a dferent time.ldquoHowever, for the time being we have to postpone.This year would have marked the fth year a stone stacking event had taken place in Dunbar event.Each year, it attracts thousands of people to the area, as well as competitors from throughout Europe.Mr Page spoke to the Courier upon ing from the World Rock Stacking Championships in the USA last month.Initially, he was keen to see the European event, which takes place at Eye Cave Beach, off Bayswell Road, take place.However, upon ing to British shores, he became aware of the state of the global issue.Speaking to the Courier, he said: ldquoWe were just waiting for word and advice but it became apparent when I got back how bad things were and that we needed to put it on hold.ldquoWe donrsquot want to be taking any risks with anybodyrsquos health and wellbeing.

Ceilidhs, workshops, conversation circles and music sessions all create an encouraging atmosphere that bring together students from  countries across five continents.As a modern, innovative college, Sabhal Mograver Ostaig has excellent learning resources on campus including an exceptional library collection, residential student accommodation, broadcast and recording facilities and a Gaelic medium childcare facility on site. It also has a growing international reputation for academic research.The college was founded on the principle of being part of the local and wider community and its activities are greatly enhanced by co-operative links, being home to a number of signicant national creative and cultural projects such as Tobar an Dualchais, Ainmean Agraveite na h-Alba and Cagravenan Graphics Studio.

It is one of the many canards which have debased social media in this crisis and turned Twitter into a pariah medium.What he told Philip Schofield on This Morning on March  was that ldquoone of the theories is that people should ldquotake it on the chin and not take measures to prevent the spread of the disease. He went on to say that this was not the Governmentrsquos policy, and that it was pursuing a ldquobalanced approach and taking measures to ldquoprotect the NHS.But that hasnrsquot stopped people saying it for him. It has become a political factoid, an article of faith that Mr Johnson, under the guidance of his dark amanuensis Dominic Cummings, has been pursuing a social Darwinist, survival-of-the-fittest approach to Covid-.Enough. Everyone with any decency should simply be wishing the Prime Minister and his pregnant partner, Carrie Symonds, well right now, following the lead of Nicola Sturgeon yesterday when she echoed the Get Well, Boris slogan.It could be any one of us in the next few weeks. This is a moment to reflect on the fragility of existence and the gt of being alive. For once, we really are all in this together.The only grain of truth in the ldquochin theory is that, as is widely known, Mr Johnson has tended to see illness as something other people get. He has famously robust good health and former advisers, like the journalist Guto Harri, say theyrsquove never seen him ill before.All the more reason to take this disease seriously. It doesnrsquot just kill the very old or those with medical issues. Even a fit, tennis-playing political leader in his prime has had to be placed in intensive care fighting for his le.This is not like a bad dose of flu, as President Trump unhelpfully suggested. Covid- mocks us because many carriers have mild symptoms or none at all. Then, after  days,the symptoms donrsquot go away it turns very nasty.There is so much we do not know about coronavirus. What we do know is that it is gendered ndash though not in the way we expect that word to be used. It seems to hit men very hard, and twice as many die of it. Women seem to have some form of genetic immunity.Either that or men just ldquodonrsquot look after themselves as some believe. That might actually be the case with Mr Johnson, since hersquos been under immense pressure over the past year: replacing Theresa May, renegotiating Brexit, then fighting a General Election.So, no one should be under any illusion that hersquoll be able tonormally any time soon. This raises dficult questions. Who in his Cabinet will have the authority to tell him that he canrsquot be allowed to take key decisions while his faculties are impaired Who exactly is in charge  The First Secretary, Dominic Raab, is formally chairing Cabinet committees. But that begs the question of who takes the final decisions. Where does the buck stop Someone has to balance the competing demands of the two front-line Cabinet ministers, Matt Hancock and Rishi Sunak. They have very dferent constituencies of interests. Mr Hancock is all about saving the NHS and avoiding immediate deaths Mr Sunak is about saving the economy, upon which just as many lives could ultimately depend.Who decides whether and for how long to renew the lockdown on Monday  It will almost certainly be continued, but should there be a provisional timetable for lting aspects of it, following Austria and Denmark Research led by Professor Russell Viner for University College London appears to show that keeping schools closed is of little use in halting the spread of coronavirus. Yet it damages the educational prospects of less-well-off children. Others disagree, including, it seems, Professor Neil Ferguson of the celebrated Imperial College report that prompted the lockdown last month.The minor scandal of the Scottish Chief Medical Officer, Dr Catherine Calderwood, breaking her own stay-at-home guidelines underlines the problem of compliance. For the comfortable middle classes, with gardens and nice homes, lockdown is tolerable but working-class families in small flats may find it unbearable.Then again, should the UK be encouraging the wearing of masks  Countries like Austria and Slovakia have made them compulsory. America is adopting masks on the grounds that it slows the spread of the disease. But the advice here is still that theyrsquore of little use.A broader question now there is a new Labour leader, is a government of national unity. Keir Starmer has clearly ordered his new shadow cabinet members to stop saying ldquowe were right and start talking constructively about how to revive a moribund economy when the lockdown is over.The Opposition has a crucial role to play in getting the Government to focus and be clear about what it is doing. But should there be a more formal arrangement, as in the Second World War when the then Labour leader Clement Attlee, was made Deputy Prime Minister It would mean the Opposition is bound by collective responsibility, and has to endorse the decisions made by Government in the next few weeks. On the other hand it would greatly enhance the political profile of the new Labour leader, and could provide a  on which Sir Keir could build a winning election campaign, in the way Attlee won the post-war General Election in .These are decisions that only a Prime Minister can make, for the simple reason that he will be required to accept the consequences. This is a desperate time for him and the country, as the death toll continues to rise.As I write, it seems that the PMrsquos condition is stable. Twitter aside, there has been a considerable degree of public sympathy for Mr Johnson. No one can be in any doubt that he feels our pain. The Prime Minister is, as it were, the first casualty among equals.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Shops across Scotland are closing.

The wording is apparently so ldquocack-handed ndash the charityrsquos phrase ndash that recipients are misinterpreting it to mean they will not receive any medical helpthey contract the virus.This is not what the letter says, but it would be an easy mistake to make. Evenit were clear, it would still be upsetting. Signing a DNAR is almost as sure an indication that the end of the line is fast approaching as requesting the last rites. Often it is signed by those with power of attorney for elderly relatives who are no longer of sound mind. Brutal though it looks when expressed in cold print, the intention behind it is compassionate.At a certain stage of ill-health, the process of resuscitation can be harsh. It unnecessarily prolongs suffering rather than allowing someone who has suffered a cardiac arrest to slip away peacefully. In some circumstances, especially where the patient is extremely frail, resuscitation is the worst of all options. Hard though it is to accept, the prospect of death can come as a relief to some for whom there is no hope of recovery, and who are simply longing to be gone.But for many who received this bald DNAR request, that is not the case. Instead of being asked to speed up and simply medical bureaucracy, they needed reassurance that, should they fall ill with Covid , they will be treated like anyone . The only grey area is over what they wish done in the event they require resuscitation. In their thoughtless and insensitive mail-shot, doctors presumably have pre-selected those for whom they think a DNAR is in their best interests. But what a way to go about it. It brings to mind Treasure Island and the sinister Black Spot pressed into piratesrsquo hands, signying their imminent demise.Even worse is the case of a care home where some residents, who were mentally well, learned staff had signed these forms on their behalf. I would not wish to be the manager should anyonersquos otherwise robust existence end prematurely because of a legally binding instruction they knew nothing about.What all this points to is troubling. There has been much trumpeting about the ways in which communities are pulling together under lockdown, growing stronger and kinder because of the strain on those who are least able to help themselves. Despite this, however, there is an insidious undercurrent to some discussions, a faint suggestion that the aged are in danger of being perceived as a nuisance, a drain on limited resources that are better used for the young. The tenor of recent government guidelines appears to hint that when people reach a certain vintage they should expect less heroic or interventionary treatment, and accept thatthings take a turn for the worst, their time is up.When new guidance was issued to medics by the former Chief Medical Officer Catherine Calderwood last week, Dr Donald Macaskill, chief executive of Care Scotland, was perturbed at its implications: ldquoNothing in this document gives me confidence that we will not be putting our clinicians in a position where they have no option but to decide on the basis of age.Le-saving equipment and highly trained medical staff are undoubtedly in limited supply. When intensive care beds and ventilators have to be rationed, then the decision of who benefits most will have to be made. Who would envy a doctor faced with such a bleak choice But it would be a terrible indictment of our societythe exigencies of this emergency fostered the sense that old is synonymous with surplus. If the word ldquopensioner is in danger of becoming a le-threatening label the long-term legacy of this disease will be far worse than the number of fatalities. It will have buried one of the primary principles on which modern civilisation is based.The idea that iniduals automatically become obsolescent after a certain age is repugnant. So too that their worth diminishes with each year. Who has the authority or right to say that one personrsquos le is more valuable than another  The more I see of friends in their eighties and nineties, the more I understand the old joke: Who would want to live to   Someone who is .One of the reasons this pandemic is so intense is because we have long recognised the importance of seniors. Modern medical advances have been expressly designed to allow much of the population to reach and enjoy advanced age, eventhey do rattle occasionally with their daily regimen of pills.Before going to university I worked for a year as an auxiliary nurse in a small hospital, on the male and female geriatric wards. It was a revelatory experience. Some of the patients had dementia, a few were permanently bed-bound, but there was not one of them who could not find some enjoyment and pleasure each day, or who did not retain much of their personality. It was an inspirational lesson that one of the finest achievements of society is to take such loving care of those whose best years are behind them, and for whom the future is measured in months, weeks, or simply hours.It is not for the state to determine who lives and dies. Every day doctors quietly make these calls, for reasons of humanity, and we must trust their judgement. When they need to discuss matters of le and death with relatively healthy patients, however, they would do well to remember that up to the very end, we all will rage against the dying of the light, and rightly, properly so.Shops across Scotland are closing.

They are delivering vital work to help provide food, but too often they forget to look after themselves properly at this stressful and tiring time of year, said the charityrsquos welfare officer, Mags Granger.ldquoThe stark reality is that every week one farmer in the UK commits suicide, with financial pressures, incomes derailed by market fluctuations, livestock disease or poor harvests all said to be key stress factors.The industry also has one of the poorest safety records of any occupation, with stress cited as a factor in farm injuries and accidents which can also harm productivity.Meanwhile, poor mental wellbeing among the agricultural sector is also said to have a signicant economic cost the World Health Organisation recently estimated the global burden at pound. billion."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-scotland-glasgow-venue-aims-raise-50k-help-local-schools-make-ppe","story":"Bosses at SWG have partnered with independent school Kelvinside Academy and Caldervale High to help produce up to , visors every day to deliver to hospitals, surgeries, pharmacies and care homes across the city.: NicolaSturgeon pledges to address concerns over equipmentThe West End school has already distributed more than , custom-built visors after throwing open the doors of their technology department to manufacturers.However, it is hoped SWG can help raise additional funds and connect the school with independent laser cutters and D printers to assist in the production.Andrew Fleming-Brown, SWG Director, said: ldquoFollowing the reported shortage of personal protective equipment for frontline NHS staff, we felt it absolutely critical to offer any support to organisations in the Glasgow area working to tackle this deficiency.\"He added: \"What Kelvinside Academy is doing is nothing short of phenomenal, but they need support to keep momentum and build capacity through independent printers.

We produce a range of styles, from classic IPA, Drop, through the multi-award-winning Fathom , Spinnaker , and Drt .We also have Wave, our weissbier, Surf, our pale ale with a twist, and Capsize, our blonde beer. Our beer comes in cases of twelve ml or ml bottles, and also bag-in-box of , or  litresare filled straight from the tank and will keep for a few weeks.Mark Hazell, who started Jaw Brew with Alison, his partner, now makes Bardowie Gin as well, and is also experimenting with making hand sanitiser, after requests from local businesses .

Where do you feel the anxiety  Be conscious of what your body is telling you. Is your heart racing, stomach churning  To help ease these symptoms, be mindful of your breathing. Inhale through your nose for  slowly and exhale through your mouth again counting to  slowly. Repeat this exercise four times.AwarenessWe cannot control how her lersquos have changed due to this pandemic but what we can control is our thoughts to this global crisis. To quote from the Greek philosopher Epictetus ldquoPeople are not disturbed not by things, but by the views they take of them. Through awareness of how our thoughts make us feel, we can challenge these to more positive helpful thoughts. Awareness is the key to unlocking our distorted thoughts and through recognising whether we are for example predicting, judging or catastrophising, this can assist us in challenging and changing these negative obtrusive thoughts to more positive helpful ones.Self-CareTake this time as an opportunity to look after self. Self-care is crucial for building up resilience to le events and there is no time more important than in the now to engage in self-care: it is a priority. Self-care consists of several elements:Physical self-care such as nutrition, exercise and sleep.Mental self-care such as being aware of our thoughts and behaviours and engaging in activities such as crosswords. Emotional Self-care such as being aware of our emotions for example anger and sadness and how these can be managed. For example, through keeping a daily journal to recognise the triggers for our emotions.Spiritual Self-care such as awareness of when our minds are racing with thoughts and to try and be still. Engage in activities such as meditation, mindfulness and through being still in the now this will quieten the racing mind and provide strength at this challenging time. Take time to assess your self-care by implementing a self-care plan and commence small steps to change through looking after self. ldquoAn empty lantern provides no light. Self-care is the fuel that allows your light to shine brightly. If you find yourself struggling with anxiety, low mood or lapsing into unhelpful ways of coping, then contact Sharon.

Situated on the banks of the River Teviot, in an award-winning conversion of the former Victorian electrical works, the distillery is laying down spirit for a future Single Malt release, makes an excellent gin, and recently released a vodka.Kerrrsquos Borders Gin is genuinely Scottish Gin ndash wholly distilled from barley grown within  miles of the distillery. It is named after William Kerr ndash Hawick-born, and among the th centuryrsquos most accomplished botanists. He sent  plant specimens back to Kew Gardens from his Far East travels.Kerr would likely have approved of the distilleryrsquos Carterhead Still ndash one of only a handful in operation. It gently heats the botanicals rather than boiling them like most other gin stills, capturing more of the subtle flavours. Together with the barley, this gives the gin a distinctive depth. The rounded flavour works well with the bitterness of tonic water, creating a beautully balanced GT.The newest addition to distilleryrsquos range is Puffing Billy Steam Vodka ndash unfiltered malted barley vodka, named after the special still which plays a key role in its production. The spirit is steamed through charcoal inside the still itself and never filtered as a liquid, preserving the delicious character of the barley.Itrsquos the only vodka in the world made this way, and drinks commentators have praised the result, suggesting it could reinvigorate vodka, a spirit somewhat overlooked during the recent gin boom. Fabulous with tonic or Ginger Beer, the vodka also tastes incredibly smooth sipped chilled and straight.Kerrrsquos Borders Gin and Puffing Billy Steam Vodka are available direct from the distilleryrsquos online shop, currently offering free delivery anywhere within the UK when you buy a bottle.See www.thebordersdistillery shop ------------------------------------------------The Mortgage Advice Service ScotlandRe-mortgaging During the Coronavirus OutbreakAlthough health concerns are their immediate priority, people are searching for ways to reduce their monthly expenditure and cutting their biggest monthly outlay makes financial sense.Although the Coronavirusis having a signicant impact on obtaining funds for purchasing a new home, re-mortgages are still available from lenders at competitive rates and depending on the size of your mortgage, you could make substantial savings each month by simply changing lenders.Re-mortgaging neednt be a hassleEvenyou can save hundreds of pounds by shopping around, the thought of trying to switch your current mortgage may seem like a hassle you could do without.However, re-mortgaging isnt nearly as much hassle as you may think, because, thats where we step in and do all the work that is involved in finding you a fresh deal that can lower your monthly payments and maybe even help you to pay off your mortgage quicker.Choosing the right mortgage can be tricky.Next to purchasing your home, choosing the right mortgage is probably one of the most important decisions you will make when you are looking for a new deal.Approaching your current lender or bank may not result in you obtaining the best mortgage deal because they generally only consider their own products.

Guy appears to be going slowly insane.Not le in lockdown Britain but business as usual on Limmyrsquos Handmade Show, the comedy so surreal the credits should be painted by Dali.Brian ldquoLimmy Limond does nothing as conventional as telling a joke. Dear God, no.Do not expect a series of set ups and punchlines, Only Fools and Horses-style, from this Glaswegian.No cuddly chummy stuff, and will-they-wonrsquot-they romance as in Peter Kayrsquos Car Share.Limmy is hardcore, brittle, slightly scary, and off the money more times than he is on it, but when his material works it sings like Connollyrsquos and can be as funny as Bridgesrsquo.This new three part series follows a pilot last year not long after the new BBC Scotland channel had launched. As before, it will be premiered on BBC Scotland before going network on BBC.Shot by himself in his flat, Limmy plays all the parts. He also the writer, producer, sound recordist, and editor. He probably did the location catering, too, and had a quick whip round with the vacuum before switching on the camera.When not in his flat he is out and about in Glasgow at ious venues. ldquoThis here is the international financial district of Glesga, he tells the camera. ldquoItrsquos offices hellip When I see offices like these it makes me so grateful that I donrsquot yet have to go back to having a real job.Note that ldquoyet. Limmy was one of the first to make \"do it yourself\" videos on his phone and upload them to social media. Now everyone and their granny is at it.Besides his television work he is best known for popping up on Twitter whenever a celebrity passes away to say he once had the pleasure of meeting so and so at a charity do, and that they were ldquo surprisingly down to earth, and VERY funny. Many are the unwitting TV researchers who have fallen for that one.In the first episode, besides wondering what it would be like working in an office, he teaches a masterclass in techno and how to rile the crowd into throwing bottles at you, rfs on contactless payments, and wonders what the numbers on a toaster mean.In a later episode he treats a creepy intruder ashe is a woodland creature that has wandered in by mistakeIt all sounds bizarre because it is. Limmy is so far down the rabbit hole he may never see daylight again.While he has his own particular brand of absurdism, he is part of a long tradition in Scottish comedy of surrealist humour stretching from Chic Murray and Lex McLean to Arnold Brown. Billy Connollyrsquos finest routines are the most fantastic flights of imagination that start at a point familiar to the audience before ending up who knows where.That said, the most successful sketches in the first episode were of the more conventional iety. In one he managed to take something as simple as an arrow chalked on the pavement leading him into an underpass and mine three pretty decent gags from it. It was almost silent comedy, with his face doing a lot of the heavy lting. A Glesga Buster Keaton no less.Some of the material fell flat, the social media chat felt dated, and three half hour episodes might be pushing it. Older now and a father, he is losing a bit of his punk edge .But I did laugh at the sheer daftness of some of it.

There has been work done on it previously ndash timber shoring ndash which helps to keep it in place.

During my letime, we were persuaded that free markets solve all problems , and prosperity depended more on the London financial market than a ersied economy. Deregulation, centralisation and out-sourcing have been promoted. These were political decisions made repeatedly over decades.How can we go forward  In retirement, I have realised that we have not been going in the right direction.

We had intended after a few days at home to travel to Ireland, but took the advice offered by the Irish authorities and have self-isolated in Glasgow ever since and cancelled our onward travel plans.Anecdotal reports from our major airports suggest that there are still no checks on the medical condition of passengers arriving from virus-ridden locations.

During that service, in a sign of humble obedience, Francis prostrated himself for a few minutes on the basilica floor.With rank-and-file faithful not allowed into the basilica in accordance with virus containment measures, and as Francis listened attentively, the Rev Raniero Cantalamessa said that ldquoit took merely the smallest and most formless element of nature, a virus, to remind us that we are mortal and that ldquomilitary power and technology are not sufficient to save us.He added said that when the pandemic is over, ldquoing to the way things were is the lsquorecessionrsquo we should fear the most. He added that the virus broke down ldquobarriers and distinctions of race, nation, religion, wealth and power.The Vatican has said there are eight Covid- cases among Vatican city residents or employees.All of the Vaticanrsquos Holy Week ceremonies have been barred to the public, in keeping with Italyrsquos lock-down measures.Italy is living through a fth week of lockdown with at least three more weeks to go.The Colosseum Good Friday Way of the Cross procession normally draws tens of thousands of pilgrims and Romans who clutch candles and prayer books, while the Pope watches from a rise overlooking the ancient arena.But Italyrsquos stay-at-home measures sent tourists and pilgrims fleeing the country weeks ago, and Romans must stay at home except to go to essential jobs or do vital tasks like buying food or medicine.copy -.

The shot was clearly going just wide of the upright before Fraser MacDonald inadvertently erted it into his own net for a bizarre opener.”Under the canny guidance of manager Angie Murchison, Skye’s useful blend of youth and experience continued to revel on the big stage. Youngsters like Somhairle Macdonald, Ewen MacSween, John MacLean and Allan MacLeod had established themselves along with several survivors of the  team – Cowie, Willie MacRae, Peter Gordon, John ‘Bodach’ Mackenzie, Ally MacDonald and Ewen MacKinnon.With  minutes played the islanders doubled their advantage.McCormack takes up the action: “John MacLean delivered a corner into the danger area, and with keeper Kenny MacDonald under pressure Cowie took two attempts before slipping the ball over the line as he tumbled face-forward onto the pitch”.Skye’s fans were in dreamland but, as the reporter had noted: “Kyles are famous for their battling qualities”.By half time the match was level.From a powerful hit in from the right the ball broke to veteran Dan MacRae “who had time and space to place the shot beyond the reach of keeper MacKenzie.”Then, calamity struck Skye in the closing moments of the half.“Another massive hit in by Tom White caused panic in the Skye defence, and as MacKenzie lashed out in an attempted clearance the ball appeared to come back past him off team captain MacSween”.Seconds later it took an outstanding save from MacKenzie to deny Dallas Turner and prevent Kyles from turning around in the lead.Murchison’s men regrouped.“The second half had been underway less than  seconds before Skye retook the initiative thanks to a corner which was turned in by Cowie, with Peter Gordon hovering to pick up on any mistake.”For much of the second half Kyles were kept well away from the Skye danger area, but a fourth goal proved elusive – thanks in large part to legendary goalkeeper Kenny MacDonald.And with Skye just eight minutes away from sealing a place in the final the men in blue hauled themselves back from the brink.Our reporter said that Dallas Turner “had looked the likeliest threat” and it was the youngster who “saw a glimmer of an opening and fired in a shot which took a deflection and flew past Bodach MacKenzie and into the net”.“That was the signal for the islanders to lay siege to the Kyles goal and for the Tighnabruaich keeper to dig dep with a string of exceptional saves.”MacLean, Somhairle MacDonald , Gordon and Cowie were all denied before the whistle sounded to herald extra time.In “energy-sapping heat” it was hardly surprising that the added half hour was more low-key, but five minutes into the second period came a “glorious chance” for Skye.Referee Donne Fraser spotted an infringement in the area, and the islanders were awarded a penalty.Rankin stepped up, but was unable to make clean contact and the “scuffed spot hit was easily turned away by MacDonald”.And so to a penalty shoot-out. Both goalkeepers excelled themselves, MacDonald saving two, and MacKenzie doing likewise. With Kyles - ahead, Rankin had to score to force sudden death, but his shot sailed wide and it was Kyles who went through to the final.Ian McCormack concluded: “Rankin was hero as well as villain. Once he got the measure of Ronnie MacVicar he dictated play from the centre, giving a hundred per cent in effort and running himself into the ground in the process. Up front Willie Cowie was immense – especially for a player just back from injury.“And while the defence as a whole were tight, Willie MacRae at buckshee back gave another award-winning performance.“If there was a man of the match award it would undoubtedly have gone to Kyles keeper Kenny MacDonald, who had excellent cover from full back Fraser MacDonald.“Their most dangerous forward was Dallas Turner, while that veteran Dan MacRae showed he still has a few seasons left in him at the top level.”In the final Kingussie, in the middle of a run of seven-successive Camanachd Cup triumphs, proved too strong, though Kyles gave a good account of themselves and had taken the lead before succumbing to a - defeat.The redoubtable Kenny MacDonald was the final’s man of the match, but his remarkable career had still some way to run. Both he and namesake Fraser # the full back in the epic tussle of  – would again pick up winners’ medals in , by which time Kenny’s son Roddy had also emerged as a star of the sport.For Skye the wait for another shot at the big one goes on – with the club also missing out in semi finals in  and .Allan MacLeod, the current Skye co-manager, reflected on that game at Ballachulish – recalling that he played much of the first half without a contact lens.“I remember marking Dan MacRae – a fantastic player. But it was great chance for us.“We were the better side for much of it, but not for the first time Kenny MacDonald was the saviour for Kyles.“At the time Kingussie were virtually unstoppable and we’d have met them in their prime. Our chance of winning the cup may have been slim, but it would have been nice to have made the final.“A lot of that Skye team would have deserved a shot on that stage.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3069609.jpg--.jpg?1586507454000\n","title":"ve mural planned after covid casts doubt over street party","story":"AMBITIOUS plans for a special community celebration in Ballykeel to mark the th anniversary of VE day have had to drastically re-scaled.Ballykeel  Moving Forward community group had hoped to combine the best elements of a party with some great historical insights into the local connection of what became known as the peoples war.But that was before the restriction rules imposed due to the COVID outbreak.However, group members Pat and Jean Rainey remained determined to mark VE day which stands for Victory in Europe when the Allies completed the task of defeating Nazi Germany.VICTORYTo that end, the pair have been busily making materials for a special VE day wall mural to be placed on a wall overlooking Crebilly Road just opposite the entrance to Tesco.Jean said: “The victory came after six long years of war and at a terrible human cost.We wanted to blend in some enjoyable activities for our young people with some historical education - the sacrices made in the Second World War cannot be forgotten - but COVID scuppered those plans.We had organised WW era costumes and a special exhibition featuring photographs of many of the men and women from the local area who played their part in the conflict.”Now, members of the group will hold a ‘socially distanced’ commemoration when the new VE mural is completed on Friday, May  at .pm.

I have always liked Easter and although I have less connection now with the institution of the Catholic Church, Good Friday always is a special day for me. It is the one afternoon that I try to slip into a church to reflect on the le of Jesus and his execution by crucixion all those years ago. This Good Friday the churches are closed. In fairness a church is not necessary for reflection. Any quiet place will do. But it will be strange nonetheless. vw, px\"  GERRY ADAMS:  commemorations will be more personalFor those of us who commemorate the  Easter Rising this will be a strange year also. There were Easters when repression and imprisonment, north and south, resulted in only a handful of activists coming together at gravesides and republican memorials to lay a wreath, read the Proclamation and list the names of our patriot dead. These were the Easters when successive Irish and Unionist governments banned such remembrances and used brutal tactics to enforce that ban. During the more recent years of conflict some Easter commemorations and republican memorials and graves were also bombed and damaged.This Easter we face a dferent kind of adversary. A silent, deadly enemy – the Coronavirus. So the traditional Easter commemorations have been cancelled.But that doesn’t mean that republicans will not commemorate our patriot dead. On the contrary this year commemorations will be more personal, more intimate, as we as iniduals and as families participate in our own little commemorative events or join in the online programme devised by Sinn Féin and others during this unprecedented health emergency. This includes a programme of social media events and posts, videos # some historical, speeches, including the keynote Easter address by Party President Mary Lou McDonald TD, music, encouraging children to produce art work reflecting on Easter, poetry, the flying of our national flag and the wearing of the Easter Lily.Many of us have favourite rebel songs and poems of struggle about the many dferent periods of rebellion in Ireland from , through Robert Emmet, the Young Irelanders, the Fenians, to Easter  and the Tan and Civil Wars, to the more recent decades of conflict. So as more and more people put video messages on social media why not consider posting your favourite rebel song  Or sing it yourself  But onlyyou’ve the voice for it. That leaves you out RG. Brón orm, chara.Or pick a poem by Pearse or Connolly or Bobby Sands or the last words of republican heroes. If you are a relative or friend or admirer of one of our patriot dead consider putting up a photo and telling their story.Court MartialThe book ‘Last Words’ by Piaras F. MacLochlainn is a personal favourite. It contains the letters and statements of the leaders who were executed after the  Rising. The poems of Pearse and the defiant statement by James Connolly to his court martial are often quoted but I have always had a special grá for Tom Clarke. He spent  years in English prisons in the s and s and endured long years of solitary confinement during which he was treated appallingly. In  he was the first signatory of the seven who signed the Proclamation. In the early hours of May  his we Kathleen, who was a prisoner in Dublin Castle, was brought to visit him in his cell under military escort. With a candle held by a British soldier for light and just hours before his execution Thomas Clarke gave Kathleen a message for the Irish people. It was brief but poignant.“I and my fellow-signatories believe we have struck the first successful blow for freedom. The next blow, which we have no doubt Ireland will strike, will win through. In this belief we die happy.” vw, px\"  National Graves Easter Parade JCThe story of the love of Joseph Plunkett and Grace Gford is well known. ‘Last Words’ contains a letter from Plunkett to Grace on  May in which he writes: “Listen –I live it might be possible to get the Church to marry us by proxy – there is such a thing but it is very dficult I am told. Father Sherwin might be able to do it. You know how I love you. That is all I have time to say. I know you love me and so I am very happy.”At pm on the evening of May  Grace was brought to the prison chapel. Joseph entered accompanied by a party of soldiers with fixed bayonets. The soldiers remained while Fr Eugene McCarthy read the marriage service by the light of a candle. After the ceremony they had to separate. A few hours later in the early hours of May  Grace was brought back to the prison and met her husband in his cell. They had ten minutes. Plunkett was executed on the morning of May  along with Edward Daly, Willie Pearse, and Michael O’Hanrahan.Oh Grace just hold me in your arms and let this moment lingerThey#ll take me out at dawn and I will dieWith all my love I place this wedding ring upon your fingerThere won#t be time to share our love for we must say goodbye.A century ago this November Kevin Barry was executed in Mountjoy Prison in Dublin. The song, which commemorates this young  year old, is a firm favourite with many. It has never lost its ability to stir the heart and remind us of the courage of this young man and his comrades. It has been recorded and sung countless times over the years, including by Paul Robeson and Leonard Cohen. Robeson’s version can be found online.A Nation Once AgainIn an earlier generation the essays and poems of Thomas Davis reminded people of the  Rising and of the awful impact of British colonialism on Ireland. RG has an edition of a book – Essays and Poems: Thomas Davis – published by the Gresham Publishing Company some time around the s. Davis died at the age of  from scarlet fever in  the first year of An Gorta Mór. One of his enduring works is ‘A Nation Once Again’.And then I prayed I yet might seeOur fetters rent in twain,And Ireland, long a province beA Nation Once Again.Davis also wrote ‘The West’s Asleep’ which in more recent years has been made famous by the Dublinersand the Clancy Brothers and others as ‘The West’s Awake’.So, this week and next use social media to post a personal reflection of the events in Dublin and where in  and of all those periods of struggle in Ireland’s long history of resistance and our demand for freedom. It can be something from YouTube or it can be you and those in your home or you and your friends singing, reciting, reading about Ireland’s patriot dead.These are some of my personal words and poems and lyrics.

But local representatives told the Belfastthe money will only be usedabsolutely necessary.DUP Westminster leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the rise to expenses, which applies to all eight party members, was indicative of the exceptional circumstances.Parliamentary authorities have made provision for MPs to avail of additional office costs to be incurred so that staff may continue to safely continue their work, he said.It allows for the purchase of any additional IT equipment for staff to work from home or for telephone systems to be amended so that important queries from constituents can still be dealt with.The support is not given directly to MPs, but enables them to purchase equipment from a central facility.The increase is obviously an exceptional measure and it was a decision taken quickly by Ipsa to assist during this exceptional time of crisis.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseColum Eastwood FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappColum EastwoodA spokeswoman for the SDLP, which has two MPs including party leader Colum Eastwood, said the cash will be a welcome boostneeded.The allowance is designed to allow MPs and staff to work effectively from home, she said.If we need to access it to enable us to provide an effective constituency service we will.Stephen Farry, who is the Alliance Party#s only representative at Westminster, said he did not think he would need to access the additional coronavirus fund.This is a decision taken independently from MPs and its purpose is to facilitate remote working, he said.I am committed to ensuring Parliament canand meet virtually during this crisis, with constructive scrutiny and accountability more important than ever. However, I don#t anticipate drawing down much,any, of this money.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseStephen FarryPA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappStephen FarryA Sinn Féin spokesman said the guidelines on social distancing had created the need for additional IT equipment.This proposal is not an increase in MP or staff salary,he said. It is an uplt in office cost allowance for ensuring a constituency service can continue to operate remotely in these times of crisis and to meet the needs of constituents.Given the increased demand on constituency services at a time of public health emergency, constituency workers should be able to work safely from home or adhere to strict social distancing guidelines - this inevitably creates a need for additional IT equipment.” According to The Times, the extra funds will be available until March  and come with a relaxation of the rules on evidence of purchases.In addition to increasing the money available for MPs# office costs, the authority is also suspending the -day limit for claiming costs and relaxing the requirements on producing evidence of money spent.The monthly credit limit on MPs# payment cards has been increased to £, and the single transaction limit has been increased to £,.The authority says it will provide additional funding from the staff absence budget for workers who are unwell or cannot be in work.Responding to the announcement, Labour MP Andrew Gwynne said: Casework has explodedso it#s right that our offices remain open ­- remotely - at this time.But he added that it would have been betterIpsa had done an equipment loan scheme instead.And Conservative MP Julie Marson said: No MP will see an extra penny of this in their bank accounts.Ipsa increased the office budget to provide staff who primarily work from the office the ability to work from home, and to produce and distribute Covid- information.Ipsa was established in the wake of the  MPs# expenses scandal.

And this year, pregnant women also have to worry about Covid-, a virus that can affect a person’s lungs and airways.Last week, the UK government announced that pregnant women were at an increased risk of severe illness from coronavirus.However, the advice to pregnant women was described by Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty as “a precautionary measure” because “we are early in our understanding of this virus and we want to be sure.”So how does the coronavirus crisis affect youyou are pregnant or have just had a baby This advice was compiled with the help of Dr David Glenn FRCOG, a Consultant Obstetrician and Gynaecologist at Kingsbridge Private Hospital and Clinical Director for Women and Child Health at Ulster Hospital.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseDr David Glenn FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappDr David GlennWhy are pregnant women in the high-risk category Pregnant women do not appear more likely to contract the infection than the general population. Pregnancy itself alters the body’s immune system and response to viral infections in general, which can occasionally be related to more severe symptoms and this will be the same for Covid-.Can a pregnant woman pass coronavirus on to her baby Transmission from mother to baby during the pregnancy or delivery is probable, although the proportion of pregnancies affected and the signicance to the baby has yet to be determined. Amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swabs, placenta swabs, genital fluid and breastmilk samples from Covid- infected mothers have so far tested negative for the virus. However, a new report describes a case in which the baby born to a Covid- positive mother was found to have antibodies in their blood at birth. This is thought to represent a baby’s response to infection within the womb.Is there a greater chance of miscarriageyou test positive for Covid- There is currently no evidence of an increased risk of miscarriage or early pregnancy loss in relation to Covid-.Moreover, there is no evidence that the virus damages the baby. Despite recent evidence that the virus can be passed from mother to baby, the proportion of pregnancies affected and the signicance to the baby has yet to be determined.What symptoms should pregnant women be aware of, and what should they dothey are experiencing any of them If you are infected with Covid- you are still most likely to have no symptoms or a mild illness from which you will make a full recovery. Most women will experience only mild or moderate cold flu like symptoms. Cough, fever, shortness of breath, lack of smell taste and even gastrointestinal symptoms are other relevant presentations.For women who have had symptoms, antenatal appointments can be deferred until  days after the start of symptoms, unless symptomspersevere.For women who are self-isolating because someone in their household has possible symptoms of Covid-, appointments should be deferred for  days.If women develop more severe symptoms or her recovery is delayed, this may be a sign that they are developing a more signicant chest infection that requires enhanced care. In this situation you should contact your maternity care team.Are all antenatal appointments going ahead as normal in Northern Ireland If you are well at the moment and have had no complications in your previous pregnancies arrangements for your care may be altered but they are still important to attend.If you have a routine scan or visit due in the coming days, you will still need to attend but the appointment may change due to staffing requirements. Maternity care is essential to reduce complications in mothers and babies. Even in the context of coronavirus, it is important that pregnant women continue to attend their scheduled routine care when they are well.Pregnant women will be asked to keep the number of people with you to a minimum. This will include being asked to attend maternity appointments alone.There may also be a need to reduce the number of routine antenatal visits.If women have an urgent problem related to the pregnancy but not related to coronavirus, they should get in touch using the same emergency contact details they already have. They should not contact that number unless they have an urgent problem.If women have symptoms of coronavirus, they should contact their maternity service and they will arrange the right place and time for the visits. They should not attend a routine clinic.What risks are there of an expectant mother contracting Covid- on a trip to hospital for an antenatal appointment Maternity care is essential and has been developed over many years with improving success to reduce complications in mothers and babies. The risks of not attending care include harm to mother, her baby or both.Many provisions have been put in place to reduce risk to mothers. These include reducing the number of visits to the hospital to a minimum, advice to mothers on reducing the number of people travelling with mothers to the hospital, attending the appointments alone, keeping numbers reduced in waiting rooms, spacing patients in waiting areas, staff taking additional protective efforts to reduce transmission in clinics with hand washing, cleaning equipment etc.How prepared are hospitals to deal with pregnant women with the virus Very signicant changes have been occurring in hospitals over the past weeks to deal with pregnant women with Covid-. Signicant changes have been made in all areas of the hospital, from clinics to wards and including delivery suites. Practice drills are being run frequently to train staff, additional resources have been brought in to help and a huge effort has been made by all levels of non-clinical, clinical, administrative and management staff.If the mother of a baby has symptoms or tests positive for Covid-, should she isolate herself from the baby Given the current limited evidence, we advise that women and healthy infants, not otherwise requiring neonatal care, are kept together in the immediate post-partum period.A risks benefits discussion with neonatologists and families to inidualise care in babies who may be more susceptible is recommended.Can a new mother with the virus breastfeed The main risk of breastfeeding for infants is the close contact with the mother, who is likely to share infective droplets. In the light of the current evidence, it is advised that the benefits of breastfeeding outweigh any potential risks of transmission of the virus through breastmilk. Precautions should be taken to reduce spread to the baby such as, hand washing before touching the baby, avoiding coughing or sneezing on the baby while feeding, and considering wearing a face mask,available, while feeding or caring for the baby.Can a pregnant person be accompanied by a partner or have visitors A person in labour can be accompanied by one birthing partner, according to the new guidelines. No visitors are permitted in ante-natal or post-natal ward areas.Will babies continue to be delivered in all Northern Ireland hospitals No, not at Causeway Hospital in Coleraine. Antenatal services will continue but it is not possible to deliver babies in the hospital during this surge period.This is due to a lack skilled paediatricians available to provide emergency care to a baby born in distress throughout the  hour period. To protect the wellbeing of mothers and babies, women booked to deliver in Causeway will be contacted and have their delivery transferred to Antrim or Altnagelvin Hospital.Should parents introduce their newborn to friends and family Current government guidance is that you should not meet with people outside your household, so no family celebrations are permitted at present.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Reduce the chance of me and others like me having a reduced lespan from Covid-.

What I have been saying all along is the need to try to look at the cumulative effect, he said.Mr Kinahan suggested that each new application is just seen as one.He also questioned the ability of Ballyclare#s sewerage network to cope with any new housing developments.He said he has written to the Department of Infrastructure to highlight the issue of sewerage.According to a recent letter sent to Mid and East Antrim Borough Council by NI Water, half of Northern Ireland#s sewers will be full by  and wastewater treatment works in more than  areas across Northern Ireland are at or rapidly approaching full capacity and where NI Water is unlikely to be able to accept additional sewer connections.Northern Ireland#s wastewater infrastructure is at serious risk and nearly every main urban area is impacted, the letter stated.

All existing trees, shrubs and hedgerows within the site and on boundaries must be retained and construction will not be permitted between March and July in a bid to limit disturbance to breeding peregrine falcons.A geology report by Earth Science Conservation Review has stated that the best exposures of the lower basalt formation in the Ballyclare area are to be found at Craighill Quarry.Belfast Most ReadWidow tells of grief over crash victim Matthew Arnold who had just become a new fatherCoronavirus: PSNI probe gathering for ex-Sinn Fein councillor#s funeralCoronavirus: PSNI launch online reporting portal after  complaints on social distancing breachesApplication for  new homes on former Co Antrim quarry site lodgedMen #lucky to escape with their lives# in Omagh gun attack,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Picture: BBC Newsline  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappThe PUP#s Dr John Kyle. Picture: BBC Newsline April   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailPUP deputy leader Dr John Kyle has pleaded with the Department of Health to give loved ones personal protective equipmentto allow them to spend final moments with family members with Covid-. Dr Kyle, who recently came out of retirement to help in the fight against coronavirus, said a close family member should be trained in how to use PPE so they can spend the last few hours of a loved one#s le caring for them. Saying goodbye to a parent or a spouse or a child, caring for them in the last few hours of their le, it is profoundly signicant for any one of us, said Dr Kyle, speaking to the BBC#s Newsline programme. In the course of our lives there are few things that are more important - so to have a blanket ban and say that nobody can be with their relative in the last few hours of their le needs to be looked at again, he said. Clearly there are practical challenges but the way it would work would be that one family member, a close family member, would be trained in how to put on and how to take off PPE and would spend the last few hours beside their loved one at the end of their le. To be able to say goodbye is really important, he said. It comes as  further people were confirmed have died in Northern Ireland after contracting coronavirus on Friday.It brings the total number of deaths across the region to  people. In response, the Department of Health said that intensive care is not a safe place for members of the public. A spokesperson said: We need to protect very vulnerable patients and staff, we appreciate the distress this restriction causes. We will actively be promoting virtual visits through mobile devices.It emerged on Friday that Stormont#s health and finance departments are expected to place a £m order for PPE on Tuesday. The BBC#s Nolan Show said funds have been set aside for a £m deposit with a Chinese state firm, but leaked documents reveal concerns the goods may not be high enough quality. Items on the order include . million facemasks,  million respirator masks and  million in both aprons and visors.There are also concerns over the danger of being in competition with NI#s main supply route via the UK government.The funds being used to place the order were originally set aside for a failed order with Dublin but have now been allocated to a new supply route found by Northern Ireland officials in China. At the Health Committee on Thursday, chief social worker Sean Holland said there were no concerns over the quality of current PPE stocks. There was more concern, he said, with theof time medics were having to wear them.The Department for Health said the order had not been confirmed.In a statement it added: It is entirely right for officials to scrutinise and test any such proposals, stressing the need for due diligence and emphasising that any procurement must be compatible with NHS four nations arrangements.Meanwhile, a clinical lead in the Republic of Ireland has told a press conference on Sunday a Chinese batch of PPE was not suitable to be worn.Northern Ireland had been expected to share in one of the most recent batches of PPE delivered in the Republic, before plans for a deal fell through. Staff in Tallaght Hospital in Dublin were sent an email on Monday stating they were to wear surgical face masks around Covid- patients.But Professor Michael Cormican, national clinical lead for Health Care Associated Infections, said the masks sent from China were a defenceless barrier against Covid-, and as much use as a paper towel.These are the poorest quality elasticated ear-loop facemasks, he said.In a statement, a Tallaght Hospital spokesperson said: The Dublin Midlands Hospital Group and Tallaght University Hospital take the safety and protection of staff very seriously and this includes ensuring goods supplied meet the necessary standards of the HSE, and as specied by the WHO.The supply of PPE is a national and international challenge. All hospitals... are working every day to ensure hospitals have adequate and quality approved supplies.Any staff member who has concerns with regard to PPE should raise it with their clinical director in the first instance.A statement from the HSE said: Many clinicians are understandably very concerned for their own safety and that of their patients, colleagues and family.Some believe that wearing gloves, masks and other protective equipment in all situations will make them and their patients safer.However, the key to protecting patients and staff from infection to the greatest degree possible is to follow the whole package of infection prevention precautions. The most important parts of this in all settings are hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette and regular cleaning.The recommendation that all staff should wear a surgical mask for all patient encounters and meetings between staff is not supported by current evidence and is not consistent with the current national guidance.Belfast Related Content\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland ffd .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cfabb-efa--bfa-acbbfaab_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland ffd .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cfabb-efa--bfa-acbbfaab_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland ffd .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cfabb-efa--bfa-acbbfaab_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland ffd .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cfabb-efa--bfa-acbbfaab_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland ffd .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cfabb-efa--bfa-acbbfaab_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"VideoNorthern IrelandArlene Foster and Michelle O’Neill lead calls for people to stay at homeNorthern Ireland’s First Minister has warned those who flout social distancing rules over the Easter holidays that they should expect police action.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming e .ece AUTOCROP wh BT_K.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming e .ece AUTOCROP wh BT_K.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming e .ece AUTOCROP wh BT_K.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming e .ece AUTOCROP wh BT_K.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming e .ece AUTOCROP wh BT_K.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Northern IrelandCoronavirus: PSNI launch online reporting portal after  complaints on social distancing breachesThe PSNI has launched an online portal for members of the public to report incidents where social distancing rules are not being followed.Most ReadWidow tells of grief over crash victim Matthew Arnold who had just become a new fatherCoronavirus: PSNI probe gathering for ex-Sinn Fein councillor#s funeralCoronavirus: PSNI launch online reporting portal after  complaints on social distancing breachesApplication for  new homes on former Co Antrim quarry site lodgedMen #lucky to escape with their lives# in Omagh gun attack,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Robin Swannand Finance Minister Conor Murphy  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappHealth Minister Robin Swannand Finance Minister Conor Murphy By David Young, PAApril   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailA Chinese PPE manufacturer that Stormont is poised to place a multi-million pound order with is a “credible” supplier, the finance minister has said.Conor Murphy said securing personal protective equipment from overseas did come with risks, but he insisted the executive was doing all it could to mitigate those risks.Mr Murphy and Health Minister Robin Swann visited a factory in Belfast on Friday afternoon that has re-purposed production lines to make millions of pieces of PPE locally.On the visit they addressed concerns that have been raised about the administration’s efforts to secure PPE internationally.On Friday, BBC Radio Ulster’s Nolan Show revealed that a Department of Health official had raised flags about the £ million deal with a Chinese state firm, expressing concern about the quality of the PPE products and that the executive may place itself in competition with UK-wide procurement efforts in China.A previous executive effort to purchase PPE from China fell through after the administration was outmuscled by rival bids from the US and India.Mr Murphy and Mr Swann both insisted the new deal did not place them in competition with the UK Government’s co-ordinated supply line.They also said they would be securing assurances over the quality of the products purchased.“We’re dealing with people who have credibility, we are dealing with people who have a state association and an assurance from the Chinese government,” said Mr Murphy.“And we’re dealing with the Chinese administration itself to make sure.“And we have people on the ground trying to ensure that there’s quality, that there’s security of supply.“There are always risks in going to procure items abroad, but what we have to do is mitigate those risks, to make sure that we have assurances on security of supply, quality of products.“And then we also have to balance that out against what’s needed, what’s needed for frontline staff in this pandemic.”On the question of Stormont pursing dferent procurement lines, local, UK and international, Mr Swann said one did not represent a threat to the others.“There’s no threat, there’s no challenge – this is about working in partnership to make sure we have the PPE supply that we need in Northern Ireland,” he said.The minister added: “As health minister I will not put any inferior product into the line or into the supply chain for my health workers to use.“That would be irresponsible and I wouldn’t do that.”The ministers made the remarks on a visit to Huhtamaki in west Belfast – a company that has partnered with another Northern Ireland business, Bloc Blinds, to produce four to six million face shields a week.Mr Swann said: “I am delighted to visit Huhtamaki today to see the essential work they are doing to help ensure our health and social care workers have the protective equipment they need.“We are working very hard to build up our PPE stockpiles for the post surge period and the expected second surge and I will pursue every feasible route locally and indeed internationally to do this.“The protection of our frontline health and safety staff is an absolute priority and my Department continues to work with the Department of Finance to ensure that all supply lines are maximised to their full potential.”Mr Murphy added: “I commend Huhtamaki and Bloc Blinds for their partnership approach to manufacturing face shields visors for health and social care staff, the first large order of which arrived today which will be sent out to Trusts immediately.“Local companies are playing a key role in helping protect our frontline workers in the fight against Covid-.“Over  local businesses have so far offered to help produce PPE equipment with orders having been placed for  million items of PPE.”PAMost ReadWidow

Castledawson man Jason is currently renting a flat on Ireton Street, off Botanic Avenue near Queen’s University in south Belfast with three other students. Jason said his letting agency were unsympathetic to the students’ situation, saying there was nothing they could do. He told Derry Now: “They said it wasn’t their problem – that was what guarantors were for. “The situation is that they won’t give us any sort of leeway in terms of paying it when they know we’re not in the house due to university being cancelled. googletag.cmd.push “They’ve said it’s not their problem because it’s privately rented and I understand that to a point, but common sense has to kick in somewhere.” Jason and his flatmates are renting their accommodation through USPM Ltd, a letting agent based on University Road and say they had to initiate contact about Covid-. “There’s very little contact with the letting agency unless you miss or have to arrange a payment. They hadn’t contacted us about the pandemic, we had to do the ringing,” said Jason. “I rang them, and our contact said they understood the frustration but there was nothing they could do. To them, we were renting a house in Belfast to live in. googletag.cmd.push “Our landlords are usually dead on, butthey had any sort of generosity, they could do something. It’s not always up to the person on the end of the phone.” While Jason is able to fall back on the support of his family, he realises not everyone has that support available. He said: “I have a few friends who wouldn’t come home as much, they don’t have a stable home to come home to and they’re paying rent through jobs in Belfast. “A lot of them were in part-time jobs and have now been laid off. They have no way to continue that, no income. It’s not a good situation for them.” Jason believes the ‘mortgage holidays’ mooted by the government could provide the solution to the problem, but that the options did not appear to be being explored. “Anybody renting privately is just being made to pay. There are no mortgage holidays coming into play,” he said. “We’re probably now having to pay- months where we aren’t there whereas we had been in years gone by. That’s probably half the year of not being in the house and having to pay for it. “If they can take mortgage holidays, there is absolutely no reason for us to be paying rent, except for making a profit.” Derry Now contacted UPSM Ltd for a response, but none was available at the time of going to print.

Derry Trades Union Council chair, Niall McCarroll, said: The global Covid- crisis means we cant celebrate May Day, the international workers day, in the way we normally would. This year we were working with Derry and Strabane Council to host a Workers Rights and Social Justice Week culminating with the May Day march and rally. The Covid- crisis is causing tremendous pain and hardship. We are in the midst of a tragedy that we hope will end as soon as possible with as few deaths as possible. googletag.cmd.push The response to the crisis has also put a spotlight on the inadequacy of government action, the state of our public services and the central role of workers saving lives, protecting communities and allowing society to . Many in the political establishment have joined claps in recent weeks for our heroic nurses and frontline workers but they have spent the last decades justying poverty wages, undermining trade union representation and dismantling our public services, including our health service. The hypocrisy is glaring. Governments have described the battle to contain Covid- as a war but theyve sent frontline workers out without PPE and testing. Far too many employers have risked workplace and public safety by refusing to implement public health guidelines. Workers have been forced to take strike action to make sure health guidelines are followed. googletag.cmd.push Its crucial we put a focus on the heroic efforts of workersresponding to this crisis, on the need for workers rights and on the central importance of our public services. The Derry Trades Union Council is calling on everyone to mark this May Day by joining a Five Minutes of Noise for Workers Rights at pm on Friday May st - and by putting up red flags and signs for workers rights from homes and workplaces for  hours. Well be working with unions, community groups, equality campaigners, artists and others that we were collaborating with for the Workers Rights and Social Justice Week to organise as much as possible through social media. We will be launching our Workers Charter - our vision for dignity, respect and justice at work, in communities and for a more equal society. Were calling on the trade unions and organisations supporting workers rights across Ireland, North and South, to join this effort. People from all backgrounds and communities deserve workers rights,dignity and equality. We want this event to be as inclusive as possible. We need to begin to shape a new way of doing things thats centred around recognising the value of workers and the needs of the working class communities.

Anyone caught neglecting to clean up after their dogs can now be issued with an pound fine and the council has wasted no time in getting the message across along some of the citys most popular walkways. Recently, Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Councillor Michaela Boyle, reminded the public of the need to take responsibility for their pets following an increase in the instances of dog fouling in recent weeks. Government measures to reduce the spread of the Covid  virus by limiting when the public can leave their home has led to an increase in walkers in local parks, greenways and public footpaths and with it more dog foul for Councils Cleansing teams to clean up. googletag.cmd.push Mayor Boyle urged dog owners to show respect for public health and other parks and greenway users when walking their pets. The vast majority of dog owners are conscientious and clean up after their dogs but there has been a noted increase in fouling since the new stay at home measures were introduced,” she said. Dog excrement left on our streets and parks poses a serious public health hazard and is putting extra pressure on our Cleansing team at this dficult time.  I would appeal to all owners to carry a bag to lt the dirt and dispose ofit in a designated dog bin where possible or in a black bin. googletag.cmd.push “Similarly, owners are reminded that when in designated pedestrian zones, dogs must be on a lead held by someone who is able to control it and owners should be mindful of other dogs and members of the public who could be scared of animals.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Kieran Stevenson was man of the match in their win over Antrim and Michael McMullan spoke with the Derry keeper, as he rekindled the memories of their golden era.  For  years, Derry had wandered around in Ulsters hurling wilderness. Until that moment. The  Ulster final was ticking towards a conclusion. Mickey Collins won a free which his brother Ollie drove between the posts at the Andersonstown Road end. Derry fans among the , strong Casement Park attendance exploded into another frenzy, as their caman-wielding heroes hit the front again. googletag.cmd.push Was this eventually going to be their day  Not just yet. There was time for Antrim to cast the dice one last time. Gary OKane composed himself over a stoppage time sideline cut. The wind carried the sliotar into the danger-zone, where vigilant Derry goalkeeper Kieran Stevenson deflected it wide. It was the last action and the final whistle kick-started an outpouring of emotion for the new Ulster champions. Bullfrog was the keeper in Banaghers three-in-a-row winning minor team, before moving into the county scene. An -year career began in , as understudy to Laveys Fergal Shorty McNally. The following year, he was second choice behind Padraig Oacute Mianaacutein when Derry won the All-Ireland B championship. googletag.cmd.push In , the Us lost to Antrimin the Ulster final. From that team, captain Colin McEldowney, Benny Ward, Mickey Conway, Gary Biggs and Geoffrey McGonigle would help spearhead Derry seniors towards Division One. The minors lost in the final that year, to the Saffrons, by an almost identical margin and Stevenson was the keeper on both teams. In , the Us took Antrim to a replay and  frees from the unerring Dermot Doherty, on his own Emmet Park turf, finished the job as Derry took the title in mid-week extra-time thriller. “That was a good win,” Stevenson recalls. “Antrim were always the team to beat, in terms of the county.” Things began to change. They ran Antrim to three points in the  senior final, but lost convincingly the following year. It was a spell in hurlings top tier that made the wheels of change turn that bit quicker. Promotion at the end of  began a four-year stint in the top flight. They ran Waterford to seven points at Ballinascreen in their first outing, before facing Cork and Kilkenny. The cream of hurling was lting Derrys standards. A -point slump to Tipperary, in Thurles, was their toughest afternoon. A one-point defeat in Laois was the one that got away, leaving Derry needing to beat Kerry in a relegation play-off to stay afloat before dropping down at end of the  campaign. “I think it as the Division One hurling that stuck to us and we were on an upward curve,” Stevenson feels. “There were more players added to the . “Derry hurlingwas about filling up the numbers and going out to play the matches. Then it changed and everybody was taking it serious. The club scene was improving and you could see the skill level going up from  to .” HARMONY In an interview three years ago, Conor Murray painted the Derry hurling scene he played on at the start of the noughties as a family. A unique one, with club rivalry left at the gates of Owenbeg and picked up on the way home. Stevenson agrees. “No club stuck to themselves, everybody got on well with everybody,” he said. Other managers werent chirping in players ears, telling them not to commit to the small ball game. In the  season, Kieran McKeever threw his lot in with the hurlers, while also playing in an Ulster football final weeks later. “Players were not restricted in playing for the county, in terms of hurling and everybody gelled,” Stevenson added A mountain of upside-down kit bags would be erected in the aisle of the team bus, with a coat thrown over it. Hey presto, they had a card table, around which they laughed on their journey to whatever battle they would later brace themselves for. It got more advanced when Stevenson, a kitchen manufacturer by trade, patented a custom-made card table. “When we were coming home, we were arm-wrestling on it and it was all a bit of craic,” he joked.  Emmett McKeever, Kieran McKeever and Geoffrey McGonigle celebrate Derrys  Ulster title. Steering the ship was Cushendall man Kevin McNaughton. After spending time helping foster Swatraghs structures and leading them to back to back intermediate championships, he came on board with Derry at the start of the  season. His trusted lieutenant, from the Swa, Roger Anthony Quinn, Laveys hurling godfather Tom Magill, Banaghers Gerard McCloskey and athletics coach Malcolm McCausland made up the management team. Heading up the M for the  final, Derry were in a decent place, following a - to - win over a Down team who had beaten New York in the quarter-final. Antrim were -point winners over London in their semi-final, but Derry blitzed them in the first half of the decider. Rookie defenders Emmett OHara and Declan McKillop were led a merry dance by the Derry attack. Ace attacker Geoffrey McGonigle and Emmett McKeever were missing through suspension. That told enough of the depth in Derrys squad. “We were getting better with playing all the better teams. There was plenty of skill, speed and fitness in the team. It was about trying to put it all together...it was a good ,” Stevenson explained. McKeever had been suspended after being sent off with Downs Noel Sands in the semi-final, on the advice of a linesman. With high-ranking officials on their July holidays, the appeal – lodged before the end of June – wasnt heard and McKeever would miss the final. “Beefywas our best player in defence...he was lethal,” Stevenson said of his captain. “We wanted to try and win it for him because he was hard done by. He was well-liked and in every match, hed have put his head in front of the hurl to stop the ball. “Antrim had Alistair Elliott, Gregory OKane was full-forward and Gary OKane started at centre half-forward, before going back .” DREAM START Kieran McKeever, Gary Biggs and Ollie Collins hit first half goals to leave Antrims foundations rocking. The Saffrons didnt score from play for  minutes. “We shouldve been further ahead,” said Stevenson of their - to - interval lead. “We had missed a pile of scoring opportunities and we were against the breeze in the second half. “We knewthe forwards were getting on the ball, they could score goals because they were skilful and quick.” Derrys backs were to the wall as Antrim notched  unanswered points and, with  minutes gone, went four points ahead. Derry replied with points to take the wind out of Antrims sails. Their case was helped further when John ODywer finished to the net for the crucial fourth Oakleafers goal. “It was the goals that won us the match,” Stevenson said. “I still have a hurling ball in the house, with the scorewritten on it.” All the press cuttings and programmes were kept too. A raft of memories from the glory years. But the hurl that deflected Gary OKanes last minute sideline cut to safety is long gone. “Some wee Belfast boy stole it,” Stevenson reckons. The Derry squad threw their history-making hurls on the turf to celebrate and within minutes they had vanished. “When the final was blown, it was more thepressure, you were always checking the time to see what was left. If the game had went onthere was less likelihood that we couldve won the game.” Conor Murray accepted the cup in the stand, before taking it down to the pitch for the suspended Emmett McKeever to again hoist it skywards to salute the magical moment. “We were there on merit,” was Stevensons assessment of their win. “We had a good defence and a good forward line. When you take the likes of John ODwyer, Geoffrey and Mickey Collins as your front three – you have a good side. “Conor Murray at full-back was safe, you had Collieand Niall Mullan in the corners.” Stevenson picked up the man of the match award and added to it with the Ulster hurler of the year accolade the following season when Derry retained their title. Later that night, the team partied into the wee small hours in Dungiven club. You could barely turn a sweet in your mouth. It was jam packed. Before that, on the joyous journey home, there was a poignant moment when the players got off the bus to carry the cup over the River Bann in Toome. “We had talked about it in previous years – the days when we were beaten,” Stevenson remembers. “It was a short walk, the boys were more interested in getting on the bus and heading on home.” Derrys fallow  years was over.

As one might expect there’s a strong representation from multiple John McLaughlin winners Ballinderry, Slaughtneil and Coleraine but I can’t believe some of the players that I have left out. However, I’m pretty sure thatan imaginary club was able to field this line-out in their prime, they’d not be far off lting the Andy Merrigan Cup. googletag.cmd.push  - MichaelConlan - Ballinderry A fixture between the sticks for Ballinderry for almost two decades, Mickey C was a good goalkeeper at the start of his career when winning an All-Ireland club medal in . By the s he seemed even better, maintaining a physical condition that would have been the envy of men  years his junior and adjusting to a massive transformation in what was expected from a modern goalkeeper. He just edges out Slaughtneil’s Antoin McMullan for the number one jersey.  - Karl McKaigue – Slaughtneil Karl might not be as well know as his elder brother, but he has been just as vital in Slaughtneil’s success. The archetype of the modern defender, who must meld man-marking skills with ability on the ball, McKaigue is often the initiation point for the Emmett’s attack. Has held some of the finest forwards in club football scoreless during Slaughtneil’s rise to national prominence including Conleith Gilligan, Ryan McHugh and Seanie Johnston. googletag.cmd.push  - Brendan Rogers Slaughtneil Another Emmets dual star Rogers, has been the defensive rock on which Slaughtneil’s success has been built. Named Ulster Club footballer of the year for , as a youngster Rogers initially chose to focus on hurling but has established himself as one of the football’s best defenders in not just Derry but Ulster, an automatic pick for this selection.  - Ciaran Mullan - Coleraine A superb athlete whose ball-carrying ability and pace have made him a nightmare for opposing forwards who end up spending much of their time tracking back into their own half. A key man as Coleraine claimed the John McLaughlin Cup for the first time in  and was still a fixture when they claimed their second title in .  - Kevin McGuckin - Ballinderry Another Ballinderry man with an All-Ireland medal in his pocket, the fact he was still making the starting  for the Shamrocks in  is testament to his qualities. A Rolls Royce of a footballer the former Derry captain’s experience was crucial as the Loughshore completed a hat-trick of victories between  and .  - Oisin Duffy - Foreglen It’s a measure of Oisin Duffy’s consistent excellence that he makes this selection based on performances in the Intermediate Championship. Could play any position in the backline, his strength and pace made him an effective man marker but equally comfortable in possession. Still as effective as ever as Foreglen claimed the Intermediate crown last October.  - Chrissy McKaigue - Slaughtneil First rose to prominence on the Derry minor side that reached the All-Ireland final in  the current Derry Captain has been a fixture for club and county for a decade. In addition to his evident abilities as a player, McKaigue provides the intangible qualities of leadership that every successful team needs. On the rare occasions that Slaughtneil find themselves floundering McKaigue is the man to whom his team-mates look to steady the ship.  - Patsy Bradley - Slaughtneil Another who’s career has spanned the ages, Patsy Bradley is an icon of Derry football. The quintessential quiet, hard man, Bradley’s aerial prowess rarely fails to catch the eye and his work-rate is immense. Has overcome injuries that might have restricted the career of lesser players Patsy’s toughness is the stuff of legend.  - Niall Holly - Coleraine Strong in the air and extremely mobile. Holly’s ball carrying skills have the been the starting point for countless Eoghan Rua attacks, with his languid style belying and athleticism allows him to glide past opponents. A perfect foil for the combative Bradley.  - Enda Muldoon - Ballinderry One of the most gted footballers ever to apply a boot to a size five, the Shamrocks man’s gts appeared to immune to the passing of the years as Ballinderry emulated their s antecedents in winning three in a row from  to . His ball to Raymond Wilkinson for the decisive goal in the  semi-final win over Banagher may be the best pass I have ever seen in club football.  - Benny Heron- Ballinascreen The only man in my team who doesn’t have some form of Championship winners medal to show for his efforts. Heron has been a prolic scorer for a Ballinascreen team that has regularly been in the mix for the John McLaughlin Cup without quite sealing the deal. With his phenomenal work rate and ability to score from both play and placed balls, Heron was a key factor in the St Colm’s club’s run to the  and  county finals.  - Sean Leo McGoldrick - Coleraine The oil that has kept the Coleraine engine running smoothly for a decade. Adaptable players can sometimes be the victims of their own versatility but Sean Leo McGoldrick’s quality is such that every manager in Derry would love to have him in their squad. One Coleraine mentor once told me that the one time in any game when he could relax was when Sean Leo had the ball because he knew it was secure. An incisive runner and an accurate passer the Eoghan Rua man can also chip in with a vital score when the occasion requires.  - Coilin Devlin - Ballinderry The flame-haired front man maybe didn’t have the profile of the other Ballinderry forward in this line-up but his impact for the Shamrocks in the early part of the decade was undeniable, bagged the decisive goal in the  final against Slaughtneil, and scored five points from play to earn man of the match honours in . Dooks pace and direct running made him a handful for opposing corner-backs.  - Colm McGoldrick - Coleraine The second member of the McGoldrick clan to make my team and you could make case for the inclusion of any of the brothers, but Colm is well worth his place. He was the fulcrum of the Eoghan Rua attack as they claimed their first county crown in . The intelligence of his movement is something that can’t be taught. As captain he scored four points in the  final as Coleraine doubled their tally of John McLaughlin Cups.  - Shane McGuigan - Slaughtneil The sharpest shooter in Derry club football in recent year. McGuigan’s scoring tallies speak for themselves scored - in the  Derry Championship and better that tally with - in . Performs well on the big stage top scored in the  Ulster final with - against Kilcoo and bagged - in ’s provincial triumph over Cavan Gaels. Every successful team needs a marquee man in their full-forward line, McGuigan is Slaughtneil’s. RELATED - Michael McMullans team of the decade- Click here...

As one might expect there’s a strong representation from multiple John McLaughlin winners Ballinderry, Slaughtneil and Coleraine but I can’t believe some of the players that I have left out. However, I’m pretty sure thatan imaginary club was able to field this line-out in their prime, they’d not be far off lting the Andy Merrigan Cup. googletag.cmd.push  - MichaelConlan - Ballinderry A fixture between the sticks for Ballinderry for almost two decades, Mickey C was a good goalkeeper at the start of his career when winning an All-Ireland club medal in . By the s he seemed even better, maintaining a physical condition that would have been the envy of men  years his junior and adjusting to a massive transformation in what was expected from a modern goalkeeper. He just edges out Slaughtneil’s Antoin McMullan for the number one jersey.  - Karl McKaigue – Slaughtneil Karl might not be as well know as his elder brother, but he has been just as vital in Slaughtneil’s success. The archetype of the modern defender, who must meld man-marking skills with ability on the ball, McKaigue is often the initiation point for the Emmett’s attack. Has held some of the finest forwards in club football scoreless during Slaughtneil’s rise to national prominence including Conleith Gilligan, Ryan McHugh and Seanie Johnston. googletag.cmd.push  - Brendan Rogers Slaughtneil Another Emmets dual star Rogers, has been the defensive rock on which Slaughtneil’s success has been built. Named Ulster Club footballer of the year for , as a youngster Rogers initially chose to focus on hurling but has established himself as one of the football’s best defenders in not just Derry but Ulster, an automatic pick for this selection.  - Ciaran Mullan - Coleraine A superb athlete whose ball-carrying ability and pace have made him a nightmare for opposing forwards who end up spending much of their time tracking back into their own half. A key man as Coleraine claimed the John McLaughlin Cup for the first time in  and was still a fixture when they claimed their second title in .  - Kevin McGuckin - Ballinderry Another Ballinderry man with an All-Ireland medal in his pocket, the fact he was still making the starting  for the Shamrocks in  is testament to his qualities. A Rolls Royce of a footballer the former Derry captain’s experience was crucial as the Loughshore completed a hat-trick of victories between  and .  - Oisin Duffy - Foreglen It’s a measure of Oisin Duffy’s consistent excellence that he makes this selection based on performances in the Intermediate Championship. Could play any position in the backline, his strength and pace made him an effective man marker but equally comfortable in possession. Still as effective as ever as Foreglen claimed the Intermediate crown last October.  - Chrissy McKaigue - Slaughtneil First rose to prominence on the Derry minor side that reached the All-Ireland final in  the current Derry Captain has been a fixture for club and county for a decade. In addition to his evident abilities as a player, McKaigue provides the intangible qualities of leadership that every successful team needs. On the rare occasions that Slaughtneil find themselves floundering McKaigue is the man to whom his team-mates look to steady the ship.  - Patsy Bradley - Slaughtneil Another who’s career has spanned the ages, Patsy Bradley is an icon of Derry football. The quintessential quiet, hard man, Bradley’s aerial prowess rarely fails to catch the eye and his work-rate is immense. Has overcome injuries that might have restricted the career of lesser players Patsy’s toughness is the stuff of legend.  - Niall Holly - Coleraine Strong in the air and extremely mobile. Holly’s ball carrying skills have the been the starting point for countless Eoghan Rua attacks, with his languid style belying and athleticism allows him to glide past opponents. A perfect foil for the combative Bradley.  - Enda Muldoon - Ballinderry One of the most gted footballers ever to apply a boot to a size five, the Shamrocks man’s gts appeared to immune to the passing of the years as Ballinderry emulated their s antecedents in winning three in a row from  to . His ball to Raymond Wilkinson for the decisive goal in the  semi-final win over Banagher may be the best pass I have ever seen in club football.  - Benny Heron- Ballinascreen The only man in my team who doesn’t have some form of Championship winners medal to show for his efforts. Heron has been a prolic scorer for a Ballinascreen team that has regularly been in the mix for the John McLaughlin Cup without quite sealing the deal. With his phenomenal work rate and ability to score from both play and placed balls, Heron was a key factor in the St Colm’s club’s run to the  and  county finals.  - Sean Leo McGoldrick - Coleraine The oil that has kept the Coleraine engine running smoothly for a decade. Adaptable players can sometimes be the victims of their own versatility but Sean Leo McGoldrick’s quality is such that every manager in Derry would love to have him in their squad. One Coleraine mentor once told me that the one time in any game when he could relax was when Sean Leo had the ball because he knew it was secure. An incisive runner and an accurate passer the Eoghan Rua man can also chip in with a vital score when the occasion requires.  - Coilin Devlin - Ballinderry The flame-haired front man maybe didn’t have the profile of the other Ballinderry forward in this line-up but his impact for the Shamrocks in the early part of the decade was undeniable, bagged the decisive goal in the  final against Slaughtneil, and scored five points from play to earn man of the match honours in . Dooks pace and direct running made him a handful for opposing corner-backs.  - Colm McGoldrick - Coleraine The second member of the McGoldrick clan to make my team and you could make case for the inclusion of any of the brothers, but Colm is well worth his place. He was the fulcrum of the Eoghan Rua attack as they claimed their first county crown in . The intelligence of his movement is something that can’t be taught. As captain he scored four points in the  final as Coleraine doubled their tally of John McLaughlin Cups.  - Shane McGuigan - Slaughtneil The sharpest shooter in Derry club football in recent year. McGuigan’s scoring tallies speak for themselves scored - in the  Derry Championship and better that tally with - in . Performs well on the big stage top scored in the  Ulster final with - against Kilcoo and bagged - in ’s provincial triumph over Cavan Gaels. Every successful team needs a marquee man in their full-forward line, McGuigan is Slaughtneil’s. RELATED - Michael McMullans team of the decade- Click here...

Aodhan Curran often draws sketches of people, both living and deceased. Families of those who have received one of Aodhans drawings say that it has brought them great comfort. As a result, the -year-old, who is currently studying to become a teacher, has offered to do a sketch of anyone who passes away from the virus. He has already been contacted by one family and within days of the person passing away, Aodhan had left the drawing at their home. He said the family were very thankful of the gesture. googletag.cmd.push “It is only a small thing but I think many of the families affected will get some comfort from it,” he said. Aodhan, who lives at Jacqueline Way in Derry, said he had always been interested in art. “I am studying to be a technology and design teacher at Ulster University in Coleraine but I have always loved art and doing sketches. “Over the years, I have done loads of drawings of people. “My uncle, Robbie Kennelly, died a few years ago and I did a drawing of him after he passed away. “His we, my aunt Margo, says the drawing is so special for her and it is lovely to hear that. googletag.cmd.push “From talking to other families, they love the sketches I have done for them and I just thought this would be a nice thing to do for some of the families of those who lose a loved one to coronavirus.” Aodhan said the circumstances surrounding the virus made it particularly dficult for families. “The people who area very ill with the virus are in the hospital on their own and then often die without their family being present. “And then there is the funeral service at which only a small number of people can attend. “It is a very dficult process for families to go through and many more will have to experience it over the next few weeks and months. “If my drawings can bring families even a small bit of comfort then I will be more than happy to help.” Any families who would like to contact Aodhan, can get in touch with him through his Facebook page Aodhan Curran Art.

Even in defeat, it was Derry who stole the show. What was supposed to be a Sunday stroll for Offaly turned out to be nothing of the sort as Derry flew the underdog flag with real pride. At the midpoint of the second half, Derry were level and pressing, and it took a strong finish by the overwhelming favourites to earn a six-point cushion at the end. Offaly’s manager, Pat Fleury, readily admitted that his team would have to make enormous improvements before the semi-final against Cork. googletag.cmd.push The truth is, Derry were always in contention in this game despite the dire predictions of a massacre. Geoffrey McGonigle ed from suspension to rattle in two goals and the full forward line of Gary Biggs, Michael Collins and John O’Dwyer scored - among them. There were high-class performances at midfield from Ronan McCloskey and Oliver Collins, and at the back, Derry held both John Troy and Gary Hannfy scoreless. We came down here to win, said manager Kevin McNaughton. We know we are not that far away and I always thought we were in with a chance, we were hurling so well. googletag.cmd.push There was the feeling throughout the first half that Offaly always had the upper hand, but once McGonigle pounced for goals in the final quarter, the complexion of the contest changed. Brian Whelahan had been left out of the starting lineup due to a hamstring strain, but he was quickly pitched into service to shore up a leaky defense, and Joe Errity was also sent into the action. Their presence had the desired effect as Derry managed only two scores in the closing stages, while Offaly had five points and a vital goal by Brendan Murphy. Derry were five points in arrears at the changeover, but they had the advantage of the breeze to come. McGonigle got the first of his goals when he latched on to Kieran McKeever’s probing delivery, and then when Stephen Byrne made a save from John O’Dwyer’s shot, McGonigle was perfectly positioned to dispatch the rebound. We put in a hell of a performance, said Ollie Collins, who was forced out with injury during the second half. This our first time down here. I’m certain this team will be back at this stage of the competition and go better.

No matter where you go or who you are talking to up and down the country, they always ask about Roly. There is always someone who knows him or has played with or against him.The above paragraph was taken word for word from Drumaness Millsrsquos th anniversary booklet in . It captures brilliantly the essence of Roly lsquoThe Manrsquo.Roly died on Wednesday, March , sparking a deluge of tributes on social media. True gentleman, one in a million, what a lovely man, one and only Roly, top man, a legend mdash these tributes, among many others, appeared again and again.Roly was an integral part of village le in Drumaness, dandering to the bookies or the shop. He would make multiple stops to say hello to everyone he met, discussing the issues of the day.I have known him for a!most  years. He worked in Sam Bellrsquos egg factory across the road from St Josephrsquos Primary School in Crossgar. The workers would kick a ball about the road during their break and even to my untrained eye he was dferent class. It was my introduction to Roly lsquoThe Footballerrsquo.Some years later Roly and his brother, John, knocked on our door in Crossgar. They wanted me to play for the Mills in the Newcastle Summer League and I was more than happy to do so.Playing with Roly was a great education for a young player. He made football look easy, was stylish and talented, possessing the rare gt of keeping the game simple.Small wonder then that when talk comes around to the Millsrsquo greatest ever player, Roly is always in the conversation, despite competition from the likes of Robbie Strain, Osie Gelston, Conor Walsh and Davy Mills.Legend has it that in those days boys were born with boots on in Drumaness because this was a village where sport was king. So it was that Roly also excelled at billiards and cricket, reaching a very high standard in both.But football and the Mills were Rolyrsquos first loves and he rarely missed training or matches. Inevitably his talent came to the notice of Irish League managers and he enjoyed spells with Portadown and Cltonville in the early seventies. Nevertheless, Roly was a home bird and sooner or later he would pull on the Mills shirt again.By now I was playing for the all conquering Downpatrick Rec team of that era and we pitched up to a Border Cup final early in  to play the Mills. We had just won the Steel and Sons Cup and had our eyes firmly on the double, but Roly and Osie Gelston had other plans and proceeded to inspire the Mills to a famous - win.Roly had reached the twilight years of a glorious footballing career, but there was still time to lead the Mills reserves to another giant-killing act, beating Castlewellan in the Bobby Dalzell Cup final in .After such a stellar playing career, Roly was expected to become a manager. He did dip his toes in the managerial waters once or twice, but with no offence intended to the managerial fraternity mdash myself included mdash Roly was probably too nice to be a manager. In all the years I have known him I canrsquot remember him raising his voice. He was just so easy going, decent and level-headed.As a result people liked Roly and this popularity unsurprisingly proved to be an asset in his working le. After Sam Bells he spent a number of years working in the Co-Op shop in Drumaness before taking up employment with well-known butcher Vincy Doran.He was a familiar sight in Vincyrsquos van, delivering to hotels and restaurants, but it was his weekend door-to-door run which played to his strengths and further cemented his popularity.He became known as Butch or Butcher mdash a nickname he loved mdash and Vincy to this day has nothing but good things to say about Rolyrsquos eight-year stint with him.Rolyrsquos next stop was with Jimmy Quinn, who owned a bakery in Downpatrick. Jimmy shrewdly ed Roly to the door-to-door market and with people still finding it dficult to say no to the personable Roly, their successful liaison continued for  years.Jimmy likes nothing better than relating Roly stories,none of which can be repeated here, and like the rest of us he will remember Roly with the utmost fondness.Unfortunately Roly wasnrsquot immune to the ups and downs of le and deteriorating health curtailed his working le. He managed to fight and beat prostrate cancer a number of years ago, but this time around the lsquoBig Crsquo has claimed this lovely man.Ironically it was during these latter years that he seemed to be ever present on the streets of Drumaness, allowing him to befriend a generation entirely unaware of his past sporting prowess.Roly married Betty Rice on October , , and together they brought Noel, Pauline, Betty, Carol and Christine into the world. After almost  years together as a couple they remained best friends, as well as husband and we.Apart from my football connection to Roly, I have been his neighbour for  years and since his passing I have heard him described as lsquoMr Drumaness Millsrsquo, but for me he was Mr Drumaness full stop. This village will never be the same without him.Rolyrsquos family should be immensely proud of his impact on those who knew him and how sad it was to see coronavirus rob them and Roly of the fitting send-off he deserved.However, the good news is that I know there are plans afoot to have a celebration of his le when normality s. Nobody deserves it more. RIP Roly.Roly Hanna -.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Cormac.jpg","title":"Ardglass golfer on teeing up with the best in the world  ","story":"ARDGLASS golfer Cormac Sharvin could be forgiven for feeling understandably frustrated right now.The richly talented  year-old should be locking horns with some of the worldrsquos best players on the European tour.But instead of prowling the fairways hersquos holed up in his apartment in Dublin mdash like many others undergoing coronavirus lockdown.Itrsquos not how Sharvin, currently th in golfrsquos world rankings, thought his first season on the European Tour would go.Having secured his card for the  season by finishing th on the  Challenge Tour rankings, he was gearing up for a potential breakthrough campaign on the top circuit.However, after just four events, he is unsure of what the future holds as the sporting world goes into shutdown due to the coronavirus outbreak.He clearly appreciated that golf, and sport in general, is of minor importance when compared with the COVID pandemic.Of the decision to close all golf courses north and south of the border, he told the BBC recently: ldquoItrsquos a precaution that needs to be in place.I donrsquot know enough about the virus, but theyrsquore obviously trying to slow things down. Hopefully wersquoll be back playing as soon as possible, I think thatrsquos the goal.ldquoI think we just have to accept it and sit tight and when it does pass, we can get things moving a bit quicker.Certainly things have happened fairly quickly for Sharvin in his career to date. He only took up golf seriously relatively late in his teenage years, but went on to have glittering amateur career.In  he was a member of the Great Britain and Ireland Walker Cup team, contributing three points and remaining unbeaten in a .-. thumping of the United States.Sharvin turned  the following year and joined the ranks of the European Challenge Tour.Having missed his European Tour card by a single shot in , Sharvin relocated to Dublin and It proved to be the right move.He amassed eight top ten finishes in  starts to earn a rookie season on the European Tour thanks in large part to his six top fives.Sharvin only missed four cuts, two of which came in the first two events of the season, before he kickstarted his campaign with back-to-back top ten finishes.However, his best performance came at the Irish Open at Lahinch where he finished tied for th and was also the leading Irish golfer.He showed impressive consistency during the  season and proved his elite-level credentials with a tie for th finish at the Irish Open, ending the week as the leading home competitor.He says: I had a really good year, I put myself into contention a lot which was great. I think I was ready to take that step and I think the way I played, I deserved to get my card in the end with a few good results.ldquoI also managed to play well in a couple of European Tour events as well which showed me that I was ready to take that step. Therersquos a relief that I have my card now but itrsquos only the start of it mdash I know I have to keep improving and moving up the rankings.At the Irish Open he finished ahead of future Open champion Shane Lowry, Ryder Cup star Tommy Fleetwood former world number one Lee Westwood and Ryder Cup captain Padraig Harrington.ldquoIt was disappointing to shoot level-par on Sunday, but I feel like I didnrsquot do much wrong, he said.ldquoIt was really nice to have that pressure of going into the final round of a big European Tour event with a chance to win. It showed me where I was mentally and physically, that I was able to come from the Challenge Tour and compete in a top-level European Tour event.ldquoThat was an unbelievable week. The crowds were incredible and I attracted a big following being the leading Irishman, and that was a great feeling.ldquoItrsquos a nice feeling when hundreds of people are following you and everyone is willing your ball into the hole. I think that really geared me up quite a lot. It was a class buzz.ldquoIt was dficult going back to playing the Challenge Tour in the middle of nowhere in France the week after, but that week gave me the confidence to string together more good results to get off the Challenge Tour.Sharvin admits itrsquos been a slow start on the European Tour, with a tie for th in the Oman Open his bestin four starts this year, but his belief in being able to compete at the higher end of leaderboards remains undimmed.ldquoI feel like my game is good, but I havenrsquot really put all the facets together. ldquoI think in Oman I was second in strokes, gained tee-to-green and just putted really poorly. I played quite nicely in Qatar and just didnrsquot get it going.ldquoItrsquos obviously such a short period of time so itrsquos hard to assess in four events, but I feel like Irsquom close. This break may help me improve other things and hopefully Irsquom a better player when we start again.Given his Walker Cup experience, Sharvin would dearly love to play in the Ryder Cup in the years ahead.ldquoThe Ryder Cup would definitely be up there for me. I grew up playing team sports and have been involved with them my whole le, so that would be huge.ldquoI feel like Irsquom pretty good in a team and having tasted a little success in team sports, I think thatI can get my game to that level, Irsquod be a good asset in that sense..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Ballynahinch.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch singer performs at nursing homes  ","story":"A BALLYNAHINCH man is serenading residents in local nursing and residential homes through the COVID- crisis with hit songs to remind them of happier times.The gesture from popular singer Wayne Rodgers is even more laudable as he lost all his work overnight in the lockdown as a driving instructor and a wedding band performer.The  year-old performed outside four homes on Monday, delighting the residents and carers in Redburn Nursing Home, Oakridge Care Home, Spa Nursing Home and Fishbourne House Care Home.Performing classic hits from artists such as Jim Reeves and Clf Richards, Wayne believes his singing is helping strike a chord with the elderly residents who need to be kept apart from family members at this time.ldquoThe singing helps the residents and it really helps me too as it passes the time for me as my work has had to stop due to the virus, said Wayne, who now lives in Bellaghy.ldquoIrsquove received photographs taken from the inside of the home showing residents enjoying my songs and itrsquos lovely to see. It can get really emotional as there are now family members turning up to wave and talk to their relatives through windows while I sing.ldquoItrsquos heartfelt to see their enjoyment at being able to connect with their parents or grandparents inside. It can be heart-breaking at times but itrsquos still nice to see it.ldquoI have been told by some of the carers that they have seen some patients with dementia sing along to the music and thatrsquos also really good to know.A former soloist with St Patrickrsquos Church in Ballynahinch and ex-pupil of St Colmanrsquos High and Sixth Form College, Wayne ensures he keeps the residents and carers safe at all times.A long extension power lead from the home is laid for him before he arrives so he can plug in his mixing desk, microphone and laptop.Wayne said: ldquoItrsquos sterilised before I get it and when I had it back itrsquos sterilised again so I have no direct contact with anyone in the home.ldquoI try not to sing beyond  minutes as the homes often open the windows to allow residents to hear better and Irsquom conscious of not wanting anyone to get too cold in the process.Wayne started off singing at a Magherafelt nursing home when a pub owner hersquos friendly with was approached by the home asking for suggestions at how they could entertain the residents.He added: ldquoThe residents in the home loved it and asked me to come back again so I did and then I got calls from other homes.He now has nine performances under his belt with the help of his brother-in-law, former Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairman Mark Murnin, and his sister, Michelle, who runs Paddy Kellyrsquos Bar in Ballynahinch.Wayne, whose parents Maurice and Naveen still live in Ballynahinch, has been a show band singer for years and once performed with the legendary Sunshine.Gigs for his wedding band, The All Stars, have been cancelled or postponed as couples were force to rebook their wedding dates.Wayne is performing free of charge and says he is happy to as it gives him some focus in his le at this time.ldquoI donrsquot have much  to do as work has stopped, but I do feel a lot better knowing that Irsquom bringing some happiness to others, he added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Binmen.jpg","title":"Binmen receiving thank you messages for essential work  ","story":"THE districtrsquos binmen have been thanked for continuing to provide collection services during the coronavirus pandemic.Some people have been pasting messages on their bins thanking the men for the job they are doing, while their efforts have also been commended by Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairman Charlie Casey.Working in extremely dficult circumstances, the binmen are providing a critical service at this time and their efforts have not gone unnoticed by ratepayers who taking time to wipe the handles of their bins with disinfectant before they are collected to help keep refuse staff safe.Householders are also being reminded to ensure that they continue to place the correct waste in the right bin to help ease the burden on public health services to help stop additional risks to staff who are working under increasing pressure.Refuse collection staff have been singled out for particular praise as they collect and transport waste, with their work also helping to protect the environment.Stormont environment minister Edwin Poots said the materials refuse staff collect for processing such as cardboard, plastic and glass are vital resources in package production across the food and retail sectors, explaining that ain recycling could impact on the supply chain ing effectively.He added: ldquoAll those working in the waste sector are key workers and I have also established a COVID- Waste Group to provide support, guidance and regulatory direction to the waste sector.Newry, Mourne and Down Council mdash which recently closed all its household recycling centres to redeploy staff to work in refuse collection mdash said that all bin collections continue as normal.However, residents are asked to provide additional help by ensuring that bins are put out for collection no later than am every morning or the night before.Where possible, residents are asked not to restrict bin lorry access and park as considerately as possible. Over recent weeks, binmen have experienced issues accessing homes in a number of areas including Ballynahinch and Newcastle to collect bins.Residents are also asked to ensure that all bin handles are cleaned or wiped-down before and after use and not to approach refuse staff without following the minimum two-metre social distancing guidance.Commending refuse staff for the work they are doing in dficult circumstances, the council chairman explained that as the coronavirus crisis unfolded, the local authority was quick to implement a number of health and safety measures to protect staff.He explained that the measures allowed bin collection teams to continue the service with minimal disruptions to residents.ldquoCrews now operate staggered start times between .am and am and are authorised to leave work immediately upon the completion of their rounds, said Cllr Casey.ldquoTo support social distancing, crews are restricted to one driver and one loader in each cab.

It is certainly a strange experience for me.I was ordained in  in Downpatrick. New technologies and new means of communication came after that, and Irsquove struggled ever since. So the recent experience of having to install web-cams at short notice into the three churches in my two parishes of Portaferry and Ballygalget, has been somewhat traumatic.This week is the holiest of weeks for Christians. The passion and death of Jesus is commemorated, in preparation for the resurrection on Easter Sunday. We celebrate this in ious ways. We might well ask ourselves what happened to Lent and how on earth do we celebrate what will seem like a lsquovirtualrsquo Easter Coronavirus suddenly intruded into our Lent, at close quarters, and changed everything.My mother still remembers the glow in the sky over Belfast, when from her home in Ballykinlar, she heard the planes over South Down on their way to blitz Belfast. No doubt her grandmother would have told stories of the terrible pandemic of Spanish Influenza just over a century ago.But my generation and that of my nieces and nephews have known little of such things and we experience this pandemic a grave threat.At the moment of writing, the streets of Portaferry and Downpatrick are entirely empty, as are the great cities of Rome, London and New York.The unexpected severity of lockdown leaves us feeling bewildered, disorientated, shell-shocked. We are acutely aware of the suffering around us mdash illness, hospitalisation, loneliness in sudden isolation. As schools close we are anxious about increased tension in family le. The loss of our work and leisure patterns, financial and employment worries.In the Old Testament Jobloses so much of what he had mdash health, family, possessions and friends mdash yet he refuses to rebel against God in his suffering. This is incredibly dficult for most of us. His attitude of acceptance of his suffering can be of help to us. He says: ldquoShall we receive the good at the hand of God, and not take the bad Jobrsquos story can be useful to us at present. If you can get a chance, read it.Lent mdash an old English word for spring mdash is more challenging this year than we ever expected. As we celebrate Holy Week here are two words that figure in the writings of Henri Nouwen, a Dutch spiritual writer, that I find useful.The first word is security. Where do we look in our lives for security. A basic human need  In success, popularity, money, friends, family, insurance and so on  We mightnrsquot think we do. We will always be influenced by them, but deep down they will never provide us with security.Many of those things are good in themselves, but spiritually, the only true security will be found in the everlasting love of the One who loved us first and who wishes to love us into and for all eternity. Job understood that mdash security.The second word is patience. Patience means a kind of ldquosuffering through the present. Itrsquos from the Latin, patior, which means to suffer. But being patient does not mean sitting back and doing nothing. It is not being passive. Having patience is not easy for us. How do we wait patiently for God this Holy Week, Easter and beyond during this world pandemic Being patient is an active waiting mdash it means a certain experience of suffering through the present moment. To let the seeds of our suffering be sown in the ground so as to grow later into healthy, strong plants.It means avoiding the dead-end of what could have been for the ability to pay attention to what is happening before our very eyes, paying attention to the people and world around us. By that patience, we can begin to catch a glimpse of the first rays of Godrsquos glorious coming.Last week, I personally saw those first rays when I witnessed the staff in a residential nursing home in Portaferry decide to live-in with the residents for as long as this emergency would last.This week I witnessed those first rays when a cousin, a retired doctor, rang me to tell me he was volunteering toto work to bolster the Health Service.In one way or another have we not all been privileged to witness the generosity of spirit, despite danger, of those carers, nurses, doctors, medics, ancillary staff and many others Might this not be for us another glimpse that helps us experience in our present circumstances that Christ is indeed risen and lives now among us  It certainly is a glimpse for me.The Old Testament reading for many of us on Sunday last was from Ezekiel. ldquoThe Lord says this: I am going to open your graves. I mean to raise you from your graves and lead you back to the soil of Israel. I shall put my spirit in you, and you will live, and will know that I, the Lord, have said and done this it is the Lord who speaks.The people of Ezekielrsquos time knew their frailty and experienced uncertainty as we do today. Their faith in God had been severely shaken. Could they start again Security, patience, maybe these two words might stay with us over the next while as the reason for the hope that we have I leave you with the words of a psalm, which St Patrick himself echoed in his own writings, his lsquoConfessionrsquo.The words encourage us to place our hope in the Son of God who will sustain and strengthen us in our days, the Son of God, Jesus, who knew what it was like to stumble and fall beneath the weight of the Cross. With these words I ask God to bless us and keep us safe:ldquoI waited, I waited for the Lord and He stooped down to me, He heard my cry. He drew me from the deadly pit, from the miry clay. He set my foot upon a rock, and made my footsteps firm.With security and patience we can put our trust in the fallen saviour..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Huge.jpg","title":"Huge boost for foodbanks  ","story":"THE districtrsquos foodbanks have been provided with a pound, boost by Newry, Mourne and Down Council to help them respond to increasing need during the coronavirus pandemic.The funding has been provided via the local authorityrsquos community network and is one of a series of initiatives the local authority is spearheading to continue providing a range of frontline services and responding to the needs of the vulnerable and elderly in particular.This week, residents across the district have been thanked for adhering to advice to help stop the spread of coronavirus by staying indoors and keeping safe.And, as the Easter weekend approaches, council chief executive Marie Ward has appealed to people to continue to listen to the advice to stay at home and save lives.

","story":"AMBITIOUS plans to redevelop Ardglass harbour could cost in the region of poundm, a new report has revealed.The figure is contained in a detailed consultants report commissioned to undertake an in-depth feasibility study to look at potential developments for the harbour which is home to Northern Irelandrsquos third largest fishing fleet.The key issue the consultants focused on was deepening the harbour to facilitate larger vessels, with work also undertaken to look at improving harbour conditions, berthing pontoons for smaller vessels and increased berthing facilities.In addition, the study included a comprehensive review of possible harbour layouts, historic document research, topographic and bathymetric harbour surveys, quay wall inspection above and below the waterline and computermodelling.The consultants also liaised with the Department for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairswhich has been given a copy of the consultants report ahead of further discussions with its officials on the way forward.Ardglass has the only all-weather harbour between Howth and Bangor and has three primary areas including the so-called fish dock within the south pier.There is also the Phennick Cove marina located behind a breakwater mdash which could be extended mdash to the west of the main harbour which can accommodate up to  leisure craft and the inner harbour which dries out at low tide.The consultants say that the inner harbour is particularly useful for vessel maintenance but not utilised as extensively as the outer harbour due to limited water depth.Last August, ious concept layouts produced by consultants were reviewed by members of the Ardglass Harbour Developments group which has been set up to oversee the regeneration of the port. The concepts were subsequently amended in November.The prime focus is on deepening the harbour and moving forward, a cost effective approach may be to zone dredge levels in particular areas.The report suggests deepening the outer harbour by nine metres and the area adjacent to Cochranersquos building at the inner harbour by two metres to facilitate crab vessels.In addition, consideration is being given to creating a pontoon with so-called finger berths adjacent to the quay wall in front of Cochranersquos with gangway access for crab vessels. No leisure craft would be permitted at this part of the harbour.Removal of the existing slipway at the southern end of the harbour adjacent to the beach is suggested as it is not generally used and considered too deep for access, with potential issues in relation to the removal of an area know as Church Rock to be investigated.Quay reclamation work is suggested between the north west corner of the existing finger pier at the ice plant and north western tip of the fish market quay.This would feature a new piled quay, backfilled and surfaced with a heavy duty concrete. Extending theof the quay wall by  metres is also suggested.The estimated cost of the harbour dredging is in the region of pound, with piling work and the new quay line and reclamation work estimated at poundm and poundm respectively.The breakwater extension is estimated at pound.m with the new pontoon facility estimated at pound,.The consultantsrsquo report makes it clear that the costings include primary construction elements but does not include licensing fees, site investigation, engineering design and tendering costs.Before anything happens, a marine licence is required for specic site investigation work, rock quality design and testing, sediment sampling of overburden, contamination testing and an environmental impact assessment.The regeneration jigsaw also requires detailed design work and planning approval ahead of tendering and construction.An economic appraisal may also be required.News of the proposed investment at Ardglass harbour comes after the portrsquos importance to the Ardglass fishing industry to the district and wider South Down economy was highlighted during a recent meeting with Stormont fisheries minister Edwin Poots.He met with South Down MLA Colin McGrath and local councillor Dermot Curran to discuss planned improvement work at the harbour, with the politicians also highlighting the need for additional investment in the harbour and its infrastructure.They described Ardglass harbour as ldquostrategically important for the Co Down fishing fleet, highlighting its crucial role in driving the South Down economy and its location as a central hub for processing fish landed at the port.Mr McGrath and Cllr Curran say further investment is ldquocritical to allow Ardglass harbour to expand to provide an economic boost, not only for the village but the wider area, and create new jobs..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Mourning.jpg","title":"Please stay in  ","story":"ldquoHE was my superman ndash the moving words from Loughinisland woman Maria Farrell whose father sadly lost his battle with COVID-.As her sister also lies in hospital fighting the virus, the mother-of-two has bravely spoken out to warn others not to be complacent about the deadly disease.Maria, who buried her father on Sunday, warned: ldquoIf you think you are exempt from this or you are immune to COVID-, you are barking up the wrong tree.ldquoMy dad went really quickly, hersquos tackled prostate cancer, heart attacks, falls, you name ithellip and hersquos bounced back.

He also highlighted the need for financial support for the southern relief road scheme in Newry.ldquoI fully understand that the roads minister has a lot on her plate and recognise that she is not responsible for the failure of her department to invest in any major road scheme in the local area over the past number of decades, he continued. ldquoThe bypass should be in place by now. Itrsquos potential for Ballynahinch and the wider South Down economy is immense.ldquoThe multi-million pound road scheme can rid Ballynahinch of its traffic nightmare, help rejuvenate the town and encourage more visitors into the district and wider Mournes area.South Down MP Chris Hazzard signed off the eagerly-awaited bypass in December  when hewas roads minister in a previous Executive.The by-pass, which would be the single biggest road scheme ever constructed in the district, is expected to take in excess of  months to build, with roads officials insisting that it will greatly benefit both strategic and local road users by reducing journey times and improving road safety.Major new roundabouts are proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road, with a new bridge constructed over the Moss Road.It is also proposed that a section of the by-pass will pass under part of the Crossgar Road with a  metre long bridge constructed to take traffic over Ballynahinch River.Overtaking lanes stretching almost  metres are proposed at either end of the by-pass where major new roundabouts are to be constructed, with the scheme also including a shared footpath and cycle lane..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Recognition.jpg","title":"Recognition for poet Stephen  ","story":"A BALLYGOWAN poet is celebrating after his debut anthology was recognised by two major awarding bodies.Stephen Sextonrsquos If All the World and Love Were Young was awarded the highly acclaimed American E M Forester Award which was previously won by Seamus Heaney in .His anthology, published by Penguin Books, was also shortlisted for this yearrsquos Shine Strong Award ndash an award presented annually to the author of the best first collection of poems published by an Irish poet.Stephen says his work centres on coming to terms with the death of his mother, Elizabeth, who passed away in .He said: ldquoI started writing a book of poems that initially were meant to be frivolous and entertaining.ldquoHowever, as I began writing, the intense grief I was battling at the time came to the fore.Critics say what developed was a touching tribute to his mother which they described as a moving narrative exploring bereavement, family le, memories and loss.The judging  consisted of poets Colum McCann, Jhumpa Lahiri and Paul Muldoon.As part of his prize fund for winning the highly acclaimed award, Stephen received , to travel and stay in the United States.Downpatrick poet Damian Smyth, head of literature at the Arts Council of Northern Ireland, congratulated Stephen on his award.He said: ldquoThe sense is quickly growing on both sides of the Atlantic that Stephen Sexton is already one of those rare poets whose obvious and prodigious lyrical gts are matched both by accessibility and universality.He added: ldquoIt is poignant that the person for whom the whole book is an elegy ndash his late mother mdashnever lived to see the acclaim lavished on her son.ldquoHowever, there are few contemporary works which describe the human processes of grief, loss, hurt and how love survives and endures as memorably and as movingly as this one, with virtuoso technique and profound wisdom, which I have to say is already a classic.

I have been transported to a time that has changed my perception of le forever.People with CF have a faulty gene which means the mucus in their bodies is much thicker and stickier than in other people.They donrsquot catch viruses more easily than other people but when they do, it affects their lungs by causing inflammation and increasing the amount of the sticky mucus. This makes bacterial chest infections more likely, some of which are resistant to antibiotics, leading to a decline in lungwhich is the leading cause of death in people with CF.As parents, for the first sixth months of Lorcaacutenrsquos le we were consumed with the fear. We were advised not to visit baby groups, not to let people with colds into the house, not to take him to the supermarket on a weekend when it was busy, not to let him play in soil, wet sand, or day-old playdough as well as taking many, many more precautions to keep him safe.We also discovered that my mother-in-lawrsquos COPD and my fatherrsquos bronchiectasis meant that Lorcaacuten would always have to be careful around his beloved Nana and Grandad in case he caught an infection from them. For the same reason, he could never be within six feet of someone  with CF because of the risk of cross infection. My world would never mdash could never mdash be the same.We rarely left the house. I gave up my job in the RSPB and postponed my studies. Much of our time was taken up with the heavy burden of treatment for CF, including daily physiotherapy and antibiotics. I spent a lot of time campaigning for a cystic fibrosis drug, Orkambi, to be made available on the NHS.And I cried a lot.Over the last three years, le has become more lsquonormalrsquo but beneath the joy of every milestone has been the fear of taking risks that could shorten Lorcaacutenrsquos le at any time.During this time we have learnt that there are some risks you need to take in order to be happy. Lorcaacuten began pre-school as well as swimming, gymnastics, and football classes and I resumed my studies and began working a few hours a week.There has been a lot of stress and sleepless nights, a lot of handwashing, and a lot of happiness. With the support of the public we won the campaign for Orkambi, a drug which can slow the decline in lungby up to % and can be taken by around half of people with CF. Lorcaacuten started taking it at the end of last December mdash the champagne was popped and finally we thought we could start to relax a little.Sadly it wasnrsquot for long. During the wait for Orkambi, Lorcaacutenrsquos lungs had become damaged, after catching a couple of colds in March, he ended up in the wonderful Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children for  days of IV antibiotics to treat a long standing chest infection.During those  days I watched the horrying news that COVID- was spreading. I grew ever more disturbed at the lack of action by the UK Government. How could our amazing health service, stripped bare by  years of austerity and cuts, possibly hold up under the strain of COVID- Lorcaacuten was moved to a room further away from other patients, masks appeared and I watched the eyes of the incredible staff in the hospital become more and more tense.With nearly every death I read that the patient was either elderly or had an underlying health condition. But why did that make it OK: Surely that made it worse  The message seemed to be that lsquoonlyrsquo the vulnerable were at risk but other peoplersquos lsquoonlyrsquo is my everything.As the days in hospital passed, I learned that the lung conditions of my son, mother-in-law, and father put them among the , in NI on the extremely vulnerable list. They would need to lsquoshieldrsquo for the next  weeks. Shielding means not leaving the house at all and having to rely on the government and the goodness of others to deliver medication and food to your door.When Lorcaacuten was able to leave the hospital, we arrived home mdash with great relief mdash to a lockdown. Once again, with no job to go to and my studies on hold, I am transported to those months of isolation three years ago.This time, however, it is dferent, because this time I have hope. For us, this too shall pass. We willto the normality so hard won in our lives. We, unlike so many others who will lose their lives, will have this as a memory to pass on. I let so much of Lorcaacutenrsquos infancy be marred by fear that I just canrsquot let it happen now. Every day I am thankful for my good fortune in a desperately unfair world. I am thankful for all the frontline workers and volunteers, for the Executive finally working together for the common good to sustain us and to protect the most vulnerable in society, for the kindness of people delivering food and medication to those most at risk.I am grateful to the other souls sitting in their homes feeling helpless and feeling like le is passing them by. But by feeling helpless we are helping more people have a le toto after this all ends.It will end but the world will never mdash can never mdash be the same and none of us will look at it in the same way either.Maybe it will be a world in which those who need support will begin to get it, a world in which our NHS will finally be built up rather than worn down, a world we protect rather than profit from. As I watch Lorcaacuten run happily and healthily around our safe home with his little sister, Saorla, I donrsquot feel fear for him. I feel fear for those putting their lives at risk for all of us, for those who will lose their lives and loved ones, and for those who are sitting in their homes feeling afraid.I often think that doing nothing is the hardest thing to do, but for the moment doing otherwise is a risk too great to take, for us all. If you can, embrace the cotton wool,only for a while..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Workload.jpg","title":"Workload up for Good Morning Down staff  ","story":"THE Good Morning Down charity which provides a telephone befriending service to elderly and vulnerable people across the district has increased the number of calls it makes as the coronavirus takes hold.Volunteers who work for highly acclaimed charity mdash now in its th year mdash have relocated from the organisationrsquos base at the Down Business Park in Downpatrick to their homes to ensure that the friendly voices people have come to rely on continue to be heard.Good Morning Down has also confirmed that in addition to increasing the number of calls that it makes, it has moved some people off the servicersquos waiting list in order that they can receive a call at this worrying time.Since it launch in , Good Morning Down has supported over  people with a wide range of disabilities and needs and the service it provides to people who live alone has never been more important.While there is concern among the senior citizens they contact and who have been advised to remain in doors for the foreseeable future, there is also great stoicism, with several able to recall hardships that they had to endure during World War Two.Staffed by  volunteers, the charity normally makes around  calls between Monday and Friday but the number has increased to help reassure elderly and vulnerable people that they are not alone.Relocating staff away from their main hub at Innovation House, the charity is unable to pick up any messages that may be left on the Good Morning Down answering machine. To help overcome this a new mobile telephone number is available mdash  .Good Morning Down was established to help reduce loneliness and isolation.

In the main, he said they are relying on the television and radio.ldquoWe are letting them know what is happening and reinforcing the message to stay indoors and not let anyone into their home, even their own relatives. We are highlighting the importance of them doing all that they can not to catch the virus, the charity volunteer continued.ldquoPeople are very concerned at what is going on and many of those whom we contact used to get out to attend ious clubs but they have all closed due to the pandemic which means the elderly and vulnerable are spending even longer alone in their homes.Aidan also revealed that some who normally received only one call a week are now getting several more, with people brought off the waiting list so they can be contacted.He also revealed that the charity is also providing the people they contact with details about local shops which are providing a delivery service.ldquoWe are emphasising the hand hygiene message as much as we can and reminding people to stay indoors. We are also telling them to exercise social distancing and not let anyone into their homes, he said.ldquoWe are also telling those whom we contact not even to let one of their neighbours over the door as it is simply too risky. The people whom we contact are very concerned about what is going on but they are made of stern stuff.Aidan added: ldquoAll the volunteers are working hard to make sure we maintain contact with our clients, more regularly than in the past by increasing the number of calls we make to them.ldquoThe reward is how grateful they are for the service we provide and our main goal is do all we can to let them know that we are here for them and want them to keep safe..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/18336251.online-charity-concert-great-success-says-nathan/resources/images/11180294.jpg","title":"latest figures reveal island trend","story":"Latest statistics show that in the Fermanagh and Omagh District region the number of positive cases rose to  with a total of  positive cases across Northern Ireland.Health Minister, Robin Swann explained that there is likely to be a second surge of the virus later in the year: ldquoEven then, a reasonable worst case scenario would involve signicant loss of le in Northern Ireland.

Performance of the Oberammergau Passion Play : Freelance“The nd Oberammergau Passion Play will be postponed due to the current situation caused by the corona pandemic.”In the Baian district of Germany, beside the Ammer River and framed by the Ammergau Alps, Oberammergau is a small town known for its woodcarvings, its NATO School and its internationally renowned -yearly Passion Play.The organisers of the Passion Play summarised the historical signicance of the postponement, explaining that the event “goes back to a vow made in . At that time, the people of Oberammergau vowed to perform the suffering, death and resurrection of Christ,no one died of the plague anymore.Engraving depicting the Passion Play in  : Freelance \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Therefore the plans to perform the Passion Play in  are currently beginning.”Held in the ‘decimal year’I attended a performance in , one of the most vivid and moving experiences of my letime, and indeed, I had toyed with the thought of ing this year.There would have been  performancesstarting in mid-May with an expected , visitors from around the globe paying between € to € for a ticket.The enormous production has been running since  except for two cancellations and a postponement.Crucixion scene in the Passion Play in  : FreelanceNearly half of the , residents of today’s Oberammergau are involved with the show - actors, musicians, front of house, backstage and looking after the horses, sheep, goats, cows and doves that add to the often intensely dramatic scenes.The other half of the townsfolk run the restaurants, shops, hotels, BBs and farmsteads where many of the visitors stay,they’re lucky.The nearest accommodation I could get in  was St. Anton am Arlberg in the Austrian Tirol.Participants in the production must have been born in Oberammergau or have lived there for  years.Oberammergau on the River Ammer in  : FreelanceIt’s not unusual for up to four generations of the same family to be taking part in the same run of plays, which can involve around  children on stage at the same time.In the th century, passion plays were held in many parts of Europe, often performed on carts in the street.They re-enacted Christ’s last days, from his entry into Jerusalem to his trial, crucixion, resurrection and ascension.In the bigger and more elaborate productions, when scene one ended the cart trundled off to another part of the town or city and scene two arrived, and so on!They were the ‘poor man’s Bible’ enabling even the most illiterate become familiar with Bible stories.But Oberammergau’s is the only play with its origins in a collective vow to God which has run, almost without a break, for approaching four centuries. This unique double-accolade brought the town a UNESCO World Heritage award.It’s quite likely that passion plays were already common events but a document in Oberammergau’s archives records “the first decades of the th century went by in peaceful calm…but then followed the Thirty Years’ War with all its hardships from  until . As early as , infectious diseases spread in Baia. This village was spared by dutul vigilance until the church festival in , when a man brought the plague into the village.”More than  local folk died and almost every family lost loved ones.“Faced with the great distress that the terrible illness inflicted upon the population,” the archive continues, “the leaders of the community came together and pledged to hold a passion tragedy once every ten years. From this day forward, not a single person perished, even though a great number of them still showed signs of the plague”.They made the pledge in  and the Passion Play was first performed at Pentecost in , on a wooden stage that some say was built on plague-victims’ graves near the church.Surviving documentation from the  production shows that the play ran ‘completed smoothly’ with seating provided ‘for spectators standing close by.’From  the date of the performance was changed to the beginning of each decade, by which time folk were coming from all over Germany to see substantial productions.Paint and painters for the  show’s scenery cost  guilders, ‘the gentlemen trumpeters’ got two guilders and  guilders went ‘to the actors for drink’!There was no performance in  when Maximilian III’s Clerical Council banned all passion plays and when another threat loomed in the s the so-called ‘mad’ King Ludwig II of Baia protected it from those who wanted to close down the ‘harmful’ passion plays. Following WWI the play was postponed until , and there was a special th anniversary show in  attended by Adolf Hitler.There were no performances in  during WWII, just the second cancellation…until now.Plans to perform the Passion Play in  are already under way, for over  five-hour shows, several thousand participants, a -strong orchestra and a -strong choir.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

The story of the Exodus from slavery in Egypt is told from generation to generation and the symbols of unleavened bread , wine and other items are are consumed as Jewish families recall the Ten Plagues, following positively by the Ten Commandments, and the crossing of the Red Sea followed by the crossing into the Promised Land .At its essence it is about the relationship between God and His people and how they experienced ine intervention and protection, most notably being spared the Destroyer or Angel of Death as it swept through Egypt killing every firstborn child and even animals after Pharoah refused to let the Hebrews go. The instruction was to daub blood from an unblemished lamb on the lintel and door posts of their homes thus when the Destroyer “passed over” the Israelites would escape the fate of the Egyptians, who had just previously tried to kill the first born Jewish babies.  \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Egypt had been ravished by pestilence and plagues galore and the country was devastated as a result. In the end the stubborn Pharaoh lets the people of Israel go. There are similarities with this classic story from the Bible and events today with the ‘plague’ of coronavirus and so many people having to stay in their homes till the danger has passed. We know in the end the final outcome was one of overcoming and redemption. We do hope for that too in the present situation which has come upon so many countries in almost ‘Biblical’ proportions.The Last Supper of Jesus which many Christians commemorate at this time of year was that same Passover meal that featured the unleavened bread and wine and the telling of God’s redemption from slavery through the shedding of the blood of the Passover lamb. The New Testament says, “Christ our ‘Passover’ was shed for us, therefore let us keep the Feast ” which the early Jewish Christians did to remember His death on this date. This was later changed to a day of the week rather than the actual date and so the two no longer link up, except for early Christians like St Patrick and other early pre-Roman churches. We can be mindful of these things this Passover, with both Jews and Christians in their homes while their places of worship remain closed. There is enough rich symbolism to satisfy both faiths. It may even bring some understanding between them as they both recall redemption and deliverance.Colin Nevin, Kosher chef, King Solomon Restaurant, Hilton Tel-Aviv, Israel -"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus we are keeping london loop insists ni ministry amid claims solo run buy ppe gear ","story":"Heartbreaking picture reveals emptiness for daughter after mother dies with COVID- - appeal for people to understand the reality of illnessCoronavirus: Pro rata, NI has fewer deaths than RoI or GB – but big caveatsNewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensCoronavirusNewsPoliticsCoronavirus: ‘We are keeping London in the loop’ insists NI ministry amid claims of a solo run to buy PPE gearThe Department of Health says it has kept the London government abreast of a planned personal protective equipmentorder from China, following a report that the Province is ignoring centralised UK-wide buying arrangements.By Adam KulaFriday, th April , : pm\"\"Medical staff put on their PPE on Tuesday at an MOT testing centre in Belfast which is being used as a drive through testing location for Covid- : PA Wire PA ImagesIt was reacting to a story broken by the Nolan Show today, that a £m deal for PPE is now in the pipeline for Northern Ireland – but that it could be coming direct from China not via a UK-wide deal.It comes after over five million pieces of PPEwere shipped into the Province from Liverpool last week as part of an arrangement with the London government.It also comes a week after a joint north-south Irish deal for PPE –which had been touted by Sinn Fein finance minister Conor Murphy – flopped spectacularly a week ago, resulting in nothing being sent to Northern Ireland.The Nolan Show referred to documentation which it said its journalists had obtained about the new deal – which the BBC said could happen on Tuesday, April , and would involve scores of millions of items of PPE. \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

All the normal elements you would find in a Presbyterian service are there. It takes a bit of the pressure off the local ministers, hopefully”He continued: “When you see the numbers of people who are watching it, there’s never been more. I’ve been surprised. I did a little tiny clip on Facebook and there were , hits in a very small time.“And you’re getting people on the far side of the world watching as well.“I simply go into the building and record all the spoken bits — the prayers, the reading, and a kids’ talks.“ I choose my songs but I’m using the material going back to or three years, which has already been recorded. But it’s video. So you can pan back and see the congregation so there’s a connection that this is what we used to do.”But the clergyman admits it is a “bizarre” experience preaching to an empty church building.He explained: “When you’re in a building that normally seats  and there’s nobody  in there except for the cameraman, it is a completely bizarre experience. “You miss the interaction with people. A preacher interacts with his people. “It lacks a bit of that but you try to make it as normal as possible.”But while everyone will be hoping the coronavirus crisis passes sooner rather than later, Rev Henry believes the streaming technology has shown its merits.“I would imagine that any congregation who has dipped their toe in with all of this will want to develop itbecause they will see the reach that it has.”He continued: “They will want to develop their journey with that. “You have people working away from home, even people on holidays and students are still connecting with their home Church.”\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

It will cut planned capital spending to pound million from a budget of pound million and will work to grow online.MS said in a statement: \"Whilst we remain confident that the post-crisis future of the business and our transformation programme remains as strong as ever, trading over the next nine to  months in our clothing and home and international businesses is likely to be severely impacted.\"As a result, it is not possible to provide meaningful guidance on future earnings, although we are taking every step to secure future value for shareholders, colleagues and suppliers.\"The chairman of Wetherspoon has said that a decline in sales was accelerated when prime minister Boris Johnson told people to stay away from pubs.After rising in previous weeks, sales fell by . per cent in the week to March  and the slowdown has picked up further since the Prime Ministers statement, Tim Martin said.It came as the business reported profit before tax rose  per cent to pound. million in the half-year to January  on revenue of pound million.Health secretary Matt Hancock has warned that coronavirus will keep spreading as long as people continue to socialise.Speaking on talkRadio, Mr Hancock said: \"If you stay at home you are saving lives.\"I know, of course, this is a more dangerous disease for older people but not exclusively, some young people get it too.\"But, more importantly, the more that people continue to go out and continue to socialise, the more it will spread and the longer were going to have to keep these measures in place.\"So, were urging people to follow the public health advice.In the emergency Bill thats in front of Parliament right now, we are taking the powers to be able to enforce these measures, so we can make it happen by lawwe need to.\"Id rather not do that and the evidence so far is that the vast majority of people are following the advice, are doing what is sensible and right.\"The company said it was cancelling its interim idend, which had been p a year earlier.Mr Martin said: \"It is obviously very dficult to predict, in these circumstances, how events will unfold in future weeks and months, but we now anticipate profits being below market expectations, so long as the current health scare continues.\"As a result of this uncertainty, it is impossible to provide realistic guidance on our performance in the remainder of the financial year.\"The company has decided to delay most capital projects and to reduce expenditure, where possible, including the cancellation of the interim idend.\"As a result of these actions, combined with the Governments proposals on business rates relief and credit guarantee facilities, the company believes it has sufficient liquidity to maintain operations at a substantially lower level of sales.\"Nicola Sturgeon has urged anyone who left the medical profession in the past three years to consider ing to help the fight against coronavirus.Sharing a plea from Scotlands chief nursing officer Fiona McQueen, the First minister tweeted: \"Scotlands NHS needs our help to meet the #coronavirus challenge.\"Mr Hancock said some retired medics whoto work in the NHS to fight the coronavirus will be able to come \"straight back in\".Asked on the BBCs Breakfast programme when workers couldto the NHS, he said: \"Well, over the next couple of weeks because for some theyll have very recently left and they can come straight back in, their annual trainings been up-to-date and they can just restart.\"Imagineyouve left at Christmas, for instance, you can restart straight away. For others who have been out for a little bit longer, they may need more of a refresher because, of course, its vital that we keep people safe, thats the whole point of the NHS.\"So the letter will go out today, well then be engaging inidually with all those who respond and I very much hope that many, many thousands will respond.\"From those Ive talked to, I think people can see just how important this is. The training will happen for those who need it over the next couple of weeks, at the same time well allocate people to a hospital near them because theres a logistical exercise here as well.\"Mr Hancock suggested that tougher measures could have to be brought inpeople do not follow the Governments advice.He told the BBCs Breakfast programme: \"What I can say is thatpeople follow the advice, stay home which saves lives andthey keep apart from others, more than two metres, more than six foot, then we can tackle this and we can turn the tide.\"The scientists advise that we can turn the tide in  weekspeople follow the advice.\"If people dont follow the advice, then itll be longer and we might have to bring more and tougher measures.\"He added: \"We have brought these measures in earlier than Italy did in terms of where theyre up to with the number of cases.\"But were absolutely clear thatwe need to, we have the powers, in fact weve got a Bill in front of Parliament now to strengthen those powers further.\"But I think its far betterpeople follow the advice.\"The FTSE  has risen by more than five per cent in early trading as travel companies jump out ahead after a bruising few weeks for the sector sparked by the Covid- pandemic.Intercontinental Hotels jumped by about a fth despite revealing that demand for rooms was the worst it had ever seen, as markets opened on Friday.EasyJet also rose by around  per cent and cruise operator Carnival jumped by around . per cent.Meanwhile, the price of a barrel of Brent crude oil joined the rally, rising five per cent to . dollarsafter a massive fall earlier in the week.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has warned about the prospect of a recessionpeople do not receive their wages.Labour has urged the Government to ensure the salaries of workers are protected as businesses lose trade during the coronavirus pandemic.He told the BBCs Breakfast programme: \"We need the Government now to act to protect people to keep them in their jobs.\"In that way, what well be able to do is ensure people have an income coming in, their job will be protected, but we prevent the second wave of a recession hitting uswere not careful.\"Becausepeople lose their jobs, they dont have their wages, demand collapses in the economy and then you really do have a recession.\"The lesson from past crises like these is act fast and act big, so thats why were saying the Government should step in and say to employers, well cover  per cent of your wages, you keep people in work.\"Demand for a room at Intercontinental Hotels has reached its lowest point in history, the group said, as the travel industry continues to be battered by the coronavirus pandemic.The business revealed that it would be cutting costs, eliminating its idend and reducing salaries in a bid to save cash.However, shares in the group, which have been badly hit in recent months, jumped by around  per cent on market open in London as investors reacted positively to the companys proposals.Chief executive Keith Barr said: \"Demand for hotels is currently at the lowest levels weve ever seen.Intercontinental Hotel Group has a robust business model and the measures we are announcing today to reduce costs and preserve cash give us the capacity to manage the business through this unique environment and to support our owners during this incredibly dficult time.\"These were not easy choices and we are mindful of the impact these decisions will have on our colleagues and shareholders.\"However, we believe that these are essential to ensuring that we come out of this as strong as we possibly can and ready to capitalise on what remains an industry with excellent long-term growth potential.\"Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders , said the list of key workers to whom schools will remain open is \"perhaps more extensive than we might have expected\".He said: \"Realistically, theywill need to identy these children by lunchtime.\"Mr Barton added: \"We already know from the trajectory of this that were not going to have many staff.\"We have to be careful that the message to parents is not business as usual.\"Matt Hancock said that a communication will be sent to around . million people who are classed as vulnerable to set out specic action for them to take.The Health secretary told Sky News: \"The first thing were going to do is set out exactly what conditions that applies to.\"We expect about . million people to then get a communication from the NHS to say that they are part of this and what they need to do.\"Many of these people have pre-existing health conditions and so will be very worried right now, and I understand that, and theyll need very specic sets of action - for instance, how do you go about still getting your chemoyou have cancer whilst also social-distancing \"If you have cancer its particularly important to stay away from other people, but you also of course have got to keep going with your chemotherapy.\"He added: \"These are some of the most dficult and challenging cases so well be getting in contact with them, butpeople think that they are on this list and dont receive a communication from the NHS, then they also need to get in contact.\"So that is under way, the money was announced for it yesterday.\"A combination of money to the NHS and money to councils because theyve got a very big part to play in keeping people safe.\"ASCL general secretary Geoff Barton said schools will have first worked to identy vulnerable children, as they will know who they are, and will then be looking at the \"key worker\" category.He said the ASCL is telling members: \"You have to do your best to negotiate the key workers list. Youre doing this to a tight timescale, and what you offer children on Monday may be dferent to what you offer next Wednesday.\"Mr Barton said that initially, schools will be doing all they can so that pupils who need to can still turn up to their own school after the weekend.In the longer term, there will be more strategic planning of school provision, he added.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers , said: \"The Government has made clear that every child who can be safely cared for at home should be. And their advice makes clear too that this applies to children of key workers.\"For the vast majority of children and young people, school buildings will close tonight and not reopen for the foreseeable future.\"Taking up a place at school during this time of wider closure is the offer of last resort, for the minority of key workers, who have no alternative.\"School leaders have many questions that remain unanswered about how this will work in practice. We will continue to work with the Government throughout the day to provide greater clarity to schools to enable this reduced offer to be up and running as soon as possible.\"Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, added her voice to calls from school leaders urging parents to only send their children in as a last resort.She said: \"This is a very long list and could result in some schools having the majority of pupils attending. This will not achieve the goal of slowing the spread of the virus.\"So it is vitally important that parents follow government advice to keep their children at home, wherever possible. Schools can only accommodate a limited number of children and the fewer children making the journey to school, and the fewer children in educational settings, the lower the risk that the virus can spread.\"The competition watchdog has launched a taskforce to tackle businesses looking to exploit the coronavirus outbreak to take advantage of customers.The Competition and Markets Authoritysaid the outbreak has prompted concerns that people could be exploited by companies \"charging excessive prices or making misleading claims about their products\".It said it has already contacted traders and s over excessive pricing of hand sanitiser as part of its efforts.Andrea Coscelli, the CMAs chief executive, said: \"This is obviously a time when we all have to behave responsibly to protect our fellow citizens, and particularly those who are most vulnerable.\"We urge retailers to behave responsibly in the exceptional circumstances of the Covid- outbreak.\"Butthey do not, our taskforce is monitoring market developments to enable us to intervene as quickly as possible.\"We have a range of options at our disposal, from warnings to enforcement action to seeking emergency powers.\"The ceremonial of the Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace, St Jamess Palace and Windsor Castle is being postponed until further notice \"in line with Government advice to avoid mass gatherings\", Buckingham Palace has announced.The palace said in a statement that the situation would be \"reviewed on an ongoing basis, with a view to restarting when appropriate\". article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Providing that people continue to be generous then there wonrsquot be a problem.As increasing numbers of people self-isolate to protect themselves from the virus, Claire said that the food bank was able to offer deliveriesnecessary.ldquoWe are a very open foodbank. If yoursquove got a need, just ask and we can do our best, said Claire.After the Church in Wales announced the suspension of public acts of worship, the Tabernacle and other churches in Penarth have been finding innovative ways to support their congregation.ldquoFrom this weekend we are going to be streaming virtual services, said Clair.ldquoOur musicians are recording pieces in their homes which will be shared online.ldquoAll our small groups meet on Zoom so wersquore in touch with our congregation.ldquoThe more elderly congregations are keeping in touch by phone and telephone to support them in every way ndash spiritually, emotionally and practically.ldquoThe epidemic is pulling everybody together and cutting across denominational boundaries.The Tabernacle Foodbank is open for donations and collections between am and pm Monday to Friday.You can also deliver donations to their collection point in Sainsburyrsquos on Windsor Road.The foodbank would particularly welcome tinned products, including curry, chilli, corned beef, and potatoes.For more information, visit: Info@tabspenarth or call:  . article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Irsquove grown up on the beach.ldquoI normally take landscape pictures because I love the water and some of the sunsets here are incredible, especially in the winter.Rochelle wrote her Instagram handle on the parcels, so that people who found them could send her a message.ldquoIt was just to make someone smile, and Irsquove had some lovely comments from people who got back to me on Instagram, she said.ldquoThey said they were going to put it up in their room and frame it.ldquoSome people were feeling a bit down and didnrsquot expect to find anything, so it cheered them up.ldquoMy job was done ndash the main purpose was to make people smile and it did - it made me smile too.ldquoI think itrsquos very important to say hello, especiallypeople are living by themselves orthey havenrsquot got their family around.ldquoWhen Irsquom normally walking the dog I say hello and have a chat, but itrsquos quite hard to do that now because everyone is quite wary.ldquoI donrsquot have to have that physical contact with someone to brighten up their day.ldquoArt is just a dferent  to communicate with. You knowsomeonersquos a bit shy and they donrsquot want to speak using words, they may want to draw a picture and open up that way instead.ldquoI think art can show feelings that words canrsquot quite express, so itrsquos a great idea to share that with the community.At a time of uncertainty and doubt, Rochelle ended with a message of hope and solidarity:ldquoI think as a community we could do so much more at this time, she saidldquoEveryone is concerned about how long it is going to last, but I am hopeful we can get past it, andwe all work together and remain positive we may come out of this in an even better situation than we was before.Rochelle would like to make clear that all parcels were fully sanitised.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves.

I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He went on to praise doctors, nurses, nuns and priests who ldquodied on the front lines, as soldiers, who gave their le for love. vw,vw,px, px\"Pope Francis at a Good Friday service inside the basilica Earlier in the day, at a Good Friday service inside the basilica, the papal preacher said the pandemic has alerted people to the danger of thinking themselves all-powerful. During that service, in a sign of humble obedience, Francis prostrated himself for a few minutes on the basilica floor.With rank-and-file faithful not allowed into the basilica in accordance with virus containment measures, and as Francis listened attentively, the Rev Raniero Cantalamessa said that ldquoit took merely the smallest and most formless element of nature, a virus, to remind us that we are mortal and that ldquomilitary power and technology are not sufficient to save us.He added said that when the pandemic is over, ldquoing to the way things were is the lsquorecessionrsquo we should fear the most. He added that the virus broke down ldquobarriers and distinctions of race, nation, religion, wealth and power.The Vatican has said there are eight Covid- cases among Vatican city residents or employees.All of the Vaticanrsquos Holy Week ceremonies have been barred to the public, in keeping with Italyrsquos lock-down measures.Italy is living through a fth week of lockdown with at least three more weeks to go.The Colosseum Good Friday Way of the Cross procession normally draws tens of thousands of pilgrims and Romans who clutch candles and prayer books, while the Pope watches from a rise overlooking the ancient arena.But Italyrsquos stay-at-home measures sent tourists and pilgrims fleeing the country weeks ago, and Romans must stay at home except to go to essential jobs or do vital tasks like buying food or medicine..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Doctors and nurses in Good Friday procession at Vatican article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
