Unseasonably warm weather has helped drive down natural gas futures. In addition, the United States and several other major other major nations have agreed to release oil from their strategic reserves. And the OPEC+ oil cartel reached an accord to release more oil in January.What\u0027s more, the emergence of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus has renewed the prospect of more canceled or postponed travel and fewer restaurant meals and shopping trips. All of that, if it happened, would slow consumer and business spending and potentially restrain inflation.Still, analysts caution that unexpected developments, including heavy winter storms, with potentially increased demand for energy, could send energy prices surging again.And analysts cautioned that easing overall inflation pressures will depend on further progress in normalizing global supply chains. Senior White House officials have said they believe that a series of actions that the administration has taken, from boosting the processing of cargo from the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach to the release of crude oil from the petroleum reserve, would help defuse inflation pressures.Some outside economists have begun to echo that view.\u0027I think November will be the worst of it, and going forward we will see steady improvement,\u0027 said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u0027s Analytics. \u0027As the Delta wave of COVID has receded and supply chains start to repair themselves, we will start to see production and shipments improve.\u0027Zandi said he believes that inflation will begin improving with the December price report and that by this time next year, annual inflation will be back down to around 3 percent, closer to the Fed\u0027s 2 percent target.For now, though, against the backdrop of persistent high inflation, the Fed is expected to announce after it meets next week an acceleration reduction in its monthly bond purchases. Those purchases have been intended to lower long-term borrowing costs.Doing so would put the Fed on a path to begin raising its key short-term interest rate as early as the first half of next year. That rate has been pegged at nearly zero since March 2020, when the coronavirus sent the economy into a deep recession.  "},{"url":null,"title":"New York implement indoor mask mandate public places","story":"Share this articleGovernor Kathy Hochul calls for workers to return to New York City offices in the New Year, vows to fix crime, homeless issue - ABC7 New YorkGovernor Hochul Announces Major Action to Address Winter Surge and Prevent Business Disruption as COVID-19 Cases and Hospitalizations Rise Statewide"},{"url":null,"title":"South African motorist drives car balanced TROLLEY replace rear wheel","story":"Share this article The driver reportedly explained there were several problems with the car, apparently forcing him to resort to using a trolley instead of a wheel. \u0027He said something about a bearing which broke.

Carlsen says he didn’t even realize the detail about the number of championship wins they share. “I didn’t know that,” he said. “What can I say? He’s a legend. He’s a legend of the sport. I thought it was an iconic picture to allude to.”He’s then asked what he thinks the elements that allowed him to dominate this match were in pure chess terms. “It’s hard to say,” he says. “I think in simple positions I make very, very few mistakes and that helps. Both in terms of tactical and positional things. The few times that the position was very complicated, we both made some mistakes but he made the last one. I think that was maybe the main factor: that I was just playing better in relatively simple positions. But we really shouldn’t forget the fact that this match really, really turned on the sixth game.” He continues: “But I think it goes to show that in the other matches that have been equal, really tense, they could have ended similarly if things had gone a little bit differently at the start, I think most notably the match against Karjakin (in 2016).”Nepomniachtchi, for his part, reasserts his position that the status quo is fine.“I think a bit of both,” the champion says. “I definitely played a lot more conservatively as black than I did in the match against Fabi (in 2018). With white, I wouldn’t necessarily say that I was that conservative. I was at least trying some different lines, trying to play. But you can see overall in a lot of my decision, when push came to shove, skewed conservative. With hindsight it worked pretty well.”Asked if he will turn his focus toward the next candidates tournament and a repeat challenge to Carlsen at the next world championship: “Of course it’s possible to think but for now it would be more clever, more smart to take some time and have some rest.”He continues: “Experience is never easy. ... The situation should be tough to gain some real experience. I guess it was a little bit too much here. I surely have some space to improve and perhaps solving some puzzles would fix it, (then) in the upcoming events I would show some better performance.”He adds: “After five games there were five draws and I’d had very, very few chances to play for anything more. Then everything kind of clicked and after that it all went my way. You don’t expect to necessarily run away with it in a world championship.” Says Nepomniachtchi: “The match of course consists of many aspects. It’s not only chess preparation but physical and psychological preparation. Of course it’s really tense and it’s a little more tense than I expected. But I guess anyway the tension is not a reason to overlook some simple things you would never overlook in a blitz game. What can I say? I should find out why it did happen and improve.”Asked to assess his performance over the course of the match, Carlsen says: “You can point that things you could have done different in every game of course, but overall I’m happy with my play, very proud of my effort in the sixth game, and that sort of laid the foundation for everything. The final score is probably a bit more lopsided than it could have been, but that’s the way I think some of the other matches also could have gone if I had gotten a lead.” Where does this match rank among his previous four world championship victories: over Anand in 2013 and 2014, Karjakin in 2016 and Caruana in 2018? “It’s hard to say,” he says. “The last one is always in a way the sweetest but I’m just happy to have won.”This will likely go down as the most lopsided world championship match since José Raúl Capablanca’s triumph over Emanuel Lasker exactly 100 years ago in Havana. In that match, Capablanca won by a four-game margin without a single defeat – a stunning beatdown Carlsen is moments away from matching.Nepomniachtchi returns to retreat the queen and hits the black rook with 22. Qc2. Carlsen moves his rook over with 22. ... Rf4. Both players are back in their chairs looking at this position. The champion must be satisfied with how he’s handled Nepomniachtchi’s pressure, leaving the challenger with no clear path to a desperately needed win as white.  Carlsen quickly responds with 19. ... d4 and Nepomniachtchi after a minute and a half follows with the 20. d5. A quite sharp position with the four pawns staring at each other in the center of the board. “It’s either going to very, very strong for Ian,” Howell says, “or these four pawns will disappear and everything will get traded and it will just be a draw.” Some breaking chess news from Dubai: Fide’s general director Emil Sutovsky has just confirmed the World Rapid \u0026amp Blitz Chess Championships, initially scheduled to take place from 25-31 December in Kazakhstan but scuttled due to the government’s new Covid restrictions, will now take place in Warsaw on the same dates.That means Carlsen could finish off his fourth successful defense of the title as soon as today with a wan. On Wednesday, Carlsen and Nepomniachtchi played to a quiet 41-move draw at the Dubai Exhibition Centre. Less than 24 hours after the Russian challenger missed made an extraordinary blunder from a promising position to effectively seal his fate in the best-of-14 match, Nepomniachtchi appeared willing to settle for a peaceful result before making one final push today. “At this point, there’s so few games to go that any draw is an excellent result,” Carlsen said. We’re about 20 minutes from today’s first move with Nepomniachtchi set to marshal the white pieces."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59518dc82c737b7d82616b1a8f77dee900a589a2/0_0_5733_3440/master/5733.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=f8612fac64a79b1f60cf7326b6b993ee","title":"covid news live australia to offer jabs to children aged five to 11 us omicron cases mostly mild cdc chief says","story":"Michael Gove, the UK communities secretary, just chaired a Cobra meeting and says the government was presented with some “very challenging, new information” about Omicron. He adds that, as new data continues to come in with regards to the variant, they will decide what action will need to be taken. According to the latest data from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), Omicron is projected to become the dominant variant in the UK by mid-December, based on current trends, while there could be more than a million infections by the end of this month – a tally that will be dominated by Omicron. The vaccine efficacy data suggests that people who have had two doses of the OxfordAstraZeneca jab 25 or more weeks ago have far lower protection against symptomatic infection with Omicron than with Delta. Dr Mary Ramsay, the head of immunisation at the UKHSA, said:  The dosage used for children will be one-third of that used in adults, similar to the United States. Currently, only the PfizerBioNTech “Comirnaty” vaccine has been approved for children’s usage in Singapore, the health ministry added. Singapore has also signed a new supply agreement with PfizerBioNTech for the Covid vaccine, it said, without specifying how many vials will be supplied.That is up from 50,867 infections and 148 fatalities in the 24 hour prior. It is also the highest number of positive cases recorded in a 24-hour period since 59,937 were reported on 9 January.The measure will be in effect from 13 December to 15 January in order to curb the spread of the virus during the holidays when more time is spent indoors shopping and gathering, Hochul said in a statement. “We shouldn’t have reached the point where we are confronted with a winter surge, especially with the vaccine at our disposal, and I share many New Yorkers’ frustration that we are not past this pandemic yet,” she added. UCU said that “a clear direction to suspend in-person activities for the final week won’t disrupt education and will prevent needless spread of Omicron amongst university communities. It will also allow essential activities such as lab-based research and medical teaching to continue on campus.” Imperial College London has already moved its teaching online after widespread outbreaks of the Omicron variant have been detected.  The union also wants the government to mandate the wearing of masks in classes and seminars in England when students return in the new year. Jo Grady, the UCU general secretary, said: After a troubled start to vaccination programmes on the continent, health officials are examining ways to encourage take-up as some countries have had to throw away doses. The World Health Organization says a shortage of syringes – in particular a 0.3ml syringe version required to deliver the Pfizer dose – may slow delivery, and it has stepped up technical assistance missions in 15 countries that have lagged behind. You can read the full report from Peter Beaumont and Nick Dall here: Arrival of 1bn vaccine doses won’t alone solve Africa’s Covid crisis, experts say The new rules, which comes into effect on Monday, mean travellers from the US will be subject to the highest tier of quarantine measures in Hong Kong, which has some of the strictest anti-coronavirus policies in the world. It will make the US the first country outside of the African continent to be placed under a quarantine centre order since the Omicron variant was first detected last month. Travellers from the US will only be allowed to enter if they are fully vaccinated Hong Kong residents and will be required to spend their first seven days at a quarantine centre with daily testing and health monitoring. Afterwards, they will need to spend another 14 days in quarantine at a hotel booked in advance. US travellers entering Hong Kong are already required to quarantine for a total of 21 days, but under current rules, they can remain in a hotel for the duration of their isolation. The Hong Kong government said on Friday it would tighten its rules after confirming a new Omicron case – the city’s fifth – involving a 37-year-old man arriving from the US. Hong Kong has followed China’s lead in adopting a “zero-Covid” strategy, which has led to some of the toughest quarantine and testing measures in the world. The policy has kept infections low but ensured the business hub has been cut off internationally for the past 21 months.The government asked regional authorities to consider expanding the requirement for proof of vaccination or recovery from the virus for access to many indoor venues. “In order to be ready should further measures be necessary, the federal council is sending two variants of proposed measures ... for consultation by 14 December,” the cabinet said. “All measures restrict social and economic life and affect not only unvaccinated but also vaccinated and recovered persons.” Under one proposal, vaccinated iniduals would additionally need to show a negative test to enter places like bars, restaurants and discotheques where masks cannot be worn.  Under an alternate proposal, it would entirely close such locations. Switzerland has been trying to curb public activity without resorting to another lockdown, as neighbouring Austria has done. The government said it wanted to limit private indoor gatherings to five people if one of them, including a child, was unvaccinated, while up to 30 would be allowed to gather indoors if all were vaccinated. It would also require working from home, compared with the current recommendation to do so. Should the situation worsen further, the government said it would consider limiting all private gatherings to five people. A relatively low two out of three residents are fully vaccinated, including three-quarters of the population aged 12 and above, but resistance to the jabs remains common. While ski lifts continue to operate normally, operators on Friday introduced new capacity limits for large cabins. They also require customers to wear face masks in closed cabins and maintain physical distance in waiting areas. Authorities in southern Guangxi region have in recent days cracked down on illegal entry and detained smugglers who help unauthorised border-crossers, the South China Morning Post reported on Friday. Local media reports said that the authorities in the Chinese region have also set up extra checkpoints along its 97km (60-mile) border with Vietnam. They have also begun 24-hour security patrols. Cases have been on the rise in Vietnam – once seen as a rare coronavirus success story in Asia. On Thursday, the Vietnamese health authorities reported more than 15,000 infections and 256 deaths. Earlier this week, the Chinese embassy in Hanoi urged Vietnam-based Chinese nationals to be “on alert” as the number of confirmed cases toppled 14,000 in the previous week. As of Friday, Vietnam has recorded a total of 1,367,433 cases of infection and 27,186 deaths.  Health authorities began to dose out booster shots to residents in the southern Ho Chi Minh City, where the number of community transmission cases has risen in recent days.Beyond compulsory vaccinations for certain professions from mid-March, the new legislation also allows for the country’s 16 federal states to close bars and restaurants as well as to ban large events due to high infection rates. The health minister, Karl Lauterbach, defended restrictions on unvaccinated people and the mandatory jabs for medical and nursing staff in front of the Bundestag lower house. “It’s absolutely unacceptable that in establishments where people live, who put their trust in us to protect them, that people are unnecessarily dying because unvaccinated work there,” Lauterbach said. The new law also aims to make vaccination more accessible by allowing veterinarians, dentists and pharmacists to administer them, though only for a set period of time. The Robert Koch Institute infectious disease body reported 61,288 new infections from the coronavirus and 484 more Covid-related deaths on Friday. A total of 104,996 people in Germany have died. It said three cases were isolated in the southern city of Limassol following specialised tests by Cyprus’s Institute of Neurology and Genetics. None of those who tested positive required hospitalisation, the health ministry said. They iniduals had recently travelled from abroad. No other details have yet been provided by the ministry.Changing self-isolation rules, Sturgeon said that any household contact of a positive case should self-isolate for 10 days even if they received a negative PCR test, while non-household contacts could leave isolation once they received a negative PCR result. Sturgeon said that the guidance was focusing on work events “because we knew they are resulting in the rapid spread of infection”. She pointed out that there were 60 train cancellations on ScotRail today due to Covid absences, whilst 40 accident and emergency staff are now isolating because of an omicron cluster. Clinical director Jason Leitch said the attack rate of Omicron was that, if 100 people were in the room and there was a single case, at least 50 people would get it.The first ministers and deputy first ministers of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will participate in the meeting, which will be held later this afternoon.The council had until now only recommended that children with underlying health issues be vaccinated against Covid. In a statement the leading advisory body said that it was making the recommendation even though most children experience mild symptoms from the virus. “There is a risk of a serious inflammatory reaction in the vital organs. It is plausible that vaccination can prevent this,” it said. “Vaccination also reduces the indirect health disadvantage that children experience as a result of the pandemic, for example because they are limited in going to school, sports or social contacts.” No 10 previously said it was the intention to have a festive bash this year. But asked on Friday, the spokesman said:  Asked when the decision was taken, the spokesman said: My colleague Andrew Sparrow is covering all related to the No 10 Christmas party saga over on our politics live blog: There were 5,018 positive cases in Scotland on Friday, a sharp rise on the average of 2,800 daily cases that health officials have been reporting recently.  There were a total of 110 Omicron cases, up from just nine when the variant was first detected in Scotland on 30 November. The Scottish government has just published an evidence paper on Omicron, which suggests that Omicron is “rising exponentially” – officials believe the doubling time is closer to two than three days, and that Omicron is going to very quickly overtake Delta as dominant variant, maybe as early as next week.

Photograph: Damien StoranPA WireTaoiseach Micheál Martin has defended the Government’s handling of Covid-19 in schools, as children between the ages of five and 12 now account for one-fifth of all coronavirus cases. The Government had been told “consistently” that schools were safe and the bulk of transmission was in the community, he said. Mr Martin stressed that Covid-19 numbers went up among children during the mid-term break when they were off school. Schools were a “regulated environment” in comparison with those in the wider community, he said.Chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan has continued to insist that the school environment is safe, Mr Martin added. Mr Martin was speaking during an appearance on Virgin Media’s The Tonight Show, during which he was also asked by presenter Claire Brock if he regretted not introducing mitigation measures such as masks or Hepa filters in schools earlier. He responded: “We followed public health advice all the way on schools and education.” He added: “Decisions were taken at the time in relation to contact tracing in relation to that. There are still concerns about masks for young children.”The Government cannot afford to ignore public health advice in relation to children, he stated.Mr Martin said it might be the new year before the first children aged between five and 11 will get their Covid-19 vaccines. “We want to do it in a comprehensive way,” he said.

Photograph: iStock Ireland is in a “very uncertain and unstable position” due to the high incidence of Covid-19, the State’s chief medical officer has said.Dr Tony Holohan said the high levels of virus is being driven by the “highly transmissible” Delta variant.“This is a matter of very significant concern as we wait for more evidence relating to the Omicron variant and the impact it may have to emerge,” he said in a post on Twitter.Dr Holohan said that based on the evidence available to the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet), they believe the “public health measures we are so familiar with will work to slow and stop the transmission of the Omicron variant, as well as the Delta variant”.He added that “early indications” suggest a booster dose of the Covid-19 vaccine will offer “good protection against infection from Delta and Omicron”.“If you are eligible for a booster dose of Covid-19 vaccine, then please take the opportunity to receive your vaccine as soon as it is available to you,” Dr Holohan said.“Similarly, if you are yet to receive a primary dose of Covid-19 vaccine then please come forward as soon as possible.”Speaking about the festive period, Dr Holohan said they are “well aware” that Christmas Eve is in two weeks, “a time of year when we all look forward to coming together with friends and family”.“You can take measures today and in the next few days that will ensure the safest possible interaction with your loved ones over Christmas,” he said.Dr Holohan urged members of the public to “risk assess” the environments they plan to be in over the next two weeks and consider if they “offer the opportunity to protect yourself and each layer of the public health advice”.He added that the public should try to avoid crowds and reduce contacts wear a mask including in crowded outdoor environments keep your distance if you feel unsafe feel empowered to leave open windows and avoid poorly ventilated indoor spaces and clean your hands regularly.Dr Holohan was speaking after 4,115 confirmed cases of Covid-19 were reported on Friday.As of 8am, 511 Covid-19 patients were in hospitalis, of whom 110 were in ICU.Meanwhile Minister for Further and Higher Education Simon Harris has said that public health doctors were slow to recognise the benefit of antigen testing and more public awareness is needed on how to use them.New advice issued by the Government on international travel has recommended that passengers arriving from Britain should undertake daily antigen tests for five consecutive days beginning on the day of arrival.It follows an updated public health assessment in relation to the Omicron variant from the National Public Health Emergency Team to the Government.The Department of Health on Thursday night said five further cases of the strain, first identified in South Africa, had been detected in the State, bringing the total to date to six.On Friday evening the Department of Health said that 4,115 cases of Covid were confirmed with 511 patients in hospital. A total of 110 of these in ICU.Meanwhile in Northern Ireland, two further coronavirus-related deaths have been confirmed and another 1,806 cases of the virus were notified.Mr Harris, a former minister for health, said officials are now examining how an improved campaign on using antigen tests might be rolled out.“It’s always important to be blunt and straight with people particularly during a pandemic,” he said. “I think there is an awful lot more that needs to be done in terms of public awareness campaigns regarding antigen tests. “They have now recommended it in certain scenarios and I think there is an onus now on a very comprehensive public awareness campaign.”Speaking on Newstalk’s The Pat Kenny Show on Friday, the Minister said his €9 million free antigen testing programme across higher education institutions followed advice that “the student population is more likely to be active . . . socialising. And we do want people to be able to safely live their lives.”Asked about a lack of Government advice on their use, he said his sector would put out an awareness campaign and provide direct guidance to third-level institutions. “I would like to see a more widespread media advertisement campaign in this area and I know this is something that the HSE and the Department of Health are looking at,” he said.Regarding controversy around the booster campaign, with reported “no-shows” to appointments where iniduals had already received their shot and long queues outside walk-in clinics resulting in people being turned away, Mr Harris said he was aware of people in his hometown of Greystones, Co Wicklow, queuing on Friday morning, eager to get the third vaccine.Under the new travel guidance, the public has also been advised to avail of a booster vaccine should they wish to travel in the future.Speaking on Thursday, when booster vaccines were offered to people in their 50s for the first time, chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said: “Our early understanding gives us confidence that a booster dose of Covid-19 vaccine will offer good protection against Omicron and Delta infection.”HSE lead on vaccinations Damien McCallion said the health service was planning to recruit more vaccinators and would look at operating longer walk-in periods.Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe said on Friday morning that the queues for booster vaccines were not welcome but he robustly defended the HSE programme and its progress. “These are the kind of challenges that we had when we were rolling out the early phase of the vaccination programme,” he said, denying officials had lost focus.However, he said a million booster vaccines had already been administered in the face of changing public health guidance on their use. “I do accept there are challenges along the way but we were here in the initial vaccination campaign and we will do as good a job with the boosters as we’ve done with other waves of vaccination.” Travel adviceThe new advice on international travel does not recommend any curbs on Christmas travel to or from Ireland.The statement added that Government communications on Covid will be updated to emphasise that everyone should take account of their overall health, their vaccine status and the spread of Omicron in other countries before they decide to travel. The current requirement for all overseas passengers to have a “not-detected” pre-departure Covid test (antigen or PCR, depending on vaccine or recovery status) will continue to apply.Airlines and ferry companies must continue to check pre-departure test compliance, with spot-checking by border management officials also maintained at points of arrival.Mr Harris said that while the newly announced need for people to take five antigen tests when travelling into Ireland from the UK is only advisory, there is still a requirement for PCR tests.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"north waterford district has highest rate of covid 19 in state","story":"The Portlaw-Kilmacthomas local authority area, which borders Co Tipperary, had a 14-day incidence rate of 2,400.7 cases per 100,000 up to last Monday.A district in north Waterford has the highest rate of Covid-19 in the country, according to the latest figures. The Portlaw-Kilmacthomas local authority area (LEA), which borders Tipperary, had a 14-day incidence rate of 2,400.7 cases per 100,000 up to last Monday.

He said the extension of eligibility to adults between 50 and 64 was being taken on the advice of the national immunisation advisory committee (NIAC), to reduce the spread of the flu in the community. “Given that Covid-19, influenza and other respiratory illnesses continue to co-circulate, this is an important measure to reduce the risk of flu compounding the winter pressures on the health system this season,” he said.Dr Colm Henry, Chief Clinical Officer, HSE said: “Flu is highly infectious and can sometimes cause severe complications, such as bronchitis, pneumonia or encephalitis. While some complications are rare, they are still possible. “Getting the flu vaccine is your best shot at protecting yourself and those around you this flu season. We have asked you to get your booster vaccine to protect against COVID-19, and now we’re pleased to be in a position to offer you a free flu vaccine as well.

Video: Enda O\u0027DowdAngeline Ruddy, deputy principal of Moville Community College: ‘It’s on our children’s lips, it’s on our staff’s lips... There’s no getting away from mica’. Photograph: Enda O’DowdAt Moville Community College, everybody is talking about mica.“There’s not an English essay that’s passed to a teacher that doesn’t have a mention of mica in it somewhere... and every time you mention humanitarian issues it’s the first thing to the forefront,” says deputy principal Angeline Ruddy.“It’s on our children’s lips, it’s on our staff’s lips,” she says. “There’s no escaping it. There’s no getting away from mica.”The presence of the mineral in construction blocks – which makes them crack and eventually crumble – has caused structural damage to an estimated 7,500 homes in counties Donegal and Mayo, as well as smaller numbers in other counties.Mica has impacted the entire community, says principal Anthony Doogan, and the school community is no different.At Moville Community College approximately 20 per cent of staff and 25 per cent of pupils – about 20 staff and 100 families – are living in “mica homes” even more have siblings and parents who are affected.“I have five siblings, and four of them are affected by mica,” says Ruddy. The one who isn’t lives in the US.“Where I live, in a half mile radius, 20 houses are affected. It’s everywhere we go.”Her children “know nothing else but a mica household” as they go about their daily routine, mica is “like an app running in the background for every one of us.“‘Is the house safe tonight?’ is a regular question my children will ask,” she says. “I have cracks that are now the width of a two-euro coin, which means my gable is starting to move away from the wall of my house. I don’t know, really, if we are safe any longer.”Others tell a similar story. Special needs assistant Barry Moore’s home is crumbling his daughter was riding her bike around the house when “a lump of plaster fell off... it was near enough to scare her, and me.”“You’re lying at home at night and you hear the walls moving. It’s scary, to think you’re living in a place that is meant to be your safe place and you’re hearing the walls cracking.”Five of the special needs assistants – nearly half of the special needs staff – have mica homes, and so do some of the students they support. A hoist used by one child is attached to a crumbling mica wall, while foster parents have bought two mobile homes to house their children with complex needs.“They need routine, they need to know what happening... they’re going to be moved into two mobile homes behind their house and watch their house getting knocked down,” says Moore.In school, he says, you can “see the children who have mica, or whose houses have mica. They are, like their parents probably are, nearly obsessed with the fact they have mica.“As staff you’re trying to accommodate and support children... but they’re going home to houses that aren’t safe and that are causing them grief and stress.”Guidance counsellor Sineád McCarron’s home also has mica she warns of “what’s coming down the line... this is just going to explode, really, in terms of the amount of support the students need.”As principal, Doogan has significant concerns about the physical and mental health of students and staff – not least through heightened levels of anxiety – and about the impact on students’ attendance and life chances the effects, he estimates, will persist for the next five to 10 years.The anxiety of students and parents “is having an impact on their work rate and their effectiveness at their studies at school,” he says.“Every secondary school in the country”, he emphasises, has seen the effects of Covid “We’re at the beginning of this cycle for mica and in two years’ time, when there’s a large number of houses in this community which need to be demolished and rebuilt, there will be severe anxiety and perhaps worse felt by a lot of our students.”There is also “clear evidence” of an increase in absenteeism due to illness – “they’re living in draughty rooms, the rooms are colder, the rooms are causing them health issues that they wouldn’t ordinarily have” as well as students from mica homes who have left school altogether.Brother and sister Shaun and Aoife Noone describe how their home is “falling down”: “If I put my hand in the wall I could just pull away some of the side of the house,” says 17-year-old Shaun.They have moved out so that their home can be demolished and rebuilt. “I don’t really have a study room so that’s affecting my study, because I’m doing my Leaving Cert now, and it’s harder to focus and settle down and get work done,” he says.“I feel disadvantaged, it’s unfair that most people would stress or be anxious about exams but I’ve got the pressure of my house on top of that, so it’s a bit hard on the mind as well.”Aaron Price (13) and his family have also moved out. “It was a lot to handle trying to go to school and do homework and trying to empty the house.”The Government this week announced a €2.2 billion scheme to rebuild mica homes in Donegal and Mayo, capped at €420,000 per home and with a sliding scale of rebuilding costs from €145 per sq ft for the first 1,000 sq ft to €110 for the next 1,000 and €100 thereafter.It has been criticised by the mica campaigners in Donegal as falling short. “Apparently a new scheme was decided but it’s stupid, apparently each square metre gets less money, that doesn’t make sense,” says Aaron.“We need 100 per cent, and I know we probably will never get that, but if it was in Dublin, this would already be fixed.“It’s not our fault, we spent a lot of money on building our house... why should we have to spend more and more money rebuilding our house?”The adults have done the figures each of those spoken to by The  is facing a shortfall of between €60,000 to €80,000. “If council houses are being built at the minute they are built on a rate of €150 a square metre,” says Moore. “What was being offered would work out essentially for our house at €127 a square metre, which would leave us paying €65,000 on top of what we would get.“My other half is a psychiatric nurse, we’re no millionaires, we’re working-class people and we live in an average size house in Donegal which is the average in the country for a one-off build, 2,500 sq ft.“If they had dropped the sliding scale part... 145 euro per square foot, that’s it, and then your rent and then your storage, I would say 90 per cent of people would have been happy and celebrating, but they put in a scale that doesn’t exist in any builder’s pricing.”“The cost to me right now is €79,000, and that’s just for the build,” says Ruddy. “My house is 2,600 sq ft... that gives a total of €315,000 of a grant. The builders have come back to me with €395,000.“I can’t borrow because I have a mica home... 100 per cent redress is so far from it, I don’t think I’m even getting 80 per cent redress.“My children are at the stage where I should be starting to save for their college. Am I going to build their house and deprive them of education? We’re facing these choices.”“People bought the material in good faith... yet they are being victimised to the extent of having to spend 40, 50, 60, €80,000, whereas other areas were given 100 per cent redress,” says Doogan.For him, it is about the value placed on people from this area, not least given that the school itself is still “nowhere near completion” 20 years after it opened. “We bailed out the banks for €64 billion, and they’re saying three or four billion is a huge amount of money, but it’s less than five per cent of what we gave to the banks.“The people up here paid their taxes to pay for the bank bailout, and people here, like me, paid their taxes to pay for the pyrite redress in Dublin and Leinster. People round here are saying, ‘is there a different law for us?’”McCarron, too, is clear: “How can we help people look after their wellbeing and instil value systems of fair justice when our own Government continues to let this happen?”“They’ve let us down,” says 15-year-old Aoife. “If this was happening in Dublin, I feel it would be a different story, because we’re that far away and we’re rural they say ‘ah, them Donegal ones, they live in big mansions, they can afford it’. We can’t. We need our houses fixed.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"gyms seeing widespread cancellation of memberships from unvaccinated users","story":"Under additional pandemic curbs introduced earlier this week the need to show a Covid-19 vaccination certificate was broadened to cover gyms, leisure centres and hotels Irish gyms have seen widespread cancellations of membership from unvaccinated customers following changes to the Covid-19 restrictions, with some gym users reportedly becoming hostile to staff over the changes. Under additional pandemic curbs introduced earlier this week the need to show a Covid-19 vaccination certificate was broadened to cover gyms, leisure centres and hotels. “It’s quite common across all our members, who have come back to us that they are receiving hassle from a certain cohort.” Mr Dunne said one gym in particular had more than 100 members demanding the cancellation or suspension of their membership, an issue which he raised during a meeting with Department of Sport officials on Thursday. New Year’s resolutions often involve gym memberships and the industry views January as a bumper month. However, the 370-member association is predicting a decline of up to 40 per cent next month. It is seeking enhanced financial supports from Government, including a grant for heating swimming pools, which have seen a falloff in use. Audience capacityPeople in various sectors are attempting to navigate this week’s additional pandemic measures. The events industry – operators have had to cut indoor audience capacity by half – is still grappling with how to rearrange shows and refund ticket-holders in the run-up to Christmas and beyond. In a letter to Taoiseach Micheál Martin and his Ministers this week, the EIAI described a broad and varied sector reduced to a category of “entertainment” by officials and “treated as somewhat of a societal sideshow”.“Significant reputational damage has been caused by the inference that our activity and venues are somehow less safe than other public environments, undermining public confidence in our ability to deliver safe event activity,” it said, appealing for Government to adopt its proposed recovery plan. Two gigsCo Meath band N.O.A.H will play two gigs in Dublin on Friday night with the capacity reduced to 100 per show. Manager Shea McNelis said almost 500 tickets were sold for the original concert, and the band would instead stage three concerts, including another February one, so the same number of fans could attend.Those who had bought tickets before the latest measures have been contacted by the selling agent or the band through social media, a measure of the complexities of reorganising events. “People in the arts industry have been really, really badly treated,” said Mr McNelis, who predicted an imminent entertainment “brain-drain”. “It’s going to be a big problem. You are looking at all these big events and concerts in Ireland next year I don’t know where they are going to get the people.” Restriction-related problems are beginning to filter through in the restaurant industry too. Adrian Cummins, of the Restaurant Association of Ireland, said staff were spending considerable time confirming pre-existing bookings, rearranging those in excess of the new six-per-table limit and handling cancellations.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside politics fresh restrictions breed frustration","story":"We assess the political fallout from the decisions taken over the past few weeks to introduce new Covid-19 restrictions covering international travel, masking children in primary school and the hospitality sector.

File photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsMinisters highlighted how there are more than three years before the next General Election is due to take place as they responded to the results of the latest Ipsos MRBI poll.According to the poll, Sinn Féin now stands at 35 per cent, up three points on the last survey. Fianna Fáil remains on 20 per cent and Fine Gael is also on 20 per cent, down two points. The Coalition is taking some solace in a finding that 57 per cent of those surveyed still think the Government is doing a good job in its handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, though this marks a decline from 74 per cent when a similar question was asked in October. Fianna Fáil Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien said: “A poll’s, a poll”. He added: “I don’t really pay too much heed to it.” Mr O’Brien said: “We’re about three-and-a-half years away from an election.”Mr O’Brien contended that the Government is “performing well” and said: “When you look within the polling data, it is seen that we’re managing things well through the through the pandemic”.Mr O’Brien added: “We’re not in campaigning mode as the main Opposition party continually seem to be in campaigning mode. That’s fine.“We’ve got to get on with running the country.”Fine Gael Minister for Higher Education Simon Harris said the poll was “disappointing” but insisted the findings were unreliable in terms of predicting an electoral outcome given that it was three years out from the next likely General Election.“There’s no point politicians saying they’re not interested in polls, we all pay attention to them,” he said, adding that there were some positives including how the Government has handled the pandemic. Also speaking on Newstalk Radio, his party colleague Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe acknowledged a “clear” trend in Sinn Féin support in recent polls.“But it has to be a catalyst for us continuing to do what we can to get our country through Covid and to respond back to where we are on housing and where we are going to be on health,” he said.Mr Donohoe said the Government could fix economic issues before the next election, citing increased employment since the pandemic threat of 18 months ago.Dublin Bay North Fianna Fáil TD Seán Haughey, who was attending the opening of a new road on Dublin’s northside with Mr O’Brien on Friday, said the poll was “one snapshot in time”.He added that Fianna Fáil’s position has stabilised but said of the poll results that “in one way it’s not surprising” as “we’re living in very difficult times and people are going through difficult issues”.Mr Haughey said his party is “focused on governing” and dealing with the pandemic and the housing crisis. Asked if Fianna Fáil could ever return to the kind of support levels it enjoyed under his father, the late former taoiseach Charles Haughey, he said: “Nobody can predict what happens in politics.”He said Fianna Fáil “certainly has work to do as regards organisation and policies. That work is continuing, but we’re living in a multi-party system. The days of really big political parties are probably a thing of the past.”He said Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin his “full support” and while there had been rumblings about the leadership earlier this year they had “fizzled out”.Mr Haughey also said: “The work of Government is just too important for Fianna Fáil to be navel gazing.”Sinn Féin TD David Cullinane argued that the poll shows that “the seismic shift in Irish politics continues”. He claimed that Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael have “run out of ideas and solutions” and that “more and more people want change in policies and a change in Government”.An index of selected articles available exclusively to our readers with an  digital subscription "},{"url":null,"title":"public stays with government on covid measures for now","story":"Tánaiste Leo Varadkar and Taoiseach Micheál Martin: poll findings suggest that the public appears willing to contemplate some further restrictions.

They never had much in the first place, which is why his chances of leading the party were seen as laughably low until the Brexit crisis. He was chosen as a wild card, the only man who could turn Theresa May’s mess into a majority. That hasn’t changed. So it doesn’t matter how frustrated they get with him: he is still, by some margin, the best election-winner they have. Until that changes, he stays.But a glorious revolution now seems to be underway. The king remains but his powers are being curtailed by parliament – or, in this case, his Cabinet. Sajid Javid yesterday ruled out compulsory vaccination, abruptly ending the “national conversation” that the Prime Minister called for the night before. No 10 can, of course, still press ahead – but having described mandatory jabs as “unethical” Javid would have to resign (again). In his way, the Health Secretary has drawn a red line around No 10.A few weeks ago, Rishi Sunak drew his own red line. Any extra revenue, he said, will be used to cut taxes rather than swell the state: that was his personal pledge delivered to a private meeting of backbench Tory MPs. No 10 might demand more spending but having made such a promise, Sunak would have to resign rather than break a personal pledge. So two holders of the four great offices of state have put the Prime Minister on notice. It’s quite an unusual situation.Both Sunak and Javid have already bent quite a bit, swallowing decisions that they would once have choked on. In the Chancellor’s case it’s the hugely-expensive Dilnot proposals for care homes. With Javid, it’s vaccine passports. Not long ago, the Health Secretary was assuring Tory backbenchers that this was an example of Hancock-era illiberal madness and that he’d bury the idea. He took great pride in telling Andrew Marr (and the public) that he was scrapping them. Now he is enforcing them, without any evidence, under orders from a panicked No 10.Politics is about compromise every leader disappoints. But what’s changing now is that the Cabinet is limiting Johnson’s power because, if left alone, there’s no telling what damage he’d do. Sunak was promoted because he accepted what Javid (his predecessor) would not: that No 10 would spend what it wanted to and the Treasury simply raised the money. Javid hated being called “Chino” (Chancellor In Name Only) and thought for a while that Sunak would be seen as a “babychino”. But since then, Johnson’s authority has rapidly and visibly drained.The rule-by-terror under Dominic Cummings has turned into a Boris Johnson court of chaos which is, if anything, worse. The Prime Minister’s bizarre decision to hold an inquiry into whether his own staff held a party under his own roof underlines the sense of no one being in charge. His ministers are told to rule out Plan B restrictions one day then, quite literally, implement them the next. It gives the impression of staggering decisions, affecting the lives of millions, being taken on a whim. As one minister puts it: “It’s a complete horror show.” It’s not just Twitter conspiracy theorists who suspect the new lockdown measures were intended to distract media attention from the growing scandal of rulebreaking Downing Street parties. There are members of the Cabinet who think that too. They can’t work out why else the vaccine passports arrived from nowhere, or why Johnson suddenly decided to emulate the European panic that he had been defining himself against. When he addressed the Cabinet this week, the Prime Minister admitted to this flaw in the logic – that, in effect, he had no evidence for his decision so no obvious exit strategy. But if this was a ersionary tactic, it has ended up a misjudgement of Owen Paterson-style proportions – turning backbench anger into cold fury. Small scandals that would once have been ignored are now seen to be far more relevant.So it matters, now, if there were several parties in No 10 rather than just one. It matters if such parties were (as one attendee tells me) “widespread” not just in Downing Street but across Whitehall. Simon Case, the Cabinet Secretary, is now meant to be investigating – and in current political circumstances, this will not be a whitewash. This raises the question of what will happen to those who attended.And it matters, now, if the Prime Minister misled his ethics adviser by saying he had no idea how his wife’s new wallpaper was being paid for when, in fact, he had personally asked the man who held the purse strings for more. It indicates a shambles which has gone beyond embarrassing and is plunging the country into unpredictable lockdown regimes that seem more closely linked to the news agenda than hospitalisation rates.Johnson himself decided on strategic resignation. Thinking that Theresa May’s Brexit deal was heading for disaster, he thought he’d jump ship. As did Dominic Raab, Esther McVey and Suella Braverman – all of whom ended up in good positions in a new regime. Ministers who think the Johnson project is doomed might be tempted to leave now, positioning themselves for what follows. The sheer turnover of staff in No 10 might be an earlier indicator of resignations to come.Ministers who do quit should be prepared to be on the back benches for quite some time. My hunch is that the Prime Minister will stay, but with more red lines drawn around him. Almost none of his Cabinet would tolerate compulsory vaccination, for example, but this time we should expect more to defy him by saying so in public. They are not (yet) ready to lose Johnson but will be actively asking who might do a better job.More from NewsGhislaine Maxwell trial: Socialite \u0026#39groped Annie Farmer during massage at Jeffrey Epstein’s ranch\u0026#39Cut income tax by 2p, Rachel Reeves urges Rishi SunakPolice use facial recognition cameras for the first timeSeven questions that go through your mind when you first see the Cambridges’ Christmas cardPrince Charles and Duchess of Cornwall share tender moment in Christmas cardShortage of Covid tests in French ski resorts threatens holiday chaosMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"emmanuel macron sacrificing franco british alliance altar ambition","story":"Franco-British relations are in a state of tension not seen in forty years, according to former British ambassador to Paris Lord Ricketts. Not to be outdone, the former French ambassador Sylvie Bermann retorts that relations have “never been as bad since Waterloo”. Yet British forces — unlike those of EU member states such as Germany — continue to fight alongside each other on the front-line. So why the rhetoric?The list of ongoing joint British-French operations is, indeed, extensive: British troops provide vital heavy-lifting in France’s struggle to combat Islamic fundamentalism in sub-Saharan Africa, Franco-British forces are jointly deployed along the Baltic to protect NATO’s eastern flank, and behind the scenes the decade-old Lancaster House agreements continue to foster mutually beneficial Franco-British cooperation — on nuclear weapons, drones, missiles and ‘complex weapons systems’.The UK-French integrated carrier strike force also continues to take shape. Only last week French and British naval forces were engaged in a massive six-nation NATO naval exercise simulating a high intensity battle for the control of occupied territory against Chinese or Russian navies — the real threat to French and British interests. Given their continuing open hostility to Brexit, Ricketts and Bermann probably assign it as the cause of the tension. And they are probably right as far as Emmanuel Macron is concerned. Like them he does not hide his hostility to Britain’s departure, nor his will to demonstrate that it cannot be allowed to succeed. To act otherwise would be to undermine a vital strut of his first mandate: deeper European integration and strategic autonomy, as proclaimed in his 2017 Sorbonne speech. And it will form a large plank of his presidential campaign, not to mention the mission statement he outlined last night for his six-month presidency of the EU Council from 1 January 2022.Yet Macron — even up against the ropes — does not believe that Franco-British relations are anything like the ahistorical doomsday musings of some diplomats. He refuses even to abrogate the 2003 bilateral Le Touquet migration treaty — an easy win were he serious. His beef with Britain is far more short-term and presidential election induced, criticised as he has been by his political opponents for supposed weakness towards not only Britain, but also the US and Australia. Presumably even Sylvie Bermann would recognise that Franco-British relations were worse under Vichy when Britain was a declared enemy, worse in 1898 when France and Britain were on the brink of war at Fashoda, or during the 1860s when so many huge and still standing fortifications – ‘Palmerston’s follies – were built on the south coast to guard against a French invasion. But what all these historical examples share is that a few years later Paris and London’s relations had been reset. Before the 1860s Channel defences were even completed, Franco-British foreign policy was aligned: after Fashoda came the Entente Cordiale, after Vichy the Franco-British Dunkirk Treaty. Comparison is not reason, as the French say. All the more so historical comparisons. But Fashoda is instructive. The pantomime military standoff between Captain Marchand (132 soldiers) and Lord Kitchener (1500) in the Egyptian Sudan over spheres of influence served as an eye-opener that the two nations’ true problem was not each other, but the fast rising military and naval power: Germany. The two powers set about clearing the decks of centuries of silted disagreement and discord on everything from colonial frontiers, spheres of influence and, yes, fishing (the century-old bone of contention of French access to British controlled fishing grounds off Newfoundland, a bane of generations of diplomats). The result was the 1904 Entente Cordiale, signed on 8 April, a date which but for two days helpfully coincides with the first round of the 2022 French presidential elections, when Macron will be fighting for a place in the second. Once that election — a cause of his cantankerousness — is over and France’s presidency of the EU completed two months later, there will be an opportunity to clear the decks and reset Franco-British relations, whoever is elected. Friction will not disappear — it never did after 1904. But, then as now, it could allow both states to concentrate on the real threat to their interests: China’s rising power. In his speech to French ambassadors in 2018, Macron cited the Indo-Pacific as the great strategic challenge, European strategic autonomy as a long term plan, and Franco-British diplomatic, defence and security collaboration as vital for the future — enshrined in each others’ defence white papers since 1995. While successful Brexit, Aukus and presidential elections explain much of Macron’s recent posture, France has all to gain by resetting Franco-British relations. That will require a still inexperienced Macron to understand that close allies’ common interests do not exclude other interests erging.Rhetoric aside, France and Britain should not forget that in foreign policy ‘alliances are not friendships’.More from NewsGhislaine Maxwell trial: Socialite \u0026#39groped Annie Farmer during massage at Jeffrey Epstein’s ranch\u0026#39Cut income tax by 2p, Rachel Reeves urges Rishi SunakPolice use facial recognition cameras for the first timeSeven questions that go through your mind when you first see the Cambridges’ Christmas cardPrince Charles and Duchess of Cornwall share tender moment in Christmas cardShortage of Covid tests in French ski resorts threatens holiday chaosMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph weekly news quiz mispronounced word year","story":"In the week that saw Boris Johnson confirm the tightening of coronavirus restrictions in a Downing Street press conference just weeks before Christmas, The \u0027s news quiz is here to find out how closely you have been paying attention to the headlines.London has become the most congested city in the world, with its drivers losing an average of how many hours sitting in traffic each year?Also this week, which French presidential candidate was put in a headlock as violence erupted at their first political rally?If you\u0027ve been reading this week\u0027s  Front Page newsletters you will have come across all of the answers to the quiz.

Steven Todd, who owns Reps gym in Preston, Lancashire, has also insisted he will not pay the three £, fixed penalty notices he had been issued for breaching coronavirus legislation, despite defeat in court. Mr Todd was ordered to close the doors for three months back in February by a district judge, after he was found to have remained open during lockdown, Lancashire Live reports.The closure order, which Preston City Council had applied for, was issued following a series of police raids which found gym-users inside the Ribbleton premises. Preston Magistrates’ Court heard there had been “at least  occasions when gyms were not permitted to open when Mr Todd was open for business”. Mr Todd, who set up the gym  years ago, continued his battle fighting the three £, fixed penalty notices through the courts. Speaking to LancsLive, he said he had no intention of paying the fines.He is accusing the Prime Minister of operating in a ‘two-tier system’ where those in power have dferent rules to the rest of the country. Boris Johnson this week came under fire over claims that multiple boozy parties took place inside Downing Street last year in breach of rules forbidding mass gatherings.Fresh anger erupted over the festive get-togethers last December after footage of a mock press conference with aides joking about the alleged rule breaches was leaked to ITV News.Despite Mr Johnson repeatedly denying that any event took place and saying all rules were followed, his former spokesperson and adviser Allegra Stratton resigned after a leaked recording of her joking about such a party.  In the clip, the former press spokeswoman and other senior advisors can be seen creasing up about cheese and wine apparently in Downing Street and a business meeting which was not socially distanced.Boris Johnson has now ordered an independent inquiry to be carried out by Cabinet Secretary Simon Case, who works closely with the Prime Minister.But the Prime Minister’s spokesman almost immediately confirmed the Cabinet Secretary’s inquiry will only cover the events of December  last year. That means the Cabinet Secretary investigation will not cover a second alleged event on November , during a national lockdown.The Cabinet Secretary’s probe will also not cover an alleged party in the Downing Street flat on November , which ex-aide Dominic Cummings has claimed took place. As people who lost loved ones without being able to say goodbye during those restrictions issued scathing criticisms of Mr Johnson and his colleagues, Mr Todd also hit out at those alleged to have breached the rules while calling for others to follow them.He said: “How can they have a party when they want all of us lot to go around with masks in the shops  “It’s like a two-tier system. There’s rules for us and rules for them. “I thought there [was] laws for us all but it doesn’t seem to be the case and that’s now very fair.” Mr Todd said he believes the new restrictions announced yesterday are unnecessary and an overreaction to the threat of the Omicron iant. He doesn’t knowhe would close his gym againordered to, he said. “If you’re making legislation then you should be following it and setting an example, not flouting it,” he said. “You can’t expect us to.

In the following year, all three received an indefinite leave to remain, and a year after this, they received their British Citizenship. With this, I also automatically gained citizenship through my parents - and of course, I was born here - so for all intents and purposes, I was and am British. Growing up in North London, I went to school in Barnet and then went on to secondary school nearby as well. Ultimately, I graduated from University of London while working multiple jobs throughout my university years. I then started my career as a journalist and hoped to make a change because the industry lacked British south Asians, and coverage around the community has been predominantly negative. There are around six million people like me, with similar stories of being born and brought up here, working in the UK and classing themselves as British Pakistani - which, despite having Pakistani at the end of it, does not make the aposBritishapos part of it any less credible - surely  Although at times it feels as though we are unwanted, this country is where we entered the world and is what we know. Evenwe decide to visit our home countries to gain more of a connection with our cultures, at the end of the day we are British citizens, right  But as much as we try to cling on to being British Pakistani or British Bangladeshi, British anything, the second part of the title has become a tool to ensure we know that we are in fact second-class citizens. This is because even though I was born here, I can be deprived of my citizenshipI am able to become a national of another country - for me, I could be deported to Pakistan on the governmentaposs whim. Despite being born and brought up here, clause , proposed by Priti Patel in July and updated last month, would allow for the Home Office to deprive me of my citizenship without delivering physical notication.This means,I went abroad and the government was unable to contact me, before boarding a plane back I could be told my passport is no longer valid without any warning.Mohammed Tasnime Akunjee, the lawyer known for representing Shamima Begum, explained how the new clause impacts Brits like me. He said: The existing law is thatthe Home Secretary deems you not conducive to the public good, and wish to strip you of citizenship, they have to sent you a notice of their decision with a reason for why they are stripping you of citizenship. However, now with the new clause, they donapost have to tell you, youaposll only be told when you try board a plane and your passport is no longer al. The government has said those who are deprived of their citizenship without notice have the right to appeal, but Mr Akunjee says there are issues with this.  He said: You need a physical notice in order to appeal a decision -you donapost have that then the courts will demand that you prove that you have actually have been stripped. You have to acquire that proof and be able to submit that to the court before you can even appeal. Additionally, although some might think that being born here would put you less at risk of being deprived of your status, Mr Akunjee says from a legal perspective, it does not. He said: Both peoplecan be stripped of their citizenship, being born or not born here doesnapost make a dference in respect of this bill. According to , the Home Office has said: “British citizenship is a privilege, not a right. Deprivation of citizenship on conducive grounds is rightly reserved for those who pose a threat to the UK or whose conduct involves very high harm. The Nationality and Borders Bill will amend the law so citizenship can be deprived where it is not practicable to give notice, for example,there is no way of communicating with the person.” So this means that as long as I am a good immigrant, I can stay in the UK  ButI was white, as I would be less likely to be able to get another nationality I would be more likely to keep my British citizenship regardless of what threat I pose to the public. *A version of this piece originally appeared on MyLondon Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Priti PatelHome OfficePoliticsShamima Begum\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

In his strongest comments yet, the Labour leader said Mr Johnson was unfit for office and asked Conservatives how long they were prepared to keep on defending the indefensible. The Prime Minister is battling on several fronts after a wave of damaging allegations that seven separate lockdown-busting parties were held in Westminster in the run-up to Christmas last year. Claims have now emerged that Boris Johnsonaposs top spin doctor Jack Doyle made a thank you speech and handed out spoof awards to Downing Street staff at a No festive bash on December . Sources have told ITV News that Mr Doyle, who was then deputy director of communications, held a joke awards ceremony for staff at the bash, which is now the subject of a Cabinet Office probe. Meanwhile, Mr Johnson is also accused of lying to a probe by his standards advisor Lord Geidt which cleared him of breaking rules over the refurbishment of his Downing Street flat.  And he faces a potential Tory rebellion over new Covid plan B measures, which include the introduction of vaccine passports for large events. Labour has vowed to back the measures, meaning they will pass, but dozens of Tory MPs have spoken out publicly against the plans. It comes as an exclusive poll for the Mirror found Labour has opened up a six-point lead over the Tories.

Mr Starmer tweeted: Boris Johnson is unfit to lead our country.He also told The : Iaposm confident weaposre going to win the next general election, whether thataposs in  or .So the question - and this is really the question that I think is central now - for the Cabinet, for ministers and for all Tory MPs, frankly, is are they prepared to endure the next two years of increased degradation of themselves and their party, being put out to defend the indefensible and bringing themselves and their party into further disrepute  Because this isnapost going to change - heaposs unfit for office, it isnapost going to change.

Cabinet Secretary Simon Case has been tasked with leading a probe into allegations of three parties in Westminster after Mr Johnson finally apologised for a No Christmas party on December , first revealed by the Mirror.Mr Johnson told the Commons he was sickened and furious at a clip of his staff laughing about the Christmas bash four days after it happened - when lockdown rules banned social gatherings.  Downing Street stonewalled questions for a week and claimed there was no party, but on Wednesday the PM announced a probe and disciplinary action for any rule-breakers. Alongside the December  party, Mr Case will include in his review a confirmed gathering at the Department for Education on December  last year, and a reported leaving event for a No  aide - allegedly attended by Boris Johnson - on November . Small business minister Paul Scully said it was key to get to the bottom of the allegations.

I believe this newspaper made a signal contribution with our exposure of the Covid rule-breaking in Downing Street.The story of illicit Christmas parties among Tory aides last winter wasn’t just a journalistic scoop. It lanced the boil of deceit in high places.And it acted as a lightning rod for all the frustration and rage of people who have endured so much and feel let down by the government’s incompetence, duplicity and delay during  months of coronavirus crisis.When “Partygate” was made public, people who had lost loved ones reacted with understandable anger. Their wrath against “one rule for them, another for us” boiled over across the media. It all came out. We have seen a similar upsurge of voter disgust before. It swept John Major’s sleaze-ridden government out of office in . But this time it’s personal, directed against an inidual Prime Minister who they know is the chief architect of this scandalous state of affairs. The people’s fury has forced arrogant Boris Johnson out of his lethal lethargy. He was compelled to invoke Plan B-lite restrictions, against his own inclination and in defiance of his hard-line MPs.And he had no option but to set up an inquiry into the shenanigans in his own office. The investigation by Cabinet Secretary Sir Simon Case must not be another Whitehall whitewash. If the rule-breakers are not brought to book, public distrust with government will increase.  The politan police should also be jolted out of their supine indference to the antics of the Tory Bright Young Things who think the law is for “the little people” – like you and me. The video of these highly paid jacks-in-office laughing and joking about their Downing Street party tipped this story over the edge into public outrage.But none of this would have happened without the Daily Mirror’s disclosures ten days ago, which were repeatedly denied by the Number  lie machine.And still are refuted – by the very aides who partied way into the night while everyone  was compelled by law not to mix with their own family. Vomit-inducing. The time has come for someone – preferably Sir Keir Starmer – to stand up in Parliament and repeat the words of Oliver Cromwell to the Long Parliament in , and Tory MP Leo Amery to appeasement premier Neville Chamberlain in : “You have sat here too long for any good you are doing - in the name of God, go!” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Conservative Partypolitan PolicePlan BBoris JohnsonPoliticsCoronavirusDowning Street Christmas Party\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The FM said the Scottish Government was acting as Omicron was set to overtake Delta as the most dominant strain within days, adding Covid could put signicant additional pressure on hospitals and other health and care services at the peak pressure of winter. “The fact is, we do face a renewed and very severe challenge in the face of of the new Omicron iant,” she said at a briefing in Edinburgh. “To be blunt, because of the much greater and faster transmissibility of this new iant, we may be facing – indeed we may be starting to experience – a potential tsunami of infections.” Meanwhile in Wales, First Minister Mark Drakeford also sounded the alarm over the new Covid strain, telling reporters at a briefing that restrictions would be reviewed weekly. The Department for Health said on Thursday there had been , new Covid infections and fears for the NHS are growing.The Prime Minister announced on Wednesday that England would move to Plan B restrictions, with people told to work from home as of Monday. The ramping up of Covid curbs also means more mandated mask-wearing and next week MPs will vote on a Covid pass scheme for some venues. But the Prime Ministeraposs authority has been damaged over the lockdown-breaking Christmas bash in No last December - first revealed by the Mirror. On Thursday night it emerged his communications director Jack Doyle gave a thank-you speech at the event and handed staff spoof awards.Tory backbenchers are also threatening a major rebellion over the Covid pass plan while Labour has said the PM is not fit to lead the country as the pandemic rages.Askedpeople in England should cancel their Christmas parties too, Mr Johnsonaposs spokesman said on Friday: Under Plan B, weaposre not shutting hospitality. The use of certication enables a number of venues to remain open when otherwise we would have had to close them for public health reasons as we have had to do previously. We understand fully the impact that these measures have had on hospitality in the past and certication allows them to remain trading. We do not think there is a need to cancel people coming together in hospitality venues.

Boris Johnson has already suffered a backlash over Plan B rules aimed at tackling Omicron, which is predicted to become the dominant iant and could be more resistant to existing vaccines. Officials are now reportedly working on aposPlan Capos, which would go a step further by reintroducing the NHS Covid app check-in for people going to pubs and restaurants, making face masks compulsory in all indoor spaces and using vaccine passports for more venues.Mr Johnson’s Plan B has been criticised by businesses as well as many Conservative MPs and even some scientists who claim the measures won’t make an impact on the spread of Omicron.  It now means that people will need to wear face masks at indoor venues like cinemas and theatres or churches, and from next Monday new work from home guidelines will be introduced. MPs will vote next Tuesday on the plans, with a string of Tory MPs openly criticising plans to introduce vaccine passports. Businesses have seen themselves hit in what for many is their busiest period of the year over Christmas and New Year - but Mr Johnson says he hopes the measures will “slow the spread”. ,],totalVotes:,votesToShow:,mentometerId:,publicationId:,callbackUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  status,voteActionUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  vote,closed:,closedMessage:This poll has been closed!,hideResults:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,pubmaticVideoPrebidEnabled:true,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,disableOzoneScriptOnDragonfly:true,pubmaticIdDisabled:true,fbia.mantisRecommender:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,blackFridayWidget.linkUrl:https:www.mirror all-about black-friday,blackFridayWidget:,partner.quicklinks.bar:true,enableSlideInSkinnySignUp:true,justpremiumDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,videoPlaylistEnabled:true,domain:mirror,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,publicationId:aeed-a--bac-edf,lotameLightningTagV:true,ampVideoCacheBuster:true,pubmaticDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,deleteAccountFromProfile:true,adHiddenLoading:true,adslotsFixedSize:true,blackFridayWidget.Link:https:get-latest.dev.convrse.media black-fridayblack-friday-widget-v.,sovrnDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,video.header.bidding.enabled:,chatEnabled:true,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,enableAboutTopics:true,converse.widget.enable:true,viafouraComments:true,adMobileBottomSlotLarge:true,video.jwplayer.playerId:DxFYnOv,flagsFromDataLayerForFBIA:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,fbia.converse.enabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,openxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,globalTrayEnabled:true,manualReconsent:,mpulse.enabled:true,nobidDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,og.image.for.section.and.topic:https:s-prod.mirror @trinitymirrordigital chameleon-branding publications mirror img logo-mirror-socialsharing.png,publicationName:Mirror,video.jwplayer.enabled:true,loadIrisManually:true,delayAdsUntilCMP:true,disableAdvertMaxHeight:true,preloadFonts:true,viafouraEnabled:true,PWA.enable:true,readNextEmbeds:true,removeSSO:true,chartbeatHeadlinePageTypes:[ home , channel , topic , section ],felix.endpoint:https:felix.data.tm-awx ampconfig.,breakingNewsPull:true,nobidVideoPrebidEnabled:true,adFixedMobileBottomSticky:true,magniteDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,footerNewsletterConfig:,xandrDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,consentText:We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youaposve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Public Health Scotland issued new Covid advice today asking people to postpone their festive bash this year and do their bit to protect ourselves and our loved ones. At Wednesdayaposs Covid- briefing, Mr Johnson said Christmas parties could go ahead but that people should exercise caution. He said: Itaposs OK to keep going with Christmas parties but obviously everybody should exercise due caution, have ventilation, wash your hands, get a test before you go - give everybody  confidence they are going to be meeting somebody who is not contagious.” Downing Street will not be hosting any Christmas parties themselves this year, despite the PMaposs OK to go ahead. No officials will be focusing on the intensive work needed to tackle Omicron. There are also fears growing over the rapid spread of the much more transmissible Omicron iant.  It comes as the UK recorded a , new infections and the latest UK Health and Security Agency confirms  cases of Omicron north of the border. Dr Nick Phin, Director of Public Health Science and Medical Director, said a signicant number of Covid outbreaks in Scotland have been linked to parties. He said: “There is much that we still need to learn about Omicron, but early evidence suggests that this new Covid iant is much more transmissible. The impact of this transmissibility has been seen in recent weeks, with a number of Omicron outbreaks linked to parties. “We still need to learn more about the severity of disease caused by Omicron and the effectiveness of vaccines, but there are important things that we can do to help protect ourselves and our families now. To help minimise the further spread of Covid-, and Omicron in particular, I would strongly urge people to defer their Christmas parties to another time. “I appreciate that everyone is keen to celebrate this festive season, particularly after the pressures of the last twenty months, but by postponing some plans we can all do our bit to protect ourselves and our loved ones.” Throughout the pandemic, a tightening of restrictions in Scotland has frequently been followed by similar measures in England. Mr Johnson, meanwhile, is under increasing pressure after it was revealed Downing Street had a secret Christmas party last December, at the height of the second wave. He was forced to apologise after footage emerged of senior staff laughing and joking about cheese and wine and definitely no social distancing at the get-together.  No has confirmed they will not be hosting a party this year. A Downing Street spokesperson said: As the Prime Minister said Christmas parties can continue to go ahead under Plan B. Everyone should continue to behave cautiously and we recommend people take lateral flow tests before meeting others socially in high-risk settings, but it is up to inidual businesses and people to decide what works for them. No is focused on tackling the rise of the new omicron iant and the ongoing pandemic, and there are therefore no plans for a party while this intensive work is ongoing. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon had asked Scots to comply strictly with current protections, adding in tweets on Wednesday: And evenyou feel angry with a politician just now, please remember just how important compliance is for the health and safety of you, your loved ones and the country. Health Secretary Sajid Javid told the Commons this week that there was now community transmission of Omicron in all regions of England.On Wednesday, the Prime Minister announced the country would move to the governmentaposs Plan B plan for Covid curbs, with home-working advised from next week. It also includes more mandated face masks in places such as theatres and cinemas and a Covid pass system for large public events. Tory MPs will vote on the plans next week, with backbenchers set to rebel.

Here we take a look at so-called Plan C and what it means Image: Evening Standard   eyevineByLizzy BuchanDeputy Online Political Editor:,  Dec | comments Tougher restrictions are being brought to tackle the spread of the Omicron iant as Boris Johnson implemented his Covid Plan B.The Prime Minister said on Wednesday that people in England should work from home where possible from December , while masks will be mandated in most public indoor venues from Friday. Vaccines passports will also be required for nightclubs and large events from December .But some experts have questioned whether the toolkit of measures will be enough to curb the new strain, with reports of officials drawing up Plan C with even tougher rules. Downing Street said on Friday there was growing confidence that the new iant spreads more quickly than Delta and there was some evidence of vaccine escape.Scotlandaposs First Minister Nicola Sturgeon warned of a possible tsunami of infections ahead of a four-nations Cobra emergency meeting chaired by Cabinet Minister Michael Gove on Friday afternoon. Here we sort the fact from the fiction on future Covid restrictions in England. What is Plan C  Officially, there is no Plan C. The Governmentaposs Covid Winter Plan, published in September, includes a section on Plan B which has a string of measures to imposethe Covid situation worsens. Boris Johnson pulled the trigger on Plan B on Wednesday, with masks becoming mandatory for most indoor public spaces from Friday, and vaccine passports made a legal requirement for nightclubs and large events like football matches from Wednesday. Brits will be ordered to work from home againthey can from Monday. This was thought to be enough to keep the virus at bay over the winter, along with the mass booster programme. But the arrival of Omicron has changed things. Downing Street say there is no official Plan C amid reports officials are drawing up a contingency blueprint with more restrictions. The Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman said on Friday there were no plans to go beyond what weaposve set out already when askedthere was going to be a published Plan C. But he added: Obviously we need to keep the characteristics of this iant under review, and we would actnecessary, but thereaposs no plans to go beyond what we set out. Askedthere was a Plan C document, he said: Not that Iaposm aware of. As a responsible Government, of course, you would expect us to... we have an array, already, of options available to us in terms of what measures we can take to mitigate a growth of any iant or virus. But there are no plans to go beyond that currently. What restrictions could be included in Plan C  There are plenty of restrictions that could come in to get infection rates down. Working from home is one of the big levers the Government can pull - and this is already coming into force next week. The other big one is a reduction on household mixing, which was mooted as a contingency plan back in October. However this would be highly unpopular and it doesnapost seem to be on the cards so far. Here are some of the ideas that could be in the pipeline. Hospitality check-ins Punters could be asked to use the NHS Covid app to check into pubs and restaurants, to help contact tracers track the spread of the disease. This rule was in place earlier this year as hospitality venues reopened after lockdown but it was later abandoned. Use of the app fell after the so-called pingdemic when hundreds of thousands of people were told to isolate, leading to staff shortages across a number of industries. In August the rules were changed so double vaccinated people no longer had to isolatepinged by the app. Instead they were advised to take a PCR testthey came into contact with an infected person.  Face masks in all indoor spaces Rules on face coverings have been tightened since Friday, to cover indoor spaces such as theatres and cinemas as well as shops and public transport. But officials are said to be considering making it mandatory in all indoor spaces, which would include hospitality too. Vaccine passports in more venues From December , people will have to prove they are double jabbed or have had a negative Covid test to go to nightclubs and large events like football matches. But this could be broadened to smaller venues too. The Government has been reluctant to require vaccine passports for pubs and other hospitality venues but this could be considered.  Tougher isolation rules Self isolation rules were loosened in the summer so double vaccinated people didnapost have to stay at home for  daysthey came into contact with an infected person. Following the emergence of Omicron, the rules were tweaked so anyone who is a contact of an Omicron case has to isolate regardless of vaccination status. Bringing back the -day rule could have an impact - but it would be controversial again. What would cause Plan C to be triggered  The Government usually refuses to say explicitly what thresholds need to be met to lead to new restrictions - as the situation can change rapidly. But we can take some educated guesses based on the Winter Plan and previous lockdown rules.Throughout the pandemic, one of the key aims of restrictions is to prevent the NHS coming under unsustainable pressure. Hospitalisation rates are a key thing to watch for as large numbers of people being admitted onto Covid wards would put the health service under strain. How well vaccines are working is another critical factor, as the protection offered by the jab has allowed everyone toto some semblance of ordinary le. One of the big unknowns about the Omicron iant is how well the existing vaccines work against it. This is what scientists are currently trying to find out. The transmissibility of the new iant is also important - and how sick people are becoming from it. The new iant may seem frightening but it is worth remembering that we didnapost have the vaccine last winter, which is the best protection against the virus. When could that happen  The short answer is we donapost know. Experts are still working to understand the new iant and the scientic advice will be critical to whatever decisions the Government makes. There are some indications that the new iant may cause less serious illness than feared - but this could still have a big impact on the NHSit spread quickly and infects lots of people. There is also the political angle, as lots of Tory MPs are unhappy with the idea of further restrictions - so there could be some big parliamentary battlesthe Prime Minister tries to bring in fresh curbs. MPs will vote on Tuesday on the Plan B measures, which would be reviewed again in the New Year. However the Government can bring in additional restrictions soonerthe public health case is strong enough.

Shes since been offered morphine and Tramadol to cope with the pain - but was desperate for a permanent solutionChrissie first asked her GP about sterilisation when she was just  years old Image: Make The HeadlinesByTfany WallisJessica TaylorReal Le Features Writer:,  Dec | commentsA single mum-of-two who suffered excruciating pain during her period has taken the drastic step of being sterilised - at just  years old. Chrissie Hadfield first started suffering from painful periods and ovulation pain when she was  years old, after the birth of her oldest child. Each time her period came, she describes feeling a pain like a hot blade in her abdomen, leaving her doubled over in pain and unable to stand. She would also develop thrush each month and had poly-cystic oies - one of which was inflamed. After two dficult pregnancies with her  and eight-year-old children, she decided she wasnapost going to have any more kids. And when her youngest was born, she ended up in hospital with ovulation pain. She was given morphine to manage it, but doctors couldnapost figure out what was wrong with her.For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here She said: “Over the next  years, doctors put me on every form of contraception you can think of. “They thought the contraception would help control the bleeding and help control the pain but none of them did. Anything hormonal literally wiped me out. She added that her period pain was so bad, she was once given drugs only given to women in labour. Eventually, she had a non-hormonal coilfitted, but this made her periods irregular and meant she could be bleeding for  days out of the month. I could also feel myself ovulating. It felt like a metal ball on fire rolling down my abdomen and every now and again it would shoot spikes. It was extremely painful.  When she reached  years old, Chrissie decided enough was enough and, knowing she didnapost want to have any more children, she asked her GP about sterilisation. But she claims her request was met with dficulty and was told it would be tricky for a single woman of her age to have the operation. “I had to show that every form of contraception does not work for my body, the hormonal contraceptives give me mental health problems and my body rejects the non-hormonal coil, she said. “I had to keep the copper coil, so I was on some form of contraception, but I was developing bacterial vaginosis and thrush every time I had a period, so I was given antibiotics every month.” Chrissie was also worried about the long-term damage taking so much medication each month would have on her body. She explained: “Being on this much medication is unnatural. Each cycle, I was developing cysts on my oies and tubes and a scan showed I had a right inflamed oy. “So, the thought of having sterilisation to me was a dream and a way out from all the medication and no more contraception. Hopefully an end to my pain.” The dficulty she experienced with her GP was repeated when she told people she wanted to be sterilised.In a Facebook post, she wrote: Back in February I expressed that I had been put on a list to be permanently sterilised. Not just because I didnapost want more children, it was mainly for health reasons.But I expressed how other peopleaposs opinions were the reason I was keeping it quiet because everyone was so vocal about their own concerns. She added: “I haven’t given into this decision lightly, so negative comments about my age or situation haven’t helped. I know sterilisation is final, I know how old I am, and I know I have made the right choice. “I have made this decision for myself. It seems to be natural for a man to have the snip, but a woman taking ownership of her own body is frowned upon.  Even to the point I was told yesterday by another woman during my pre op assessment... you know your partner could get the snip instead  I’ve had men not even knowing what a fallopian tube is and women telling me Iaposm making a mistake because ‘whatI meet a man who wants kidsapos  Responding to these comments, Chrissie says people arenapost conscious of what she wants and needs, given that sheaposs suffered excruciatingly painful periods for  years. People just hear sterilisation and jump straight away to judgement. Especially as I was single when I started this journey, she wrote. But finally, last month, she had the operation to remove her right fallopian tube and part of her left. “Does it make me less desirable because I canapost bear children  Does it make me less than a woman  Will it make me seen as a short term partner instead of a long term partner  “What will people think  Will people pity me because of my situation  Will I regret it  But you know what, I feel relieved, and I feel empowered. “Finally, a step to try and ease the pain I have been experiencing for years. All that worry was about what other people thought again. But I have a boyfriend who is amazing, she wrote. She encouraged people not to judge what others do with their own bodies - and remember that thereaposs a lot we donapost know about what others are going through.Do you have a real le story to share  Email jessica.taylor@reachplcNow in recovery, Chrissieaposs pain hasnapost fully gone away, but itaposs more manageable. Now, she wants to promote equality around fertility issues. She said: “We are approaching . These should not still be issues women are facing to take control of their own bodies. “Nearly every woman has quoted to me, ‘my body my choice’ and I feel empathy for all the women who have thanked me for speaking up about my own experience, as it has given them confidence to speak up about their own. “Being sterilised shouldn’t make me any less of a woman,anything it gives me the ability to be more human.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON NHSHospitalsPeriodsFertility\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The organisation said while it is yet to find any credible evidence of extraterrestrial le, it is not closed to the possibility that aliens exist. It comes from a Nasa report released in November under a Freedom of Information request from GovernmentAttic.org. In a collection of emails, one Nasa official said the earliest alien records are probably ,BC or  AD, or not depending on what science and comments we believe. This was written in relation to the unsolved mystery of a cooking pot in China which dates back to ,BCIts owner asked Nasa for an expert opinion on the potapossUFO artwork depicting symbolic language, hidden meanings, futuristic spaceships and clothes from a vanished civilisation.The official responded: YesI was an alien who visited earth say , years ago or anytime, I too would take a simple thing in front of me like a clay pot to record my visit in multiple aposlanguagesapos or symbols and dimensions and technologies... including D, D, D, D, D, and beyond any comprehension here now.  However, he concluded that the potaposs drawing which defies the laws of physics, showing and aircraft with no motors, wings or tails, must be a unique coincidence. The document also addressed reports of unidentied aerial phenomenon, more commonly known as UFOs. It stated: “When we learn of unidentied aerial phenomena, it opens up the door to new science questions to explore. The language of scientists is data. But without access to full data, it is nearly impossible to very or explain any observation. It went on to highlight that scientic study of UFOs is facing a central problem being the lack of robust data including the lack of access to information that already exists. The revelation comes after a Pentagon report in June revealed what the US government knows about a series of mysterious flying objects that have been observed in military airspaces in recent decades. It looked at  records of sightings of what the government described as an unidentied aerial phenomenon or UFO.  Investigators were able to explain only one of those encounters which was attributed to airborne clutter. There was no evidence which pointed towards aliens or a major technological advancement by a foreign territory, such as China or Russia, as a viable explanation for the sightings. A senior US official said: Of the  reports we are dealing with here, we have no clear indications that there is any non-terrestrial explanation for them, but we will go wherever the data takes us. We don’t have any clear indications that any of these unidentied aerial phenomena are part of a foreign collection programme and we don’t have any clear data that is indicative of a major technological advancement by a potential adversary. Signicant efforts continue to track such developments and officials continue to watch that very carefully they added. Another senior official said that  of the reports show UFOs “that appear to have some sort of advanced propulsion or advanced technology. They also indicated speeds beyond what the US considers to be possible in the realms of foreign adversaries despite having a lack of propulsion or acceleration.

Leo is  of  in the world to be diagnosed with a TBCD gene mutation that affects his brain, central nervous system and muscles. Leo spent nearly four months in the ICU at St. Thomasapos hospital in Lambeth, before being discharged as doctors didn’t know anything more they could do to save him.  Lucinda, who now lives in Chatham in Kent, said: “It was completely unforeseen. When he was born, I was in complete shock. The severity of it didnapost really sink in. I donapost think it really did until I saw him in the incubator with all the tubes and wires. I just burst out crying. “Nothing that could be done because of the rarity of the condition. Even specialists out there that havenapost even heard of this disorder. “Then he was discharged. I was told to enjoy the time that I have with him. Leo requires round the clock care as he suffers with has epileptic seizures and low muscle tone, which means he has dficulty moving and breathing.  Overnight he requires ventilation, which kicks in when he stops breathing when is in a a deep sleep. Lucinda previously worked in hospitality while working abroad in Canada, but came back to the UK have Leo and now is a full-time Mum to him. Despite doctors presenting the option to turn Leoaposs le support machine off in the beginning, Lucinda chose to fight for Leo. While she praised doctors who did their best for him, Lucinda says she “just couldn’t accept that there was nothing that could be done for her son. “I have sent thousands upon thousands of posts and emails all over the world to try and find someone who knew more and could help.” she said. “It’s a deteriorating condition - he will get progressively worse. It could get to the point where he’s too weak to breathe. But I want to get help before his health declines. He is definitely defying the odds right now - I hope he continues to.  “I’ve helped him with physio somewhat - I can get him as strong as physically possible, but without medical help, thereaposs only so much I can do. Due to the rarity of Leo’s conditions, there are very few medical experts on the condition. This also means she is left in limbo, with no one being able to say for sure how long Leo has left. But, despite having no medical background, Lucinda says her fight for Leo engulfed her in research in a bid to do anything that will help him. She said: “I had no medical background before this, but you do become an expert in your child. I have sat down for hours and looked at medical results. I would google each word I didnapost understand and try and put it together in a simplied form to understand what it actually means. I would research how a specic diet might help him, or supplements to make him stronger.  “But I get days when I just feel like Iaposm losing the fight for him. Iaposll pick him up from his cot and hug him and cry. But I use that for my motivation to keep going. I put all that negative stuff to the back of my mind.Lucinda has found some hope in a US biotech company who can research ‘drug re-purposing’ for Leo - whereby drugs to treat other conditions might have unintended benefits. They can also undertake revolutionary treatment to change Leoaposs failing gene to produce the protein that he is lacking. But the treatment costs £, - so she relying on fundraising.  He is my motivation to keep going, Lucinda added. Lucinda has also managed to connect with some of the other parents whose children have the same condition - of which there are only  in the world. She said: They are mostly in the States but thereaposs one in Peru, a couple in Turkey. One mum in particular I became very good friends with and we bounce ideas off each other. She’s been a real rock.You hit so many brick walls when youaposre trying to find a specialist or raise funds to help.

The government hopes that despite new restrictions such as Plan B, as well as further restrictions possible in the form of aposPlan C apos, hospital admissions will be lower due to vaccinations.When the UK was forced to lockdown in  and early , most of the population was unvaccinated against the virus. Receiving the vaccine should not be too much of an inconvenience unless you are someone who may have a reaction to it. Some people have experienced brief, flu-like symptoms after receiving it, but most are expected to be fighting fit and are welcome to socialise after being vaccinated. So can you drink alcohol before and after your vaccine  Can I drink alcohol before or after having the Covid- vaccine   It is probably best to avoid drinking before and after the vaccine and you are only damaging yourselfyou have been drinking excessively. Alcohol may harm your immune response triggered by the vaccine by suppressing your immune system. If your immune system is slower to react, then the effectiveness of the vaccine could be impacted.  As for drinking after receiving the vaccine, people have been known to have side effects caused by the jab. Alcohol will not help any of these symptoms and is not a cure for feeling ill, it is just likely to dehydrate you and you will feel worse. Can alcohol affect the immune system   When a person is exposed to a virus, the bodyaposs antibodies are tasked with fighting off this illness. Healthier people with better and faster immune systems can fight viruses off more quickly. This is why older people are more at risk from viruses like Covid-, as their immune response is typically slower. Yale Medicine addiction medicine specialist Dr. E. Jenner Edelman, told Healthline: Alcohol has erse adverse effects throughout the body, including on all cells of the immune system, that lead to increased risk of serious infections.With COVID-, alcohol is likely to interfere with an inidual’s ability to clear SARS-CoV- and cause people to suffer worse outcomes. What are the side effects of the coronavirus vaccine   In February, around one in three people reported some kind of side effect from the vaccine, including some soreness around the area the needle penetrated the skin. Side effects are caused by the bodyaposs response to the vaccine and not the virus itself.Dr Anna Goodman of Guyaposs and St Thomasapos Hospital, in London, told the BBC that a heavier response to the vaccine does not mean you are more immune to the virus than others.

While taking your dog off its lead is permitted in most UK parks and wooded areas, it is in fact illegal in some spots. In lieu of signs alerting you to restrictions, it is likely fine to let your four-legged friends roam free. However, dogs typically need to be on a lead near roads, footpaths, carparks, play areas and certain ponds or streams at some times of the year. Areas like flower beds, beaches and pitches are usually considered off-limits. And dog owners should keep a keen eye out for signs alerting them to the rules, in case of any other restrictions.  Local authorities also have the power to issue a Public Spaces Protection Order , or Dog Control Order, excluding dogs from certain areas or instructing owners to put them on a lead. These orders also set out rules regarding the maximum number of dogs one person can walk at one time, and rules about dog fouling. The order comes with a maximum fine of £, – which can be issued as a fixed penalty notice in place of a prosecution. Other things you could be fined for under this order include failing to remove dog faeces, not putting and keeping your dog on a lead when asked to do so, permitting a dog to enter land they’re not allowed on, and taking more than a specied number of dogs onto a land.

Gill, who worked as a supervisor in a legal office for  years, was given the crushing news that the cancer had spread to  parts of her body.She did not see a doctor face to face during the pandemic period and when her cancer was found following a private MRI scan, it was already active in  places in her abdomen, reports the Daily Record. Gill, from Perth, Scotland, said she has spent around  hours having chemo but following her last treatment – on Wednesday, the day after her living funeral – she will now take things as they come.  She told the Perthshire Advertiser she had worried about how her son of  and her husband would cope with organising her funeral after she passed away so decided to take an unconventional route. Gill said: “I started to plan my funeral myself. I discovered you could have an option described as ‘direct to ashes’. I did not want my son Ryan faced with a cremation service and a coffin. “Funnily enough, at first I planned a lunch at The Royal George, but I did not like the cake choice, meringues, they offered on the menu. Then I thought, ‘but I won’t be there, so it won’t matter!’ “That set me thinking: whatI was there, whatI could enjoy the gathering of the people who mattered  It was not as though I had lost my capacity to enjoy le as yet, but I had to act fast. “I brought in Maggie Robertson, a celebrant and so began the process of this living funeral.” It was held at Craigie Hill Golf Club on Tuesday and Perth City celebrant Dr Maggie Robertson gave an eulogy. Gill’s childhood friend Susan – who she met aged three – flew in from Texas and pals from Bannatyne’s gym danced in matching t-shirts and masks with Gill’s face on to a live version of the Dolly Parton hit  to , which was sung live by friend Veronica.  There were balloons, a special cake and cousin Kerri arranged a specially-made slide projection of favourite photo moments from her le. A raffle fixed up by fellow cancer sufferer Sandra raised £ for Gill and Robbie to make some memories together in the coming weeks. They plan to go for a break at Gleneagles. To huge applause and cheers, Gill got up and danced herself. The track was Staying Alive. She had saved her energy for this, her big day, attending her own funeral party. There was a meal, laughter and tears and husband Robbie stole the show with a wise-cracking stand-up comedy routine that made light of the very serious situation. A written farewell message from each person there was collected to be put into an album. Celebrant Dr Maggie Robertson , a member of the Good Le, Good Death group, had cancer herself, opting for a double mastectomy. She said: “It was truly amazing what happened for Gill on Tuesday. “She had everything you could wish for and she was on her feet, even having a bit of a boogie. “It was an inspiring occasion, filled with much happiness and unique moments that will live on in everybody’s memory. I feel honoured to have been a part of Gill’s day.”  The cake on Tuesday was an imaginative model of Gill, Ryan and Robbie all sat on a bench. Like they often are, as Gill loves a walk up Kinnoull Hill. Celebration Station in Perth had made the couple’s wedding cake so it was poignant that they also made this one for Gill’s living funeral. A generous group of Fair City and Perthshire businesses donated fabulous prizes to Sandra’s raffle which ensured a fund for Gill’s future happy times was made possible. They were Lorna Davies Florist, KL Nails, The Bulldog Frog, Delicious, Murrayshall House Hotel, Pit Stop Cafe, Donna’s Harbour Cafe, King James pub, Alex Cairncross Jewellers, Taylor’s Hair Luncarty, Willows Coffee Shop, Macrotrition, Latchbrand Domestic Cleaning, cleaning products from Rachael Rush, plus champagne, vodka and ious other gts donated from friends and family.

Just like other families, when the likes of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Charles arrive for the festive season, they come laden with gts for each other.But the rule is reportedly the cheaper and cheekier the present the better - with all manner of wacky and wonderful gts exchanged over the years.  However, there is a very specic time when the gts are opened - and itaposs not when most people open theirs. Rather than race from their bedrooms on Christmas morning to open their presents - they actually do it the day before on Christmas Eve.

It is understood the Queen will travel to Sandringham on or around Friday, December . Royal sources said it was likely she would make a -minute helicopter journey from Windsor, but insisted a traditional journey by train from London to Kings Lynn had not yet been ruled out. A source said: “The Queen has told everyone she is feeling far better of late and is very much looking forward to welcoming them for Christmas.“Like many other families, this will be the first time Her Majesty can gather with her extended family after being kept apart for so long due to the coronavirus pandemic.”Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON SandringhamQueenKate Middleton, Duchess of CambridgeRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Helen Macdonald, , who owned Geronimo, fought a high profile campaign to avoid the alpaca being killed, claiming she was confident he was not infected. But she lost a long legal battle to save Geronimo and the animal was taken away by officials, protected by police, from Miss Macdonald’s Gloucestershire farm last August. It is said that she is now considering taking legal action against the Government. Post-mortem results have found that the alpaca was found to have no trace of bovine tuberculosis after all, the Daily Mail reported.Initial tests on the animal for bovine tuberculosis in September were inconclusive with no lesions found on the lungs or respiratory tract - the most common place for them to be with the disease. But the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairssaid that tuberculosis-like lesions were found on liver and lymph nodes. Further tests to discover whether Geronimo had the disease involving the examination of tissue samples for developing bacteriological cultures, have revealed that the animal did not have tuberculosis.  Geronimo, from New Zealand, was a pedigree alpaca worth £, who had won competition thanks to the quality of his black wool. The eight-year-old twice tested positive for tuberculosis in  but Miss Macdonald disputed the results and a long legal battle went to the High Court where the decision was to kill the alpaca. She claimed Geronimo had given  positives. Thirteen expert vets had called on Environment Secretary George Eustice to stop the killing so that further tests could have been made that could also serve as to give a better understanding of bovine tuberculosis. Defra previously said that while it had sympathy for the case it had to tackle tuberculosis and pushed ahead with the alpaca being put down.

Hereaposs everything you need to know about where to get a lateral flow test, how to read the results and more. Where can you get a lateral flow test   The best place to start is to find outyou are able to get lateral flow tests through your workplace, school or university.However, this option wonapost be available to everyone, in which case they can be ordered from the NHS website.These lateral flow tests will be delivered to your home in a matter of days. If you are unable to use the online service, you can also order them by calling the free number  between am and pm. Luckily, the tests are generally free for all purposes apart from travel. You can also go and collect them in person at pharmacies like Boots or Lloyds, as well as some community centres. Getting tests in this way is also usually free. A pack has seven tests, one for each day of the week. And, in some cases, you will be able to get two packs at once. When should you take a lateral flow test   People who are socialising often should take lateral flow tests regularly, while the new rules also create more times when you need to take them. You mainly need to take lateral flow testsyou are unvaccinated and need a Covid pass, oryou are a close contact of someone who has tested positive, in which case you will need to test every day. If you develop Covid symptoms you will need to take a PCR test, but close contacts with no symptoms will still need to take lateral flows. They are best taken when you are due to go into an area where the spread of the disease is likely to be higher, like places with big crowds or where vulnerable people will be present. Make sure you take your test no more than  hours before the event you plan to attend for the best possible protection. Test results can be registered via the barcode strip by going on the government website. When does an infection show on a lateral flow test  The following day may often be too soon to checkyou picked up the virusyou are worried you came into contact with it. Antigen tests, like lateral flows, are less sensitive than PCRs and so require a higher viral load to show a positive result - this can lead to  positives. However,you do have a positive result on your lateral flow test, you will see a line against both the aposCapos and aposTapos markers on the test, rather than just on the aposCapos marker.So, two lines, eventhey are faint, mean you are positive for Coronavirus and will need to report this on the government website.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Boris JohnsonPublic transportPoliticsCoronavirus testing\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

In , Prince George and Princess Charlotte made their Sandringham public debut when they met well-wishers after the annual religious service at St Mary Magdalene. Holding their proud parentsapos hands, the two adorable children smiled and waved to dedicated fans who waited for hours to see them - and itaposs hoped Prince Louis might join them this year. During their appearance two years ago, Kate colour-coordinated the familyaposs outfits, and they all looked very smart in dark green. And while fans around the world loved their style, it turns out that Kate really regretted her outfit choice for the day, and even told one well-wisher she really shouldnapost have worn it. Kate looked stunning in a heavy grey Catherine Walker coat, with a green hat, bag and heels.But during a quick chat with -year-old fan Rachel Anvil, she admitted it was the wrong choice for the unseasonably warm weather.

Rachelaposs mother told : Kate was talking to my daughter about clothes and how she was feeling too hot, she said aposI really shouldn’t have worn thisapos. I’m there talking to Charlotte about dolls and my daughter’s talking about fashion with Kate. It wasn’t fake it was a genuine discussion, it was about a minute but it was tailored to my daughter, it was like speaking to a friend. They are totally dferent with the public.  Meanwhile, it has been reported that the Queen will be holding her usual family Christmas gathering at Sandringham this year and may make a public appearance for the first time since early autumn.The monarch and late husband Prince Philip spent last Christmas alone as they shielded at Windsor Castle and it turned out to be their final festive season together, as the duke died aged  in April.But it appears the Covid pandemic will not force the Queen, , to cancel her usual family gathering for the second year in a row. According to reports, she is planning to host her family at her Norfolk estate and may even appear in public for the first time in months. The monarch has been resting on doctors’ orders and only carrying out light duties such as audiences since spending a night in hospital for preliminary tests on October , and later spraining her back. She is also preparing to film her Christmas Day message to the nation.

Alice Quaddy had been suffering from a sense of isolation and futility before her death, her dad Brecon said.The -year-old health care assistantaposs mental health was aggravated by the loneliness she felt being on standby at home but often having little work to do, Gloucestershire Live reported. On April  Aliceaposs manager at Cirencester Hospital contacted her mum to say sheaposd not reported for work that day, Gloucestershire Coroneraposs Court heard He said that she had also missed two days earlier that week.The inquest heard that Alice’s parents went straight to their daughter’s flat, but could not get a response.Mr Quaddy used her spare keys to get into the building and on reaching her flat he peered through the letter box and saw his daughter lying leless. He called the emergency services and let the paramedics into the flat, who declared her death at .pm. Speaking after the inquest, Aliceaposs father said: Aliceaposs loss is deeply felt by everyone who knew her.To her NHS colleagues at Cirencester Hospital where she worked as a health care assistant, she was a valued and greatly appreciated member of the team whose death was all the more shocking because it was completely at odds with the Alice they knew.“She bravely fought mental illness for years and she leaves behind an unfathomable hole in the lives of everyone who knew her.Alice was seconded to the NHS internal Covid track and trace programme in Gloucestershire. She wasn’t working on the wards at Cirencester .It was meant for the best, since she was classed as vulnerable to Covid due to earlier physical health issues. Unfortunately, on many days she had few or no calls to make but still needed to remain in her flat alone on standby, a fact that doubtless increased her sense of isolation and futility that was referred to during the inquest.However, we don’t blame the NHS at all for what happened. She was part of a wonderful team. It was the response to Covid. The inquest heard from aposChange Grow Live,apos an organisation that provides drug and alcohol recovery services in Gloucestershire, and was overseeing Alice’s substance misuse after she had self-referred herself to the charity in January of this year.The organisation said Alice was being treated for her cannabis and alcohol misuse.However, her contact had been sporadic until March .At the time of her death she was not being prescribed any medication by the organisation.Alice had told them that she used around one gram of cannabis on a daily basis and only consumed alcohol socially.Alice told her support worker that she suffered from anxiety and depression, but she did not disclose any suicidal thoughts, the organisation added. Police Sergeant Portman told the inquest that he attended Alice’s address and saw her in situ. He saw that she had a number of bruises and self harm marks to her body. There were no visible wounds to suggest that she had been assaulted and no signs of forced entry to the flat. He concluded that there was no third party involvement in Alice’s death, he said.Another police officer discovered Alice’s journal, which revealed the state of mind she was in at the time.A pathologistaposs post mortem report stated that Alice had consumed alcohol and cannabis immediately prior to death and that both substances have intoxicating properties which, when combined, can alter the user’s state of mind.The pathologist believed Alice had not been taking the anti-psychotic drugs that she had been prescribed.He stated that the medical cause of death was the effects of hanging.Assistant coroner for Gloucestershire Roland Wooderson said: “It is quite clear from the evidence that Alice died on April  at her home address. I accept the medical cause of death.”The coroner then offered his condolences to Alice’s family and added that anything he said wouldn’t make anything better for them.*If youaposre struggling and need to talk, the Samaritans operate a free helpline open   on  .

The Market Drayton branch in Shropshire is insulated with British sheepaposs wool and powered by wind turbines and solar  on site. Diners queueing for their Maccas can look out for wildle in the restaurantaposs bioersity garden which collects rainwater from the carpark. It also features a Drive-Thru lane made from recycled tyres, wall art made from used coffee beans and kerb stones made from plastic bottles. The pioneering site opened its doors on December  and will act as a testing site for other industry-first creations. Plans are already in place to replicate its design with the fast food chain aiming to achieve net-zero emissions for all its , UK sites by .  It is designed to retain the familiar McDonald’s look and feel to ensure it can be effectively replicated. McDonald’s Beth Hart said the company believes its food needs to be served in restaurants that are sustainable for the future adding that Market Drayton is a big step towards making that a reality. Other climate friendly features include wall art made from recycled polystyrene cups fixed in lace with starch from McDonaldaposs own potatoes.  The building cladding is made from recycled IT equipment and white household goods like washing machines while its furniture is made from  per cent recyclable materials. McDonaldaposs Simon mcWhirter said: “The challenge of decarbonising the construction industry is a complex one. But McDonald’s commitment to building the first restaurant in the UK in line with UKGBC’s net zero carbon buildings framework is a critical first step. However, campaigners are not convinced by efforts from the food giant which has been accused of greenwashing. Greenpeace describes the concept as a PR tactic thataposs used to make a company or product appear environmentally friendly without meaningfully reducing its environmental impact. Anna Jones from Greenpeace UK told Sky News: If meat and dairy are still the main course on McDonaldaposs menu, then this new restaurant initiative can only be labelled as it is: McGreenwash.

She said: I had been going to my GP numerous times but because of my age and the fact that I had a clear smear they said I didn’t have cervical cancer. They kept sending me for sexual health checks which were coming back clear. “In April this year I was rushed to hospital and developed sepsis from a pelvic infection and at that point I was saying I was experiencing these symptoms and I believed that I had cervical cancer. “The doctor still didn’t believe I had it but agreed to do a biopsy and  weeks later I found out I had cancer. “It really upset me because I had suspicions I had cervical cancer, I was getting symptoms. I was quite angry it hadn’t been detected earlier. “Although it’s a shock to hear I wasn’t shocked because I kind of knew. I was relieved because finally they had found out I had got it.”Since being diagnosed with cancer Leah - who also has Crohnaposs disease - has been documenting her journey on her Instagram page where she keeps her followers informed on how she is doing.She added: “My le is really dferent. It’s monopolised by hospital appointments, lots of scans and waiting around. My le is on hold waiting to see what is going to happen and how I’m going to respond to the treatment.  “I was working before the diagnosis. I have always worked so it’s been dficult for my emotional well-being not being in work or having that routine. Due to the treatment I wouldn’t be able to do my usual job. “At the moment I know they are treating me to hopefully cure me but it depends how well I respond to the treatment. “To the initial chemo my tumour did shrink but it’s still there. At the moment it’s unknown.” It was on her social media where she was approached by a group of men who wanted to raise money for her and another woman who has cervical cancer. Friends James Walker, Daniel Ellams, Connor Flynn and Rob Box are taking part in a triathlon on Saturdayto help raise money for both women.Their JustGiving appeal has already raised over £,.   Leah added: “I was approached on my Instagram page because I document what’s going on and raise awareness of cervical cancer. They asked about wanting to do something. I didn’t know at first. He really wanted to do it. “I was shocked and blown away by it that anyone would want to do that for us. I was taken aback and it’s really lovely. “I love the comments and the messages I have received from people. It’s been amazing. It gets me through and brings me so much positivity knowing that there are so many people out there rooting for me. “The money will cover bills and general expenses. It’s not cheap when you are not at work. I’m not going to be buying a new car or anything, it will go towards the day-to-day living costs and will be a massive help for my family. “I’m blown away by the kindness.

Tressa hit the headlines  years ago when it was revealed she was expecting a baby aged just . She had suffered a damaged childhood - her mum Tracey Tallons struggled with addiction and Tressa was forced to endure late night parties. Her older brother Jason sexually abused her from the age of seven and she fell pregnant by him when he raped her four years later.  She kept the identity of the babyaposs father a secret and the pair were taken into care until - aged  - she broke down and told a social worker what had really happened.

In total,  miles are typically travelled during the month of December alone, as people make the most of their freedom and go to parties, pantos and plays. This equates to a collective .billion miles nationwide, across the million motorists who will take to the road. Almost  miles will be driven visiting friends and family, while a further  miles will be covered shopping for food and gts. To highlight the increase in pollution due to high traffic volume over the Christmas period, energy provider EDF created a Christmas Tree-V on Glasgow’s Buchanan Street - powered by an electric vehicle - and featuring lights, which change colour when polluted fumes are particularly bad.  The light display has been programmed to reflect live pollution data and change colour from green to white, once the World Health Organisation annual mean limit for average pollution levels is exceeded. Philippe Commaret, managing director for customers at EDF, which commissioned the research of , adults who participate in the festivities and own a motor, said: “Santa may not ride an electric sleigh, but increasing numbers of motorists are choosing to drive electric vehicles, with COP encouraging more people to consider the carbon impact of their travel this Christmas. “Thanks to our specially designed Christmas Tree-V, visitors to Glasgow city centre will be able to see pollution levels change throughout the day as the lights change, helping people to see the impact of their transport choices for themselves. Of those travelling in the month of December,  per cent will drive to see festive markets and  per cent usually go to see the Christmas lights. Buying the Christmas tree, a trip to the theatre, and visits to see new releases at the cinema are also common journeys made this time of year. The average motorist will make five shopping trips during the Christmas period - with  per cent of adults making the extra effort to visit high streets over online - to buy their presents. And out of those who are visiting stores for gts,  per cent prefer to buy items in person - with  per cent doing so as part of their Christmas tradition. Of those who are using a car to travel,  per cent said it is much more convenient to use during Christmas time. And four in  don’t have to worry about carrying lots of shopping back homethey drive in, according to the OnePoll figures. A quarter of adults who drive would rather use their car to travel as there are limit public transport alternatives. But, of those who were aware of the COP conference which took place in Glasgow, more than a thirdhad said that it made them more likely to consider their carbon footprint when they travel - and potentially switch to an alternative mode of transport to cut carbon emissions.  A spokesperson for EDF energy added: “We’re committed to making it as easy as possible for motorists to make the switch to an EV and cut their carbon emissions, from car leasing deals to home charging points and % renewable zero carbon EV tarfs.” TOP  REASONS FOR TRAVELLING DURING THE MONTH OF DECEMBER FOR RECREATIONAL AND SOCIAL ACTIVITIES .

He said the new rules are coming into force as the doubling time of the new strain could be between two and three days - meaning its spread will be rapid. Face masks have already been mandatory by law in England’s shops, supermarkets, gt shops, indoor shopping centres, public transport including taxis and indoor stations, banks and post offices since November . They are also compulsory at hair salons, barbers, nail salons, massage centres, tattoo and piercing studios.  You must also wear a face mask during driving tests and lessons - plus at pharmacies, vets, auction houses, retail galleries, takeaways , estate and lettings agents, high street solicitors and accountants. Under-s are exempt and anyone who canapost wear face coverings for medical reasons. But from today they will become mandatory in more venues. They must be worn in theatres, places of worship, cinemas, public libraries or community premises.  Those who do not comply can be fined £ for a first offence , doubling on each repeat offence up to £,. Police will be expected to enforce the rules. But there are exemptions when you are eating, drinking, singing or exercising so face masks are not mandatory in pubs, restaurants or gyms. Secondary schools in England were recommended to ask pupils to wear masks in communal areas and corridors at the end of November. There are reports of talks ongoing about whether to extend this. However there was no immediate announcement.  Under the government’s ‘Plan B’ rules, any contact of a suspected Omicron case will be forced to isolate for  days. Mr Johnson said: “We will reintroduce the guidance to work from home. “Employers should use the rest of the week to discuss working arrangements with their employees but from Monday you should work from homeyou can. “Go to workyou must but work from homeyou can.” However Mr Johnson also said Christmas parties could go ahead but that people should exercise caution. He said: Itaposs OK to keep going with Christmas parties but obviously everybody should exercise due caution, have ventilation, wash your hands, get a test before you go - give everybody  confidence they are going to be meeting somebody who is not contagious.” It came as the PM apologised unreservedly over allegations of a Christmas party held at Downing Street last year when lockdown rules banned social gatherings – but he continued to deny all responsibility.

But a south London pub is hoping to make the Christmas Day more bearable for those spending it alone by offering them a free lunch and some festive company. The Alexandra, known as The Alex by locals, has been offering the meals since  but was forced to skip last year due to the pandemic. This year, managers Sarah and Mick Dore, who have run the bustling pub for the past decade, open their doors to elderly people, those who work in hospitality so canapost travel to see family and many others. Speaking to the Mirror, Sarah explained how it all began. She said: Mick would always tweet out on Christmas day,youaposre on your own come and have a drink. And five or six years ago, a gentleman took up on the offer and was sort of still here when we were closing up the bar, and Mick invited him to have Christmas dinner with us and our family.But he politely declined, saying he had somewhere  to go, but he clearly didnapost have anywhere . She stated how the interaction gave them the idea that for the following year, they would offer not only a Christmas drink but also a meal to anyone who had no plans. And since then, the meals have been a hit, with Mick claiming many have stated it to be the aposbest Christmas meal theyaposve ever had. Mick and Sarah have seen a iety of people come down for many reasons - some had missed the last train home while other simply did not have anyone to spend the day with. Mick said: We had a guy who had missed his train home on Christmas Eve, so he came in and ended up having a good day.  Thereaposs many people who work in retail hospitality who donapost get Christmas off. They have to work Christmas or Boxing Day, so theyaposre stuck at home on their own. But they come in for a meal and end up making friends. Itaposs kind of a bit cheesy, but we always say you come on your own, but you leave with friends. Sarah spoke about how they are urging other to join their fight in combating loneliness. She said: Not everyone can do what we do, but everyone can do just a little bit. Mike added: All of us encounter, specically old people, who want to talk all the time. And weaposre all guilty of giving them a wide berth or cutting the conversation short when weaposre in the supermarket queue. But you might be the only person they have spoken to for days. So we all have a role to play where we could just make a bit of time for people.If youaposd like to volunteer or donate to the cause, The Alex is on Twitter as @TheAlexSW or email alexandra@youngs.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Boxing DayChristmas dinnerChristmas DayMirror More Hopeful\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The pair reside at the Princeaposs Palace in the principality and have started accompanying their dad on royal engagements and visits. This year, Jacques and Gabriella have also had to endure being apart from their mum, who has suffered health issues and is currently receiving treatment for emotional and physical exhaustion at an undisclosed location. This means she is unable to be with them on their big day but sent them a sweet birthday message on Instagram.Hereaposs what we know about Jacques and Gabriellaaposs unique lives so far... An heir for Monaco Jacques and Gabriella are the twin children of Prince Albert II of Monaco and his we of  years Princess Charlene. Albert and Charlene met in  - the same year Charlene represented South Africa in the Sydney Olympics in swimming. They married in July  but there were reports before they tied the knot that she tried to leave Monaco andto South Africa. The Palace dismissed the claims as ugly rumours. Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up. Jacques and Gabriella were born in  at the Princess Grace Hospital in Monaco with Gabriella arriving two minutes before her brother. Despite being slightly younger, Jacques is in fact heir to the Monaco throne due to preference being given to males. The twins also have an older half-brother and half-sister from their fatheraposs previous relationships. However, as Albert never married their mothers, they are not in Monacoaposs line of succession. School le  Like most kids their age, Jacques and Gabriella had been attending school and in a rare update Charlene remarked how her daughter loved her education so much, she wanted to go to school on Saturdays. In September, they were taken for their first day at the private LaposInstitution François d’Assise-Nicolas Barré school by Albert, and looked smart in their unorms. However, earlier this month, Albert revealed he was temporarily pulling the twins out of school so they could study at home instead. Speaking to French magazine Paris Match, he said: Jacques and Gabriella are now being educated at the palace. Albert went on to say the children arenapost learning alone and a small classroom had been set up for them and some friends. Royal appearances  Like young royals in other countries, Jacques and Gabriella have only made rare public appearances. These have included on the balcony of the Princeaposs Palace on Monacoaposs national day each December. And early this month, they accompanied their dad on an official trip to Ireland - one of the first places he visited on a royal tour. Mumaposs health battle  This year has been a particularly dficult one for the young prince and princess, who have spent large periods of time separated from their mum Charlene. Charlene travelled to South Africa earlier this year, but suffered an ear, nose and throat infection while she was there.She had to undergo surgery and was unable to travel back to Monaco, forcing her apart from her children.In August, Albert flew out to South Africa with Jacques and Gabriella and Charlene posted images of them enjoying time as a family on social media.  This led to rumours circulating all was not well in their marriage but Albert told PEOPLE : She didnapost leave Monaco in a huff! She didnapost leave because she was mad at me or at anybody . She was going down to South Africa to reassess her Foundationaposs work down there and to take a little time off with her brother and some friends.It was only supposed to be a week-long, -day maximum stay, and [she is still there now] because she had this infection all these medical complications arose. She didnapost go into exile. It was absolutely just a medical problem which had to be treated. Charlene eventually ed to Monaco in early November and her reunion with her children was described as being filled with joy and emotion.However, just days later, it was revealed that she was in a treatment facility where in Europe. Albert said Charlene was overwhelmed and couldnapost face official duties, le in general or even family le following herfrom South Africa. Last month, while appearing on the balcony of Princeaposs Palace on Monacoaposs national day, her children held up heartrendering signs saying: We love you mummy and we miss you mummy. And although she canapost be with her children on their birthdays today, she wrote on Instagram: Happy birthday my babies. Thank you God for blessing me with such wonderful children. Iaposm truly blessed. Love mom.

But what does that mean for our Christmas plans  Here, Prof Azeem Majeed, professor of Primary Care and Public Health at Imperial College London, answers your questions... I’m having my family over for Christmas dinner, but some of them are unvaccinated. What should I do  People who are unvaccinated are more likely to become infected with Covid- and transmit infection to others.If you have vulnerable family members – such as elderly relatives – joining you for your Christmas dinner, my advice would be for your unvaccinated relatives not to attend. If they do attend, you should aim to reduce the risk of infection by asking them to carry out a lateral flow test before they visit. You should also improve the ventilation in your house as this will also reduce the risk of infection. My elderly mother missed Christmas last year. Can she come round this year  People from dferent households can mix indoors this year, so your mother can come round. Ideally, everyone eligible for a vaccine who is present should be fully vaccinatedand take a lateral flow before your mother arrives.  Children under  are not currently eligible for a vaccine. They should also take a lateral flow test as there is currently a high Covid- infection rate in children. I’ve booked to go with my family of four to a West End musical over Christmas. Can we still go  Theatres remain open. You will be required to wear a mask whilst in the theatre. And it is a good idea for everyone to carry out a lateral flow test before leaving home for the theatre. My work is throwing a big Christmas party for all  employees. Will it still go ahead, andso, will it be safe to go  Christmas parties can still go ahead but many employers are cancelling them because of the risk of infection in crowded, indoor settings, particularly where ventilation is poor. A Covid pass is not required for entry to the party butthe event does go ahead, ideally, everyone attending should be fully vaccinated and take a lateral flow test before the event. If you are clinically vulnerable through age or a medical condition, or live with someone who is clinically vulnerable, my advice would be not to attend the event evenfully vaccinated because of the risks from a breakthrough infection. My department is planning a Christmas lunch with around  people. Is that still allowed  What precautions should we take  Christmas lunches organised by employers can go ahead. Everyone attending should aim to be fully vaccinated and take a lateral flow test before the event. People who are clinically vulnerable – or live with someone who is clinically vulnerable – should consider missing the event.  Will my kids’ school nativity play still be allowed to happen, andso, what extra restrictions might there be  School Christmas plays can go ahead. However, many schools are limiting the number of people who can join the event, meaning that parents may not be able to attend.  If you are allowed to attend, you should wear a face mask and take a lateral flow test before attending. Ensure that you are also fully vaccinated. What precautions should I take when I go Christmas shopping  Wear a face mask whilst indoors and on public transport. An FFP mask provides greater protection and many public health specialists advise the use of these rather than standard surgical masks. Wash your hands or use had sanitiser before and after leaving shops. Is it safe for my children to have friends around to play over the Christmas holidays  Children can have their friends round. A lateral flow test for everyone can help in reducing the risk of infection. Ventilation can also help reduce infection risk. Younger childrenare not currently eligible for a Covid- vaccination. What will happen to the Christmas Eve midnight mass we all normally go to Religious events can still go ahead and are exempt from the from requirements to use the NHS Covid Pass.A face mask will be required whilst indoors in the church, except when singing. To reduce the risk of infection further, everyone attending should be fully vaccinated and take a lateral flow test before attending. Will me and my mates still be able to have our traditional festive drinks evening at the pub  You can still have your festive drinks with your friends. As the venue is likely to have less than  people, the NHS Covid Pass in not needed to enter. A face mask is not required either.  You should remember, however, that indoor events like this carry a risk of infection because the venue may be crowded and social distancing will not be possible. Ensure you are fully vaccinated and use a lateral flow test before the drinks event. Why do we need these new restrictions  The number of Covid- cases in the UK has increased in recent weeks to an average of nearly , per day with the number of cases caused by the Omicron iant doubling about every three days.If this increase continues, Omicron will replace Delta as the most common iant of the Coronavirus in the UK within a few weeks. This is concerning because it looks like our current vaccines may be less effective against the Omicron iant than against the Delta iant. The new measures aims to reduce the risk of infection.  The good news though is that three doses of a vaccineshould continue to provide good protection from serious illness, evencurrent Covid- vaccines are a little less effective against Omicron. Some people with weak immune systems will need four vaccinations before they are fully vaccinated.

Loralie Henry, , has spent more than half of her le in foster care in Los Angeles, Calornia, in the US. She was first put into foster care when she was four before briefly going back to her biological mum and ing to the system aged six. Loralie said: It was actually really scary, too. I didnapost know what to expect in other homes or what they would feed me. I didnapost really know what to do. So I thought, aposWell, what should I do  Is there anyone waiting for me apos I was really scared. Until I met my mom. My second-grade teacher.  Zoe Henry is a teacher and didnapost have any plans to adopt. The single mum says the moment she saw Loralie two years ago she knew she wanted to adopt her.She added to KABC : She came into my class, and I just took one look at her - her little freckles, her little birthmark.I am going to adopt this little girl. Sheaposs my daughter. The minute I set eyes on her.  Zoe thought the little girl would get adopted by another family, but when that didnapost happen she begged social workers to let her adopt. Loralie went to Zoeaposs house two days later. The schoolgirl said: I remember the moment when we were sitting by the car, sheaposs like, aposYouaposre going to come with me.apos I was so surprised and happy. It was like an early present.  Zoe said Loralie has a lot of obstacles but now she is a brave and strong little girl. She added: She is probably the most compassionate person I know. She wants to be a foster mom someday and adopt kids. On November , which is National Adoption Day in the US, Loralie and  other kids were officially adopted by their forever families.  Zoe added: Biological parents have the right to contest. That did not happen. I know her mom really loves her. I know she really wanted to be a better part of her le. But like I tell Loralie, her mom loved her so much that she would let her be adopted so that I can give her what she needed.Matilda is a  American film based on the  Ronald Dahlaposs novel with the same.The young girl has psychokinetic abilities and comes from a disruptive family.During the film, Matilda forms a close bond with her teacher Honey - who goes on to adopt her at the end.

Kazumi, from Florida in the US, was struggling to think of gt ideas for her boyfriend before coming up with the perfect idea - sex with someone . The -year-old, who is in a polyamorous relationship with her boyfriend, recently took him to a legal brothel in the state of Nevada for an early gt. After her partner enjoyed his experience, Kazumi is now looking for her own male sex worker so she can have some fun too. “I’ve been so busy working on my OnlyFans I felt like he needed some extra loving,” Kazumi said, adding she was concerned he was lonely. “My boyfriend is a supportive partner and I feel like sometimes he is shy. She decided to suggest the idea and see what he thought - and he seemed to be interested in the idea. “We have good sex but I wanted him to explore something out of the box,” Kazumi explained. The pair were already in Vegas, so decided to pop into a legal brothel nearby. On arrival, Kazumi stayed in the waiting area while her boyfriend went off and “did his thing” during a  minute appointment. The model added she paid extra for a luxury experience for her partner - as she wanted to ensure both he and the sex worker were as safe and comfortable as possible.  Kazumi is keen to break the stigma around sex work and thinks everyone should have the chance to feel desired - eventhey have to pay for it. She said: “People shouldn’t feel ashamed for buying sex. Many people buy it and a more open conversation can make it less stigmatised. “I’ve always been interested in the sex worker world. If we want something, why not pay for it ethically in a legal brothel  “It’s no dferent to anything  – I know how to cook but sometimes I like to go a restaurant. “I know how to entertain myself but why not buy tickets to an event or watch a movie  “We’re all okay with spending money on things we like, so why not sex as long as it’s done in a safe, legal, and consensual manner  She added: A lot of people have knee jerk reactions to buying intimacy – but there really is no reason to hold that stigma when we buy everything .” Her boyfriend had such a great time enjoying his gt that Kazumi is now looking for her own sex worker to have fun with. “Maybe it’ll be his Christmas present to me,” she said.

Brooke Barclay says sheaposs been accused of lying about being pregnant for attention and told she must be starving herself due to her small frame.The -year-old from Edinburgh, Scotland, was overjoyed when she discovered she and partner Liam, , were expecting their second child. She is currently  weeks pregnant, but her stomach is nowhere near the size that many people usually expect at that point along.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox. for a Mirror newsletter here.Brooke, who is already mum to Leighton, three, says she first noticed her belly wasnapost getting very big at her -week gender scan, her tummy was still completely flat.However, this was something she had expected as she also experienced it during her first pregnancy.The mum explained that the reason for her smaller bump is due to her tilted uterus - and not anything to worry about.A tilted uterus means that the womb tips backwards at the cervix instead of forward, so a pregnant womanaposs baby will sit towards the back rather than the front. Brooke, who worked as a COVID- testing operative before her maternity leave, said: The reason behind me having a smaller baby bump is because I have a tilted uterus. I found this out during my last pregnancy, and it doesnapost affect the baby at all. This is common and normal, and it is how some women donapost even know they are pregnant until labour. After sharing footage of her baby bump to social media, Brooke said she was hit with mean comments, with people saying she must be aposstarving herselfapos. Others even said she must be aposlyingapos about being pregnant to get attention. Now Brooke is sharing her story in the hopes to raise awareness about the reality of having a tilted uterus and to show that not all pregnant bellies look the same.  She added: So I decided to post a TikTok at  weeks pregnant, not expecting more than my friends and family to see it. But after a couple of weeks, the views started to go up and the comments flooded in. It had a total of . million views. People were saying I was lying or starving myself and even wearing a waist trainer. There were a lot of people thinking they knew my body more than me and were telling me that I am going to have a tiny baby. These comments didnapost bother me really I knew my baby was growing fine and healthy. People automatically assume that having a tiny bump means there is something wrong with me or the baby but that really isnapost the case at all. I just wish people wouldnapost judge right away. Everyoneaposs body is dferent, and that doesnapost mean Iaposm unhealthy or underfeeding myself and baby. The expectant mum added that she and Liam are very excited to welcome their second little one. We were extremely happy finding out we were pregnant again. We had been planning and trying for just a couple of months. Even though the nerves kicked in about having two children, we still cannot wait to meet our new boy.So far, the pregnancy has been healthy but dficult, with constant morning sickness all the way through, a lot of back pain and heartburn to go with it.

It uses antibodies extracted from ostrich eggs from birds that have been injected with an inactive, non-threatening form of Covid.  Ostriches are capable of producing dferent antibodies neutralising foreign entities in the body. By spraying the antibodies on a filter from a mask, the reaction can detect whether the virus is present. President Tsukamoto and the group explained that they experimented over ten days with  Covid patients. They found that the masks they wore glowed under UV light.  The researchers said: The ostrich antibody for corona placed on the mouth filter of the mask captures the coronavirus in coughing, sneezing, and water. aposaposNext, a fluorescent dye-labelled ostrich antibody is reacted and the virus is visualised by irradiating with light. We also succeeded in visualising the virus antigen on the ostrich antibody-carrying filter when using the LED ultraviolet black light and the LED light of the smartphone as the light source.  This makes it easy to use on the mask even at home. Visualisation of the illness is possible. The presence of the virus can also be confirmed from the ostrich antibody-carrying mask used by a person infected with the new coronavirus for eight hours. There are plans to sell inspection kits to the general public in Japan and further afield, potentially even this year, once a patent has been secured for the technology.

It was dark in colour and resembled a Batman mask covering large parts of her young faceLittle Luna before her surgery Image: Carolina Fenner  SWNS.COMByKelly-Ann MillsReporter:,  Dec | commentsA two-year-old girl who had a birthmark on her face which resembled a Batman mask has had it removed in a pioneering operation. Little Luna Taes-Fenner had a huge nevus birthmark covering her nose and eyelids, and had made regular visits from her home in Florida to Russia to have treatment. She had been receiving photodynamic therapy - a treatment not yet available in the US. Her doctor Pavel Popov said: “Luna has already started speaking and she says herself: ‘My black spot has gone. I am a princess’.” The surgery took place at a clinic in Krasnodar - a Russian city close to Ukraine amid high tension between the two countries.  And there has been a heartwarming result from the Russian medical treatment, which medics say has prevented possible skin cancer for the toddler. We only had six operations to remove the nevus and have succeeded in making it disappear,” Dr Popov said. “The main medical part of the task is done. This does not mean that we have finished treatment. “We are letting Luna rest from the treatment she has undergone and then we will undertake the aesthetic surgeries. “Later we aim to make sure Luna will not have any complexes when she comes to the age where she is concerned about her appearance.” The doctor had no hesitation in saying the treatment was a “success”. “I am completely satisfied with the result of the surgery,” he said. “Luna is very loyal to us. Often there is an aversion to the medical staff. “Children are afraid of doctors, but Luna brings her dolls to the appointment every time and asks me to treat their faces. “I attach a plaster to the dollaposs face. Luna is happy that the doll is also treated. “I guess the lack of pain in the treatment allows her to be so loyal. I canapost tell you how long the cosmetic part of Lunaaposs treatment will take.  “It depends on too many factors - pandemics, lockdowns, visas.” However, he is sure it will bring great results for Luna. The girl’s mother said she was grateful for the treatment not involving an invasive and “aggressive” surgery, which would have been the case where. Luna is good now,” she said. Her bandages are off. “Weaposre going to fly away for Christmas and come back for the final cosmetic surgeries at the end of January. “I don’t regret at all having the treatment here. Luna doesnapost feel the pain. She dances a few hours after the surgery.” Carolina, a US citizen originally from Brazil, and her husband Thiago Taes, , raised tens of thousands of dollars for their daughter’s treatment in Krasnodar and also had the support of an anonymous Russian donor which they called a “miracle”.

It would almost be better to have a regulation and a furlough scheme.#Sharing doubts over what number of people and what premises they attended actually constituted a #party#, he added: #Given that it#s best according to the authorities to avoid party situations then from a business point of view, we need support.#We need some clarity followed by some support.#The BID chairman#s comments came as leaders of all four UK nations are set to meet to discuss the rising levels of the new Omicron iant of COVID-.

We are well underway with our vaccination boosters and aim to have all booster vaccines administered by the middle of January with all appointment letters out before Christmas.#From tomorrowall household contacts of confirmed cases, Omicron or not, need to isolate for  days regardless of vaccination status or a negative PCR result. Non-household contacts can end isolation after receiving a negative PCR resultdouble vaccinated and have no symptoms.#These changes to isolation for household contacts of COVID- will have an impact across the community, and NHS Orkney has robust business continuity plans to help us deliver our key services.

There were no help groups, no mental health care, back then.“We went to my grannys to live for a while and then we came back to the house, the three of us, and that was it. It was a case of paddle your own canoe, really.“My dads going out to work every day as a painter and decorator and we were two young boys going out to school.“Its really just about capturing that time and the values he taught us as kids without ever really knowing he was doing it - or us realising what he was doing. The behaviours, we just kinda copied him.“Thats what I realised as I started to right this thing, that this is what it was...”Ironically, it was his grand daughters prompting that convinced him to put pen to paper in the first place.“About a year ago, my eldest grand daughter said to me - grandad, remember all the old stories you used to tell us when we were kids, about our grandad, racing the pigeons. She told me one of them, almost word for word. I thought, I really must capture those for posterity, for the family. RETIREMENT “Obviously, when retirement and lockdown came into play I had a lot more time on my hands so I sat down at the laptop to fiddle about and to write these wee stories.“As I started, this thing just took on a le of its own and became something completely dferent which was kind of a surprise to me, but a very pleasant surprise, as I really enjoyed writing it.”And I really enjoyed reading it, this simple tale of a hard-working father and his two sons making their way in the world.But the real stars of the book are the pigeons to whom Frankie cleverly lends human traits, such as the ability to talk - characters like Proud Boy, Warhorse and Bootsy.And, of course, Princess Sofia, who we come to learn resembles Frankie’s own mother.The trials and tribulations of the loft in attempting to win the biggest prizes in the sport resemble the struggles faced by Frankie’s family in an era when times were tough.But this isn’t a depressing tale rather, it is an uplting story of how families and, by extension, close-knit communities bandied together to overcome adversity. With a healthy dose of pigeon racing nostalgia thrown in for good measure.“Whilst some of the pigeon names and details have been changed the book is based on true le events,” continues Frankie.“It was never my intention to get the book published, I only started writing it as something to give the grandkids. “I really dont care about the business side of things – its just nice that people can read about my father.“I suppose people are quite surprised about the book but there’s more interest there than anything which is great.“Depending on the feedback who knows, there might even be a second one.”‘The Penzance Smash,’ published by Austin McAuley is out now."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1639060616576.jpg--covid_19___thu_9th_december_figures.jpg?1639060617000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20211209newscovid 19 thu 9th december figures","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows four further coronavirus related deaths and  new positive test results.

It was all about the opportunities’ - young people on leaving NI behindTwo young people share their experience of moving away to join the ‘brain drain’ from Northern IrelandExpandExpandPreviousNext\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseFionnuala Ward, from Magherafelt, now living and working in London as a concert pianist.Donal Magee, who left Northern Ireland to live and work in England a year ago this week. FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueFionnuala Ward, from Magherafelt, now living and working in London as a concert pianist.Mark BainTwitterEmailDecember   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailDonal Magee , originally from Newry left Northern Ireland a year ago this week and said it was a mix of reasons combined that led to his le changing move.For Fionnuala Ward , from Magherafelt, who moved to the mainland ten years ago as she began university, there was richer stream of opportunities to showcase her musical talent and thoughts of moving back home were far from her mind.They are just two of the younger generation who have joined the so-called ‘brain drain’ across the Irish Sea.Earlier this week research from think tank Pivotal found that young people don’t feel properly represented by politics here saying it fails to devote adequate time to issues they care about such as building a good economy, women’s rights and climate change.Ongoing ‘orange and green’ issues are as much to blame for Northern Ireland’s youth drting away as the economy, the study revealed.But the idea of political ision continuing to blight the lives of the young appears more of an afterthought for both. The role of ision in making the initial decision to move may be overplayed and only when looking back do they realise the limitations they’ve left behind.“I left Northern Ireland a year ago this week,” said Donal.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “I had been planning to move as my girlfriend had got an engineering job just outside Oxford, however, due to the pandemic we had both been working from home so there was real rush to move.“I worked as an assistant accountant in Belfast and due to outsourcing I was made redundant, so that was the kicker to finally get me to leave Northern Ireland and use the redundancy money to set myself up in England.“I came over to England and now live in Swindon and initially got a job in accounting but realised that I hated it and then moved onto work an entry level job in the finance department of a tech company.“I left an industry I had been in for years and went to an entry level job and even at that I am now on  grand more than I was in Belfast and my rent cost only went up by  a month so the money alone could have been a reason to leave,” he said.For Donal, it was only after spending some time in England that he looked back on his le in Northern Ireland and his eyes opened to the dference in culture and community.“When I left I never really considered the political discourse something that bothered me,” he said.“I just ignored it for the most part, but, since moving I have become so aware of how many things I did back home because of the religious and political split.“I don’t have to worry about what jersey I wear when I go out into town, I don’t worry about telling strangers where I came from and unlike when I moved from West to East Belfast I didn’t have to stop giving out my name to people.“The move was genuinely one of the best things that have ever happened to me,” he said.“I’m in a better job, I feel safer in my surroundings and I’m more comfortable talking to people I meet without the voice in the back of my head trying to tellthey won’t like me because I’m from Newry, or because I have a Catholic name.”There does remain one thing he misses from home, the craic.“I would say the only thing that is a step down are that culturally the South of England seems to be a lot more closed off, nothing quite like the Belfast banter with strangers.”Growing up in the south Derry town of Magherafelt, Fionnuala Ward was quickly making a name for herself as a talented musician.She was named Northern Ireland’s Young Musician of the Year . As a schoolgirl her prowess on the piano even saw her play for the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh at Hillsborough Castle during a royal visit. Music was always going to be a career path.“I left in  for university,” she said, one of many who found that the courses offered at universities on the UK mainland provided a wider gateway to a successful career.“I went to study piano performance at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland in Glasgow, knowing that I wouldn’t be moving home again, because the classical music opportunities just aren’t there.“I’ve since moved to London in , and plan on staying here indefinitely.”The London move was to begin her Masters Degree at the Royal College of Music. Now graduated from the college she always said was her ‘Hogwarts dream’ she often takes her place alongside some of the best talent in Britain with the London Philharmonic Orchestra.For Fionnuala the opportunity of starting fresh was the real draw. Staying at home in Northern Ireland would have kept her off the radar, struggling to make an impression in her own country, let alone on an international stage.“Political ide didn’t really come into play,” she said, “it was all about the opportunities. I have a very Nationalist Catholic name, sothat has had any influence on my prospects back home then that’s to be expected, and has been out of my control.“In my experience, the few opportunities at home seem to favour those who are from Belfast east of the Bann.“It has been tough but very rewarding to take strides in another country, and make a fresh name for myself off my own back.”The research from Pivotal found that there are both “pull” factors which entice young people away, such as a broader range of university courses and the prospect of better job opportunities.It also identied “push” factors which actively encourage them to get out of Northern Ireland, such as poor community relations, the unresolved social legacies of segregation, and the perception that young people’s priorities are not represented by local politicians.For these two, at least, it’s the pull of the greener grass of career prospects that decided their futures away from home.Any thoughts of the political ision push come afterwards when they’ve shaken off the baggage of a young person living in Northern Ireland.Most ReadCoronavirus NI: Shut pubs and restaurants now to prevent new lockdown, says public health expertSinn Fein’s John O’Dowd attends Craigavon hospital due to Covid-Shared island already exists, Patrick Kielty saysPSNI say body found in Tollymore in search for missing German-born computer expert Bernard SankeGruesome details of how former UDA leader Johnny Adair carried out his first murder revealed in new bookTop VideosPlayTake a look inside the former Tesco store in Belfast’s city centre which will be an event space over ChristmasPlayWatch: Passengers given sick bags as flight attempts to land at Dublin Airport during Storm BarraPlayFirst Minister and Deputy First encourage people to take up both doses of the Covid- vaccine and the booster dose when eligibleLatest Northern Ireland‘We have come so far’ in making Northern Ireland fixtures a welcome place for all, says Gerry Armstrong as anthem debate comes under the spotlight-year-old paedophile father gets  years for attack on his -day-old baby sonNo plans to change Covid restrictions over Christmas, says First MinisterRelatives of Troubles victims protest against Government legacy plansStormont’s draft budget would see £ billion spent on health in three yearsLatestGhislaine Maxwell told girl, , to undress and massaged her breasts, court told‘We have come so far’ in making Northern Ireland fixtures a welcome place for all, says Gerry Armstrong as anthem debate comes under the spotlightFrance to ask for EU legal actionUK does not show ‘goodwill’ in fishing talksDai Young calls for Government help as Cardf six face extended quarantineFrank MitchellOpinionI should have known better than to think it was okay to let Simon in on the Santa secret,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

And it felt good,” Mr Kielty added.“I know that sharing isn’t easy, offering up something that you would rather hang on to.“A shared island means challenging ourselves to go beyond our own comfort zones.“What we are prepared to give up to make things better for others, and ourselves.“In this year of centenaries, it’s easy to honour the ghosts of the past, it’s easier to sing a rebel song about a united Ireland than decide not to sing it in order to have one. Yet, we have to be honest with each other about who we are, how we feel and it’s not just trauma that gets passed down, it isn’t just a northern thing.“Across this entire island, not talking and not engaging means that other things get passed down too – one-sided history, stereotypes and, maybe the worst of all, apathy.“It’s easy in a post-Brexit world to sit in Dublin and say the British Government doesn’t care about north when the truth is for many people in the Republic, they aren’t particularly interested in it either.”\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming bb .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_fdb-e-af-d-bf_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming bb .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_fdb-e-af-d-bf_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming bb .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_fdb-e-af-d-bf_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming bb .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_fdb-e-af-d-bf_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Patrick Kielty said apathy is a great danger PA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":truePatrick Kielty said apathy is a great danger  He added: “Say this quietly but the shared island we are talking about is is already happening today just up the road.

This is the best way to ensure we support those businesses which were impacted hardest by the pandemic.“While the vast majority have received and used their cards, not everyone received their cards as early as we would have wished.Therefore in order to offer these applicants more time to maximise the support for our high street businesses, I am extending the deadline to use the Spend Local cards to midnight on December .Most ReadCoronavirus NI: Shut pubs and restaurants now to prevent new lockdown, says public health expertSinn Fein’s John O’Dowd attends Craigavon hospital due to Covid-Shared island already exists, Patrick Kielty saysPSNI say body found in Tollymore in search for missing German-born computer expert Bernard SankeGruesome details of how former UDA leader Johnny Adair carried out his first murder revealed in new bookTop VideosPlayTake a look inside the former Tesco store in Belfast’s city centre which will be an event space over ChristmasPlayWatch: Passengers given sick bags as flight attempts to land at Dublin Airport during Storm BarraPlayFirst Minister and Deputy First encourage people to take up both doses of the Covid- vaccine and the booster dose when eligibleLatest Northern IrelandNew Covid restrictions not inevitable, says Health Minister‘We have come so far’ in making Northern Ireland fixtures a welcome place for all, says Gerry Armstrong as anthem debate comes under the spotlight‘Political ide didn’t come into play.

Pic: Mark Marlow Pacemaker Press.“I felt we were at a disadvantage in the anthem, because I could see how other countries would either sing their anthem or display real patriotism, you know, a real togetherness, real emotion during the anthem. And we never really got that,” O’Neill told ‘A Game of Two Halves’.“When I came in I could see that a lot of the players from nationalist backgrounds would stand with their head down.“So we made sure that the players linked, first of all, it was very important. And that the nationalist players were requested that, whilst they may not sing the anthem that they would respect it and they would stand with their head not bowed.”Meanwhile, football agent Gerry Carlile suggested playing both God Save the Queen and the Republic’s Amhrán na bhFiannbefore Northern Ireland games.Read MoreNorthern Ireland football anthem debate: play God Save the Queen and Soldier’s Song says Gerry CarlileArmstrong, who is originally from west Belfast and played Gaelic games before forging a career in football, said while he welcomes the debate, he endorses “%” the work made in making Northern Ireland fixtures a welcome place for all.Irish FA chief executive Patrick Nelson told the Belfastthe governing body has worked incredibly hard over many years to ensure football “really is for all” in Northern Ireland.“Our new corporate strategy, due to be launched early next year, will again underpin that and we want the National Football Stadium at Windsor Park to be a place welcoming to fans from every walk of le,” he added.Armstrong, who scored one of his country’s most famous goals in a - victory over Spain in the  World Cup, said he knows how far “we have come” since the dark times and believes everyone is made to feel welcome at Windsor Park.“Windsor Park is a place where people can go and enjoy themselves,” said Armstrong.“Our fans are the best fans in the world. I have travelled with them all over Europe, I’ve travelled with them to every country, and they are a credit to us and they always have been.“There’s been so much progress made and I just see the positive side to it now.”Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseFormer NI international Gerry Armstrong. FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueFormer NI international Gerry Armstrong.Commenting on the God Save the Queen debate, Armstrong said the Irish FA could possibly introduce a sporting national anthem.Referring to a previous radio discussion with former Ulster and Ireland rugby player Trevor Ringland, Armstrong looked at how the Irish Rugby team sings Ireland’s Call before their fixtures as a way to accommodate Ulster unionists.“I think it would be a good ideawe had our own sporting national anthem and Trevor said, ‘why don#t we have We’re Not Brazil We’re Northern Ireland’,” he continued.“That might be pushing it a bit far but there might be a possibility we could do that from a sports point of view.“It’s good that people are even talking about it and looking at the possibilities to try and improve any situation.“But I am very happy in that anybody can go to Windsor Park and enjoy themselves.“There’s a great atmosphere and great fans. It’s a place where anybody can go - families the whole lot. I endorse that %.”Gary McAllister, the chairman of the Amalgamation of Official Northern Ireland Supporters’ Clubs, said fans have worked hard to “challenge and eradicate sectarianism” from international matches.“We#re extremely proud of the role we#ve played in helping to bring that about,” he continued.“That work, in partnership with the IFA’s Community Relations Department, has been widely recognised and praised for many years.“I believe that Northern Ireland matches and Northern Ireland fans are viewed very dferently today than we were  years ago, very much for the better.”“I think that Northern Ireland fans should continue to be proud of where we are today compared to where we once were,” he added.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseThe Northern Ireland team line-up for the national anthem before a Fa World Cup qualier against Italy in Belfast.

Photo: Getty ImagesDecember   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailThroughout the pandemic, we have been told our actions and decisions on public health measures will be led by the science.But what happens when even the scientists don’t have the answers At a media briefing with the chief medical officer and chief scientic adviser earlier this week, neither were able to say with certainty what Omicron means for Northern Ireland.They were able to tell us it will likely be the dominant iant here at some stage shortly after Christmas and that modelling is currently being updated to try and forecast its impact.Even with this work ongoing, a Department of Health document this week made some worrying predictions.Prior to the arrival of Omicron here, hospital occupancy was below the least severe scenario, it said.Not exactly a comforting assessment of the current state of the health service.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up More concerning, however, it warned: “It is anticipated that this picture will change rapidly with the emergence of Omicron.”At the moment, we are very much reliant on watching the pandemic pan out in South Africa, where Omicron was first identied.It appears to be infecting younger age groups, but that has tended to be the pattern with earlier iants, and the infection inevitably makes its way into older, more vulnerable age groups.Not enough time has passed yet to accurately assess the impact on hospitalisations and there is some suggestion that Omicron leads to less severe illness than Delta.If indeed this is the case, there are some who have celebrated this as a positive development, but it must be tempered by the real possibility that Omicron is more infectious than Delta.If this is the case, as the maths suggests, the effects would be disastrous.For example,Delta infects , people and % of them require hospitalisation, that would mean  Covid- patients taking up beds.Turning to Omicron,it infects , people and % need hospital treatment, that would mean an additional  Covid- inpatients for a system already stretched to breaking point.The argument for taking quick and decisive action was made on Thursday night, with Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the World Health Organization, appealing to countries to act now.“Even though we still need answers to some crucial questions, we are not defenceless against Omicron or Delta,” he said.“The steps countries take today and in the coming days and weeks will determine how Omicron unfolds.“If countries wait until their hospitals start to fill up, it’s too late. Don’t wait. Act now.”Returning to the science, this seems like a logical argument to make.We know there is a lag time between infection and hospitalisation, and a further period before patients become so unwell that they require critical care or even die.By the time we get clear answers about the danger posed by Omicron, with a doubling rate believed to be in the region of three days, it will already have a firm hold on the Northern Ireland population.What we do now decides the trajectory of the pandemic in the weeks and months ahead.So, why isn’t the Executive taking more decisive action now to slow the spread of a iant that could potentially cause disaster There are cynics who believe the emergence of Omicron has come at a convenient time to encourage more people to be vaccinated and adhere to the likes of face coverings.But in reality, it couldn’t have come at a worse time for politicians eager to keep voters on side.Here we are, two weeks before Christmas with thousands of people preparing to travel around the UK to reunite with family and friends.At the same time, financial supports such as furlough have ceased and we are trying to rebuild our fragile economy, while also attempting to find a balance between social mixing over the festive period and suppressing an airborne virus.After almost two years of draconian restrictions, people are fed up and an increasing number are rebelling against, ignoring, or simply forgetting even the most basic public health measures.All this at a time of waning immunity and while the health service copes with normal winter pressures, an exhausted workforce and the consequences of spiralling hospital waiting lists.Even a small rise of Covid- inpatients could prove to be too much for the NHS.Yet, move now on restrictions and it turns out Omicron isn’t such a disaster after all and the politicians will never be forgiven by the voting public.However, put in place additional measures now that actually stop the health service from collapsing in January and there will be plenty who will complain the absence of a crippling Covid- wave is proof they were never required in the first place.Isn’t it the case that health minister Robin Swann is still being pilloried for his warnings of a Covid- death toll of biblical proportions as he made the case for lockdown Another factor likely to be playing a role in how the Executive responds is whether Westminster will fund support packages for businesses affected by any measures put in place now.The chances of Boris Johnson loosening the purse strings to cover the cost of our Omicron strategy while similar measures aren’t in place in England are remote.Ultimately, and probably most importantly, who wants to be the politician seen to be cancelling Christmas The Executive didn’t want to do it last year and that was without an Assembly election just months away.Most ReadCoronavirus NI: Shut pubs and restaurants now to prevent new lockdown, says public health expertSinn Fein’s John O’Dowd attends Craigavon hospital due to Covid-Shared island already exists, Patrick Kielty saysPSNI say body found in Tollymore in search for missing German-born computer expert Bernard SankeGruesome details of how former UDA leader Johnny Adair carried out his first murder revealed in new bookTop VideosPlayTake a look inside the former Tesco store in Belfast’s city centre which will be an event space over ChristmasPlayWatch: Passengers given sick bags as flight attempts to land at Dublin Airport during Storm BarraPlayFirst Minister and Deputy First encourage people to take up both doses of the Covid- vaccine and the booster dose when eligibleLatest Northern IrelandNew Covid restrictions not inevitable, says Health Minister‘We have come so far’ in making Northern Ireland fixtures a welcome place for all, says Gerry Armstrong as anthem debate comes under the spotlight‘Political ide didn’t come into play.

New travel restrictions introduced for arrivals into Ireland, amid fears over the Omicron iant, have made predicting passenger numbers more dficult, Dublin Airport said in a statement.

Primark shops in the Netherlands have been hit by restrictions in trading hours, in Germany customers need vaccine passes, while its five shops in Austria have all closed. But in the months ahead things are unlikely to get worse than they were at the same time last year, when most of the chain’s shops were closed. Between December and April sales are expected to be “signicantly better” than in the same period a year earlier, AB Foods told shareholders. The business also has several other wings, including grocery, sugar, ingredients and agriculture businesses. These have all traded in line with expectations since the start of the financial year in September. “We are experiencing the impact of widely reported port congestion and road freight limitations and our businesses have been working hard to overcome these dficulties,” AB Foods said. “We have seen an escalation in the cost of energy, logistics and commodities and we have been implementing plans to offset these through operational cost savings and, where necessary, the implementation of price increases.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeWoman in critical condition following four-vehicle road crash overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Specsavers is encouraging avid readers to have regular eye tests so they can continue to indulge their hobby. Presbyopia is the gradual loss of our eyes’ ability to focus close up as the lens becomes less flexible. A natural part of ageing, it usually becomes noticeable around the age of . The condition is common and typically isn’t a cause for concern. But some struggle to adapt, and find they need to hold their book at arm’sto read the page or direct a light on it to see the words more clearly. For most people, the answer is a simple eye test which will identythey need reading glasses, multi-focal glasses or contact lenses to make words clearer – and le easier. Maeve Walsh, director at Specsavers Crescent Link in the Waterside and Ferryquay Street in the city centre, says: “It can sometimes be dficult for people to assess themselves whether they have presbyopia, which is why we always encourage regular eye tests, usually every two years. “As we age, it’s completely natural for our eyesight to worsen and it shouldn’t be something we worry about, providing our eyes are in good health. “My advice to those with presbyopia would be to carry your specs with you at all times and get into the habit of having them close by. This will help with activities like reading, and will also ensure you’re not straining your eyes, which can sometimes cause other problems.” To find out more about presbyopia, or to book an eye test visit:https:www.specsavers eye-health presbyopiaandwww.specsavers stores derryorwww.specsavers stores crescentlink Top five signs you have Presbyopia .

Reporter: Staff Reporter Dec   addthis, Lynch’s, the local family retailer which operates a number of Spar and Eurospar stores and supermarkets, have opened their third local supermarket bringing their total store number to eight across the North West and Mid Ulster. googletag.cmd.push Lynch’s Eurospar, Greysteel is the third outlet from the retailer to open under the popular Eurospar brand and has allowed management to more than double the number of jobs available, now employing  locally. Acquiring what was previously a Centra store on the site, company director Paul Lynch says the community needed a larger format supermarket brand that would not only bring a host of fresh and local produce and ranges, but would be convenient and complemented with services vital to the local area. Paul said: “We have invested around pound, to bring our supermarket experience to the Greysteel area and are so proud to open the doors. “We have more than doubled the size of the space which allows optimum navigation throughout the aisles, where shoppers will find an increased iety and range of fresh and local foods including our own meat offering and pre-packed ranges. “Importantly, we have continued the on-site partnership with Nicholl Fuels to offer locals a -hour fuel service with pre-pay pumps and we have  parking spaces to allow shoppers to conveniently load their cars safely.” The team has also retained important services including the Post Office, ATM, Lotto and PayPoint and added even more amenities and initiatives to bring value and choice to the area. The deli now serves an extended range of hot and cold food to go alongside Barista Bar coffee and Spar bakery, and shoppers can take advantage of the many deals available including the current  Deals of Christmas campaign which drops the price of big name items and festive essentials every week in the lead up to Christmas. Paul continued: “Eurospar also price matches over a thousand branded products to Tesco each week, so paired with our consistent schedule of value deals, we’re bringing a huge amount of savings for shoppers.” As is the Lynch and Eurospar ethos, the team in-store will implement outreach initiatives with the local community, sponsoring and supporting local clubs and organisations, while also fundraising for charity partner Cancer Fund for Children. Paddy Doody, sales and marketing director at Henderson Group, which owns the Eurospar brand in Northern Ireland added: “We now have  Eurospar supermarkets in Northern Ireland, each one bringing a wealth of convenience in a large format supermarket to their areas. “The Lynch’s are experienced independent retailers and know how to engage with their local communities, with an incredibly high bar set for customer service. “Its fantastic to see the Eurospar brand thriving under our independent retailers and we wish Lynch’s the best of luck with their new business.” The new supermarket in Greysteel joins Lynch’s portfolio of stores including Eurospars in the Skeoge area of Derry and Draperstown in Magherafelt, plus Spars in Dungiven, Claudy, Newbuildings and Trench Road in Co Derry, and Clonoe in Coalisland.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeWoman in critical condition following four-vehicle road crash overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

It also states the need for increasing the notication period for utility companies to implement price rises and introducing a cap on energy company profits. On publishing the report, Ms McLaughlin said:“Households across the North are struggling right now. Between the cut to Universal Credit, increasing national insurance contributions, the runaway cost of oil, gas and electricity, people are finding it really dficult to make ends meet. To date, our First Ministers have shown no political will or, it has to be said, interest in tackling it. “The SDLP is publishing this action plan, setting out our view on how hard-pressed households can be supported in the short and long term. This includes direct support by extending the Winter Fuel Payment to Universal Credit recipients who have already had their payments cut by the Tory Government and facilitated by Sinn Feacutein Ministers. We are also proposing a Warm Home Discount Scheme that would reduce energy costs by facilitating the installation of insulation while decarbonising our housing stock. “We are also seeking to reform the structural issues that have led to successive price rises at short notice to households. That should include extending the period that companies must give notice to consumers before a price rise takes effect. This will allow families time to prepare for signicant increases rather than being caught on the hop at times like Christmas when energy use is traditionally higher. “I don’t believe that the First Ministers understand the scale of this crisis.

Niamh said: “I want to model full time which is one of the reasons I entered the competition. I model around Derry and Belfast and one of the photographers I work with in Derry sent me a link online to enter the competition. “The next day the organiser of the competition, Greg, rang me and told me I was accepted and walked me through the next steps. “It was my first ever show and I had no experience in runway modelling. I wanted to enter because I thought it would be a great way to get experience of runway modelling and performing in front of crowds. It’s also a great way to get more exposure all around Ireland and beyond.” In a normal year, without Covid restrictions, the competition normally has three stages A photoshoot workshop, a fitness workshop and then the finals. This year, due to Covid, there was one photoshoot workshopin October last year in Dublin and the fitness workshop was cancelled as it wasn’t possible to do with social distancing. The finals which were originally supposed to be held in December  but they were delayed to January this year as a result of lockdown. This was then delayed again to allow for a more normal setting for the finals. Niamh continued: “The finals took place this weekend, December , so it’s been a long road. “The competition is full of challenges and tests to see that the winner is fit to head off and represent Ireland at swimsuit USA in America. “So, throughout the competition the photoshoots and workshops and working with other brands is all a test for howprofessionalyou are and how well you can work with photographers, brands and other models. “It’s also about a healthy body and lestyle so they’re looking for someone who is passionate about physical and mental health. “For example, one of our challenges throughout was promoting our sponsor, Beauty Belle, on social media s and doing weekly posts. Then, the big challenge at the final to test how confident you are in front of a crowd. “I absolutely loved the experience and I’m so grateful for it, the final reallywasa night I’ll always remember. “I was terried when I was travelling to Limerick but when I got there and out on stage I was really in my element and it confirmed this is exactly the kind of thing that I want to continue doing in the future. “I love the rush I get being out of my comfort zone andthatswhat modelling does for me, nerves are good. “I was disappointed that so many of the opportunities throughout were held off or not able to happen because of Covid, I would’ve really liked to spend more time with the other girls and get to know them more as they were lovely and made the whole experience. I was one of two girls from the North, I didn’t get to see much of them. I was also really pleased with placing top six at my first ever show, I would’ve just been happy to complete it. The whole experience really boosted my confidence. “I really want to say a big thank you to The Beauty Edit makeup shop inFoyleside, my personal trainer, Peter Ward, and my friends and family who supported me especially my Mammy, Shauna and my best friend, Erin who travelled to Limerick with me. “Over the next year, in preparation for Miss Bikini  , I will be taking up any opportunities I can to grow my confidence and to grow as a person and grow my . I will be training so I can be the best candidate possible next year. “This year, I did the show for the experience and fun but it’s made me realise how much I want the title now and I don’t plan on letting anything distract me from it in the next year.” To support Niamh’sjourney for the next year, follow her on Instagram at:niamh.hawes  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeWoman in critical condition following four-vehicle road crash overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Niamh continued: “The finals took place this weekend, December , so it’s been a long road. “The competition is full of challenges and tests to see that the winner is fit to head off and represent Ireland at swimsuit USA in America. “So, throughout the competition the photoshoots and workshops and working with other brands is all a test for howprofessionalyou are and how well you can work with photographers, brands and other models. “It’s also about a healthy body and lestyle so they’re looking for someone who is passionate about physical and mental health. “For example, one of our challenges throughout was promoting our sponsor, Beauty Belle, on social media s and doing weekly posts. Then, the big challenge at the final to test how confident you are in front of a crowd. “I absolutely loved the experience and I’m so grateful for it, the final reallywasa night I’ll always remember. “I was terried when I was travelling to Limerick but when I got there and out on stage I was really in my element and it confirmed this is exactly the kind of thing that I want to continue doing in the future. “I love the rush I get being out of my comfort zone andthatswhat modelling does for me, nerves are good. “I was disappointed that so many of the opportunities throughout were held off or not able to happen because of Covid, I would’ve really liked to spend more time with the other girls and get to know them more as they were lovely and made the whole experience. I was one of two girls from the North, I didn’t get to see much of them. I was also really pleased with placing top six at my first ever show, I would’ve just been happy to complete it. The whole experience really boosted my confidence. “I really want to say a big thank you to The Beauty Edit makeup shop inFoyleside, my personal trainer, Peter Ward, and my friends and family who supported me especially my Mammy, Shauna and my best friend, Erin who travelled to Limerick with me. “Over the next year, in preparation for Miss Bikini  , I will be taking up any opportunities I can to grow my confidence and to grow as a person and grow my . I will be training so I can be the best candidate possible next year. “This year, I did the show for the experience and fun but it’s made me realise how much I want the title now and I don’t plan on letting anything distract me from it in the next year.” To support Niamh’sjourney for the next year, follow her on Instagram at:niamh.hawes  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeWoman in critical condition following four-vehicle road crash overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

I am calling on the Education Minister to introduce regulations to cap unorm costs and provide statutory guidance to schools to ensure school unorms are made affordable for families. “A recent poll of parents showed that % were concerned about the rising costs of unorms and PE gear, while % said they getinto debt to cover the costs. Unorms and PE gear are costing parents hundreds of pounds, per-child, every year. This is unacceptable and must be addressed. With the cost of living rising, urgent action is needed to support families and I am calling on theEducation Minister to legislate to ease the burden of school unorm costs.

Since April of this year, there have been  donors and families who have enabled  patients to receive a le-saving transplant in Northern Ireland. Statistics have shown that % of people in Northern Ireland support organ donation, but only % have signed the Organ Donor Register. Mayor Warke said: Making the decision on whether or not to become an organ donor is a big decision and a personal one for each inidual. Its important that we all take the time to think about our own choice, and to share that choice with our family and friends. Christmas is a time for giving, and one of the greatest gts that any of us could give is the gt of le. The statistics around organ donation are really quite incredible. One organ donor can save the lives of up to nine people, and with around  iniduals currently on the waiting list in Northern Ireland, every single donor makes a huge dference to potentially saving someones le. Its vitally important to remember that loved ones will always be involved before any organ donation can go ahead. Given the fact that only half of families agree to donatethey dont know their loved ones decision, but  out of  will support itthey know their loved one wanted to donate, Id ask everyone to please share their choice. By doing so you could save lives. You can record your decision around donation on the NHS Organ Donation Register atwww.organdonationni.info  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeWoman in critical condition following four-vehicle road crash overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Since April of this year, there have been  donors and families who have enabled  patients to receive a le-saving transplant in Northern Ireland. Statistics have shown that % of people in Northern Ireland support organ donation, but only % have signed the Organ Donor Register. Mayor Warke said: Making the decision on whether or not to become an organ donor is a big decision and a personal one for each inidual. Its important that we all take the time to think about our own choice, and to share that choice with our family and friends. Christmas is a time for giving, and one of the greatest gts that any of us could give is the gt of le. The statistics around organ donation are really quite incredible. One organ donor can save the lives of up to nine people, and with around  iniduals currently on the waiting list in Northern Ireland, every single donor makes a huge dference to potentially saving someones le. Its vitally important to remember that loved ones will always be involved before any organ donation can go ahead. Given the fact that only half of families agree to donatethey dont know their loved ones decision, but  out of  will support itthey know their loved one wanted to donate, Id ask everyone to please share their choice. By doing so you could save lives. You can record your decision around donation on the NHS Organ Donation Register atwww.organdonationni.info  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeWoman in critical condition following four-vehicle road crash overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity.

She took to Facebook in a search for information about the school after noticing it as she travelled up and down the road. “I had been passing this school every day and was just fascinated by it. I wondered what it was called, when it was up and running, when it closed,” she told the County Derry Post. “Wee country schools like that had generations of families in them, and it was just something I became fixated on. “I wanted to know what it was called, andanyone had any memories or photographs of it. It was really to get a lot of people talking about it. “I wanted to stir up a bit of nostalgia among the community that was linked to the school, and was hoping that it would bring a lot of people back in touch with each other. “One lady hilariously came back and said there were some she could do without getting in touch with, and that made me laugh.”  Councillors raise County Derry road issues with DfI officials  Department officials were speaking at a recent full council meeting.   Despite that particular womans reluctance, Julie was able to gather a huge amount of information on the old school, which had been in use for almost  years. Opened in , the school had undergone two extensions in its -year stint, and at the time of its closure, Mr Noel Cunningham, who had links to the RAF, was the principal. A Mrs Carson taught at the school around the same time, while there were two dinner ladies named Bertha Clarke and Greta McKinney. Julie said she had been contacted by  past pupils of the school during her search for its history. “I ordinarily wouldnt have been out this road, but now being on it every day, I see it, so I thought Id put it out and seewe got anything back,” she said. “People were putting up messages, tagging people and asking Is this the school you were at  and I wondered how long it has been since those people were in touch with each other. “I thought it was a really lovely site a quaint country school, and there arent many of them around. I know its up for sale so I thought Id like to know the history before anything happens to it.” The derelict site at Killure PS. Despite the relatively recent closure of the school, photographs have proved dficult to come by for Julie, with just one unearthed so far. She is appealing for anyone with information or photographs to get in touch with her via the Derry Post to pass on what they know. “If anybody had photographs it would be a lovely thing for me to be able to share with everybody,” she said. “It was just to see what I could get back about it for them. I dont know these people I dont know any of them, but theyve all been so lovely in coming back to me. “Surely to goodness, after all thatof time, the papers would have covered a school like that closing ” If you have any information or photographs relating to Killure School, Drumcoon Road, Aghadowey, get in touch with us via editor@derrypostor give us a call on .

One of his most memorable stories features in a book penned by Dennis Taylor when the Magherafelt man toppled the mighty Alex ‘Hurricane’ Higgins.” Tommys legacy stretches long beyond his playing days, and he was instrumental to ensuring the survival and development of the game within the Mid Ulster area. “When his best playing days were perhaps behind him he didn’t turn his back on the game,” said the club. “He organised the Mid Ulster Snooker League for + years, which is an unbelievable commitment and no doubt it was this dedication that kept the game alive in the area. “When he handed over the reins in the late noughties, the game was still in a healthy state and we are all indebted in a way to Tommy that the Mid Ulster league is still being played to this day.” As a symbol of their gratitude, the Mid Ulster League named a trophy after Tommy, and the club said seeing him presenting his own trophy was an emotional moment. “A few years back many of the players felt that it would be a fitting tribute to name one of the Mid Ulster league competitions after Tommy. “We consider ourselves fortunate that Tommy was able to attend to present his own trophy. “As a club we have our own piece of history on the wall in the club, Tommy produced a great article detailing the history of our own club from its founding in  and is well worth a read for any local. “It was also fitting that when the club was rebuilt in  that he played Joe Swail on the opening night. A fitting tribute for a great snooker man.”  Derry Death Notices - Tuesday, th November,   Obituaries    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeWoman in critical condition following four-vehicle road crash overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Rose Ayling-Ellis is making history as the first deaf contestant to compete on Strictly Come Dancing, and information officer for the charity, Pauline Doherty last night heaped praise on the -year-old dancer.  “It is great to see Deaf Culture being recognised. Deaf Awareness and sign language shouldbe taughtto everyonein schools,” she said. In a recent episode, Rose and her partner Giovanni danced a section of their performance without any music and Pauline found that moment very important for the Deaf community. “When Rosie danced with no music to show hearing people what Rosie was feeling, it was fantastic,” said Ms. Doherty. Rose has been an inspiration to young people all over the UK and the Dungiven based charity have been unequivocal in their praise for young dancer. “Rose is fantastic, I love watching her and I really hopes she wins,” said Wendy Cassidy, cleaner at Hands That Talk. Paddy Bradley the caretaker smiled and said “Yes, Rose is very good. It’s nice to see Deaf people on TV,” he added.

She cannot wait to see Rose every week, and she hopes Rose will win it,” he said.

At a media briefing, he stated there were inherent internal contradictions in the bans and said, Weve seen these before where you ban flights except for your own citizens. Is it that some passport holders will have the virus and some wont  Does the virus read your passport  Does the virus know your nationality or where youre legally resident  Our concern here is that we apply public health principles, not political principles to selecting measures that are used to control the spread of disease. He made the comments in the wake of tightening border restrictions across dozens of countries in response to the Omicron iant. WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, also called on countries to take rational and proportional risk-reduction measures. He said, Blanket travel bans will not prevent the international spread of Omicron and they place a heavy burden on lives and livelihoods. Dr Ryan suggested other ways to manage risk: There are ways that you can de-risk travel in terms of having increased testing, more testing before departure, more testing on arrival, quarantine until negative testing. There is a whole series of things that can be done that will manage the risk of importation of disease or even exporting disease to another country which fall short of blanket bans. The idea that you can put a hermetic seal on most countries is just frankly not possible. We all know that, weve seen that happen before. And certainly there has to be consistency. If [the bans] are being applied, they have to be consistent.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeWoman in critical condition following four-vehicle road crash overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeWoman in critical condition following four-vehicle road crash overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

I am contacted about cleansing issues on a daily basis and while working with council staff a solution is found, butrobust processes and procedures were in place, this should be routinely completed and no major issues should arise.Cllr Sharvin says he is also keen to see greater attention on cleaning play parks, explaining that currently there is no formal process to do so and operates on adhoc basis.ldquoGiven the increase of use play parks during Covid and the councilrsquos objective to increase healthy living in our communities, itrsquos vitality important that we clean and maintain our play parks on a regular basis.

pop royalty and real-le royalty, George Lowdenrsquos guitars are known to be the best in the world.The Prince of Wales recently made known his knowledge of and fascination with Georgersquos guitars and Ed Sheeran reportedly likes to keep one handy in nearly every room of his house.With Niall Horan of One Direction and Dubliner singer songwriter Dermot Kennedy becoming the latest owners of the bespoke guitars, Georgersquos company, Lowden Guitars, has just announced its latest collaboration with Sheeran.To celebrate the release of his most recent album, Sheeran has teamed up with George, who founded the firm in , to design and create a signature guitar worthy of music royalty.The Sheeran by Lowden Equals Edition guitar will also be available to the public to purchase, with a limited edition run of , available through Lowdenrsquos global dealer network.Itrsquos the second joint project with Sheeran, following on from their range of more affordable guitars.The latest achievement comes in the wake of George recently meeting the Prince of Wales at a Windsor Castle reception to mark Lowden Guitars winning the  Queenrsquos Awards for Enterprise.He also launched a new range of limited edition guitars to mark his th birthday over the summer which features specications chosen by George.Itrsquos all a far cry from when the renowned luthier first began to hand-make guitars for his own use.He could never have known that his determination to make the best guitar would see his name travel around the world and be spoken of by royalty.ldquoTherersquos quite a lot of things that have happened that I never could have imagined. When I started out, I had no formal training in the manufacture of guitars, explained George.ldquoIn a way, that gave me the confidence to take some risks, innovate and produce an instrument that has a completely unique voicing.He found the Prince of Wales to be very interested in the guitarsrsquo manufacture and may have even suggested a new development.ldquoWe had a great chat and he asked quite a lot of questions about the wood, all kinds and how we found it, said George.ldquoHe was also very interested in dieback ash, asking aboutit would be a very good way to use the trees as a lot have perished due to this disease.ldquoIt wouldnrsquot be the best toned wood you could find but Irsquove been thinking more about that since and wondering whether we could use it for guitar necks or not so we might do a little experiment to seeit works.From creating coveted instruments for top Irish and UK guitarists in the know, Lowden Guitars have become an international sales success mdash hence the Queenrsquos Award.George explained: ldquoThe company is far bigger than I ever envisaged. In some ways itrsquos good but I never tried to expand the company and get the kind of growth we have enjoyed.

However, the Magpies led by four on referee Niall Cullenrsquos short whistle.Ramor came out after the break and pressed high, and were rewarded with three scores in the first five minutes.Kilcoo didnrsquot panic and upped the ante immediately with two Paul Devlin frees settling things. Jerome Johnston and Eugene Branagan kept the scoreboard ticking and on the th minute the brilliant Ceilum Doherty found the net after great approach play by Dylan Ward.From here to the end, Kilcoo kept playing with that high tempo and the game was put beyond the Virginia men with six minutes remaining when man of the match Jerome Johnston found the net once again.Both sides emptied their benches as the game petered out, as the Down men came away with an impressive win.Mickey Moran and his management team will take great heart from many aspects of their teamrsquos performance and will know only too well it will take this and morethey are to win against the Derry champions and reach back-to-back Ulster finals.Kilcoo assistant manager Conleith Gilligan expressed mixed emotions as the local side look ahead to the semi-final stage.ldquoThere was definitely some nice passages of play and, look, we were able to play the game at our own pace and as the competition goes on that wonrsquot be allowed to happen, he said.ldquoOnce we got our legs moving, up to the first water-break we did very well. It was just that second quarter where we were on top but we didnrsquot take enough chances that would have put the game to bed and we allowed Ramor to live in the game right up to half-time.He added: ldquoWe didnrsquot need to be the best in the country tonight, we just needed to be better than Ramor and I think we were.Kilcoo: N Kane, N Branagan, R McEvoy , A Branagan, M Rooney, Anthony Morgan , E Branagan , D Ward , Aaron Morgan, C Doherty , J Johnston , S Johnston , C Laverty, R Johnston, P Devlin .Subs used: A Branagan, T Fettes, M Hynes, C Rooney and J Clarke.Ramor United: L Brady D Bartley, B OrsquoConnell, E Somerville A OrsquoConnell, Jack Brady, M Magee, L Caffrey, E Maguire B Smith, S Cadden, C MaguireJames Brady , A Cole, S McEvoy .Subs used: G Mannion, K Maguire, P McNamee , J Bradley and L Lynch.Referee: Niall Cullen ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"New £65m Lidl supermarket in Carryduff gets green light  ","story":"THE green light has been given for the multi-million pound regeneration of the Carryduff shopping centre which could create  new jobs.The ambitious plan designed to transform the Church Road site mdash which includes a new pound.m Lidl store mdash was approved by Lisburn and Castlereagh Councilrsquos Planning Committee on Monday.Lidl submitted its new store planning application earlier this year and hopes to open the , square metre facility, creating  new jobs and parking spaces for  vehicles, by the middle of next year.In addition to the Lidl store, an additional , square metres of floorspace is available for other retailers at the expansive centre site.The new store opening is a major part of the shopping centrersquos regeneration, which has lain derelict for more than four years, with the planning application proposing the demolition of the existing buildings and the erection of three retail units, cafe, bookmakers, drive through cafe, landscaping and associated site works.Parking provision for disabled drivers is included in the development proposal alongside dedicated spaces for parents and children. Four dedicated spaces for electrical vehicles are also included.Itrsquos understood that in addition to the  jobs in the new Lidl store, a further  will be created across the other proposed retail units, with  jobs created during construction and development.Council planners are recommending to members that the application be approved with  conditions including its full construction within a five-year period.In papers submitted ahead of Mondayrsquos planning meeting, planners said they were recommending approval as the proposed retail use is considered to comply with the local development plan.They say that when the buildings are constructed, they will not adversely impact on the character of the area or have a detrimental impact on the amenity of existing residents in properties adjoining the site.ldquoAppropriate provision is made to meet the needs of cyclists and adequate facilities are made for shower and changing facilities as required for such a major employment-generating development, the papers point out.A spokesperson for Lidl said the poundm store would reflect the retailerrsquos concept design, boasting a sales floor, a shopping environment withspacious, wide aisles, long tills, restrooms and baby-changing facilities, as well as a bakery offering and staff facilities.ldquoOur ambitious plans to complement the site with additional retail and leisure units represent an investment of more than pound million into the area and the support of more than  jobs, he said.ldquoWersquore proud to be part of the centrersquos signicant regeneration and bring a new future of growth to the locality whilst honouring the sitersquos historical connections to the community.The spokesman added: ldquoWe hope to receive planning permission for the site and look forward to opening the brand new, state-of-the-art Lidl store early next year, bringing shoppers even more choice of quality products at unbeatable value.Carryduff shopping centre was a prime retail destination for many years, but since the closure of its flagship Supervalu store in , it struggled to attract an anchor tenant that would drive its growth.The formal planning application by Lidl follows an extensive local consultation of the plans undertaken in February which was positively received by local representatives and the wider community.Lidl acquired the . acre Carryduff shopping centre site in August last year as part of the retailerrsquos plans to expand its store presence across the region to more than  stores by the end of the decade..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"Newcastle harbour development plans  ","story":"THE redevelopment of the former generator house at Newcastle harbour has the potential to act as a catalyst to secure additional investment.Thatrsquos the assertion of Mournes councillor Willie Clarke whose comment came after Monday eveningrsquos annual meeting of the Newcastle Harbour Heritage Association.He congratulated the grouprsquos chairman Campbell Miller and the committee members on the ldquofantastic positive contribution they have made in improving the harbour over the past year.Cllr Clarke said the two main items discussed at the annual meeting included the refurbishment of the former generator house as a community hub and the provision of a new boarding pontoon that would allow disabled people to board vessels, something which he said is long overdue.The business case for the new floating pontoon recently passed through Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee.Cllr Clarke explained the vision for the generator house includes the provision of showers, toilets, and changing facilities for water-based recreation, alongside a meeting room for the community and harbour users.He said the business case was submitted to the local authority and approved through the so-called community transfer process.ldquoIt is essential that this building is refurbished for the local community which will be a catalyst in the development of the harbour, suggested Cllr Clarke.ldquoIn addition, it offers an excellent opportunity for the local council and the harbour community to develop a partnership to create a community hub for the area.

McCollam fired over another point in the th minute and pointed a free at the very end while trying to it in on the Downpatrick area to poach a late goal.McCloskey didnrsquot score in the second half and being out of general play resulted in his normally reliable free-taking also taking a hit.At the other end the outnumbered Downpatrick forwards had to survive on scraps as well but they could always rely on their free-takers.Goalkeeper Pearse Smyth landed two points from inside his own half, while Tom McGrattan converted three frees and landed a point from play as well.McGrattan was the star of the game and he capped a brilliant inidual performance with two late plays that effectively took his team into the final.With the game in the balance at - each in the rd minute, McGrattan jinked his way along the sideline under the stand to win himself a free.It was an acute angle, but the Portaferry clubman arrowed the sliotar between the uprights.Then less than a minute later he played a beautul cross-field pass into the path of mid-fielder Finn Turpin, who stepped inside the defender and hit the roof of the net from  metres out.St Patrickrsquos were through to their first ever Danske Bank Mageean Cup final where they will play St Patrickrsquos Maghera at the Dub Arena on Friday week, December .But back again to that breath-taking first half.After five minutes, the teams had each scored three points. By the tenth minute, Jack McCloskey had cut through the Red High cover and shot to the net off the base of the right hand post.Within three minutes Downpatrick were a point up. McGrattan went around the left side of the Ballymena defence at full pace to rle to the roof of the net for one of the best goals that you will see at any level.Aodhan McGarry responded by pointing from a side-line and the water-break broke the action at - each.McGarry started the second quarter scoring with a fine point but a run of three successive scores from Finn Turpin, McGrattan and Oisin Coulter edged the Red High ahead again.However, three frees from Jack McCloskey and a point from Ronan McCollam put Ballymena in the lead by - to - at half-time.By the second water break Downpatrick were - to - ahead, mainly through frees and St Louisrsquo were now looking for scores from distance.The next  minutes went scoreless. In hindsight Ballymena snatched at a couple of scoring chances that might have put pressure on the eventual winners who pumped a lot of ball in high on the north Antrim defence with no .Eventually sub Tom McFerran brought the teams level and McCollam from the left wing gave St Louisrsquo the lead. The gauntlet had been thrown down for the Red High.Oisin Coulter landed a much-needed Downpatrick point in reply and they held firm until Tom McGrattan delivered the match-winning scores.It is scant consolation for Ballymena that they played their part in a fine display of schoolsrsquo hurling, but a number of players stood out including Daire McMullan, Connor Dickson and Dara Martin in defence and McCollam and McCloskey in attack until tempered by Downpatrickrsquos packed back line.Defence was ultimately the winning of the game, but they would not have got across the line without Turpin, Oisin Coulter and especially the mercurial Tom McGrattan.As a hurling disciple of the great Bro Charles in the s, I was a proud man leaving the Dub on Friday evening.For the generations of hurlers who climbed to the top of the hill on Saul Street each morning over the past  or  years, winning a Mageean was just not on the radar.This team is only  minutes from achieving what for us was the impossible.St Patrickrsquos: P Smyth - frees, J Ruddy, R OrsquoNeill, D Coulter, S Mageean, D Mallon, C Lenaghan, T Connolly -, F Turpin -, M Dorrian -, A Connolly, T McGrattan - , O Coulter -, R McGrath, S McCarthy.Subs: F MacManus for A Connolly , LMcCabe for S McCarthy , F Casey for R McGrath ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"Road officials set to carry out survey at Ballynahinch school  ","story":"PLANS by roads officials to carry out a survey on the main road outside Ballynahinch Primary School have been welcomed by Strangford MLA Peter Weir.The work will be carried out to assess the potential for a new pedestrian crossing and while pleased that the survey is to take place, Mr Weir is disappointed that there are no current plans to also introduce a temporary mph speed limit at the Dromore Road as part of a province-wide Department for Infrastructure initiative.Mr Weir mdash who has met with school principal Mr Michael Moore mdash said the safety of children who have to cross the busy road was of paramount importance and a real issue of concern for parents and residents.The former Education Minister said he was ldquodisappointed that the school had not been included in the Roads Departmentrsquos part-time mph speed limit scheme.ldquoI believe that the Department needs to give a clear commitment that Ballynahinch Primary School will be included in the next roll-out of the scheme, said Mr Weir.ldquoThe Dromore Road is busy and is also a bus route.

The huddle of five then broke apart in the last K as they hurtled towards the finish line in break neck speed.Overall winner Owen Everardonly edged for glory in the last two strides as right to the mat it was not clear who would breach the tape first.His time of . was two seconds ahead of Matthew Neill , who was one second ahead of third-placed Eskander Turki .

The background to the incident has been well detailed in the media. However, central to the incident is that it took place at the scene of dreadful murders in a bookmakers shop. It is right that all police actions are open to scrutiny. But that the officers were subject to a republican propaganda campaign in the heat of which the chief constable’s support for his officers was absent was deeply disappointing.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

There are many questions around the handling of this case that demand answers. However, the well-being of the young officers should now be the chief constable’s primary concern. Simon Byrne must ensure that PSNI support services offer assistance as the officers resume normal duties. Also, an apology from the chief constable to the police officers might be appropriate.

But it was a dferent Soldier’s Song – it was not wrapped around the IRA, it was one of friendship and one of a group of people who wanted us to be out there on the pitch representing them,” he said.“Would I suggest that we look at a sporting anthem as well [at football internationals], to play in addition to God Save The Queen  I would say we did that in rugby and it works really well, because it is an extension of that constructive atmosphere.“In the medium term anyway, and maybe forever, God Save The Queen might well be played, but it would be nice to have something  [also],” Mr Ringland added.READ: Windsor Park : worst night of sectarian thuggery that never wasREAD: Opinion:  match a case study in nationalist myth making ——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Clockwise from top left, David Lloyd George Austen Chamberlain, F.E.Smith, , Winston Churchill, Robert Barton, Michael Collins, Arthur GrfithLock it up carefully”, David Lloyd George said to his mistress and secretary, Frances Stevenson, in her room at  Downing Street, as he handed her the British copy of the historic Anglo-Irish Treaty just before  am on  December .Under its terms the Union of Great Britain and Ireland, as created by Pitt the Younger  years earlier, came to an end. Only the six counties of the newly formed Northern Ireland were to be permitted to remain within the United Kingdom. Their devolved Parliament, which had been opened by King George V the previous June , was given the power to vote them out of the all-Ireland settlement, based on dominion status, which the Treaty embodied.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.The document that was locked away in Downing Street bore the signatures of four members of the British delegation who had negotiated it. They formed a column headed by Lloyd George himself the others, drawn from his Liberal  Unionist coalition cabinet, were Austen Chamberlain, F.E.Smith, Lord Birkenhead , and Winston Churchill.Another column listed the signatures of three of their Irish counterparts, headed by Arthur Grfith, the founder of Sinn Fein in , and followed by the charismatic Michael Collins, the chief organiser of the IRA’s terrorist campaign against Britain, waged from  until July  when a truce was agreed between the two sides. The third Irish signatory, Robert Barton, a Unionist landowner turned Republican and an intimate friend of Collins, was the Sinn Fein delegation’s economic adviser. Never before had British and Irish representatives put their names to a formal agreement of this kind as complete equals. After the signing, which took place at . am, the two sides shook hands for the first time. Trust had replaced the deep suspicion with which they had first regarded each other. Irish leaders, who a few months earlier had been denounced as rebels and murderers, had come to enjoy the respect of the British delegation. Michael Collins had undergone an astonishing transformation from terrorist leader to statesman, gaining the admiration of two prominent members of the British team, Churchill and Birkenhead.Final agreement on the terms of the treaty had been reached in two intense negotiating sessions in the Cabinet Room at No , which ended two months of wrangling. The first session, which lasted over five hours, began at pm on December . Lloyd George employed all his formidable political skills to secure a breakthrough in all but one of the key areas that had hitherto defied resolution.The Irish gained the full fiscal and financial autonomy they craved. The British got what they wanted on defence: the use “in time of war or of strained relations with a foreign power [of] such harbour and other facilities as the British government may require”, combined with the permanent retention of what came to be known as the Treaty Ports , major strategic assets which Neville Chamberlainwas to abandon in a further Anglo-Irish Treaty in  to Churchill’s fury. Since the start of negotiations in October, the words of an oath of allegiance which Irish elected representatives would in future be required to swear had been through endless drafts. It was at last settled with a suitably convoluted rigmarole to spare the Irish republican conscience as much strain as possible: “I will be faithful to His Majesty King George V, his Heirs and Successors by law, in virtue of the common citizenship of Ireland and Great Britain, and her adherence to and membership of the group of nations forming the British Commonwealth of Nations.” This was the first time on which the customary reference to Empire was dropped from an official document.There remained just one make-or-break issue: Northern Ireland, with its devolved powers over local matters entrusted to it by Westminster earlier in . Sinn Fein were determined to get it into their independent state. Lloyd George was happy to give them all the help he could. In November, he had piled pressure on Sir James Craig, the Northern Ireland prime minister. In letters and conversations he tried, with all his accustomed craftiness, to get Craig to accept that he had a patriotic duty to remove the last barrier to peace in Ireland by joining a sovereign all-Ireland Parliament in place of Westminster, while retaining all the devolved powers that Westminster had provided.The Unionist members of the British delegation did not demur. Not for the last time, Ulster Unionists found that they could not rely on their English Unionist allies in high places . Austen Chamberlain said that separate arrangements for six of the nine Ulster counties were “illogical and indefensible”. He thought “the greatest moral pressure” should be put on Northern Ireland to bring it into a settlement that was “vital to the Empire”. His party chairman, Sir George Younger , believed “Ulster should take some risks and forget some of the past arguments against unity in Ireland”.These Unionist calls for compromisewere made against the background of a sustained press campaign, led by The Times, criticising Ulster Unionists for their intransigence. “Ulster blocks the way to peace” was the newspapers’ regular refrain. Craig described it as “ a press campaign against Ulster without parallel in the history of Great Britain.”But the Northern Ireland premier was unmoved. He told Lloyd George that a single parliament for Ireland was “precisely what Ulster has for many years resisted by all the means at her disposal”.Lloyd George tried another tack in November, concentrating his cunning this time on the leader of the Irish delegation, Arthur Grfith. Here he had much greater success than in his attempts to manoeuvre Craig into an all-Ireland parliament. At a private meeting with Grfith on November , he got the leader of the Irish delegation to give a personal written pledge that,Northern Ireland refused to accept an all-Ireland settlement, it would remain under the British Parliament, “but in this case, it would be necessary to revise the boundary of Northern Ireland. This might be done by a Boundary Commission ... to make the boundary conform as closely as possible to the wishes of the people.” What went unrecorded in the paper was the clear impression given by Lloyd George that Northern Ireland would lose so much territory that it could not survive as a separate entity and a united independent Ireland would as a result come into existence.During the course of the long afternoon session in Downing Street on December , Lloyd George reminded Grfith of what they had agreed.Proof was needed. A frantic search was made of the prime minister’s wardrobe, and “eventually an insignicant pocket cast up an envelope and a piece of paper.” On the strength of this written undertaking to establish a Boundary Commission whichwould undermine Northern Ireland, the leader of the Irish delegation agreed to sign the Treaty himself, but said that he could not commit his colleagues.At this, Lloyd George assumed a magnicently melodramatic air. He had told Craig in Belfast to expect news of the outcome of the discussions in Downing Street the following day. That could of course have been done by telephone, but Lloyd George now conjured up an elaborate plan to send the news in writing to Belfast in an attempt to force a decision out of the other two Irish delegates.“Here are the alternative letters which I have prepared, one enclosing Articles of Agreement reached by His Majesty’s Government and yourselves, and the other saying that the Sinn Fein representatives refuse to come within the Empire. If I send this letter it is war, and war within three days. Which letter am I to send  Whichever letter you choose travels by special train to Holyhead, and by destroyer to Belfast. The train is waiting with steam up at Euston ... to reach Sir James in time we must know your answer by ten p.m tonight. You can have until then, but no longer, to decide whether you will give peace or war to your country.”With these impassioned words ringing in their ears, the Irish delegates ed to their Knightsbridge hotel for anguished discussions amongst themselves, but promised to be back in Downing Street by the pm deadline. In fact, it was nearly .pm when they ed.Nothing more was heard about the special train waiting at Euston. Grfith announced calmly, “Prime Minister, the Delegation is willing to sign the agreements, but there are a few points of drafting which perhaps it would be convenientI mentioned at once.” The most important concerned the Boundary Commission redrafting increasedthe likelihood that Northern Ireland would collapse. At Iam on December , an agreed text was handed to the Downing Street typists.In England, reaction to the treaty was ecstatic. The Times led the way: “These are fitting peace terms to mark the close of an age of discontent and distrust, and the beginning of a new era of happiness and mutual understanding.” In Ireland, discontent intensied and took a new form: the long quarrel with Britain was replaced by distrust and ision within Sinn Fein, which led to a bitter civil war the following year. In Northern Ireland, IRA terrorism increased, generating sectarian stre in  parts of Belfast came to resemble the battlefields of the First World War. The Boundary Commission recommended only minor changes, and its report was shelved. Englishmen looked away. “The country”, said Austen Chamberlain, “wants peace and is tired of Ireland and Ulster.” English politicians hoped they would never have to think seriously about Irish affairs again. For nearly  years they had their wish — which meant that that they were fatally handicapped by ignorance when the Ulster crisis of  erupted.l BIBLIOGRAPHY—D.G.Boyce, Englishmen and Irish Troubles: British Public Opinion and the Making of Irish Policy -and “ How to Settle the Irish Question: Lloyd George and Ireland -” in A.J.P.

He wanted the plan to go out as an agreed Executive budget and resisted suggestions it could be presented as a Department of Finance budget.Such a move would have potentially given Sinn Fein’s political opponents on the Executive more latitude to scrutinise and even criticise the plans during the consultation period.It is understood Mr Murphy raised concerns at Thursday’s Executive, insisting he was not prepared to put out the budget for consultation without the backing of the wider Executive.Ahead of Friday’s Executive, Sinn Fein deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill tweeted: “Sinn Fein Finance minister has prioritised funding to tackle waiting lists, transform our health service and support healthcare workers.”The compromise position will enable the budget to be published as a draft Executive budget while a majority of ministers have reserved their position on backing the final spending allocations.Conor MurphyDUPSinn FeinMichelle ONeill  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularDonaldson repeats threat to bring down StormontSinn Fein Arts Minister slammed for failing to give a single penny to mark Northern Ireland CentenaryAnthem debate detracting from Northern Ireland fans’ success: Trevor RinglandDennis Hutchings family lodges formal complaints over lost ‘key evidence’Windsor Park : worst night of sectarian thuggery that never wasMost PopularChristmas jumpers you’ll want to wear year after year - for women and menThe best gingerbread house kits to buy for Christmas - from houses to bake from scratch to ready-madeTop letterbox gts for loved ones you can’t see in person for Christmas  - from flowers to activity kitsMen’s gts for Christmas: great presents for Dads or husbands, including clothing, food, drink, music, gamingChristmas toys : popular toys expected to sell out this Xmas - including Paw Patrol and a fidget popper                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-kTUwUJ sc-dqBHgY ciFbrr\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperCoronavirusMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe complaint to the Public Services Ombudsman for Wales against the Cardf and Vale University Health Board was lodged by the patient -referred to in the complaint as lsquoMr Drsquo -who was unhappy with the care and treatment he received at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardf during and after a scheduled admission for surgery to remove the right side of his colon.Mr D, who has Aspergerrsquos Syndrome, complained that hiscondition - at the time believed to be Crohns Disease -was not clearly diagnosed and that clinicians were slow to identy he suffered a post-operative bleed and needed further emergency surgery.He complained that information about his treatment and care was not provided clearly to him despite those caring for him knowing about his Aspergerrsquos Syndrome. He was also unhappy with aspects of his care after his discharge.Mr Drsquos surgery was carried out on the presumption that he had Crohnrsquos Disease according to the Ombudsman, but surgical findings suggested complex chronic appendicitis.The Ombudsman found that neither of these conditions needed the extensive surgery that Mr D was given. The Ombudsman also found there was no complete record of how his condition was monitored following his surgery and that his post-operative bleed might have been detected sooner.The Ombudsman also concluded that the clinicians were aware of the patientrsquos Aspergerrsquos Syndrome but did not clearly communicate the information about his diagnosis and treatment to him. The Ombudsman also found that the patient was not seen by a mental health clinician as requested by Mr D because it was not arranged.MORE NEWS:The Ombudsman did not uphold the complaint regarding Mr Drsquos care post-discharge.Nick Bennett of Public Services Ombudsman for Wales said: ldquoThis regrettable case highlights yet again the importance of one of the key principles of prudent healthcare formulated by the Welsh Government ndash lsquodo only what is needed and do no harm.rsquoldquoPhysicians responsible for Mr Drsquos care should have employed a lsquowatch and waitrsquo approach in which his condition would probably have settled without surgical treatment.ldquoInstead, Mr D, a vulnerable inidual, faced completely avoidable trauma of unnecessary surgery and post-treatment complications ndash a trauma which saw him seek mental health support. I anticipate that my findings will be extremely distressing for him. This is reflected in my recommendations in this case.The Ombudsman recommended that Cardf and Vale University Health Board provides Mr D with a detailed apology and a redress payment of pound,. Mr Bennett also recommended that the physicians and nurses involved in Mr Drsquos care have relevant training in the management of Crohnrsquos Disease and chronic appendicitis as well as the care and management of patients with Aspergerrsquos Syndrome.It was also recommended that the nursing team consider the importance of conducting and documenting post-operative observations and of preparing accurate and relevant care plans.The Ombudsmans report says Cardf and Vale University Health Board has accepted the findings and conclusions of the Ombudsmanrsquos report and has agreed to implement the recommendations.A spokesperson for Cardf and Vale University Health Board said: \"As a health board we would like to reiterate our sincere apologies to Mr D for the concerns identied in the report.\"We are implementing the recommendations from the Ombudsman and an improvement plan has been developed to monitor the delivery of all recommendations within the agreed timescales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"Comments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityExactly how fast the city should grow is up for debate as Cardf council launches a major consultation on its local development plan.Another issue is how many of these new homes should be built in the countryside or in urban areas.The development plan is a hugely important council document shaping how the city will evolve until , and the consultation runs for  weeks until February .The first phase of the consultation looks at how many new homes and jobs the city might need over the next  years, with three specic options. Currently developers already have plans for an extra , homesmdashwhich havenrsquot yet been builtmdashthanks to the existing local development plan.Although, itrsquos possible that not all of these will actually be built. Some additional lsquowindfall sitesrsquo are also likely to come forward, where developers build homes not allocated in the development plan.So factoring these in, the first option would mean an extra , homes needed, as well as , new jobs. That would mean , new homes built each year, for a total of , by .The second option would mean an extra , homes needed, and , new jobs. That would mean , new homes built each year, for a total of , homes by . This could mean more affordable housing.The third option would mean an extra , homes needed, and , new jobs. That would mean , new homes built each year, for a total of , homes by . This is based on population growth projections from the previous development plan, which some critics say were too high.Councillor Caro Wild, cabinet member for strategic planning and transport, said: ldquoThe replacement LDP is going to shape the look and feel of Cardf for years to come, so it was really important for us to hear as wide a range of views as possible. At this stage of the process, we are accessing a number of dferent scenarios on the possible levels of growth in Cardf up to , and the need for houses to be built to accommodate this growth..removeldquoIt is important that people understand the consequences of the options, as most growth scenarios will have pros and cons with regard to important issues such as land for employment opportunities, the impact on the environment, addressing housing need, supporting the delivery of community and transport infrastructure, and how many truly affordable homes that could be provided.People can respond to the consultation by visiting the website https:cardfldp.consultation.ai, while there will also be focus groups to gather views of people who donrsquot normally respond to council consultations.The next phase of the consultation explores eight options on how the city should accommodate a growing population, and how many homes should be built in the countryside or in urban areas.Option one would extend the existing strategic sites, built on countryside on the outskirts of the city. This would mean more affordable homes and a wider range of housing, due to the cheaper construction costs of building on greenfield sites.Options two and three would see new homes built mostly on urban brownfield sites, meaning land which has already been developed. This would mean denser housing, and could be more expensive to build with less range in size. Option four is similar, but focusing on building around existing district centres to create a lsquocity of villagesrsquo concept.Option five would see new homes built around existing transport links in urban areas while option six would focus growth around proposed transport improvements like the metro and planned new train stations, including on some greenfield sites.Option seven would focus on greenfield sites not already earmarked for development, on countryside on the outskirts of Cardf. Option eight would be a mix of using greenfield and brownfield sites, in urban areas and the countryside, to get the best of both.Cllr Wild added: ldquoAt this stage of the process, all of the options that are presented in the consultation are potential options, rather than preferred options. The preferred strategy could combine a number of these options together. All of the feedback from the public will be considered, alongside further technical work, which will help the council prepare the preferred strategy that will be consulted on with the public in autumn .This consultation follows a previous one held earlier this year, which focused on what the broader goals of the replacement development plan should look like. This included exploring how the city should face problems like coronavirus and the climate crisis. The final plan is expected to be approved in October . article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityPollsters Yougov surveyed a sample of people from Wales and the rest of Britain, asking them whether they would support or oppose banning people who have not been vaccinated against coronavirus from visiting public places.Such places would include events and non-essential shops, Yougov suggested.The poll comes as some countries attempt to ramp up vaccination rates by either threatening new restrictions or making jabs mandatory.Political leaders in the UK have downplayed the prospects of such restrictions being introduced, but other European nations have already begun taking steps to curb freedoms for unvaccinated citizens.The Yougov poll found that in the Wales and Midlands area, nearly two-thirds of peoplesaid they would either strongly support, or tend to support, banning unvaccinated people from non-essential public places.Just one in four peoplesaid they would oppose such restrictions on the unvaccinated.The regional results largely match the total response from Wales, England and Scotland, which showed  per cent would support a ban and  per cent would oppose it.MORE ON CORONAVIRUS:Yougov uses sampling data to measure public attitudes to current events and issues. In this case, some , people across Britain, including  in the Wales and Midlands region, responded to the survey. While the sample cannot give a  per cent accurate record of public opinion, it does provide a helpful indicator of which way the wind is blowing when it comes to any future Covid policies on vaccinations and restrictions.A few days ago, Germany announced it would be reimposing some restrictions across the nation, as well as bringing in tough new measures aimed specically at unvaccinated people..removeMany leisure and entertainment venues will only be accessible for people who have either been vaccinated or who have recently recovered from Covid, and the German parliament will also consider a general vaccine mandate which,passed, could come into force as soon as February next year.The nation follows neighbouring Austria, which last month brought in lockdown-style rules for people who have not been vaccinated. Around  per cent of people in Austria have been fully vaccinated ndash one of the lowest rates in western Europe.By comparison, some  per cent of people in the UK have been given both jabs, and booster vaccines have already been administered to . per cent of those people who are currently eligible.Asked on Fridayvaccines could ever be made mandatory for the general public in the UK, a spokesman for Downing Street told reporters: \"Wersquove set out our policy on this and wersquove said itrsquos not something that we would look to introduce.\"And earlier this week, Wales health minister Eluned Morgan said such rules were\"not something the Welsh Government has considered\".While health is devolved in Wales, policies regarding vaccines have remained largely the same across the four UK nations, led by common advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation .However, England has taken the additional step of making vaccines mandatory for health and social care workersndash a measure which hasnt been introduced here in Wales. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Soon after they arrived in Belfast it is believed that Mr Lovell died from Black Flu and before he died, and about to be left alone, Mrs Lovell accepted compensation for the damage that the wagon had suffered in the sea crossing and gave up ownership.The vintage horse-drawn caravan has been lovingly restored.It was the custom at that time in some Romany communities that the do was burned when the owner died, hence making this type of caravan particularly rare. This wagon luckily escaped as it had passed out of Mr Lovell’s hands.In  it came into the ownership of Mr McNeill. He completely stripped down, repaired, and repainted the original wood and metal employing the skills of craftsmen such as signwriter   restorer Mark Stead and wheelwright Cecil Watson. Where replacement was necessary, he sourced only authentic materials. Whilst in the restoration process, a museum stated that they estimated therewere only five remaining in the United Kingdom. It is estimated that this number has decreased still further since then.The wagon was transported to Bray, Co Wicklow in  where it had a starring role in the feature film of Charles Dickens’ ‘The Old Curiosity Shop’.Wilsons’ Plant, Machinery and Commercial Manager Richard McFetridge said: “I am delighted Wilsons Auctions have been entrusted to auction off such a special, historical asset.

Though perhaps keeping your articial one for nine years or more may be just as environmentally friendly.“Save on paper waste by sending an e-card online. An estimated  billion Christmas cards – the equivalent of  million trees - end up in the recycling bin each Christmas,” said a Council spokesperson.“If you need to gt-wrap, avoid glitter and plastic wrap. Why not make your own wrapping paper out of newspaper, brown paper or even a scarf! In the UK , miles of wrapping paper is used at Christmas.“Buy local for your Christmas dinner and gts. This not only supports your local shops and economy but it also cuts down on transport emissions. Buy gts which your family and friends would love such as membership of magazines, tickets to cinema or theatre or vouchers to their favourite restaurant.“Plan your menu ahead and use up those leftovers! Need recipe ideas  Log onto www.lovefoodhatewaste to save money and the environment.“Switch to LED lights. LED’s consume % less energy than twinkling incandescent lights. If you have any outdoor Christmas lights or decorations switch to solar powered and set them on a timer so you don’t waste any precious power. “Buy rechargeable batteries, they will last for years to come! A staggering  million batteries are used over the Christmas period!“Avoid single use plastic - Buy products which are made from compostable or recyclable materials. Shop around for plastic-free, wooden toys and avoid any games that contain plastic parts.“Re-gt unwanted presents! One in five of us received an unwanted present the last festive season.

The consultation with key stakeholders will run for a period of  weeks.”The issue first arose inFebruary  when the council received a request from Abbeyville Residents’ Association for five Irish language street signs which was turned down after councillors voted in favour of a policy retaining street signs in English only proposed by Glengormley DUP councillor Alderman Phillip Brett and seconded by Glengormley Ulster Unionist councillor Ald Mark Cisgrove.Ald Brett stressed the importance of the council having a policy on the issue so thatthere were future requests, these could be dealt with “smoothly”.Ald Cosgrove said that given the facts and figures presented to members over the number of Irish language speakers in the borough, the request would be “preposterous” and street signs would look like a “dog’s dinner”.According to the  census,.% of residents in Antrim and Newtownabbey had some knowledge of Irish. In , it was reported that  people in Antrim and Newtownabbey spoke Irish as a main language.However, in September , the council was forced to do a u-turn after being challenged in the High Court by a resident who sought a judicial review over a “deeply held concern that the policy adopted by the local authority was unlawful”. Read hereThe borough councilinsisted that its policy was “not a ban in any way on the Irish language” and a new, “more detailed policy would be drafted for the council to consider”.Commenting on last week’s decision, SDLP group leader Councillor Roisin Lynch said: “I was disappointed that councillors decided to support this deeply restrictive policy. It is a shameless and deliberate attempt to slow down and stymy efforts for dual language signage.“There can be little doubt that this onerous policy is designed to obstruct efforts to progress the visibility of Gaeilge in our local communities. I am particularly disappointed that Alliance Party councillors backed a policy designed to restrict the growth of the language.“It is of vital importance that the Irish language is given the visibility it deserves and that anyone who wishes to see bilingual signage in their area has access to a fair and transparent process. This is a slap in the face to those in our communities, including myself, who know that we need to break down barriers to the visibility of the the Irish language, not create new ones.”Antrim and Newtownabbey Mayor Councillor Billy Webb commented: “This is not an Irish language policy. This is a multi-lingual policy. We are a erse community.“The policy is going out to consultation. We were looking for one third of residents of a street to instigate an application and then  per cent plus one in the actual vote. That is a normal and true democratic process. The DUP was looking for two-thirds.”Michelle Weir, Local Democracy Reporter--A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this article.
