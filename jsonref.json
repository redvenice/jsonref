But he said “likely to be a sticking plaster for the immediate issues around confidence in the housing market”, rather than a long-term solution.“It might be better to consider reforming the entire stamp duty system so it accurately reflects today’s housing stock and pricing, as well as focusing on ensuring that the right types of homes are built in the areas which need them,” he said. Others questioned whether the move was enough to improve confidence when there are so many uncertainties in the economy.Tim Walford-Fitzgerald, private client partner at accountancy firm HW Fisher, said the reduction may not be enough to spark the confidence needed to take on long-term liability of a house purchase.“There is more to consider – mortgage availability, rising house prices, economic growth and overall market confidence are critical factors and the chancellor should not forget that,” he added.There was some surprise that the measures extended to help those buying a second home or investment property. The additional homes surcharge will still apply but investors stand to make savings as a result of the tax break.Analysis by the property firm Hamptons International found that landlords would save an average £1,840 across England, and those buying in London would typically save £7,240.Aneisha Beveridge, the head of research at Hamptons International, said other changes introduced in recent years meant landlords still needed to weigh up the profitability of their investment.But the saving “might be enough to lure those investors teetering on the edge of whether to invest, particularly in London and the south”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c68d4c3677e44da43caefdd096ccdab2e975c34b/0_186_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=61ae9fe72e422a8216a1dcab0ccf2266","title":"the future of food inside the worlds largest urban farm built on a rooftop","story":"In Paris, urban farmers are trying a soil-free approach to agriculture that uses less space and fewer resources. Could it help cities face the threats to our food supplies?On top of a striking new exhibition hall in the southern 15th arrondissement of Paris, the world’s largest urban rooftop farm has started to bear fruit. Strawberries, to be precise: small, intensely flavoured and resplendently red.They sprout abundantly from cream-coloured plastic columns. Pluck one out to peer inside and you see the columns are completely hollow, the roots of dozens of strawberry plants dangling into thin air.From identical vertical columns nearby burst row upon row of lettuces near those are aromatic basil, sage and peppermint. Opposite, in narrow, horizontal trays packed not with soil but coco coir (coconut fibre), grow heirloom and cherry tomatoes, shiny aubergines and brightly coloured chards.“It is,” says Pascal Hardy, surveying his domain, “a clean, productive and sustainable model of agriculture that can in time make a real contribution to the resilience – social, economic and also environmental – of the kind of big cities where most of humanity now lives. And look: it really works.”Hardy, an engineer and sustainable development consultant, began experimenting with vertical farming and aeroponic growing towers – as those soil-free plastic columns are known – on his Paris apartment block roof five years ago.This space is somewhat bigger: 14,000 sq metres, the size (almost exactly) of two football pitches. Coronavirus delayed its opening by a couple of months, but Nature Urbaine, as the operation is called, is now up and running, and has planted roughly a third of the available space.Already, the team of young urban farmers who tend it have picked, in one day, 3,000 lettuces and 150 punnets of strawberries. When the remaining two-thirds of the vast rooftop of Paris Expo’s Pavillon 6 are in production, 20 staff will harvest up to 1,000kg of perhaps 35 different varieties of fruit and vegetables, every day.Nature Urbaine is already supplying local residents, who can order fruit and veg boxes online a clutch of nearby hotels a private catering firm that operates 30 company canteens in and around Paris and an airy bar and restaurant, Le Perchoir, which occupies one extremity of the Pavillon 6 rooftop.Perhaps most significantly, however, this is a real-life showcase for the work of Hardy’s flourishing urban agriculture consultancy, Agripolis, which is currently fielding inquiries from around the world – including in the UK, the US and Germany – to design, build and equip a new breed of soil-free inner-city farm.“The method’s advantages are many,” he says. “First, I don’t know about you, but I don’t much like the fact that most of the fruit and vegetables we eat have been treated with something like 17 different pesticides, or that the intensive farming techniques that produced them are such huge generators of greenhouse gases.Produce grown using this soil-free method, on the other hand – which relies solely on a small quantity of water, enriched with organic nutrients, minerals and bacteria, pumped around a closed circuit of pipes, towers and trays – is “produced up here, and sold locally, just down there. It barely travels at all,” Hardy says.“It uses less space. An ordinary intensive farm can grow nine salads per square metre of soil I can grow 50 in a single tower. You can select crop varieties for their flavour, not their resistance to the transport and storage chain, and you can pick them when they’re really at their best, and not before.”Urban farming is not, of course, a new phenomenon. The mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, aims eventually to have at least 100 hectares of rooftops, walls and facades covered with greenery – including 30 hectares producing fruit and vegetables. A programme called Les Parisculteurs invites local groups to come up with suitable projects for up to a dozen new sites every year.Inner-city agriculture is booming from Shanghai to Detroit and Tokyo to Bangkok. Strawberries are being grown in disused shipping containers mushrooms in underground carparks. Not all techniques, however, are environmentally friendly: ultra-intensive, 10-storey indoor farms that have sprung up in the US rely on banks of LED lighting and are major consumers of energy, Hardy says.Aeroponic farming, he says, is “virtuous”. The equipment weighs little, can be installed on almost any flat surface, and is cheap to buy: roughly €100 to €150 per sq metre. It is cheap to run, too, consuming a tiny fraction of the electricity used by some techniques.Produce grown this way typically sells at prices that, while generally higher than those of classic intensive agriculture, are lower than soil-based organic growers. In Paris, Nature Urbaine should break even, Hardy estimates, some time next year – a few months later than planned because of the pandemic.There are limits to what farmers can grow this way, of course, and much of the produce is suited to the summer months. “Root vegetables we cannot do, at least not yet,” he says. “Radishes are OK, but carrots, potatoes, that kind of thing – the roots are simply too long. Fruit trees are obviously not an option. And beans tend to take up a lot of space for not much return.”But Agripolis runs a smaller test farm, on top of a gym and swimming pool complex in the 11th arrondissement, where it experiments with new varieties and trials new techniques. A couple of promising varieties of raspberries are soon to make the transition to commercial production.Urban agriculture is not the only development changing the face of farming. As with almost every other sector of the economy, digitisation and new technologies are transforming the way we grow food.Artificial intelligence (AI) and the internet of things are beginning to revolutionise farming, from driverless, fully automated farm machinery that can sow seeds and fertilise and water soil with maximum precision to systems that monitor exactly how healthy inidual animals are and how much they are producing (a concept known as the “connected cow”).Other AI systems analyse satellite and remote ground sensor data, for example, to monitor plant health, soil condition, temperature and humidity and even to spot potential crop diseases. The technique could help build plant and animal resistance to disease, and reduce waste. For example, with methane known to be a stronger greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, research is under way into the stomach bacteria of cows in the hope that tweaking animals’ gut microbes may eventually allow them to produce not just more meat, but also less gas.Urban farming of the kind being practised in Paris is one part of a bigger and fast-changing picture. “Here, we’re really talking about about building resilience, on several levels – a word whose meaning I have come to understand personally,” says Hardy, pointing to the wheelchair he has been forced to use since being injured by a falling tree.“That resilience can be economic: urban farming, hyper-local food production, can plainly provide a measure of relief in an economic crisis. But it is also environmental: boosting the amount of vegetation in our cities will help combat some of the effects of global heating, particularly urban ‘heat islands’.”Done respectfully, and over time, inner-city agriculture can prompt us to think differently both about cities, by breaking down their traditional geography of different zones for working, living and playing, and about agriculture, by bringing food production closer into our lives. “It’s changing paradigms,” says Hardy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a2570b76a93239ecc3a1eb32386ac6d1e622ad4b/115_0_4120_2473/master/4120.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b6e5e90933106e390053ddc1ebeeb1ba","title":"mini budget government rich roosevelt stamp duty planning","story":"For all the Rooseveltian rhetoric, what’s on offer is stamp duty ‘holidays’ and bonfires of planning rulesThe Tory party’s damascene conversion to the merits of state intervention continues. In the past week, we’ve had Boris Johnson borrowing from Franklin D Roosevelt’s playbook and Rishi Sunak announcing a mass job creation scheme. Of course, the scale of these plans falls far short of both the size of the challenge and the bombastic rhetoric. And while central government hands out goodies, local authorities are on the verge of bankruptcy. But to focus solely on this is to miss a deeper problem.Exhibit A is the “kickstart” jobs scheme. Sunak’s proposal will effectively subsidise private employers to offer more of the same low-wage, insecure jobs that made us vulnerable to the pandemic in the first place. The government will cover the cost of employing somebody for 25 hours a week at the national minimum wage – just £4.55 for 16-18-year-olds – for six months. Few conditions are attached to this free money for employers. Meanwhile, the jobs retention bonus offers employers more free money: £1,000 in January for each worker they bring back from furlough. There is nothing for the low-paid essential workers who have been risking their health to get us through the crisis.Yet the pandemic has shown we desperately need a genuine new deal for workers. Too many sick people couldn’t afford to stay home because they lacked basic employment rights. Too many people on poverty wages had no savings to fall back on and have been plunged deeper in debt. More of the same won’t cut it. A sustainable recovery requires more money in the pockets of ordinary workers, not handouts to the owners of private capital. Why not instead announce major public investment to create good jobs doing things that really matter – social care, childcare, renewable energy – and give key workers a pay rise?Exhibit B is a stamp duty holiday for first-time buyers to revive the housing market. This is like using a defibrillator on a patient who has terminal cancer. The massive accumulation of rent arrears will lead to a wave of evictions when the current ban is lifted next month. Meanwhile, landlords – who have been almost entirely insulated from the effects of the crisis – may well take advantage of falling prices to buy up more properties, leaving even more people stuck in the private rented sector.But if this a good investment for private landlords, it would also be a good investment for the public purse. A bold and imaginative government would use falling prices to bring land and property into local public ownership, providing genuinely affordable housing and rejuvenating struggling high streets. It would also rebalance the burden of the crisis between landlords and tenants (including small businesses) – looking to the example of Spain, which has forced big landlords to either write off half their tenants’ rent debt or restructure it over three years.Even more worrying is exhibit C: Johnson’s promise of a bonfire of planning rules. Apparently, we are so desperate to get private developers building that we must strip away any democratic constraints on what they build and where. This might help the Richard Desmonds of the world make a quick buck, but it will do nothing for ordinary people stuck in expensive, poor quality housing. The lockdown has starkly demonstrated the huge gap in the quality of life between those with a decent home and garden, and those without.Hot on the heels of the Robert Jenrick scandal, it’s crystal clear whose side this government is on. Indeed, Johnson made no bones about his allegiances, urging us to clap for “our wealth creators, our capitalists and financiers”. This is a far cry from Roosevelt, who lambasted “financial monopoly, speculation, reckless banking”, saying “they are unanimous in their hatred for me, and I welcome their hatred”. Unlike Johnson, Roosevelt understood that rentiers don’t create wealth. They merely extract it from others in the economy, whether in the form of eye-watering rents, interest payments or utility bills. The real wealth creators are the essential workers – most of whom are not even paid enough to keep up with their bills.It’s possible – though far from guaranteed – that the government has done just enough to stave off the worst-case scenario of mass unemployment. But it won’t be enough to avoid a second wave of poverty, indebtedness and homelessness. Still less will these plans honour the sacrifices made during this pandemic, with a vision for a resilient, green economy that delivers good lives for all. This should have been an opportunity to spur a fundamental shift: away from the concentrated wealth and power of Roosevelt’s “organised money” and towards the frontline workers and ordinary citizens who are the true engine of prosperity."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/089c42e0c11382e077a6450e499ca11e0d8ad063/0_0_2435_1461/master/2435.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=322cde5732509e2b48ab38761f356656","title":"rishi sunak tory party political economic chancellor divide","story":"The chancellor has been forced to spend for now, but he may revert to the low-tax small-state agenda the Tory faithful loveRishi Sunak is now the most important person in the Conservative government, Boris Johnson included. This is quite an achievement for someone who has only been chancellor of the exchequer for five months. It reflects, in large part, the lack of competition from one of the least weighty cabinets of modern times. But it also reflects the severe damage that Johnson has done to himself during the Covid-19 pandemic.Sunak has emerged as hard-headed, clear-spoken and on top of his brief. Thus far, he has proved himself equal to events. The contrast with Johnson on all levels is increasingly stark. Unlike the prime minister, Sunak does not bluster, bully, thump the table or make things up. Talk of Sunak as the next party leader is common, though this also reflects the low level of most of the alternatives.Sunak’s value to the Tory party is political as well as economic. No chancellor in memory, not even Alistair Darling after the 2008 financial crash, has faced the demands that the Covid-19 pandemic has imposed on Sunak. Today was his fourth major economic statement to parliament. Already a fifth looms in the shape of the autumn budget. Poor Sajid Javid, whom Sunak replaced, never had the chance to make a single one.Yet Sunak has not had to withstand the kind of criticism and anger during the crisis that has continually faced Johnson, his guru Dominic Cummings, or the health secretary, Matt Hancock. Most of what Sunak has done during the pandemic has been widely supported. Critics of his furlough scheme want it to go on for longer, not to be changed.The chancellor owes a lot of this to luck. While uncertain health policies have aroused national and international controversy, the economic response benefits from a remarkable new consensus: almost every advanced economy has had to do something very similar. British government claims to have been uniquely responsive to the crisis are wide of the mark.The latest mini-budget went with the grain of earlier interventions. Most of its measures had been well-trailed, including the job guarantee scheme for 16- to 24-year-olds, the stamp duty cut, and the 15-point VAT cut for the hospitality sector. Of the two Sunak had kept up his sleeve, one is substantial, the other more eye-catching. The job retention bonus is a big-ticket incentive to employers not to cut jobs in panic as the furlough scheme ends the eating-out discount for August is more of a gimmick. All seem likely to be popular with the public and are not opposed by significant political players.But this is a watershed moment in the crisis all the same. The furlough scheme and the parallel measures for the self-employed and for benefit claimants are to be wound down over the coming months. In spite of today’s measures, unemployment is set to rise to levels that only those aged over 50 can recall. As a result, the mood of fortitude and endurance that Sunak hymned in his peroration is about to be seriously stress-tested.The long-term question for Sunak and his party is what kind of economy they are trying to create during this unprecedented time. His statement gave a hint about the need to return to sustainable public finances, but different sides of the Tory party can read different things into that. There was no strategic vision. The idea that there can be no going back to the old economic normal, on which much has been written, was ignored. There was almost nothing said at all about fiscal rules or about tax and borrowing. There was only a quiet admission that many of the jobs that existed before the pandemic have gone for good. It will be harder to conceal the strategy in the autumn at the budget and the new spending round. Yet there is no disguising that the Tory party faces a serious potential ide about its medium- and long-term economic policy. Johnson and Cummings think the priority must be to secure the support of the voters in what they now call the “blue wall”. Those voters are much more likely to favour continuing government intervention in both capital and current spending. But the Tory backbenches are full of people who prefer a low-tax, light regulatory regime and small-state ideas. They dislike the scale of the recovery package. Where Sunak stands on this is not yet clear. He plays his cards close to his chest. By background and inclination he is a Thatcherite small-state, free-market politician. His style and language are centrist. But he was made chancellor by a prime minister who demanded control of economic policy in order to spend more.At some point, Sunak is going to have to make his choice. The stronger his political position, the sooner that moment will be and the more the choice can be on his own terms. And right now, Sunak’s position could hardly be stronger."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/33c91ae26f4e0cef2c3c87ec74530d8156a04cc3/0_15_3756_2254/master/3756.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=09f2e9af17c44116f936b57eb6031434","title":"the guardian view on rishi sunak right words right focus wrong policies","story":"The chancellor is handing out cocktail umbrellas as the UK heads into a hurricaneAlmost alone among his cabinet colleagues, Rishi Sunak has a knack for saying the right thing at the right time. He did it again on Wednesday while unveiling his plan for jobs. “We entered this crisis unencumbered by dogma,” the chancellor told fellow MPs. “And we continue in this spirit, driven always by the simple desire to do what is right.” Fine words uttered in a sympathetic tone. The trouble is, they are not matched by actions. The former investment banker, who can see that the UK is entering a historic economic and social crisis, is grappling with the ambitious politician who doesn’t want to scare Conservative backbenchers. What emerges from this unhappy struggle is the strange alloy offered on Wednesday: sound analysis, sensible priorities but underwhelming, sometimes even wrongheaded policies.Finally, the Treasury is right to focus on preserving and creating jobs. Over the past few weeks, independent economists had speculated that up to 5 million Britons could be out of work by next year even now, it looks quite likely that unemployment could top 3 million within months – a level not seen since Margaret Thatcher was in No 10. Between coronavirus and the turmoil of Brexit, we are almost certainly lurching into a jobs crisis.Yet even as Britons head into a hurricane, Mr Sunak hands round cocktail umbrellas. Possibly his single biggest mistake was to announce that the furlough scheme will come to a sudden end in October – the “cliff edge” that the Greater Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham, and many others begged him to avoid. In its stead will come a retention bonus of £1,000 for each furloughed worker employed until January. This looks less like job creation and more like a handout for companies. Treasury officials have a hidebound prejudice against explicitly supporting particular industries, but it would have made sense for the furlough scheme to be extended for those working in hospitality, culture and other sectors where social distancing makes business as usual a distant dream.It would also have been smart to consider subsidising employees to work fewer hours, as Germany does with its Kurzarbeit programme. The most notable absence of all was anything for the self-employed, for whom it took the government weeks of pressure in spring to devise help. Mr Sunak’s defenders will say that he can always make more announcements, just as he brought out three consecutive budgets in March. But businesses and households need to make plans, and soon. They will already be making investment and spending decisions: keep that office or not? Buy that equipment or pause? Send my child to university or wait and see?The priorities chosen by Mr Sunak are also odd. A few weeks ago, the government dragged its heels over providing meals this summer to hungry children. It took a fervent campaign, an angry press and a Premier League footballer to get Boris Johnson to U-turn and spend the £120m. On Wednesday afternoon, the chancellor committed over four times that sum to giving every family a half-price meal next month. He threw £4bn at the housing market, but offered nothing to renters. The government, which on Sunday evening clapped for carers, showed them an empty hand.This crisis has exposed a bust economic model and a broken social contract.

His chief objective was in getting back to business as usual as quickly as possible. Given what lies ahead, he is unlikely even to achieve that."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef2ed1271104b10b23bc18725cbb3fd379366402/0_175_5300_3182/master/5300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b7f69467d914a13470228e071ab9c514","title":"international aviation and shipping likely to be added to uks net zero carbon target","story":"Sector excluded in transport emissions figures but policy change unlikely until 2023 International aviation and shipping emissions are likely to be included in the UK government’s net zero target, it has emerged – but not until after 2023.The intention to review carbon accounting emerged after ministers and advisers, including climate activists, held the first meeting of the Department for Transport’s net zero board.The board includes representatives from business, technology, motor manufacturers and the transport industry, as well as campaigners, including a founder of Plane Stupid and a director of the International Council on Clean Transportation, which uncovered the VW diesel scandal. The team will help shape a transport decarbonisation plan, to be published later this year.Transport accounts for a third of the UK’s CO2 emissions, but the figure excludes international aviation and shipping.The DfT is understood to be considering the advice of the Committee on Climate Change, which last month again urged the government to include all such emissions in its targets.The DfT’s decarbonisation plan is expected to call for a change in policy, but only once the government has attempted to secure internationally binding reductions in emissions through the International Maritime Organisation, whose strategy will not be settled until 2023.The initial meeting, attended by the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, transport minister Rachel Maclean, and the minister for clean growth, Kwasi Kwarteng, focused on steps for a green recovery from Covid-19. Shapps said the board would “play an integral part in our green recovery”.Maclean said the pandemic had led to people making huge changes in work and travel, adding: “We want to capitalise and build on the new habits people have developed, as well as champion the power of new, cleaner technologies on our road to a green recovery.”The government has promised to spend £2bn to increase cycling and walking, although board members pointed out that it was dwarfed by the £27bn promised for renewed road-building, with cars responsible for the vast majority of transport CO2 emissions.Stephen Joseph, a visiting professor at the University of Hertfordshire’s smart mobility unit, said: “Ministers were very clear that transport is a very big problem for climate – and the reductions they have planned only go halfway to where they need to get to by 2032.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff7d26e2d543cdeca82bc8f574590530e8a98fb4/0_315_4724_2835/master/4724.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8583db8c7ed2661ad7b94f81a6ee384c","title":"not what a green recovery looks like rishi sunaks plan gets mixed response","story":"Summer statement’s focus on energy efficiency welcomed but disappointment that no boost for renewablesThere was no lack of advice for the chancellor on measures to green the economic recovery from the coronavirus crisis from top economists and the government’s own climate advisers.But the Rishi Sunak seems to have focused on just one – home insulation – to a mixed reception from green experts and industry figures.The £3bn to be spent on improving energy efficiency in the next year, £1bn on public buildings such as schools and hospitals and the rest in vouchers of up to £10,000 for households, is expected to result in 650,000 warmer homes and support 140,000 jobs. Experts, from the Nobel-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz to the International Energy Agency, had called for such measures, as a fast way to create jobs while making permanent emissions reductions and setting the UK on a path to net zero emissions.“This is a really good package,” said Chris Stark, the chief executive of the Committee on Climate Change (CCC), the government’s statutory adviser. “We said the government should focus on job creation, and the biggest area of job creation is energy efficiency. This is a genuine stimulus, as it is big money that has to be spent quickly.”The voucher system will operate from September and the £3bn is to be spent in 2020-21. At least 15m homes need insulation, and all houses in the UK must be switched to low-carbon heating to meet net zero emissions by 2050. Stark said the next step must be to put in place policies to safeguard the jobs for the long term.There are also question marks over the prime minister’s promise of £12bn to build new social housing. The CCC has said about 1m homes built since 2008 will have to be refurbished, as they were constructed to inadequate standards. But the promised new homes in the “new deal” will also fall short if government plans to introduce a low-carbon home standard from 2025 are not brought forward, Stark said. “It’s an expensive problem that we don’t need.”Other measures that the CCC, economists and experts had called for received less attention. Renewable energy, essential to reaching the target of net zero emissions by 2050, received no new boost. Electric vehicles were parked on the hard shoulder, along with other hoped-for green transport measures.Building out broadband would create jobs and help those working at home, but the chancellor was silent on that. Measures to restore nature also received little funding, with just £40m for a green jobs challenge fund, despite promises of tree-planting and landscape restoration.Craig Bennett, the chief executive of the Wildlife Trusts, said: “The money allocated to help restore nature falls embarrassingly short of what is needed to tackle the twin emergencies we face: climate change and nature loss.”There were a few unexpected crumbs for pet projects. Technology for capturing carbon dioxide directly from the air will receive £100m, and there was £10m for the automotive transformation fund, looking at blue sky projects for green mobility.Other countries have moved further and faster. France is spending about £13bn on its green recovery measures, while Germany is looking to top £35bn. The EU as a whole is pursuing a $1tn green deal.Anna McMorrin, the shadow minister for international development, said: “This is not what a green recovery looks like. The chancellor touts a green recovery in one breath but invests in high-carbon industry both at home and overseas in another, pumping billions into fossil-fuel projects abroad.”Greenpeace said Sunak had had the opportunity to spend £15bn on “shovel-ready” projects that would have created hundreds of thousands of green jobs while cutting emissions. Rebecca Newsom, the head of politics, said: “The chancellor made many of the right noises about sparking a green recovery. But instead of digging in to deliver on this promise, he seems to have downed spades with the job only partly done. The government has missed the opportunity to kickstart the green recovery we need.”The chancellor has delayed the national infrastructure strategy to later in the year, so the lack of detail on large-scale infrastructure projects was not surprising. Carbon capture and storage, hydrogen, green transport and large-scale energy projects might take more time to come to fruition, and could be included in the autumn statement.However, green experts are worried that time is running out. Ed Matthew, the associate director at the thinktank E3G, said: “This was not a recovery statement, let alone a green one. It was an economic intervention to keep people spending money and save existing jobs once people come off furlough. There was very little on economic vision or recovery. But we are in a climate emergency and need urgent action to decarbonise the economy now. We need that comprehensive green recovery plan yesterday.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/96eb3ddbe89327d4d49fb05c7eab103ae6dadbd3/62_0_1028_617/master/1028.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=81afe06c732874b880bdb0a473ea22d8","title":"chanels lagerfeld inspired haute couture shows how luxury can thrive online","story":"Virginie Viard’s strong designs in chic colours shine, despite digital showcase’s subdued vibePre-pandemic, Chanel’s show would be a highlight of any Paris couture schedule – with a set worthy of a movie. Highlights from previous years have included a replica Eiffel Tower, an abandoned theatre and, last season, a library with books lining the walls.By contrast, the brand’s contribution to the first digital couture fashion week was a little lower-key. Debuted on Tuesday morning on its website was a one-minute-22-second film with models Rianne van Rompaey and Adut Akech wearing 30 outfits from the house’s most elite collection.The coronavirus crisis has forced fashion labels to move from physical events to online showcases, as the industry navigates the new normal. This video was showcasing creative director Virginie Viard’s designs to the couture customers who might be tuning in. It contrasted with other brands’ take on going digital, such as Schiaparelli’s film of designer Daniel Roseberry sketching his collection or Christian Dior’s narrative of mythical creatures being coaxed into couture dresses. While the latter film was let down by its lack of ersity in casting, it was probably the most imaginative take on digital couture this week.The Chanel collection was inspired by the life of the late Karl Lagerfeld, with whom Viard worked for over 30 years at Chanel, before becoming creative director after his death in 2019. In a press release, Viard wrote that she was thinking of “punk princesses”. “Karl would go to ‘Le Palace’,” wrote Viard. “He would accompany these very sophisticated and very dressed-up women, who were very eccentric too.”If the presentation perhaps lacked the wow factor of the physical shows, the clothes were strong and looked like the serious luxury that the couture client is looking for. Tweed pieces utilised yarn by Vimar, the high-end thread company that Chanel acquired this month. Jewel-like pinks and greens mixed with silver and inky blue – a colour palette that felt chic but also very wearable, should one have the required budget. A series of tiered gowns in taffeta and velvet, and beaded and embroidered pieces, were particularly sumptuous and ready for black-tie events, whenever they might return to social diaries.This is the second video Chanel has released since the pandemic. The first, for the “cruise collection”, was released on 8 June. The seven minutes of models standing in front of imagined seascapes and on elegant balconies was criticised as not reading the room while the news cycle focused on the emerging protests around George Floyd’s death and cities emerging from lockdown. It was also seen as a bit of an anticlimax after the razzmatazz of Chanel’s physical shows.Acclaimed art director Fabien Baron, speaking to WWD about the cruise show and fashion film, said a “straight” approach is less engaging. “Let’s remember that film is about image and storytelling, otherwise it can be very flat and an easy medium to lose an audience,” he said.Asked about the issue of ersity in fashion, Pavlovsky said it was a priority across Chanel’s business, which was reflected in the ersity of staff in its boutiques across the world. He said this was important for reaching a erse and international customer base. “Our customers are from everywhere – all cultures, all skin colours … As a brand, I believe we need to continue to be very engaged,” he said. “The best team is a erse team.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0eb1e1bfa2cdd26aad907bc7b59bac2d7c578c1c/896_67_3577_2146/master/3577.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b926ae9e49f27a678d4ae800268dae8","title":"dermot mulroney charlie sheen climbing over balcony half clothed","story":"The star of Young Guns made his name as one of the Brat Pack. Three decades on, while others have crashed and burned, he is dreaming of ‘reopening’ the entertainment industry after lockdownIn a quiet corner of his Los Angeles home, Dermot Mulroney grapples with a question that many actors’ egos would not allow them to entertain: why isn’t he a bigger star?“Well, I had some alcoholism. That slowed me down. And I ... wasn’t six feet. Does that work? No, that’s a little flimsy. Let’s keep thinking.”To be fair, few actors have been as consistent a presence on the big and small screens. Although he is best known for the 1997 romcom My Best Friend’s Wedding, Mulroney is as capable of grit as he is fluff, with film roles that include the Aids-themed drama Longtime Companion, the serial-killer thriller Copycat and the suburban angst of The Safety of Objects. More recently, he has found steady work in television, appearing in New Girl, American Horror Story, Arrested Development, Enlightened and the US adaptations of Shameless and Four Weddings and a Funeral. This month, he joins the second season of Hanna, the high-octane Amazon series about a child assassin.He’s hardly a failure, then. But you might have expected Mulroney to rise higher, given that he says he was “hand-selected” for stardom. In 1985, the year Mulroney turned 22, a new movement was sweeping through Hollywood with St Elmo’s Fire and The Breakfast Club: the Brat Pack of twentysomething A-listers, led by Emilio Estevez. Mulroney found himself caught in their slipstream as talent scouts sought out more young blood. The same applies to most US actors now aged between 54 and 58, he says (he is 56). “It’s Johnny, Brad and Keanu – the list goes right down the length of my arm because they were pulling in all of those 20-year-old kids that year, and all of them were good.”As the middle child of five growing up in Alexandria, Virginia, Mulroney acted in “back yard” theatre and school plays, although his chief creative pursuit was the cello. (He played in the scoring orchestra for Mission: Impossible III, among other blockbusters.) Later, while studying film at Northwestern University in Illinois, he appeared in the comedy revue – but his plan, after graduation, was to work as a cameraman in Chicago.When an agent came to audition young actors, Mulroney, on a whim, put his name down. “I was convinced that it was a waste of time, a pipe dream, and not worth any actual attention or effort – I wasn’t about to do that,” he says. “Two minutes later, I was signed.”He was cast in his first role, the television film Sin of Innocence, after only four months of auditions. “Then I took off like lightning. Once I got signed, I thought: ‘I’m really going to do this, and I’m going to do it for ever – I’m going to make sure I don’t blow it.’” Meanwhile, Mulroney’s agent was billing him as a “better actor than Tom Cruise”: “He’ll be a household name.” (Actually, Mulroney says: “It sure made things hard, ‘Dermot Mulroney’ did.”)The publicity machine kicked in to a higher gear in 1988 for Young Guns, a “Brat Pack western” starring Estevez as Billy the Kid, alongside Charlie Sheen and Kiefer Sutherland. The newcomer Mulroney was marketed as the fifth of “six reasons why the west was won”. “That’s that predetermination, where I was hand-selected.”Cutting loose on the hotel bars and steakhouses of Santa Fe with the young cast was “a top-favourite experience”, Mulroney says. “We were all drinking voraciously in a way that I don’t think young actors do today. I think that took on some legendary status.” The members of the group soon learned “who could handle their liquor, handle their scandals”. What scandals? Mulroney becomes vague. “Charlie Sheen, climbing over a balcony, kind of half-clothed …”As for Mulroney’s own drinking, he was never really bad on set and didn’t let people down, “except for” – he counts, then holds up four fingers to the camera – “this many times. But it’s a nailbiting business, that’s what I mean. Every performer is in a state of stress even when they make it look easy.”Young Guns was a hit at the box office, and in the home-video boom. But his best-known role remains My Best Friend’s Wedding: an “insidiously hilarious” film that people still feel affection for 23 years on. “A lot of these things are welling back over with nostalgia, and I’m all in with it – but it’s a real feeling.”Indeed, some viewers remain “deeply troubled” that his character rebuffed Julia Roberts’s: “That’s what makes the movie great,” he says. The two remain good friends and occasional collaborators, having worked together on August: Osage County and Amazon Prime’s Homecoming. “I’ve watched her family grow up,” he says. (He has two daughters, aged 11 and 12, with his wife, the singer Prima Apollinaare, as well as a 21-year-old son from his first marriage to the actor Catherine Keener.) He heaps praise on Roberts’s “sensible household”: “They use cloth towels in the kitchen, she makes her own focaccia pizza with vegetables from her garden … she’s got chickens.”While My Best Friend’s Wedding relaunched Roberts’s career, it combined with 2005’s The Wedding Date to typecast Mulroney as a romcom man – he believes, unfairly. “I only did two they just happened to be fucking great. And romantic comedies are indelible, so they made a deeper impression I couldn’t escape.”Yet Mulroney’s biggest footprint on popular culture may just be a 2012 Saturday Night Live skit about his being confused with the actor Dylan McDermott. (“It just goes on and on,” he marvels, without bitterness.) Just three episodes of Friends in 2003 – he played Rachel’s cocksure maternity cover Gavin – had a similarly outsized impact. He declined three more: “There’s a regret.”During the 2000s, Mulroney turned down most television in favour of the integrity and variety of independent film. But with the 2008 recession, indie budgets stopped stretching to relatively high-paid actors “to play the dad”, he says. “It took me a couple of years to realise: ‘I am not making a living any more the way I used to.’” TV, however, was booming: “I flexed a little, and maintained working status.” Today, Mulroney suggests, “an actor who doesn’t say yes to everything is really making a mistake”.For Mulroney, 35-odd years have passed “one job at a time”. “There is a point, I never got there, where you can plan your near future, people want you, and the bucks are big.” Yet that was what he had been on track for, when he entered the industry. Does he feel that he should have made the A-list? “The straight answer is yes, of course,” he says, slowly. “I thought I was just going to build right up and I’d be a top movie star.” Mulroney seems to have surprised himself with his answer. “I’ve never even really said that. But that was the programme. There’s no denying, that was gonna be the plot.”So what happened?That is the question that starts Mulroney spitballing: not obvious enough a leading man? Stiff competition? (“People like Patrick Dempsey, man, they were tough to beat!”) Too handsome! (“I heard Rob Lowe say that – but have you seen the guy?”) “Really, the answer is, I don’t know,” he finishes. “I tried fucking hard.”But he didn’t exactly fail. “I had a fair shot at the welterweight belt, I took a few on the chin and I’m still in the game – so I couldn’t be happier. I could have made more money. But I couldn’t give a damn about being more famous.”He has seen the toll of that first-hand. Mention of Lindsay Lohan, his co-star in Georgia Rule in 2007, prompts a visceral reaction: “She’s one of the first victims of social media.”“My hands are shaking,” Mulroney says, showing me, “because these are traumatised people. People her age, they were hit with the first wave of being famous in that way. We’ve learned since how destructive and awful that is, especially if you’re young and seeking it deliberately.“Now she’s like, an elder stateswoman – and we’ve seen them go down, one after another.” He won’t name names: “So many people still have so much time to recover from the pressure. But it’s been devastating, devastating, to watch. “So be careful, you kids, if you think you want to be a movie star or on a TV show or be in some band – fucking think twice! You can take the F-word out, but I mean it. It’s unsafe.”Unsafe to pursue fame? “Yeah, until now.”It is quite an extraordinary speech, and not always clear where Mulroney is locating the danger for young performers: the mental health toll of show business or the predators operating within it.It is “that sense of being watched at all times that drives celebrities crazy”, he believes – exacerbated by social media and reality programming. “The pressure of fame, the type of commitment it has started to take, of showing people so much of your home life … it turned all of our cultures.”But long before the selfie generation, Mulroney says, “Corey Feldman and those guys, just younger than my generation, were horribly abused by this industry”. And before them, “it was all the 70s sitcom kids, who were so horribly used up”.“How many made it out alive, not to mention sane? I don’t know what to do, but I can’t watch it any more.”Pressed for specifics, Mulroney is clear: he has never witnessed a sexual assault or “anything overt on any set” (nor does he count his cohort among “the traumatised crowd”). “But I know, it’s a lurking thing.”He hopes that it is changing: #MeToo has already “cleaned up our industrial worksites, for people’s safety and sanity”, he says. Young actors today “won’t ever have to have that creepy feeling, if not overt, misogynist, sexist, sexual assault and beyond. Those people are up and running, and on the ground they’re starting to be able to bring people in behind them.”He is also excited by the creative opportunities that may arise from “our current collective experience” – both the Black Lives Matter protests and Covid-19. In March, he had been in New York, finishing shooting on a season of his Fox crime drama Prodigal Son – resulting in a “nail-biting” few days of coast-to-coast travel before lockdown was imposed. “That was one of the last shows working, and I plan to be on one of the first shows going back.”That is why he has been so serious about quarantine, Mulroney says, brandishing a green bandana that has been serving as a mask (which he has fiddled with throughout the video interview). “My best contribution is to be able to reopen the industry and that huge chunk of the California economy.”He frets that he is underdressed – a polo shirt, worn under a hoodie, over a T-shirt – for the photoshoot later. “Does it look a little disrespectful, with the hoodie? What do you think? I might have to put on a real shirt, right, not, like, a golf shirt.”He has appreciated the family time that has been enforced by coronavirus. “I think it will go down in history as ‘that time when you spent all that time with your dad’.” The “secondary area” of his home, from which Mulroney is speaking, has been serving as his daughters’ classroom. (It features a large oil painting and a cushion shaped like a dog’s face. “The little glimpses you see of people’s home interiors now,” Mulroney says, peering at mine.) But he is keen to get back to work. “We’re going to release this creative force on ourselves. I very much want to be a part of what’s next.”As he said earlier, consistency brings its own rewards. “I never did reach that apex of my class, the No 1 guy. Therefore, I’m much more usable now. And there are fewer of us. Sometimes, it is a matter of outlasting.”• The second series of Hanna is on Amazon Prime"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a6bd07019738cb2cc54dae6cca7a527da5aa0f9/1025_270_2642_1585/master/2642.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=83c8fea1e8e17524ab9c0ad2e8034f0b","title":"finding the way back review ben affleck basketball drinker coach movie","story":"Affleck plays a depressed drinker whose life is rescued by becoming a basketball coach in this flat, uninspired fableA clunking underdogredemption sports movie with a horribly perfunctory and unconvincing script, and a ponderous, half-awake performance from the bearded and stolid Ben Affleck.He plays Jack, a lonely guy whose marriage has failed, owing to a family tragedy now he works on a building site and drinks himself to a stupor all day every day.

It’s not a million miles away from a cheesecake, but whose is the best recipe? Key lime pie is, like so many regional specialities, very much the product of its environment – in this case, the Florida Keys, a chain of coral islands that trail lazily into the Gulf of Mexico and that were only linked to the US mainland in 1912. This splendid isolation fostered a reliance on local ingredients such as limes and the cans of condensed milk popular in tropical climates before widespread refrigeration. Put the two together, and you have most of a key lime pie.Though it probably dates from the late 19th century, the dish became famous when the tourist industry took off in the Keys following the construction of the Overseas Highway – in a 1948 travel piece on Key West, the Washington Post includes it, along with turtle steaks and black bean soup, as one of the “epicurean pleasures not to be overlooked”. That said, there have been more recent claims that it’s simply an adaptation of a 1930s recipe for lemon pie created by a condensed milk manufacturer 1,500 miles north in New York City, but I won’t go there. Instead, here’s a recipe.Most key lime pie recipes make use of the aforementioned condensed milk, beaten with egg yolks to enrich it and turn it into a kind of quick custard. The mixture is further thickened by the addition of lime juice, whose acidity “cooks” the yolks, coagulating the proteins to give the whole thing a stiffer consistency. The more yolks you use, the richer and firmer the result – chef Brad McDonald’s pie, from his book Deep South, is undoubtedly delicious with just two, but it’s tricky to cut into neat slices. Four is more usual, and safer. (Interestingly, I have some trouble getting hold of condensed milk the man behind the counter in the third shop I try tells me demand has soared this summer. If anyone can explain why, please do let me know in the comments below my theory is no-churn ice cream.)Many American recipes express caution on the subject of raw egg yolk that’s less of a concern in the UK, where hens are vaccinated against salmonella, but that’s no reason not to try a baked recipe when Cooks Illustrated magazine makes such a compelling case for heat yielding a “thick, creamy and unctuous” (though I suspect they mean rich) filling with a pronounced lime flavour – “the difference was remarkable”. My panel, however, feels that it also gives the pie a texture more reminiscent of a baked cheesecake, particularly if, like Pepe’s Cafe in Key West (“the oldest eating house in the Keys!”), you whisk egg whites into the mixture to make it really fluffy. Better, if you’re really keen to serve up perfect wedges, to go down the freezer route, as Jennifer Steinhauer’s recipe for the New York Times suggests. Not only is this the dish that Meryl Streep pushes into Jack Nicholson’s smug face in the film adaptation of Nora Ephron’s Heartburn, but the icy temperature brings out the custardy smoothness of the filling in a way that’s extremely satisfying to eat. I haven’t suggested this step in the recipe below, because it’s not always practical, especially if you want to take the pie to a picnic, but I would recommend giving it a whirl if you are serving it in the vicinity of a freezer: leave it in there for at least three hours, then get it out 10 minutes before serving.Two of the recipes I try take a rather different approach. The Chez Panisse lemon meringue pie, which the New York Times cookbook suggests can be easily adapted to make a key lime variation, is made with a citrus curd that utilises eggs yolks and butter, thickened over heat, to make a very rich filling (“Are you sure this isn’t a lemon meringue pie?” someone queries in the gathering dusk of our socially distanced outdoor taste test), while photographer Stephen Shore’s key lime pie supreme has a cornflour and water base, with just a little butter. Mild and gently wobbly, it’s my favourite, because I must confess I find ordinary key lime pie rather intense – so sweet! So rich! So tangy! – but this is a democracy, and the panel vote for the traditional version.Some recipes assert that this pie is only worth making with key limes, the local name for a distinct species of thin-skinned, acidic, south-east Asian lime thought to have been brought to the Keys by Spanish sailors, and rhapsodise over their gorgeously aromatic qualities. In blind taste tests, however, this claim doesn’t always stand up, but whether or not they have a point, the fact remains that even on the Keys themselves, the limes used tend to be grown in Mexico, and even these are very rarely found outside the Americas, so I’ll be using standard fruit here. A good way to create a more well-rounded, perfumed flavour is to add zest, as most recipes suggest, whisking it with the yolks to release the volatile oils before stirring in the condensed milk and juice. Half a cup, or 120ml, juice is fairly standard – when you learn this is about four standard or 20 key limes, you may well feel relieved they’re so hard to come by.Though most older recipes for key lime pie use a graham cracker crust (graham crackers being a popular American biscuit) of the type popularised by Nabisco to promote its wares in the Great Depression, some more recent ones recommend pastry – Chez Panisse’s version uses a flaky version that, while delicious, is far too delicate for this unapologetically unsubtle dessert (I’d also question whether it’s enough for the size of tin called for in the recipe, but that’s an argument for the New York Times). The chunkier, rougher, more robust texture of a biscuit crust works much better.McDonald makes his own crackers first, adding honey and cinnamon to the dough, too – excellent on their own but, once whizzed to fine crumbs and then mixed with melted butter, my panel, after hacking at my pie tins, pronounce the fruits of my labour “too solid, like a rock”, voting instead for a crust made with shop-bought digestive biscuits. I’m rather taken with Bon Appetit’s suggestion of substituting the butter with coconut oil for a suitably tropical taste, but the panel aren’t convinced, so I’ll leave that one up to you, like the cinnamon I’m not so keen on. Do add a pinch of salt, though – it will be very welcome with the intensely sweet and sour filling.You could leave your key lime pie plain, as Pepe Cafe and McDonald do, but it looks more impressive with a topping meringue is one option, but though that’s a handy way to use up those excess egg whites, and my testers are vociferous in their support for it, when questioned, they admit that, much as they like meringue, it is “a lot” in combination (egg whites are great in daiquiris, by the way). Whipped cream, meanwhile, proves a soothing foil for the tangy filling and crunchy base – serve on the side, if you prefer (this makes it easier to transport), and garnish with slices of lime, if you’re playing to the camera.For the base 200g digestive biscuits (about 14)75g butter, or coconut oil, melted1 pinch saltFor the filling4 egg yolks4-5 limes400g tin condensed milkFor the topping (optional)300ml whipping or double cream1 tbsp icing sugarHeat the oven to 160C (150 fan)325Fgas 3 and grease a 20cm tart tin. Crush the biscuits to a fine crumb (this is easiest in a food processor, if you have one).Stir in the melted butter or oil and salt, tip into the tin and press down firmly into the base and around the sides.Bake for 15 minutes, until dry to the touch, then remove and leave to cool before making the filling.Finely grate the zest from all four limes into a large bowl, add the egg yolks, then squeeze the juice from the fruit into a jug until you have 120ml.Beat the yolks and zest for a couple of minutes, until the yolks thicken and turn a pale green, then stir in the condensed milk.Finally, beat in the lime juice and taste – it should be shockingly tangy and sweet, though you can add more juice if you like, bearing in mind that chilling will make the flavour more subtle.Pour the filling into the cooled biscuit shell and chill for at least three hours, until set. Just before serving, whisk the cream and sugar in a large bowl until the mix holds soft peaks, then dollop on top. Garnish with extra lime slices, if you have them.• Is key lime pie Florida’s best culinary export, and if not, what would you recommend instead? Which other recipes allow lime, rather than lemon, to take centre stage, and what else can you do with a tin of condensed milk?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/963d8fc28ac147fb9d645e12f854c5b9ff28fee5/84_0_2784_1670/master/2784.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f68d570c5296bd901ec2f7301416dd1e","title":"diangana and oshea down derby and put west brom back on top","story":"West Brom turned up the pressure on Leeds as they returned to the top of the Championship and moved a step closer to a Premier League return. Grady Diangana and Dara O’Shea struck to see off Derby and put Slaven Bilic’s side two points clear at the top, having played a game more, and five points ahead of third-placed Brentford.Defeat damages Derby’s play-off hopes as they dropped to eighth and also had Louie Sibley was sent off in injury time. Leeds host Stoke on Thursday knowing victory will reclaim the lead but Bilic should be satisfied with a professional job done with only four games left.Both sides began positively with O’Shea blocking from Duane Holmes and Kamil Grosicki shooting over. But it was Albion who struck first to underline their promotion credentials in the 11th minute. Grosicki’s cute through ball found Diangana and the West Ham loanee beat the offside trap to round Ben Hamer and roll in from a tight angle.Albion’s Matheus Pereira dragged wide soon after and Graeme Shinnie shot over as the visitors tried to find a foothold. Yet the Baggies had raised their game and comfortably kept the visitors at bay.With Pereira and Diangana they also had the game’s most influential players the pair, at times, toyed with Derby in the first half. George Evans blocked a low Pereira effort after the forward danced into the area eight minutes before the break.Albion continued to press, only for Grosicki to shoot wastefully over, and Hamer was forced into a smart low save when he turned Charlie Austin’s volley wide in first-half stoppage time.Wayne Rooney’s impact had been minimal but Pereira was growing in stature and Hamer saved his low drive four minutes after the restart. Diangana hobbled off soon after, being replaced by Callum Robinson, but the robust hosts did not break stride.Although Sibley slashed wide Derby remained limited and, after Hamer denied Pereira, Albion doubled their lead 14 minutes from time.

As is so often the case, Pep Guardiola’s side were far classier, far more accomplished than opponents who barely – if ever – threatened Ederson’s goal.Guardiola’s response to City’s loss at Southampton – a ninth of the campaign – was to make five changes, as in came Kevin De Bruyne and John Stones, who made a first league start in seven months and who was to impress throughout. Steve Bruce’s XI showed six different players from a draw with West Ham that had made Newcastle safe last time out.De Bruyne – who conducted proceedings all match – swung in a first corner that had Stones interested but Martin Dubravka, the visiting goalkeeper, was able to rise and collect the ball cleanly.The next time City attacked they scored. João Cancelo came infield before the ball was moved on to Rodrigo, Phil Foden and David Silva who, from a left-wing position, stroked a cross over. Gabriel Jesus allowed this to come past his body and he finished neatly.Newcastle nearly conceded a second when Ederson hit a 70-yard goal-kick straight to Riyad Mahrez. The Algerian swivelled smoothly and hit the bouncing ball in an instant but it went right into Dubravka’s hands to the keeper’s relief.City were already in control. Next Foden collected possession and glided past two opponents and saw a shot go just wide. When Silva overhit a pass Cancelo could not keep in play this pointed to a rare sloppiness that still visibly displeased Guardiola.Better was about to occur for the Catalan. City squeezed Newcastle on the left, Silva fed Foden and his ball released De Bruyne. A pull-back found Mahrez and he doubled the margin with aplomb.The drinks break allowed Bruce to inform his players to wake up – fast – if they hoped to stop what appeared the makings of a rout. But, not surprisingly, it was City – via Mahrez – who threatened next, though the forward allowed a through ball to slip under his feet.If Matt Ritchie was able to float a free-kick on to the head of an unchallenged Federico Fernández in a rare attack for Newcastle, City soon reasserted their grip. They ended the half with Rodrigo, Silva, De Bruyne, Foden and Mahrez moving the ball in and around their opponents. Foden may have held head in hands after missing from close range but as the second half commenced it was Newcastle who required inspiration from somewhere.Guardiola had swapped Ilkay Gündogan for Rodrigo and Kyle Walker for Cancelo but City were again in keep-ball mode. It was Walker who fashioned a sand-wedge of a chip into De Bruyne, who played a pass from which Foden surely should have scored from close range, but he again missed badly.City cruised in no more than third gear, toying with Newcastle. Blue shirts continually recycled the ball, and when the visitors finally managed to move into City’s half this was akin to a collector’s item.What occurred next was akin to Keystone Kops defending. Jesus swapped passes with Foden but now Ritchie intervened, stabbed at the ball, this hit Fernández’s hand and it spiralled past Dubravka, clipped the right post, and it was 3-0.In what was hardly better news for Newcastle, Guardiola replaced Jesus and Foden with Bernardo Silva and Raheem Sterling. The latter drew a foul from Joelinton and David Silva took the dead ball, arrowing this into the top corner for a 59th league goal of a glittering City career.Bruce brought on Dwight Gayle, Javier Manquillo and Matty Longstaff for Joelinton, Valentino Lazaro and Jonjo Shelvey but, as with so many against Guardiola’s side, his team were in a damage-limitation exercise now.In a nice moment Guardiola gave Tommy Doyle the final 15 minutes, the 18-year-old midfielder’s league bow.City ended with a Sterling strike in added time confirming a fine night for them, a miserable one for Newcastle."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d494e47cae4fddd6e4bc39966052b1e65889e552/55_0_4197_2521/master/4197.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=30af5a0f9592b92d24ee561d391f7058","title":"brighton v liverpool premier league live","story":"20 min: Brighton nearly grab a goal back, Gross and Maupay working some space down the inside-left channel. Wijnaldum half-intercepts in the box, but only tees up Trossard, who shoots from 12 yards. Williams slides in brilliantly to block and deflect the effort over the bar. The resulting corner is a non-event.18 min: Salah and Firmino combine down the middle, the latter being fouled by Lamptey. Salah was in the business of feeding Williams into space down the left, but the referee doesn’t play advantage. Nothing comes of the free kick.16 min: Maupay leaves a little something on Henderson, standing on the top of his foot. Nothing more than a foul, and probably just clumsy rather than spiteful, though you’ve seen yellow cards given for plenty of challenges like that.14 min: Keita looks in the mood tonight. He dribbles with speedy grace down the inside right, and slips a ball further down the channel for Salah, who floats a tame shot straight into the arms of Ryan. (Apologies for Prince earworm.) Salah was almost certainly offside anyway.13 min: Hearts in Liverpool mouths for the first time as Mac Allister, now fully repaired, chases a long ball down the middle. He’d have been free on goal, had Alisson not read the situation and raced from his area quickly to head clear.12 min: Liverpool continue to ping it around. Brighton can’t get a sniff.10 min: Mac Allister has taken an accidental whack upside the head. Blood runs down his face. On comes the physio. “Brighton may have to go back to the 60s for their last league home victory over Liverpool, but they did it in the FA Cup in 1984,” recalls Ben Mimmack. “I remember because my Dad came back from the match and told me they were going to the final again. Three weeks later they were hammered by Watford in the fifth round and that was that.” They’d beaten Liverpool at Anfield the year before, too, en route to the 1983 final you mention, former Liverpool midfielder Jimmy Melia the manager. Both results sending huge shockwaves all over the land. Ah the magic of the cup, huh kids.Brighton gift Liverpool another. Webster strides upfield but is swarmed by Henderson and Keita. Liverpool sweep forward though Firmino, who passes to Henderson to his right. The captain lashes into the top left from 25 yards. What a start by the champions! On the touchline, Graham Potter looks slightly stunned.Brighton play out from the back ... and straight into trouble. Ryan passes to Propper, who is immediately stripped by Keita. Fine pressing. Keita slips the ball to Salah on his right Salah opens his body and calmly slots the ball into the bottom left. Easy as that.5 min: Alexander-Arnold swings one in from the right. Salah can’t win a header, but the ball breaks to Firmino, whose shot is deflected wide left. Nothing comes from the resulting corner.3 min: Williams spins neatly past Lamptey on the left, but again Liverpool fail to drive home any advantage from the situation. A slightly uneasy start by the young Brighton right-back.1 min: Van Dijk makes a bit of a meal in ushering the ball back to Alisson. Maupay nearly nips in, but the keeper smothers. Oxlade-Chamberlain then makes good down the left after Lamptey misjudges the bounce of a long ball, but fails to do anything with the good position. A bright start by both teams.Brighton get the ball rolling ... but only after everyone takes a knee of solidarity, respect and love. Black lives matter.The teams are out! Brighton are in their blue and white stripes, while Liverpool wear red. Brighton form a guard of honour for the new champions. Georginio Wijnaldum and Virgil van Dijk look highly amused by it all. We’ll be off in a minute, on a drizzly night under the floodlights in East Sussex.More from Klopp, this time in praise of the hosts. “They have an interesting set-up. They fight to stay in the league, but do not play like this. They are a proper football team. They have a real plan and stick to it. Football-wise they have really clear patterns so they will be a challenge for us.”Graham Potter on tonight’s challenge. “There are a lot of games, we have freshened things up in some areas. We have a fit squad, so we need to choose. We have to play this game with respect to the opposition, they are a top team. Regardless of anything else, we have to make sure our performance is good and work really hard. We’re playing the champions. If we’re short and not quite at our best, we’ll be defeated.”Jurgen Klopp on full debutant Neco Williams. “He should just enjoy the game. We have to make sure that he is not alone. If he is alone, it should be in an offensive situation! Neco has showed he is ready. This is not a test. We need to make sure our intensity is right, and Andy Robertson has not had the same preparation as our other players. He was injured for ten days in our little pre-season. I am looking forward to it for him. He deserves it.”Brighton make three changes to the team named for the victory at Norwich on Saturday. Dale Stephens, Pascal Gross and Alexis Mac Allister replace Yves Bissouma, Aaron Mooy and Aaron Connolly.Liverpool make four chances to the team sent out to beat Aston Villa on Sunday. Neco Williams, Jordan Henderson, Georginio Wijnaldum and Roberto Firmino replace Andy Robertson, Fabinho, Divock Origi and Sadio Mane. It’s a first Premier League start for the 19-year-old Williams.Brighton \u0026amp Hove Albion have only ever beaten Liverpool once in the league at home. That was at the old Goldstone Ground back in January 1961. Tony Nicholas, Dennis Windross and Roy Jennings got the goals in a 3-1 win that seriously dented Liverpool’s chances of promotion from the Second Division. Bill Shankly’s team - featuring the likes of Roger Hunt, Gordon Milne, Gerry Byrne and Ronnie Moran - finished the season in third place, and would have to wait another year to go up. Brighton ended the season in 16th.Both clubs are in a far better place now. Brighton have made it to 36 points in the Premier League, a number big enough to ensure safety for the past two seasons, and surely big enough this time too. A fourth season of top-flight football awaits the Seagulls! Liverpool meanwhile have just ended that 30-year wait. Everybody happy!So can the Seagulls chalk up home league win number two over the Redmen? They’ve lost all five of their meetings with Liverpool since winning promotion in 2017, and Jurgen Klopp’s side are trying to break the points record in the English top ision, so they won’t be taking their foot off the gas. But Brighton are coming off the back of an impressive win at Norwich, while Liverpool have struggled on the road recently: they’re seven hours and 42 minutes without an away goal in all competitions! Maybe this match, like the corresponding fixture at Anfield earlier this season, will be a little closer than many expect. It’s Brighton. It’s Liverpool.

Suffice to say, pitch-side reporter Matt Smith made a valiant attempt to get him to speak, but might have had more luck extracting blood from a stone.More on Tommy Doyle’s grandfathers: “According to Wikipedia (so it may not be true) Tommy Doyle’s maternal grandfather still holds the record for the youngest ever person to play for Man City,” writes Jimmy M. “He’s the commentator’s dream this lad.Doyle’s paternal grandfather, Mike Doyle, is also a City hero and you can read more about the family here.

Elsewhere in the Premier League: Having failed to score all season, John Egan has gone goal crazy, bagging his second goal in as many games to give Sheffield United a late win over Wolves. At the London Stadium, Jay Rodriguez scored the only goal of the game as Burnley beat their hosts West Ham. Peep! Peep! Peeeeeeep! It’s all over at the Etihad Stadium, where Manchester City have pulled Newcastle’s pants down and given them a good king. If anything, a Newcastle side missing several key players dodged a hail of bullets after a bad day at the office, and will probably count their blessings that they only shipped five goals. They turned up with the air about them of a team that expected to get walloped and the hiding duly arrived.David Silva atones for his sins by teeing up Raheem Sterling for a shot into the bottom corner after Newcastle had given the ball away halfway inside their own half. Far be it from me to point the Big Finger Of Blame at anyone at this difficult time, but I’m looking at you Nabil Bentaleb. 89 min: David Silva cuts inside from the right and blasts the ball over the bar from a tightish angle, when he could have put it on a plate for Tommy Doyle, Bernardo Silva or Raheem Sterling, who were all unmarked in the Newcastle penalty area and screaming for a pass. Their senior team-mate apologises to all concerned. If anything, Clive, he had too many options. 88 min: The players of both teams are just going through the motions now, playing down the clock with Manchester City showing no real inclination to pile any more hurt on their visitors.84 min: Newcastle double-substitution: Matt Ritchie and Emil Krafth make way for Christian Atsu and Yoshinori Muto in what we will politely call Steve Bruce’s last throw of the dice. 82 min: Kevin De Bruyne plays one of his flat, lofted passes into the Newcastle penalty area for Bernardo Silva to chase, but it flies straight into the arms of Dubravka. 78 min: Bernardo Silva advances on the Newcastle penalty area down the inside right, with Kyle Walker up in support. Bernardo runs down a blind alley and Newcastle clear. Matty Longstaff, who has just come on, already looks to be struggling with an injury. 76 min: Manchester City substitution: Tommy Doyle on for Riyad Mahrez. It’s his Premier League debut, so congratulations to him. Both of his grandfathers played for Manchester City, notching up almost 1,000 appearances between them, so he has very, very big boots to fill.75 min: Manchester City squander two good scoring chances in quick succession, the pick of them falling to David Silva, whose shot is turned over the cross-bar by an off balance Martin Dubravka. Good save. Nothing comes from the corner.70 min: DeAndre Yedlin makes a good run down the right flank for Newcastle, looks up but sees no options open to him and plays the ball backwards. Newcastle are repeatedly on the retreat, even when in possession and it makes no sense whatsoever. I would be intrigued to hear the thinking behind this weird approach, or lack of approach. Perhaps somebody will ask Steve Bruce after the game. 67 min: Newcastle triple-substitution: Dwight Gayle, Matty Longstaff and Javier Manquilo on for Joelinton, Jonjo Shelvey and Valentino Lazaro. No pressure, lads. Free-kick for City, just outside the Newcastle penalty area after Joelinton fouls Raheem Sterling. David Silva spots that the wall is not wide enough and insists on taking the set piece, pulling rank on De Bruyne. A second later, the ball is nestling in the back of the net after being dispatched into the top corner. Brilliant! 64 min: Raheem Sterling tries a shot from the edge of the Newcastle penalty area after Valentino Lazaro gifts him the ball. His effort is blocked. 62 min: More misfortune for Newcastle as Manchester City make a double-substitution: Raheem Sterling and Bernardo Silva replace Phil Foden and Gabriel Jesus.60 min: Newcastle have ridden their luck at times in this game but ran out of it on that occasion. With the ball at his feet, Gabriel Jesus was scurrying through the Newcastle penalty area. Matt Ritchie stuck out a foot to dispossess him, the ball flew up in the air and was erted into the Newcastle goal by a ricochet off a completely unwitting and helpless Fernandez. Not that they need assistance, Manchester City go 3-0 up after Matt Ritchie’s attempt to dispossess Gabriel Jesus spins up in the air and goes past a hopelessly wrong-footed Martin Dubravka off Federico Fernandez.57 min: A cross from the left flank is controlled by Joelinton on his chest. He’s off balance and it bounces up in the air, allowing Nicolas Otamendi to head clear. 55 min: Kyle Walker is penalised for handball near the halfway line and Newcastle use the free-kick to play the ball all the way back to Martin Dubravka. Why? That’s inexplicable carry-on. 53 min: Not for the first time this evening, Newcastle struggle to play the ball out from the back under intense pressure from their opponents, end up lumping it towards the halfway line and losing it. It’s been a recurring theme. 50 min: Martin Dubravka claims a Kevin De Bruyne corner confidently, after David Silva had seen a shot deflected over the bar following a terrific cross-field pass by Kyle Walker that gave City a route to Newcastle’s goal. 49 min: At the far post, Phil Foden stabs the ball wide with the goal at his mercy after getting on the end of a looped delivery from Kevin De Bruyne. Another let-off for Newcastle – that was one of those opportunities that looked easier to score than miss. 47 min: Nicolas Otamendi tries to pick out Oleksandr Zinchenko with a short pass to the left touchline, but shanks the ball out of play and into the stand. It’s not often you see Manchester City players doing that.It’s scoreless between Sheffield United and Wolves at the interval at Bramall Lane. At the London Stadium, Jay Rodriguez has scored the only goal of the game between West Ham and Burnley, which the visitors lead at half-time. Brighton entertain Liverpool in tonight’s late kick-off, which you’ll be able to follow with the . Goals from Gabriel Jesus and Riayd Mahrez separate the sides, but the scoreline flatters Newcastle. Missing several key players, they’ve been battered in that first half but are somehow clinging on. I suspect we might see Dwight Gayle introduced in the second half - his speed could cause Manchester City problems on the rare occasions Newcastle mount attacks on the break.45+1 min: We’re into time added on at the end of the first half and while they’re two goals down, Newcastle’s players will probably be delighted the scoreline isn’t an awful lot worse from their perspective. They’re forced to withstand a late siege before adjourning to the dressing-room for their team talk. Will Steve Bruce use the carrot or the stick? His team have given away two cheap goals but can be reasonably pleased to be only two down. 44 min: Rodri picks out Zinchenko on the left touchline with a terrific pass. The Ukrainian’s low cross is cleared at the near upright. 43 min: Manchester City corner. Kevin De Bruyne’s delivery is poor and cleared at the near post. 41 min: Shelvey loses possession on the edge of his own area again, getting caught on his heels and allowing Foden to steal the ball and play a give-and-go with David Silva. He looks a certainty to score with only Dubravka to beat, but sends his shot from 10 yards out wide of the upright. 38 min: Martin Dubravka has a goal kick to take and due to the tenacity of City’s forward players, there are literally no options open to him but to lump it long. There’s no shame in that, with Joelinton up front to try to win headers and flick-ons. Newcastle win themselves a free-kick wide on the left. Matt Ritchie sends it towards the far post again, where it’s cleared. 35 min: For the second time in quick succession, Jonjo Shelvey gives the ball away. The first time was just outside the City penalty area, this time it’s just outside his own. His mistake could have been costly - Dubravka is forced into conceding a corner from a Mahrez shot after good build-up play from Foden and David Silva. 34 min: Nothing comes of the corner, which is half-cleared by Kevin De Bruyne. An important header from Fabian Schar stops City mounting a successful attack on the break. Better from Newcastle in the past couple of minutes, but the bar is low. 32 min: Matt Ritchie is forced into giving away possession by a hard press, but Cancelo loses the ball and Newcastle attack on the counter. They win a corner.

Zivkovic’s shot is blocked, then it comes to Osborn whose shot is pushed out for a corner.90 min: Doherty blocks a cross by Stevenes with his arms. United have a freekick just to the left of the box. They’ve got plenty of tall guys in the area to aim at ... They take it short to Osborn, who tries to lash in a low cross towards the near post. It’s cleared for a corner.86 min: Wolves are penning their hosts back but still not look like breaking through.83 min: Jimenez makes a mess of the last pass when Doherty was pleading to be put through.81 min: Saïss puts Basham’s cross behind for a corner. Norwood delivers but Wolves get it away, out for a throw-in on the far side.79 min: Wolves substitution: Dendoncker on, Traoré off. That means a switch to 3-5-2 and a chance of attacking emphasis: until now Traoré had been practically Wolves’ only source of danger but United’s centrabacks were generally coping well with his crosses when they came now Wolves will hope to have more men to attack through the middle. They’ll have to summon more class than they’ve shown from there so far though. 77 min: Zivkovic chips over a canny cross from the left. Baldock comes in on the blindside of Jonny to get to the ball first. But he doesn’t connect properly with his header, so he nods a bouncer wide from eight yards. What a chance! 73 min: Boly drags down Zivkovic to concede a freekick near the left-hand corner flag. Norwood botches the freekick, failing to beat Jimenez at the near post.72 min: Amazing by Traoré! he demonstrates his speed by beating O’Connell to the ball despite starting from five yards behind him, and then shows his composure and skill by slowing down to float a delicate cross into the danger area. Egan does well to clear.68 min: It says lot about the shallowness of these teams’ squads that there has only been one substitution so far.66 min: United continue to put on the pressure, but Wolves are coping with it pretty comfortably. Berge and Mousset are getting into some dangerous positions though, and Stevens is a constant threat down the left. He’s been having the better of his duel with Doherty so far.63 min: Dinky work down the right by Baldock and Basham, whose pass eludes Berge by a fraction! If he had been able to collect that, the Norwegian would have had a clear shot from 10 yards. And when the move breaks down, Wolves seize the change to launch a counter. Traor´e goes speeding into the Blades’ half ... before he’s the victim of a desperate trip by Stevens. That’s as blatant a yellow card offence as you’ll ever see. 60 min: Wolves have lost the initiative in this game. But they’ll be confident they can still hit United on the counter. Just once in the last half an hour could be enough to boost their Champions League charge ...58 min: A sweeping United move culminates with another excellent low cross from the left by Stevens. It flashes across the six-yard box but neither Mousset nor Sharp can get on the end of it! 56 min: Both these team look a little jaded. There’s no lack of effort but neither is as precise as usual. 54 min: Basham goes down in the box after a neat United move involving Norwood, Sharp and Berge. The ref saw nothing awry with the challenge and there are no complaints from United. Good, because Saïss didn’t touch Basham. 53 min: Stevens finds Sharp with a wonderful first time pass from the left. Sharp turns around Coady and fires into the net ... but he was offside. Not even VAR is going to overturn that. Probably.53 min: Moutinho’s delivery from the right is characteristically dangerous, but O’Connell stoops to head it away. It runs to Neves, who has a crack from over 20 yards. It misses by miles.52 min: Freekick to Wolves in a useful crossing position after Egan blocks off Jimenez’s run. 49 min: It’s a good spell by United, zipping the ball around in the Wolves half. Brge plays in Basham down the right, but the cross goes straight to Patricio at the near post.48 min: Baldock crosses from near the corner flag. Coady is well positioned to clear.46 min: No personnel changes during the break, but Lys Mousset is in serious discussion with Wider on the sidelines, suggesting he will be introduced soonish. They could sure do with him, as McBurnie and sharp have got no change out of the Wolves’ defence.There hasn’t been much to report in terms of goalmouth action but it hasn’t been too boring, as there has been plenty of committed play and bold intent. Wolves had the better of it but lacked precision when it mattered most. But, as already noted, they tend to be at the most dangerous in the second half. But the Blades have carried a latent threat too even if neither of their forwards has had a much of a look in. Stay tuned! 45+3 min: Wolves end the half on the attack, but their efforts yield nothing as Moutinho wafts a shot wide from 20 yards after a pass by Doherty.45+2 min: Norwood aims a corner to the back post this time. Doherty beats Berge to it to nod away.45+1 min: Norwood’s corner is headed away powerfully at the near post by Jimenez, a striker with many strings to his bow. 45 min: A swift counter-attack by United. Stevens dangerous low cross from the left is cleared by Coady.44 min: Neves drills a low shot from an acute angle on the right. Henderson is too alert to be beaten at his near post.43 min: Coady finds Doherty with a superb long diagonal pass. Doherty ‘s cross is cleared at the near post. 41 min: A long kick from Henderson runs straight out of play at the other end, doing nothing to increase the entertainment factor.40 min: Traoré goes back into his own box to help his team out. He wins the ball and then sets off on a charge upfield: three players converge on him before he even makes it to half way. And on of them fouls him. 38 min: Good work in midfield by Osborn, who finds Stevens on the left. The wingback slips a nice pass into the let-hand side of the box. Sharp peels away from Saïss to collect it near the byline, but his cross poses no threat.36 min: Neves has a pot shot from from 25 yards. It swerves several yards over the bar.

Here’s your match report. Bye!While West Ham remain in control of their destiny, this messy effort was a reminder that survival in the short term will bring no guarantee of a brighter future. Even if David Moyes succeeds in steering them towards calmer waters in the next four games, realists will know this leaky ship will still be in danger of sinking next season.For now the smart money is on West Ham staying up given they are four points above the relegation zone, with games against Norwich, Watford and Aston Villa to come. In the long run there is little cause for optimism.Uncertainty gripped West Ham just when they seemed poised to pull clear and Burnley punished their frailties at both ends of the pitch, making light of their injury crisis by moving three points behind sixth-placed Wolves thanks to a clever winner from Jay Rodriguez.Much more here:West Ham weren’t great today, but though I can see them losing against one of Norwich, Watford and Aston Villa, they will surely win one of those games to reach (effective) safety. Soucek is a good goal threat both at set pieces and running into the box from midfield, Antonio stretches teams with his pace (when not completely knackered), Haller is back to add height to the forward line, Bowen and Yarmolenko both offer a decent threat from wide positions, and all in all they should have enough. Burnley meanwhile will just continue to Burnley their way into Burnleyable positions, as they do.It is a challenge when they lose their teammates, but there’s a resilience to them, there’s an honesty to them and there’s a respect in the group, and you add in organisation and you certainly add a physical prowess, and I think they’ve got more talent than people sometimes mention, and I think it’s a good mixture.Fair play to them, they’ve asked a lot of questions of us. But we defended well when we needed to and we had a few moments when we could have got our nose even further in front. They’ve had a couple of golden moments and our keeper was there to save the day when he was needed. Nick Pope, who had a fine game in nets and kept his 14th clean sheet of the season, is chirpy: 90+6 mins: It’s over! Three wins in four for Burnley, and every one of them by the same scoreline.90+5 mins: West Ham have 90 seconds to conjure a clear chance. They’ve only had two so far, one moments after the goal and another moments after Haller’s introduction.90+3 mins: Antonio chips the ball into the mixer, and it looks destined for Bowen until Pope runs out and punches it away.90+2 mins: West Ham win a corner, which somehow bounces through the six-yard box without anyone getting a touch on it!90+1 mins: Brownhill has recovered, and returns for the start of six minutes’ stoppage time.88 mins: Bowen hammers a shot into Brownhill’s head, and he goes down and stays there. It’s hard to tell, in the circumstances, if he’s genuinely troubled or just keen to waste a few minutes.87 mins: West Ham take off Fornals and bring on Ajeti.85 mins: West Ham are attacking the same way a third-rate covers band might play Stairway to Heaven. The right chords, but none of the magic.82 mins: Burnley have only made seven substitutions since the restart, which is an illustration of their various woes. And they’re heading for a third win in four.80 mins: Save! Burnley threaten on the break, Wood running onto a long pass forward and beyond Diop, cuts onto his right and hits a powerful shot towards goal, but Fabianski stops it!80 mins: West Ham are pushing with increasing pace and desire, but no more precision. 75 mins: GOAL! But it’s disallowed! Bardsley slides in a low pass, Wood turns it in, but he was just beyond Diop! VAR will have to check this.72 mins: The game restarts, and after the ball bobbles around Burnley’s area Bowen has a shot, which bobbles wide off a defender. Sometimes the Hammers look like they’re trying to do heart surgery with a trombone. 68 mins: Burnley send a corner to the far post, where Long tries to challenge Fabianski and is harshly judged to have fouled the keeper. And that’ll be drinks.66 mins: Chance for a second! Taylor’s cross from the left flicks off a defender’s head and falls to Wood, who erts it straight to Fabianski.64 mins: Nothing comes of it, Burnley break, and Fredericks gets booked for trying to stop them.63 mins: Bowen has a couple of shots, which are blocked by Tarkowski and Long. West Ham win a corner, which leads to another. The pressure mounts.62 mins: And Haller nearly scores after five seconds! A long throw drops to Antonio, whose shot deflects to Haller, who suddenly has the goal at his mercy but picks out Pope!62 mins: A change for the Hammers: Yarmolenko goes off, and Haller comes on.61 mins: Antonio outmuscles Tarkowski, who tumbles, but then trips over the prone defender.60 mins: West Ham win a corner, which they inevitably send towards Soucek, who heads high.58 mins: Ouch! Tarkowski studs Bowen in the knee, not particularly violent but nowhere near the ball, and is lucky to just get a booking. Vydra, whose body language wasn’t very encouraging all evening, goes off to be replaced by Wood. 56 mins: Twice already this half McNeil has picked up the ball in a central position and run diagonally towards the left, away from anywhere interesting, before giving it away.53 mins: A few minutes of midfield stodginess. West Ham keep finding Antonio, but he isn’t finding anyone else at the moment and that’s where their attacks are currently fading.50 mins: Burnley make nothing with the corner but win another, from which eventually Brownhill crosses, it’s knocked down and Vydra winds up a blockbuster left-foot volley but completely misses.48 mins: McNeil crosses low from the left, Vydra runs across his marker to meet it, and the ball deflects off Fredericks for a corner. A bright restart for the visitors.46 mins: Within seconds Vydra gets a chance to sprint beyond the home defence, but he seems a bit tentative about it, and instead of turning on the afterburners he slams on the brakes.46 mins: Peeeeeeep! Bubbles everywhere as the players come out and kick off.

Whatever your trade, glowing reviews are good for business.But since setting up Surrey Hills Handyman in 2016, Lingard has sought to gain further advantage, using Google My Business, a free tool for businesses to manage their online presence across Google services. The tool helps him display his five-star ratings and the favourable reviews he has earned on his online profile, which – alongside the use of Google ads to reach new customers – have helped him grow his business exactly how he wants. Like word of mouth, in digital form.Four years on, Lingard can afford to be choosier. He specialises in “all the little jobs” that people often can’t find someone to do or don’t have time for themselves, focusing on quality, not quantity, “like bits of tiling or installing kitchen splashbacks, putting up picture hooks or fitting doorbells”.It’s here that promoting himself through Google tools has really paid off, taking on greater importance in recent months. Lingard had already taken to using Google ads, using keyword research to help find out what prospective clients were searching for online in and around Guildford – for instance, jet-washing a patio during the summer months – and then advertising those specific skills. This ability to be flexible and fleet of foot has had a significant impact on his business – “It’s quick, effective and direct,” he says – but really came into its own following the lockdown, when he was able to swiftly angle his remit as a “contactless service” in order to address customer fears around social distancing.Meanwhile, his Google My Business profile has helped him to keep existing customers updated with his working hours, while the review rating builds his reputation and earns trust with new ones. Lingard says Google also enables him to concentrate on the job at hand rather than tying himself up fielding calls asking what jobs he can do – the photos on Google My Business help showcase this to prospective customers. Even with the unpredictability of the future, given the pandemic, there is significant potential for tradespeople like Lingard to grow their businesses as households contend with the crisis. Homeowners have had more time to contemplate their surroundings, while a growing number of the UK workforce expect a permanent change to their company’s approach to flexible working post-lockdown. It means many homes and gardens will require improvements. Lingard’s Google profile, for example, flags up his skills at assembling flatpack office furniture.At a time when the wider job market looks uncertain, Lingard reveals that he is booked up six weeks in advance. “In a time of social upheaval and economic downturn such as this, demand for my services could have dwindled to nothing, but I’ve even been able to turn work away,” he says. “Google My Business has been central to me weathering the storm and future-proofing myself.”To find out how Google can help your business adapt, visit: g.cosmallbusiness"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b473ddf12486a48df79edc79336b9da1ddb50475/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6c64d254b4a65ad0ee81b15a92a6965c","title":"we realised we were a necessity how a high street baker used google to keep serving his community","story":"For Sam Mensah of London bakery Uncle John’s, the right digital ingredients equipped his business to rise to the challenge during lockdownThe bright yellow signage of Uncle John’s Bakery stands out like a beacon on West Green Road, in the north London suburb of Tottenham. Famed for its lovingly made Ghanaian sweet bread and other regional specialties such as drop doughnuts and meat pies, the bakery has served London’s African-Caribbean and wider community for 25 years.Sam Mensah took over the family business in 2015. “When my parents came to Britain in 1982, they had nothing behind them education-wise, but they were ready to seize the opportunities life in the UK could provide,” he recounts.“They longed for the comfort of Ghanaian sweet bread, but the available imports were stale on arrival. So they started baking their own, to a family recipe, using somebody else’s bakery after midnight. Soon they started selling it by word of mouth. Then they had it packaged, placing it in Ghanaian shops. Eventually they built up enough momentum to open a shop of their own.“It wasn’t always easy, but whenever things looked bleak, my mum reminded my dad of a Ghanaian motto: obeyeyie – things will get better. I think – and especially now, when people might feel like they need to give up on things – you have to have resilience.”Resilience and persistence is clearly baked into the family DNA, as Mensah too proved when he set aside a successful music career to take over running Uncle John’s from his ageing parents. Tackling a steep learning curve, he not only added two new production units and gained the certifications needed to be able to supply supermarkets, but also comprehensively rebranded the store and built up a digital and social media presence.And as the UK went into lockdown in March, it was this spirit of resilience that made all the difference. Mensah says he did have a moment of panic: “We closed the store for a couple of days. Then we realised the wholesale side was moving fast and that we were a necessity – that people will buy our bread. So we reopened, putting measures in place to protect our staff, and publicised our new opening times on social channels, and above all, on Google My Business.”Using Google My Business – a free tool for businesses to manage their online presence across Google, including updating opening times on Search and Maps - meant customers could not only see the bakery’s new hours of business, but also that online ordering was available, either for pickup, or for delivery within an eight-mile radius. Uncle John’s also delivered flour – a hot commodity at the peak of the lockdown.If luck is when preparedness and opportunity meet, Mensah had the perfect package at just the right time: an optimised website with Google Maps integration, a strong social media presence, and an informative Google My Business profile. Positive Google reviews further buttressed his credibility, reassuring first-time customers. With all the pieces coming together, what could have been a crisis became a springboard for further growth.Mensah is clear what a lifeline it has proved to be: “With Google My Business, we have been able to communicate our business’ adaptations during this current pandemic, and helped bridge the gap between our business and consumers by keeping customers informed. And in turn, through reviews, we are able to understand what the customer wants and adjust accordingly.”And the effects go well beyond his premises Mensah was also able to publicise his NHS initiative – priority service and free loaves for NHS staff. “Serving our community at this time is more important than ever,” he says. “We’ve given out more than 2,000 loaves so far.”In fact, this community ethos was what drove Mensah to take over the family business in the first place: “What really helped me make that decision was having a daughter of my own. I wanted her to see what legacy is about. I felt that this business was something very important within the community, and for the generation that comes after me.”For Mensah, the way forward is now clearer than ever. “Our goal is to stand our ground among all British companies, not just black businesses,” he says. “And it’s no longer just for us. It’s for all the people who are placing their trust in us.”To find out how Google can help your business adapt, visit: g.cosmallbusiness"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a371e11d8c0194b16ba2ad85052f592fafd61558/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e65dd308a467c45f3bb10e9faf011db","title":"we sold the most books ever in a month how an inclusive bookseller adapted during lockdown","story":"Lynsey Pollard’s family-run business champions ersity in children’s books. Using Google tools helped Little Box of Books become a bestsellerLynsey Pollard picks up her phone from the kitchen table and pans the camera around to reveal dozens of boxes stacked through the living room behind her. “There’s another bookcase full downstairs and some in the hallway,” she says. “You should have seen it two months ago you could barely move. We even had to store them under the bed.”It’s been a hectic three months for the director of Little Box of Books, a subscription service for children’s books she runs with her partner Neil Langston from their London flat. In mid-March, just before the coronavirus lockdown, they took the risk of ordering a three-month supply of books instead of the normal one-month’s supply.“We had no idea how business would go, how our suppliers would manage or if they’d even exist afterwards,” Pollard says. “We wondered what would happen if one of us got sick. Neil also runs an IT consultancy and we’ve got an 18-month-old and a six-year-old to look after. For a two-person business, it was quite intimidating.”Pollard credits Google tools for the surge. “Google My Business has helped us to help our customers,” she explains. “We could let them know we were still open for business and fully stocked up. It is amazing to have a versatile and visible storefront apart from the website that drives traffic to our products, helping people to find us and trust us.”For Pollard and Langston, who founded the company in 2018 with the aim of bringing greater ersity to kids’ bookshelves at home and in school, this enhanced ability to create awareness of their product and capitalise on it is central to not just their business, but to their mission.Pollard, who previously worked in charity communications, had the idea during a period as a single mum to her eldest son. “I just didn’t see our family in any of the stories I was reading to him.” Now, each month, after scouring scores of publishing lists, she sends customers hand-wrapped books and other learning resources that include characters with different racial backgrounds, disabilities, step-parents, single parents, two mums, two dads and anything else that more accurately reflects the society we live in.Pollard and Langston hadn’t even finished testing their website, but she soon found herself on Sky News discussing the study and her new business. To make the most of the media exposure at the time, Pollard started using Google ads so her website would appear when people searched for more erse books. “It helped bring us our first customers who weren’t friends or family,” says Pollard. “That was such a great feeling, to know that people wanted to buy our product.”“We thought books and learning resources that would transport them outside of their family bubble during this time could be important,” says Pollard. “So we created ads to reference that, and help more people to find us.”Pollard says Google tools have enabled their business to reach an entirely new audience in recent months. “They have brought hundreds of people to us who may not have realised that most children’s books don’t accurately reflect the world we live in today. I love that it’s why we set up the company. I’ll continue to update my Google My Business as another place where people can find our business.”There’s a social element to all that Pollard and Langston do. For every box purchased, they send one to London-based child literacy charity Doorstep Library. And since March, each new order has received a stamped envelope addressed to a care home resident, so children can write letters or draw pictures for older people who are isolated.When we speak, anti-racism protests have spread from the US to the UK, further highlighting the need for greater ersity on children’s bookshelves. Pollard is already noticing the impact on her business. “People want to do better for their kids. Sometimes they just need a little help. We’d love it if all children could see themselves in stories. Then instead of talking about ‘erse books’, we could just talk about ‘books’.”To find out how Google can help your business adapt, visit: g.cosmallbusiness"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff02d590a99ec550c9a855e442e3b1b2477a7dd2/0_215_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=652e3ea770674453653c8e44d9e9fcf9","title":"stamp duty chancellor rishi sunak summer statement","story":"Rishi Sunak has announced a stamp duty holiday in his summer statement. How will this affect you?The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has announced there will be no stamp duty to pay on property purchases up to £500,000.Stamp duty land tax, its proper name, is a tax paid by someone who purchases a property or piece of land in England or Northern Ireland – Scotland and Wales have their own systems. The tax is paid when the sale is completed and is based on the sum paid.Prior to the financial statement, there were two different points at which stamp duty was payable, depending on whether you were a first-time buyer or a mover. For movers, stamp duty had to be paid on any property costing more than £125,000.For first-time buyers there was no stamp duty to pay unless a property cost more than £300,000. If your first home cost more than £500,000 you paid the same as a mover but if it cost less than that, you only paid tax on the part of the price that fell between £300,000 and £500,000.The cut will make a difference for anyone buying a property over the old thresholds. For first-time buyers, it will generally be those in the south-east and London who stand to benefit, as elsewhere they would typically not be spending more than £300,000.The saving could allow people to move more quickly than planned – instead of needing the money for tax they can now channel it towards their deposit. The tax is paid after a sale is completed, so anyone who is part-way through buying a property will benefit.At £250,000, a first-time buyer was already off the hook for stamp duty but a mover would pay £2,500. They will now pay nothing.An investor spending £250,000 on a property will save £2,500, while one spending £495,000 will save £14,750.The housing market was frozen during lockdown, with buyers and sellers told to stall purchases. Since estate agents reopened there are signs that people are looking again – property websites and mortgage lenders have all reported jumps in interest from prospective buyers but the Treasury is obviously worried that the rebound will be fleeting.While some people are not moving because of immediate financial problems that will be solved by the cut, there will be many others who are staying put because they have lost their jobs, or are concerned about the outlook for the industry they work in. The cut may bring forward purchases but it may not stimulate many extra ones.Previous holidays have focused on first-time buyers and do not seem to have led to a surge in sales. The chancellor mentioned that prices had fallen since the crisis and talked about taking away uncertainty for people, so the move seems designed to support values. Some of the money saved by buyers could go towards their offer for a property and lead to increases in parts of the country where the market is busy. The fact that landlords and investors will also get a tax cut will make this more likely than if it had only applied to homebuyers.Typically, the largest increases come in the run-up to a stamp duty holiday ending, when people are keen to take advantage of the tax break while it lasts, so we could see a bubble next spring.On all purchases there is a surcharge if it is a second home."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0bb3888fe32302b7cbb925f41dfbd86caaf86f6a/0_474_4897_2935/master/4897.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7b58f0b3c8f93f1d8430629c34eb2d35","title":"brahms where to start with his music","story":"Our new series continues with Brahms - for some a reactionary, for others a radical, the highly wrought dramas of his symphonies and concertos and the quiet distinction of his chamber works have ensured his music enduresThis series began last week with Beethoven. Among the composers who took up the daunting challenge of the symphonic form, none was more aware of the legacy than Johannes Brahms (1833-97). The responsibility weighed heavily upon him, and it took him many years to emerge entirely from Beethoven’s shadow.Brahms’s works rarely feature among lists of the most well known classical tunes. But then his music never aims at instant effects he never bothered with the distraction of opera, and he generally avoided religious music. (His German Requiem, composed following the death of his mother, uses biblical texts, but it is not a liturgical work in any real sense.) Apart from his songs – more than 200 of them – almost everything that Brahms wrote was “absolute music”, ie music that is not explicitly “about” something.Nevertheless he composed some of the most frequently performed works in the concert repertoire. His Variations on a Theme of Haydn, often known as the St Anthony Variations, is a concert perennial and his Hungarian Dances are popular orchestral encore pieces, while the Academic Festival Overture quotes the student song Gaudeamus Igitur, still sometimes heard at graduation ceremonies. Perhaps the nearest Brahms came to a sentimental favourite was his Wiegenlied, Cradle Song, the lullaby he dedicated to a friend on the birth of her son. And Brahms’s two great piano concertos, both works of symphonic length and ambition, are perhaps the most archetypal of all romantic concertos, pitting a “heroic” solo piano against the might of a full orchestra.Brahms grew up in Hamburg. His father was an orchestral double bass player, who gave him his first music lessons. An early piano teacher complained that the young Brahms could be an even better pianist if he did not spend so much of his time composing. By the time he was 12, though, he was receiving composition lessons from pianist and composer Eduard Marxsen, who had not only known Beethoven and Schubert, but also hugely admired Haydn and Mozart, and ensured that his pupil was familiar with the tradition that those composers defined. Brahms made his debut as a pianist at the age of 14, and very soon began including his own works and arrangements in his recitals. However the story that in his teens he supplemented the family income by playing the piano in Hamburg brothels seems to be a myth.Violinist Joseph Joachim, who he met as a young man, became a lifelong friend. Both his Violin Concerto and the Double Concerto for violin and cello as well as three violin sonatas would be written for Joachim, and the violinist also led the first performances of a number of Brahms’s chamber works.It was thanks to Joachim that the 20-year-old Brahms met Robert and Clara Schumann. He was warmly welcomed and his talent immediately recognised. He had already published some pieces and arrangements under a pseudonym, but Schumann’s enthusiasm for his music enabled Brahms to get music published under his own name, including the three piano sonatas, and some songs. Schumann’s mental health was steadily worsening, though, and after attempting suicide in February 1854 he was confined to an asylum. His wife was not allowed to visit him, and Brahms became their intermediary. His Variations on a Theme of Schumann (1854) are dedicated to Clara, and in an attempt to distract her from her husband’s predicament, he also composed the Four Ballades Op 10, whose bardic intensity makes them unlike any other piano works of his.The nature of the friendship between Brahms and Clara Schumann has been the subject of much speculation. If it was an entirely platonic relationship it was certainly a very close one, which persisted until Clara’s death in 1896. She never remarried after Robert died in 1856, and nor did Brahms ever marry.The premiere of the First Piano Concerto in 1859, in which Brahms himself was the soloist, had been a failure, but through the 1860s he became increasingly successful, with works such as the Handel Variations for piano, String Sextet No 1, the Piano Quintet and the Horn Trio, and A German Requiem, as well as the music for domestic, drawing-room performance – songs and part-songs, and the popular Liebeslieder-Walzer.In 1860 Brahms had made an ill-judged intervention in a public debate on the future of German music, joining forces with Joachim and others to attack the New German School of composers, who regarded Liszt and Wagner (the latter by then the dominant figure in the arts in the German-speaking world) as their standard bearers. Brahms and his allies were dismissed as hopelessly reactionary and he never made public pronouncements again. After he settled in Vienna in 1863, though, his circle of friends included figures on both sides of this musical ide.Though Vienna, which became the capital of the newly formed Austro-Hungarian empire in 1867, was an increasingly prosperous city, it was culturally a relatively uneventful place at that time. The heady days of romanticism were past, while the next great artistic upheaval in the city was yet to come. Sigmund Freud’s Interpretation of Dreams, which would be so influential on its composers, writers and painters in the early years of modernism, was written just after Brahms died. The Viennese waltz, though, was in its heyday, and among Brahms’s close friends in the 1880s and 90s was Johann Strauss II. In 1889, when Brahms was visited by one of Thomas Edison’s representatives to make a phonograph recording, one of the pieces he played was a polka by Josef Strauss, brother of Johann, and one of his last public appearances, in 1897, was to attend the premiere of one of Johann’s operettas.The First Symphony, which Brahms began working on in 1854, was finally premiered in 1876. It was a great success and over the next decade Brahms produced a flood of major works that included some of his most enduring masterpieces, works that epitomised his genius for finding new expressive paths through familiar musical forms. Apart from the Violin Concerto and the Second Piano Concerto there were three more symphonies, each strikingly different. Where the First Symphony sometimes struggles to escape from the past (Wagner even nicknamed it “Beethoven’s 10th”), the remaining three occupy worlds of their own – radiant, relaxed, almost bucolic, in the case of the Second tauter, more anguished but finally quietly optimistic in the F major Third and unmistakably tragic in the Fourth, with its tightly constructed finale in the form of a passacaglia (a series of variations over a repeated bass line) that resists any temptation to manufacture an optimistic major-key ending.Brahms’s musical innovations may have been less obvious and less revolutionary than those of his contemporary Wagner, and he has not been universally admired – Britten reputedly used to play through his music each year to remind himself how bad it was. But Brahms’s influence persisted well into the 20th century in the music of composers ranging from Elgar, who admired his ability to package potently expressive themes in rigorously constructed musical forms, to Schoenberg, who in the 1930s wrote an essay entitled “Brahms the Progressive” in which he maintained that Brahms’s use of classical forms as the foundation for his innovations in melody and harmony had formed the basis of his own radicalism.Brahms’s final orchestral work was the Double Concerto of 1887, a peace offering to Joachim – they had fallen out when Brahms sided with Joachim’s wife over the couple’s orce. After the successful premiere of his Second String Quintet in 1890, he announced his retirement, but the playing of the clarinettist Richard Mühlfeld persuaded him to change his mind: the Trio for clarinet, cello and piano and two Clarinet Sonatas, and the Clarinet Quintet were all composed for Mühlfeld. Those quietly understated pieces, together with the four late collections of piano miniatures Opp 116 to 119, and the Four Serious Songs, composed after Clara Schumann’s death, seem far removed from the highly wrought dramas of the symphonies and concertos on which Brahms’s enduring reputation rests, but they inhabit a very distinctive musical world of their own.Almost all the great conductors of the last 100 years, from Wilhelm Furtwängler (Warner Classics) and Arturo Toscanini (RCA) to Claudio Abbado (Deutsche Grammophon) and Riccardo Chailly (Decca), have put their stamp on the Brahms symphonies. If you want to hear the works in less sumptuously upholstered versions, closer to the sound that Brahms himself might have expected, there are John Eliot Gardiner’s recordings (SDG). There’s an embarrassment of riches, too, among recordings of the piano concertos Emil Gilels’s performances from the 1980s (Deutsche Grammophon) and Nelson Freire’s (Decca) from 2005 stand out, while Julius Katchen’s survey of the solo piano music (Decca) and the Amadeus Quartet’s performances of the string quartets, quintets and sextets (Deutsche Grammophon) are wonderful bargain collections."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b51c254579e7a4b2e6deca489b82edb80236a2dc/412_149_2114_1269/master/2114.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4498920be811fc1be4f4fdcb4dcff3db","title":"ja ja ding dong how schlager found its joyful place pop eurovision","story":"Will Ferrell’s new Eurovision movie dances to the bouncing beat of schlager, Germanic folk-pop reclaimed from the spectre of nationalism by embracing kitschAt the beginning of the new Netflix movie Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga, aspiring musicians Lars (Will Ferrell) and Sigrit (Rachel McAdams) are workshopping material that will hopefully be good enough for Söngvakeppnin, the Icelandic talent show for a Eurovision place. But performing at a local bar, their attempts at presenting something new are cut short by patrons who clamour for Ja Ja Ding Dong, which the pair half-heartedly agree to perform. It’s an old hit, and exactly what the title suggests: oompah rhythms, accordion accompaniment, and lyrics halfway between nursery rhyme and sexual innuendo.Ja ja ding dong (Ding dong)My love for you is growing wide and longJa ja ding dong (Ding dong)I swell and burst when I see what we’ve becomeJa ja ding dong (Ding dong)Come, come on, baby, we can get love onJa ja ding dong (Ding dong)When I see you I feel a ding-ding dongJa Ja Ding Dong is a quintessential example of schlager, one of the most maligned genres of European pop music. The eyerolling of Lars and Sigrit to their own song is appropriate for a style that’s deemed parochial, superficial and old-fashioned this very newspaper once dubbed it Germany’s most embarrassing musical genre and online publication the Awl asked in 2017: Is Schlager Music The Most Embarrassing Thing Germany Has Ever Produced? “Listening to schlager gives you some notion of what American pop music might sound like without the African influence – in a word, cheesy,” writes John Seabrook in The Song Machine: Inside the Hit Factory.But even though it’s become a punchline once again, I love schlager, and unironically so. I love the frequently occurring one-two rhythm – the oompah! – and the cheerful, sweet melodies and lyrics, which, while lacking wit and bite, are unbridled expressions of joy. I dare you to listen to the schlager renditions of Rosamunde, or Anton aus Tyrol praising his own virility, for example, without cracking a smile. I also love the way this bright, shiny thread is woven so closely into the fabric of pop music.The first piece of music that was labelled as schlager is the Johann Strauss waltz An der Schönen Blauen Donau (The Blue Danube) described in the Wiener Fremdenblatt newspaper in 1867 as “ein entschiedener schlager” (a clear hit). It also referred to operetta lieder, such as Johann Strauss’s drinking song Im Feuerstrom der Reben in Die Fledermaus and Das Macht die Berliner Luft Luft Luft in Paul Lincke’s Frau Luna: these ensemble numbers use repetition, rhyme, and an upbeat rhythm to conjure what we would now call an earworm.Schlager was also popular in Weimar Germany, and it actively celebrated the frivolous joys of life, including desire and infatuation, with a generous use of double entendre. The harmony ensemble Comedian Harmonists, in their song Veronika, Der Lenz ist Da (Veronika, spring is here), mention asparagus, a clear phallic symbol, sprouting and growing in their Maskenball im Gänsestall (Masquerade in the goose coop), they address their love interest by saying: “It’s May, come lay an egg with me.”The Third Reich dampened salaciousness and frivolity, but schlager triumphantly returned after the second world war its innate cheer also became a celebration of the German economic miracle. This had another interesting consequence: in the mid-1950s, schlager started borrowing melodies and harmonies from the south of Europe, as a result of more Germans spending their holidays in the Mediterranean. Italian-born singers such as Caterina Valente and Rocco Granata contributed to this crossover.When Germany was inundated by English-language pop and rock, schlager inevitably took a backseat. Elvis Presley, the Beatles, the Rolling Stones and Jimi Hendrix embodied the spirit of the new rebellion bigoted conservatives dismissed it as “negermusik” and fell back on schlager, beginning its unlucky association with parochialism and traditionalism.“It’s considered arch-conservative and bourgeois,” ethnomusicologist Julio Menil told Deutsche Welle, which labelled schlager as Grandma’s Music in 2011. “Schlager evoked consoling images of a beautiful and romantic countryside and painted a distorted, idyllic picture of Germany that excluded any reference to the horrors of the war and the atrocities of the concentration camps,” Menil wrote in German Pop Music: A Companion, taking issue with the “schlager dream”, and its pretence of Germany being a clean slate.But while a treacly, oldtime-y version of schlager still exists (Tausend Träume Immer Noch by Amigos is a great example), starting in the 1960s, schlager began incorporating elements of pop and dance, merging with mainstream disco: a good early example of this is Moskau by the band Dschinghis Khan.This approach, coupled with Italian and Spanish influences, yielded gems such as Arabesque’s Caballero, DJ Ötzi’s schlager-Eurodance hybrid Pronto Giuseppe, and Frau Kapitän by Calimeros, an ode to the Med. While they are by no means high art, their entertainment potential is undeniable, and the cross-pollination with – even appropriation of – southern European pop certainly enriched schlager’s sound. (As an Italian who spent most of her childhood and teenage years in German-speaking environments, I am not offended by this, but delighted.)Its versatility was even clearer in Sweden, whose own brand of schlager is more familiar thanks to their biggest music export, Abba. Their harmonies, countermelodies and synthetic sounds became the standard in pop music in the following decades, all of which are quite indebted to schlager. “Abba took the flowing melodic element in Swedish folk songs and hymns,” writes Seabrook, “and added elements of schlager music.” He says the group keep schlager “at arm’s length, but you can hear it in the wheezy organ sounds in Take a Chance on Me.” The kitschy exoticism of Fernando and Chiquitita, a marked oompah base for I Have a Dream, and outsized sentimentality for The Winner Takes It All – this is all quintessential schlager.Swedish schlager has a distinctive quality, wherein happy-sounding songs have an air of melancholy, and vice versa: this has been widely adopted in mainstream pop music as the hallmark of producer Max Martin. In an interview in the New Yorker from 2014, Tove Lo described Swedish pop as having “clear but simple lyrics, is a lot about the melody, and also having a little bit of melancholy or a darker sense to it, to not make it too sugary or too bubblegum.” Take the Swedish Eurodance hit Dolce Marmellata by Domenicer, whose upbeat tempo is counterbalanced by a somewhat sombre vocal track, or Danish pop group Aqua’s 1997 hit Barbie Girl, a schlager-infused number whose minor key adds an uncanny element to the otherwise upbeat melody, and has made the tune age particularly well.Schlager gets a further boost by our willingness to embrace camp, and over-the-top “so bad they’re good” cultural products. Films such as The Room and Showgirls have gone through a cultural redemption, first by becoming cult-like sensations, then by getting movies made about them, namely the feature film The Disaster Artist and the documentary You Don’t Nomi. Pre-Raphaelite painters were mostly dismissed as kitsch until they were reassessed in the 1960s, and now major museums host retrospectives. Holst’s Planets suite was frowned upon by refined cultural elites, but became a foundational work for movie soundtrack composers (Hans Zimmer and John Williams above all). Celine Dion, once a dismissed as a treacly chanteuse has been embraced as a quirky fashion and music icon.Schlager has a substantial camp component: the juxtaposition of sweeping music and mundane lyrics treads the line between farce and seriousness. Nicole’s Ein Bisschen Frieden is a perfect example, said by Schlager scholar André Port le Roi to have won Eurovision 1982 for a “very typical German mixture of emotionality with a hysterical apocalyptic mood”. Leaning into that camp potential, schlager managed to partially reinvent itself in the 2000s, to the point that, each year, Hamburg hosts the Schlagermove music parade, a gathering of 500,000 (only 50,000 attended when it started in 1997). Conchita Wurst’s Eurovision-winning drag performance of Rise Like a Phoenix is a perfect example of schlager and camp Evighet by Carola (2006) and Take Me To Your Heaven (1999) and Hero (2008) by Charlotte Perrelli show how schlager continues to work well with Europop. By folding schlager into wider pop forms, these artists have made it less conservative and nationalistic, and by casting those nationalistic elements as camp and silly, they detoxify them too.In the last decade, singer Helene Fischer, known as the “queen of schlager” has sold more than 13m records. Her most famous hit Atemlos durch die Nacht combines Schlager’s signature sentimentality with a grittier sound, and, language notwithstanding, it has all the elements to be a global pop anthem in the same vein as Lady Gaga’s Rain on Me, whose own Europop influences are blatant. What schlager is perhaps now losing in kitsch, it is acquiring in wider palatability.“If you really want to know what makes a song powerful, I would say look at how the memory works,” said physiologist Harry Witchel when analysing the structural perfection of Abba’s Waterloo in 2005 for the BBC. “Memory works either through strong emotions or through repetition – that’s how we normally teach. And Abba songs allow for both of those things to occur.”This also applies to all aforementioned schlager hits: their melodies, coupled with their repetitive and alliterative lyrics create a pleasant cycle of repetition and emotions rooted in escapism. The meaninglessness of the lyrics, the ahistorical dream-Europe the songs evoke, and the forgiving framework of camp mean that schlager can now mean almost anything to anyone. Just as Strauss’s Die Fledermaus transports the viewer into an amusing comedy of errors, or the Blue Danube to that very river, so schlager hits give us the illusion of an idyllic reality, where all that matters is love, sun and vacation – somewhere you can finally feel a ding-ding dong, whatever you want that to be."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2e3bcf27c738c1a9f5621920d46cadf518962d1/0_154_2848_1708/master/2848.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=323b6530364202f602910467e8ef79e7","title":"taking on sir humphrey can the civil service be reformed podcast","story":"Michael Gove has set out his plans for a revolution of Britain’s permanent bureaucracy, the civil service.

From then on, it was this institution, comprising hundreds of thousands of apolitical government employees, that would be tasked with turning the new ideas into reality.  Powell tells Anushka Asthana that it was not easy: many officials are reluctant to run with new ideas, or tend to look for problems rather than solutions. It’s an issue that the current Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, has also identified. In a recent speech, he promised to shake things up: move more civil servants out of London, make them take more risks, and become more specialist and numerate. For Jonathan Powell, the acid test will be whether Gove can deliver on these words, which have echoes back to the 1960s and Harold Wilson’s government’s promises."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97404a0cfbc6243ce7803207395d2aa46016df60/0_0_6000_4000/master/6000.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=7e9a56c7a17a3a6d72ec02552683e212 1440w","title":"dominic cummings to continue to take active role in government","story":"No 10 adviser had been expected to take less prominent role after lockdown scandalLast month, rumours across Whitehall had it that Dominic Cummings might take a less prominent role in No 10 following the humiliation of having to confess that he had travelled to Durham during lockdown. Instead, he appears to be front and centre again.He and the cabinet minister Michael Gove have overseen the departure of Sir Mark Sedwill, the government’s most senior civil servant folded the Department for International Development into the Foreign Office made plans to cut the government communications team of 4,500 people across more than 20 departments and introduced a White House-style plan for televised briefings.There is more to come, say insiders. Following Wednesday’s announcement that Cummings has been granted permission to visit five of the UK’s top secret security sites ahead of the looming integrated review, he will have a role cutting waste in the ministry of defence.Dave Penman, the general secretary of the FDA union which represents the UK’s most senior civil servants, said: “Dominic Cummings may or may not have the answers to the government’s and the country’s woes, but what appears increasingly clear is that the centralisation of power and policy is the means by which the prime minister intends to execute it.”Cummings’ re-emergence has brought a sense of relief to some close to Downing Street. One source said: “It’s a bit like swimming with a shark – when you can see his fin, at least you know where he is.”Cummings has written extensively about the need to stop wasteful spending in the Ministry of Defence, a department regularly criticised by the National Audit Office for failing to deliver multi-billion-pound schemes on time or within budget.Articles on his blog have argued in favour of using artificial intelligence and drone technology as opposed to traditional defence equipment.So Whitehall officials may be concerned to see that he appears to be spearheading Johnson’s review of armed forces spending.Any attempt to cut the budget or the personnel will face opposition from the military’s top brass and their supporters on the Conservative backbenches.Buried in the detail of Rishi Sunak’s summer statement on Wednesday was £100m of taxpayer backing for a leading-edge green technology known as “direct air capture”.It involves removing carbon dioxide from the air and compressing it into a form that can then be buried or stored. Cummings is enthusiastic about the technology, colleagues say– as is another government adviser, Tim Leunig– hoping the UK could become a world leader in it.It’s just one example of the government’s willingness to take bets on R\u0026ampD with public money and one definition of what Johnson meant when he repeatedly promised to “unleash Britain’s potential” during the election campaign.Cummings is pushing through the creation of a UK version of Darpa, the US Defense Advanced Projects Research Agency, set up under Eisenhower in the 1950s, which backs new technologies and helped support the creation of technologies including the internet and GPS. The budget in March earmarked £800m to create the organisation, described as a “blue skies” science research agency. Sajid Javid resigned during the February reshuffle, when he was told that his special advisers – including those dealing with the media – would be combined with No 10’s. Afterwards he joked that he wouldn’t comment on “Cummings and goings” – acknowledging the role of Johnson’s right-hand man in his departure.Last week it became clear that the change was just the beginning of a dramatic reorganisation of government communications, which will put Downing Street in the driving seat.While Cummings remains the lightning rod for criticism, the shakeup is as much the brainchild of Johnson’s director of communications, Lee Cain.Scores of departmental civil service press officers will see their jobs disappear, and those who remain will be line-managed by the Cabinet Office, instead of their own, home departments. Johnson’s team are scathing about the quality of some Whitehall press offices and want to centralise and standardise the messages emerging from government. Critics say it is a further blow to the independence of cabinet ministers.Recruiting scientists – and weirdosThe government announcement on Wednesday, that it had created a new Office for Talent based in No 10 as a way to help leading scientists, researchers and others live and work in the UK, will come as little surprise to those who have observed Cummings closely. His obsession with bringing in scientists and outside talent into the orbit of No 10 has been a striking feature of Johnson’s seven-month tenure.In January, Cummings wrote a rambling blog calling for “weirdos and misfits with odd skills” to apply for new jobs in No 10. He wanted data scientists, economists, policy experts, project managers, communication experts and junior researchers, one of whom would become his personal assistant. Special advisers, whose contracts have been changed to give No 10 more power over their jobs, have been ordered by Cummings to read books promoting superforecasting as part of a training regime he arranged for the summer.At a recent briefing, they were told to read the 350-page book Superforecasting: The Art and Science of Prediction by Philip Tetlock and High Output Management by Andrew Grove, which claims that “only the paranoid survive”.Cummings’ obsession with superforecasting, which examines how historical patterns can be used to make accurate predictions, was blamed for his recruitment of Andrew Sabisky, who calls himself a “superforecaster”. He was recruited to No 10 earlier this year but quickly stood down after it was disclosed that he had previously praised eugenics and argued that intelligence was inherited."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6db992945442189d6989f3da28c140887cddb77/0_26_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026s=1a569c1ed6a48779f4ac724bc1a00dbf","title":"may worst month for covid 19 impact on uk jobs market show ons figures","story":"Labour demand and supply hit by lockdown, particularly in retail and hospitalityThe negative impact of the coronavirus lockdown on Britain’s jobs market appears to have been greatest in May before a partial recovery in June, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).Both demand for and supply of labour were affected by lockdown restrictions, and the temporary closure of non-essential businesses caused demand for labour to fall, leading to fewer job vacancies, the ONS found, by studying job advert data from the online job search engine Adzuna.The ONS said: “Experimental online job adverts data imply that the worst impact of the pandemic on labour demand was experienced in May and some sectors increased hiring in June 2020.”Retail and wholesale and catering and hospitality were among the sectors that saw the greatest falls in online job adverts. The number of vacancies in the wholesale and retail sector reached its lowest level on record, totalling just 67,000 in the three months from March to May.Hiring was particularly disrupted in industries that rely on close interaction between people, and where businesses could not take advantage of technology in order to continue trading during lockdown, such as accommodation and food service.Other industries badly affected by the coronavirus restrictions, according to the data, included entertainment and recreation and construction, which suffered large falls in job vacancies.The UK began to ease some coronavirus restrictions in May, when garden centres in England were allowed to reopen, and several nationwide restaurant chains gradually began to offer takeaway or drive-through services to customers, while many more retailers reopened their doors in June and sectors including hospitality began trading again from early July.The easing of restrictions “contributed to increasing hiring activities in some categories”, which the ONS interpreted as “early signs of optimism” that companies were beginning to look for new staff. Vacancies in wholesale and retail, catering and hospitality and education began to pick up slightly in June.The Recruitment and Employment Confederation’s latest job recovery tracker found that demand grew for bar and serving staff in the final week of June as pubs and restaurants in England prepared to reopen.However, by late June, the overall index of vacancies still remained at lower level than before the pandemic.Some industries, such as the health sector, continued to hire staff during the pandemic, and the ONS found that the low decrease in vacancies in the human health and social work sector was partly associated with treatment of Covid-19 patients.

Rainford-Brent spoke about “the constant drip drip” of racism she had put up with during her career in cricket, all the loaded remarks about her hair, her body and her food, “day in, day out”, the way a coach always referred to “your lot” in conversations with her.Rainford-Brent, the first black woman to play for England, is known as one of the warmest people on the cricket circuit. She broke down as she explained how her jovial personality had been shaped by her reluctance to push back against those prejudices.The film included footage of the former MCC president, and current ECB ambassador, Mike Gatting being heckled by anti-racism campaigners for taking “blood money” on the rebel tour to apartheid South Africa. And if the point wasn’t clear enough, Rainford-Brent pressed it by pointing out the structural racism in the England and Wales Cricket Board, and at all levels of the game in England. She bluntly pointed out there are no black members of the ECB Board, no black directors of cricket, no black chief executives, and no black captains among the 18 counties and that black participation in grassroots cricket is tiny.Holding continued, live on air, with an extraordinary monologue that took in everything from the recent video of Amy Cooper threatening to call the police on a black man who asked her to put her dog on a lead, to the historic representation of Christ as a white man, to the erasure of Lewis Howard Latimer, (the black man who perfected the lightbulb), at the expense of Thomas Edison. Holding spoke about research done at Yale that revealed the extent of unconscious bias among pre-school teachers and he spoke about research done by the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology that showed how white policemen invariably overestimate the age of black children.It was eloquent, intelligent, and confrontational broadcasting, fiercely uncompromising stuff for an audience who were tuning in because they wanted the comfort and relief of live cricket, of cakes and sunshine and sixes.And it was capped by Nasser Hussain. “People will be tuning in and saying not this again”, Hussain said. “All I’ll say to those people who say ‘not again’ is that a few weeks ago I watched a black man being killed in front of my eyes on Channel 4 news, and my natural reaction was to look away. Next time that footage came on, I forced myself to watch because I felt something inside of myself say ‘you’ve been looking away too long.’”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/caaa0e9a63a39fd91e562e674da10c4ce5c1dee2/6_294_2924_1754/master/2924.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5a8613b130f48349c65dc4d7b15a84f4","title":"british dance schools","story":"Conservatoires adapted quickly to our new normal. What sort of industry will students graduate into – and how far have we come since UK-trained dancers were said to be ‘outclassed’?‘One of the students created a lighting installation in a dishwasher,” says Lise Uytterhoeven, the director of dance studies at London Contemporary Dance School (LCDS). “From restriction you can get great creativity,” she says, laughing. Lockdown has stretched Uytterhoeven’s students’ imaginations, but of all the subjects you might try to teach online, dance must be one of the hardest: you need the bodies in the room, space to move and hands-on interaction. “We’re an absolutely in-your-face kind of art form,” says Janet Smith, who retired as principal of the Northern School of Contemporary Dance (NSCD) in Leeds in May, while the school was empty. “We all want to be in the room together, with close physical contact.”The leaders of the UK’s contemporary dance conservatoires swiftly adapted to the new normal, moving to online classes, auditions and now graduations – final-year performances from LCDS, NSCD and Trinity Laban in London can be seen online this month. Now they are planning for reopening in September, with a mix of online and studio teaching in socially distanced groups, plus experiments with outdoor classes.There are questions overhead. One is about the kind of industry into which these dancers will be graduating and how much damage will be caused by the ramifications of coronavirus. Another concerns whether the lack of studio time will disadvantage a cohort of students going into a short, intense career where time is precious as it is.It is five years since the leading choreographers Akram Khan, Hofesh Shechter and Lloyd Newson wrote an open letter stating that, in the highly competitive, international business of dance, UK-trained dancers were at a disadvantage, falling below the calibre of those from overseas. They lacked “rigour, technique and discipline”, said Khan they were “outclassed by fitter, stronger and more versatile counterparts”, said Shechter.At the time there was a robust response from training institutions – and almost a sense of betrayal. “It was upsetting, because we’re a small, interconnected community,” says Smith.Has anything changed in the intervening five years? The question hinges on what we think we are training dancers for. In terms of the pursuit of technical excellence, the Juilliard School in New York is the “gold standard”, according to Amanda Britton, the principal of the Rambert School. But she points out that Juilliard takes 24 dancers from thousands of auditionees. “It would be very easy to train 24 dancers for the elite end of the profession,” she says.UK schools have bigger classes, a much wider remit and a deliberately different mindset to some of their global counterparts. They offer accredited degrees and transferable skills to support the realistic picture that almost all dance graduates will have a portfolio career, in performing, teaching, choreography, community dance, administration and any number of other jobs. Uytterhoeven says that even before Covid-19, as a result of austerity and arts funding cuts, there were fewer stable jobs within dance companies. “We have a duty to prepare graduates to work in a wide range of roles. It would be irresponsible not to.”All leaders of dance schools talk about inclusivity and want their students to represent a erse range of dancers, backgrounds and styles. They recruit by potential, not achievement, noting that not everyone has access to high-quality training from a young age. “You risk losing such a range of artistic voices if you’re only starting with middle-class children who have done ballet since they were zero years old,” says Smith.There are good reasons for not pushing all dancers into the same mould. Contemporary dance, by its nature, is always changing and responding to the world around it. It needs creators and thinkers, not just malleable bodies. “When I lived in America, they concentrated on physicality,” says Benoit Swan Pouffer, the director of Rambert dance company. “But you encounter dancers who have only the physical and it’s not enough. What differentiates one dancer from another is who they are and what story they have to tell. I’ve found British dancers have a lot of personality and a sense of self.”In 2015, Khan’s producer, Farooq Chaudhry, spoke of British students being “mollycoddled”, but the teachers I speak to consider “kindness” part of their philosophy. The old-fashioned ballet cliche of teachers scaring their students into line has been consigned to the past. “We have to remember that there was a huge amount of students who left dance degrees never wanting to dance again,” says Darren Carr, the director of studies at NSCD. Smith adds: “Damaged, in fact.” “We’ve changed that culture,” says Carr.Sara Matthews, the director of dance at Trinity Laban, says: “I deliver workshops around the world and I’ve seen different training methods. I’ve seen how the ‘whip approach’ actually creates a very passive learner and very underconfident young people.” Yet, quietly, some schools admit they have been working to boost the fitness of their students, an area seen as lacking – only these days the basis is dance science, using data and periodisation in training and building on the latest findings from elite sports.All the school heads talk of evaluating and overhauling elements of the curriculum during their tenure. Has it made a difference? Akram Khan says that, from his efforts to engage with young dancers in recent years, “what is clear is that the thirst and drive is there, accompanied with potential and erse physical facilities”. What he wants to impart are values – in his case, those of “curiosity, rigour, immersion and surrender”.The dancer and choreographer Sam Coren says “dance is too insular in the way it trains”. “We spend so much of our time and attention on moving in a way which is physically not that relevant any more,” says Coren, who uses ideas from acting and clowning in his teaching. “Dance education doesn’t really prepare you for being on stage every night in front of an audience.” Something must be working, because Shechter says he has started to notice a difference: “It’s something I can see in the auditions there’s improvement all the time.” For Shechter, the problem is less with higher education and more with what comes before. “We don’t have early-age contemporary dance education in the UK, like they do in other countries. That’s the main reason it’s difficult to develop professional dancers in time,” he says. Dancing a couple of times a week after school and then training full-time at 18 will not prepare most students for the intense demands of professional dance, he says. (Rambert School takes students full-time at 16, while 12 Centres for Advanced Training offer more specialist training to limited numbers from the age of 10.) Shechter has worked with Amanda Britton on Rambert Grades, a contemporary dance syllabus that can be taught from the age of seven, which Britton hopes will help fill the gap left by the decline of GCSE dance.Why does all this matter? Surely audiences just want to see great dance it is unimportant where those dancers are trained. “It’s like arguments with my daughters about practising for their piano lessons,” says Shechter. “We can do it or not, I really don’t care, but if we do it, we do it really well. The point is: we’re doing it anyway we should try to find a way to do it better.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad1c5057178da31a96b72c8675f71e44fbeb7d8c/0_368_2729_1637/master/2729.jpg?width=1200\u0026amp;height=630\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026amp;overlay-width=100p\u0026amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026amp;s=db4b16f4b15783957105cd615b26f00a","title":"boogaloo boys movement who are they what do they believe","story":"Five deaths have been linked to ‘boogaloo’ rhetoric, but there’s still confusion over how to label the developing ideologyMen showing up to protests wearing Hawaiian shirts and carrying military-style rifles. Facebook groups full of intense discussions about imminent civil war.Over the past year, online conversations about the “boogaloo,” an ironic term for a second civil war, have begun to coalesce into the beginnings of an actual movement, according to experts who monitor American extremists. Facebook has designated a network of “boogaloo” groups as a dangerous organization similar to the Islamic State, and banned them from both Facebook and Instagram. At least 15 arrests and five deaths have been publicly linked to “boogaloo” rhetoric, including the murders of two law enforcement officers in California.But there’s still plenty of confusion over how to accurately label this still-developing ideology. Here’s a guide to what we know, and what we don’t, about the politics of the “boogaloo.”In response to a news story about the potential threat “boogaloo” attacks posed to people in Washington DC, Trump’s Department of Homeland Security sent a tweet denying that the “boogaloo” is “a leftwing OR rightwing” movement, and claiming “They are simply violent extremists from both ends of the ideological spectrum.”One CNN article on “boogaloo” supporters at protests included an interview with a man who claimed to be a “left anarchist”.But extremism experts agree that “boogaloo” ideology overall is, in fact, rightwing.How do they know? For one, they look at images of the “boogaloo” flag, which is sometimes emblazoned with the names of rightwing anti-government martyrs, including Americans killed in infamous standoffs with the police at Ruby Ridge in 1992 and during the occupation of the Malheur national wildlife refuge in 2016.“The way we know the ‘boogaloo’ movement is a far-right movement is because they draw a line directly from Waco and Ruby Ridge,” said Alex Newhouse, a digital researcher at the Center on Terrorism, Extremism and Counterterrorism at Middlebury Institute for International Studies.“They hold up things like the McVeigh bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building and the armed response to Ruby Ridge as heroic moments in American history,” where citizens stood up to government oppression, Newhouse said.Like the rightwing anti-government militia and Patriot movements of the 1990s and 2000s, many “boogaloo” supporters see the current federal government as illegitimate, while remaining deeply patriotic. They revere the constitution and see themselves as the true descendants of America’s founding fathers. In their view, current US lawmakers are the equivalent of occupying British forces during the revolutionary war. Among the “boogaloo” merchandise for sale online are images of George Washington armed with a modern, AR-15-style rifle.Another clear sign that “boogaloo” boys are rightwing is their decision to show up with guns to guard private businesses, first during demonstrations against public health shutdown restrictions, and later during the protests over George Floyd’s killing, Newhouse said.While “boogaloo” supporters showed up to George Floyd protests saying they wanted to stand in solidarity with Black Lives Matter protesters against police violence, some also described going to protests to “defend businesses – including big national corporations – against looters and destruction”.Showing up with guns to protect big corporations from property damage is not something that most leftwing protesters would do, Newhouse said, since leftists would be more like to view corporate stores like Hobby Lobby or Ross as “part and parcel of capitalist exploitation”.This emphasis on the importance of private property is part of what makes the “boogaloo” “very much an extreme right libertarian ideology”, Newhouse said.Support for unfettered gun rights, and fierce opposition to most or all gun control, is also central to “boogaloo” supporters, with some pro-gun advocates using the term “boogaloo” to refer specifically to the civil war that will break out if Democratic politicians ever try to confiscate Americans’ guns.While some anarchists have embraced “boogaloo” rhetoric, these are primarily are “rightwing anarchists”, who believe in “unfettered capitalism”, not leftwing anarchists, said Mark Pitcavage, a researcher at the Anti-Defamation League’s Center on Extremism.The Department of Homeland Security’s claim that “boogaloo is not a rightwing movement is “playing politics”, said Daryl Johnson, a former DHS analyst who was forced out of the department after Republican backlash against a prescient briefing about the growing dangers of rightwing domestic terrorism.“This is an ultra-nationalist primarily white movement of people who belong to the militias,” he said. “Could there be somebody that has different sympathies that’s part of it? Sure. It’s predominantly rightwing.”There’s no question that some “boogaloo” supporters are explicit white nationalists and neo-Nazis who use the term “boogaloo” as a synonym for a coming race war.But there’s real disagreement, even among experts who monitor extremist groups, about whether the “boogaloo” movement as a whole should be described as “white supremacist.”Analysts from the Anti-Defamation League and Middlebury’s Center on Terrorism, Extremism and Counterterrorism have argued that a significant number of “boogaloo” supporters are genuinely not white supremacist, and that the movement in fact has two wings, one advocating for race war and one obsessed with societal breakdown and rebellion against the government.Arguments over white supremacy have played out on public “boogaloo” Facebook groups for months, the analysts said, with some “boogaloo” supporters, particularly group administrators, denouncing white supremacists and saying they want to stand in solidarity with Black Lives Matter, even as other members of the groups made racist and antisemitic comments and mocked moderators for trying to be politically correct.Tensions within the movement over supporting Black Lives Matter and pushing out overt white supremacists have been playing out for months, according to the first in-depth profile of the movement from journalists at Bellingcat. Some “boogaloo” memes and versions of the movement’s flag name black victims of police violence, including Oscar Grant and Breonna Taylor, among the movement’s martyrs. At the same time, some of the recent pro-Black Lives Matter statements on Boogaloo pages may have been motivated by group administrators’ desire to avoid a crackdown from Facebook moderators, Newhouse said.Other experts say that lip service from some “boogaloo” supporters about wanting to be a multi-racial movement should not be taken seriously.“We’re equivocating for the sake of an imagined audience,” said Joan Donovan, the director of the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard Kennedy School.“The idea that you would dismantle the US government at this stage is to undo the protections that have been granted to black, people, queer people, disabled people, to stop foreign policy related to immigration,” Donovan said. “There are always racialized and eugenic sub-themes in these groups. That’s what war is, at its base. It’s about who should live.”“I don’t think you can get away from the ways in which the rhetoric supports a white supremacist ideology, once you start talking about the kinds of policies or strategies they think need to be implemented.”One way to capture the complex dynamics of “boogaloo” ideology is to label it as a broad anti-government movement that is full of white power activists, said Kathleen Belew, a historian of the American white power movement of the 70s, 80s and 90s.Because there are many Americans who believe in white supremacist ideas, but have never make an explicit effort to advocate for the cause, it’s more accurate to label people involved in racist movements as “white power activists,” rather than as “white supremacists,” Belew argues.Like the militia movement of the 1990s, not everyone who participates in “boogaloo” events or groups is necessarily a white power activist, Belew said. But it’s important to understand that many explicit supporters of race war are operating under the cover of a slightly more mainstream anti-government movement, she said, and that this is a deliberate strategy.“Not all the people in the militia movement would be categorized as white power activists, but most of the white power movement was located inside the militia movement,” she said. Money, guns and people routinely moved between more mainstream and more underground, explicitly violent groups, she said, and that same pattern is likely repeating today.For the Americans who are encountering armed men with Hawaiian shirts at protests in their hometowns, nuanced distinctions may not be that helpful.On the ground, experts said, there’s really no way to figure out in real time if an unknown man in a Hawaiian shirt is a neo-Nazi looking to start a race war, or an anti-police libertarian who sincerely believes that he is not a racist. Asking “boogaloo” boys about their beliefs directly is unlikely to clarify much, since neo-Nazis and white nationalists routinely lie and claim not to be racist.“No matter what your beliefs are, if you show up at a Black Lives Matter protest as a white man armed with a bunch of guns, that’s a white supremacist act, even if you don’t mean it to be,” said Emily Gorcenski, the creator of First Vigil, a project that tracks far-right iniduals and groups. “Fundamentally, it will instill fear.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd6492372f132774216a49ca9bcc838e9a6df1ac/0_192_5906_3547/master/5906.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bcb00bdd7e25701318d55b92966f3869","title":"church of england bishops criticised over cummings tweets","story":"Members of the general synod to examine whether senior clergy broke rules on use of social mediaChurch of England bishops who publicly criticised Dominic Cummings over his breach of lockdown rules have come under fire from members of the C of E’s governing body over their use of social media during the controversy.Only two of the nine questions named the No 10 adviser, though others appear to have indirectly referred to criticism of Cummings’ trip to Durham in April.The questions ask whether it is appropriate for senior C of E clergy to comment on such matters whether social media posts are monitored for compliance with guidelines whether bishops’ comments on social media are the views of the church or the inidual if additional training is needed and whether bishops are “creating a perception that they are simply using their office to promote their own political views”.In the aftermath of the ’s revelations that Cummings had travelled with his family to his parents’ home in Durham and had taken a day trip to Barnard Castle, more than a dozen bishops criticised the adviser and Boris Johnson.Nick Baines, the bishop of Leeds, tweeted: “The question now is: do we accept being lied to, patronised and treated by a PM as mugs? The moral question is not for Cummings – it is for PM and ministersMPs who find this behaviour acceptable.”The bishop of Ripon, Helen-Ann Hartley, said: “Integrity, trust and leadership were never there just a driven misguided ideology of power that has total disregard for the most weak and vulnerable, and those who work to protect and care for us with relatively low pay.”John Inge, the bishop of Worcester, said: “The PM’s risible defence of Cummings is an insult to all those who have made such sacrifices to ensure the safety of others.”Responding to the written questions on behalf of the House of Bishops, David Walker, the bishop of Manchester, repeatedly refers to the C of E’s digital charter and social media guidelines, which call for constructive engagement and “fair and factual posts”.Walker was among the bishops strongly criticising Cummings on social media. He tweeted: “Unless very soon we see clear repentance, including the sacking of Cummings, I no longer know how we can trust what ministers say sufficiently for @churchofengland to work together with them on the pandemic.”Several bishops received death threats over their comments in the following days.Synod questions have also been tabled on whether the decision by the archbishops of Canterbury and York to close churches even to clergy at the start of lockdown was warranted. Many clergy were dismayed at the advice.One synod member asked whether Christmas carol services were expected to take place in churches later this year. In response, Sarah Mullally, the bishop of London, said: “Advent and Christmas are inevitably going to look very different … Churches which have traditionally welcomed large numbers to a carol service may find that they need to offer several.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5421e241149520c16aeef8ff4fbbf0525686d3ab/0_31_5280_3169/master/5280.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a23c0cf697001bd348781fadf5cd3803","title":"tati much loved french retailing institution shuts up shop in paris after 70 years","story":"Cut-price clothing chain falls victim to changing shopping habits and the Covid-19 lockdownby  Jon Henley in ParisFounded by a Tunisian immigrant at the end of the second world war in the mainly west African Barbès district at the foot of Montmartre, Tati grew into more than 100 outlets around France, and its pink-and-white chequered carrier bags became a style statement for film stars and celebrities.The company has been in difficulty for decades, having struggled to adapt its “pile ‘em high, sell ‘em cheap” strategy of the early postwar years to a more fashion-conscious clientele seduced by big fast-moving multinationals such as H\u0026ampM or Primark.The flagship Barbès store – the brand’s only outlet until 1978 – “never really saw its clients return” after the double blow of public transport strikes that brought Paris to a halt in December and January, followed by three months of Covid-19 lockdown, said the company’s managing director, Thierry Boukhari.Sales from October 2019 to May this year were two-thirds down on the same period 12 months earlier, he said, “and we find ourselves unfortunately obliged to close our historic shop and to find alternative employment for its 34 staff”.At the Barbès store on Wednesday, shoppers were nostalgic and upset. “Tati has always been a bit like the aunt who looks after you,” said Aminata Mbaye, 62, originally from Senegal. “Such a big choice. You could always find something you could afford, no matter how little money you had.”Fatoumata Diassouba, 71, from Ivory Coast, said the store had “always been the place you thought of first” for cheap clothes or fabrics. “It was always Tati, nowhere else. But it’s true, it’s not the same. I came this morning for T-shirts for the grandchildren. There’s not much.”For a multitude of Parisians of a certain generation, however, Tati – which started life as the first deep-discount, self-service fabrics shop in France – will always be the home of the £50 wedding dress, the £1 T-shirt (guaranteed to shrink in the first wash), and the 50p pair of pants.Once, customers would hide its carrier bags in shame, but over the years some of France’s most glamorous women have been more than happy to be seen sporting them in public, including the film star Brigitte Bardot, the novelist Françoise Sagan and even the wealthy socialite Nadine de Rothschild.The store was founded in 1948 by the late Jules Ouaki after he was demobbed from the Free French army. He wanted to name it after his grandmother, Tita, but since that was already registered as a brand name he had to settle for Tati. He had the simplest possible slogan: “Tati, les plus bas prix” (Tati, the lowest prices).By piling his goods up where everyone could see and touch them, clearly displaying their prices, and keeping things cheap by paying suppliers cash, he built the business into a huge success.In the 1990s Tati, by now run by Jules’ son Fabien, expanded abroad and attempted a move upmarket “from cheap to chic”, opening a branch on New York’s Fifth Avenue. It even made a short-lived foray into the world of fashion in 1991 with a critically acclaimed collection by Azzedine Alaia, modelled by Naomi Campbell for the fashion photographer Ellen von Unwerth and, on the catwalk, by top models of the day including Helena Christensen, Yasmin Le Bon and Elle Macpherson.Yohann Petiot, of the Trade Alliance of French clothing and shoe retailers, said the store had fallen victim to changing shopping habits and the emergence of more aggressive rivals with the same bulk-purchase, high-volume business model.“But it has also been hit by the same crises that are causing problems across the whole retail sector: the gilets jaunes (yellow vests) anti-government protests, the transport strikes, and finally the Covid-19 lockdown, which for some will be the final straw.”Tati left the Ouaki family’s hands in 2004 when its 100-plus loss-making stores were sold to the Eram group. In 2017, in even greater financial trouble, they were bought up by GPG, another retail group, which rebranded some and spun others off to their management.GPG said last year that the original Barbès store would be the only one to keep the Tati name, but has now conceded it is fighting a losing battle. Two small specialist shops, including Tati Mariage, which specialises in cheap wedding outfits, will continue trading for the time being."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e27b52eefa8c280978c7b9610fb257ac46b5d4c/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c0ce32bfdb95b5d1fc97afa4f3946f8e","title":"uk nominates liam fox world trade organization","story":"Government describes former international trade secretary as ‘ideal candidate’ for top job Liam Fox, Britain’s former international trade secretary, will be nominated by the UK to be the next head of the World Trade Organization (WTO), the government’s Department for International Trade has confirmed.Fox was a cabinet minister in Theresa May’s government between July 2016 and July 2019, and has been a Conservative MP since 1992.He is known as a prominent supporter of Brexit, and said in a 2017 interview that the UK’s free trade deal with the EU after leaving should be the “easiest in human history”.The government described Fox as “the ideal candidate” to lead the WTO and listed his attributes including his advocacy for multilateralism, his “decades of experience in global politics, as well as first-hand experience of running a trade ministry” and his belief that global prosperity and security are underpinned by rules-based free trade.However, Fox is expected to face a challenge garnering support for his nomination from other countries, especially from the EU, none of whose members have put forward a candidate.He was criticised during his time as international trade secretary for suggesting the UK would have up to 40 trade deals ready immediately after it leaves the EU. The UK has 20 such deals in place, according to the Department for International Trade’s website.Boris Johnson, the UK prime minister, said Fox “has firsthand experience of the political and technical challenges of negotiating trade agreements, and the reforms that are needed to ensure the global trading system truly delivers for all WTO members”.Fox said he was honoured to be nominated and stated that the task for the organisation was to “update. Strengthen and reform” to remain relevant and vibrant. He added: “We must ensure that global trade works for everyone.”The SNP criticised Fox’s nomination for the WTO top job, accusing Johnson’s government of letting ideology trump competence.Stewart Hosie MP, the party’s shadow international trade secretary, said: “It is deeply concerning that at a time when the UK should be working with international partners, it is instead continuing its march towards isolationism by backing a candidate who doesn’t appear to know how complex trade and negotiations work – with his only credential for the role being that he is an ardent Brexiter.”The WTO is looking for a new director general, after the Brazilian Roberto Azevêdo announced in May that he was quitting a year before the end of his term. He is due to step down at the end of August.The 62-year-old has served as director general since September 2013 and had been due to conclude his second four-year term in August 2021.Azevêdo said it was a personal decision to leave early, and that the timing allowed for his successor to be chosen well before WTO council meetings next year.The 25-year-old WTO is designed to help negotiate multilateral trade deals, while also monitoring trade flows and helping to settle international trade disputes through its resolution body.However, there have not been any major international agreements on trade from the 164-member organisation since the Doha round negotiations were abandoned in 2015.The search for a new director general comes at a crucial time for the organisation, with cooperation between governments under severe strain and protectionism on the rise.Donald Trump’s administration has blocked the appointment of appeals judges to the WTO’s appellate body, the ultimate arbiter of trade disputes. Azevêdo is also understood to be frustrated by the battle over import tariffs between the US and China.The trade war between the world’s two largest economies impacted global activity in 2019, while experts have warned that the downturn in trade caused by the coronavirus could accelerate the unwinding of globalisation.The pandemic has also knocked global trade, pushing international imports and exports to their lowest level in at least four years, according to WTO trade figures released in May.Six countries have nominated a candidate to be the WTO’s director general, and 8 July is the deadline for nominations.Fox’s nomination was first confirmed on Twitter by the political editor of the Spectator magazine.The news will be a disappointment for Peter Mandelson, the former EU trade commissioner and former British business secretary in Gordon Brown’s Labour government, who had expressed interest in the role, according to the Financial Times.Lord Mandelson was reportedly informed by the government that he would not be nominated as he is not a supporter of Brexit."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32d0906c1bcea2c9ab2abb7f15f07ea2c0c3cbea/0_219_3164_1898/master/3164.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6778e50da57654efb3f7134b53f3af07","title":"leicester how have you been affected by the local lockdown","story":"We want to hear from people living in Leicester about how restrictions are affecting themLeicester is the first city to experience a local lockdown with non-essential shops and schools closed from Tuesday.Restrictions are set to be in place for two weeks after infections rose, with Leicester accounting for around one in 10 of all coronavirus cases in the past week.We want to hear from local people, schools and business about their experiences.

While I love all three, they also, respectively, cause me stress, temptation and guilt. I did not go to mass at the weekend because, as with pubs, I thought it might be a bit of a melee. I imagined feisty parishioners clamouring at the door being spoken to severely by sunglassed, earpieced bouncers. No, I left it until Tuesday to allow calm to prevail. My church’s website advised me places were limited to 48. Pre-booking online was advised but the IT for that was still in development, so I decided to take my chances for the 11.30 kick-off.I get my fruit and veg from a stall opposite the church. I always chat to the Brentford fan who works there – an enormous, and enormously nice man. Brentford were playing that evening – a match of great importance to supporters of my team, West Brom, who are rivals for promotion. My man was nowhere to be seen.“He never works matchdays,” his mate said. “Too nervous.”I laughed.“I’m serious,” he said.I told him to pass on a message that I was on my way to church to pray that Brentford lost.There was no queue outside the church. A masked usher led me in, to the free-standing, no-touch hand-rub dispenser. Where once I would splash myself with holy water, I waved my hands in front of the machine, but gel came there none. Someone suggested I tried kneeling, but before I did so a splurge emerged. Rubbing my hands, partly in anticipation, I was led to my pew. It felt great to be back.The sculpture in the corner caught my eye, as it always does. It is of a woman praying. It stops me in my spiritual tracks every time. I thought of her there alone, in prayer, behind the locked door of the church for all those months.The bell rang and Father Michael appeared. I have always had a soft spot for him. Just before I became a Catholic, 13 years ago, I bumped into him one day in the street.“Ah, hello Adrian,” he said. ”And how is your supernatural life this morning?”I burbled something but was stumped for an answer to the question. It is one I’ve asked myself most mornings since, and I remain generally stumped.The mass was great. I enjoyed it much more than the football and, in a different way, just as much as the pub. When the time came for us to go up to receive the blessed sacrament, an usher sprang up at the front to point us in the right direction, rather in the manner of a traffic policeman in an old Italian film. We formed queues on either side of the aisle at the head of each was the station at which the priest would administer the host. These stations were about three metres apart, so the task at hand required some agility from Father Michael. He was equal to the task, darting between the two, sidestepping rather in the manner of a goalkeeper trying to distract a penalty taker. Never was he not in place as, upon a precise signal from the masked Italian traffic cop, we presented ourselves at the required position. The coordination between priest, cop and congregant was something to behold.I hadn’t realised how much I had missed receiving the blessed sacrament. I felt, well, blessed I suppose, to be receiving it now.My anti-Brentford prayers were not answered, by the way. They went and won. Serves me right for being so mean of spirit to my nice fruit and veg man, who will doubtless do me a particularly good deal on my groceries today."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d93b4da8a13703885e05b8bb27126e2ce23c80b9/0_0_5472_3648/master/5472.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=ac441c3d40db957783f2ad70407b1d74 1760w","title":"uk coronavirus live sunak to set out jobs plan and stamp duty holiday","story":"Chancellor delivers summer statement in the Commons on UK economic recovery from pandemicLeaving the furlough scheme open forever gives people false hope that it will always be possible to return to the jobs they had before.The job retention bonus will pay firms £1,000 if they retain furloughed staff, provided they are kept on until January. Arguably this might just delay the point at which people are made redundant. But, to coin a phrase, you could see this as flattening the curve.Here is our main story on the summer statement.Here is a summary of the key points.Here is a column on it from Martin Kettle, in which he argues that Sunak is “now the most important person in the Conservative government, Boris Johnson included”.And here is an extract from Martin’s article.The long-term question for Sunak and his party is what kind of economy they are trying to create during this unprecedented time. His statement gave a hint about the need to return to sustainable public finances, but different sides of the Tory party can read different things into that. There was no strategic vision. The idea that there can be no going back to the old economic normal, on which much has been written, was ignored. There was almost nothing said at all about fiscal rules or about tax and borrowing. There was only a quiet admission that many of the jobs that existed before the pandemic have gone for good ...Where Sunak stands on this is not yet clear. He plays his cards close to his chest. By background and inclination he is a Thatcherite small-state, free-market politician. His style and language are centrist. But he was made chancellor by a prime minister who demanded control of economic policy in order to spend more.That’s all from us for tonight. Thanks for the comments.Samuel Tombs of economics consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics says Rishi Sunak has given employers an incentive to bring more workers back part time, rather than fewer full time:ITV’s Robert Peston thinks the August meal deal might just lead to more people eating out earlier in the week, instead of at the weekend.The UK car industry is unhappy that Rishi Sunak announced no targeted support for their sector today.Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, says other countries are providing more help: Today’s announcements to safeguard jobs and encourage consumer spending in some parts of the economy are welcome – but it’s bitterly disappointing the chancellor has stopped short of supporting the restart of one of the UK’s most important employers and a driver of growth.“The automotive sector has been particularly hard hit, with thousands of job losses already announced and many more at risk. Of Europe’s five biggest economies, Britain now stands alone in failing to provide any dedicated support for its automotive industry, a situation that will only deter future investment.Here is the start of a Twitter thread from Faiza Shaheen, head of the Class (Centre for Labour and Social Studies) thinktank, on the summer statement.And this is her conclusion.Here’s our Money editor, Hilary Osborne, on the temporary cancellation of stamp duty on property sales up to £500,000:The cut will make a difference for anyone buying a property over the old thresholds. For first-time buyers, it will generally be those in the south-east and London who stand to benefit, as elsewhere they would typically not be spending more than £300,000.The saving could allow people to move more quickly than planned – instead of needing the money for tax, they can now channel it towards their deposit.The tax is paid after a sale is completed, so anyone who is part-way through buying a property will benefit.The Institute for Fiscal Studies has released its first full statement on the Rishi Sunak announcement. Here is the overview from its director, Paul Johnson.Prior to today, the total value of new measures announced since March was thought to stand at £130bn. Today the Treasury revised that figure up to nearly £160bn, with £30bn more being spent on public services, especially health. The chancellor also set out new measures worth a further £30bn.More support may well need to be announced in the autumn when we know more about the path of the virus and of the economy, but this was another big package from the chancellor. It was focused on the right things, such as jobs for the young, but its size in part reflects how hard it is to target resources only where they are really needed. Much of the job retention bonus cash will be paid in respect of employees who would have (or indeed have already) returned to work anyway, for example.Here are some other points the IFS is making about the announcement.Sacha Lord, nighttime economy adviser for Greater Manchester, is also concerned that pubs that mainly sell beer are not benefiting from the VAT cut:Lord has welcomed the “Eat out to help out” scheme, but cautions that restaurants and pubs need to maintain social distancing.The Ministry of Justice has announced that cleaners in its central London offices will now receive full pay if they are self-isolating or off sick, our colleague Harriet Grant reports here. The announcement follows  reports in June that the MoJ failed to investigate a potential Covid-19 cluster among its cleaners. Here is some more reaction to the summer statement from three of the smaller parties at Westminster.From the SNP’s Treasury spokeswoman, Alison Thewliss:The chancellor’s statement was a missed opportunity to put building a fairer society at the heart of the recovery – with no measures to boost family incomes or reverse the soaring levels of child poverty and inequality that shame the UK.The coronavirus crisis has exposed and exacerbated the deep inequalities that a decade of Tory austerity cuts have caused. What we needed today from the chancellor was serious action and investment to put money in people’s pockets. Instead, we got a few sticking plasters and an ‘Eat out to help out’ scheme that shows just how out of touch the Tories are. Many people can barely afford to eat at all, let alone dine out with a small discount.From the acting Lib Dem leader, Sir Ed Davey:Totally absent today was any measure to help the millions excluded from Covid support – like new starters, newly self-employed people and freelancers. They haven’t been helped at all so far and yet represent some of the most vulnerable groups. They must not be left behind.Fundamentally, we need a radically new approach to building a radical new green economy for everyone. We must match the scale of the economic and climate crises with the courage to invest £150bn over three years in a green recovery plan for green jobs in all parts of our country.Sadly, ministers have fallen far far short of what is needed for people and for the climate.We know that local lockdowns will become the new normal, but we still have no financial measures to support them. For weeks we have been calling for local furlough-like schemes, but today the chancellor missed the opportunity to address this obvious upcoming issue."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4299232.1594216034!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"cao college applications for high points courses surge","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMore than 77,800 students applied for a college course this yearCollege applications for high-points courses such as law, veterinary medicine, dentistry and physiotherapy are up significantly this year, as students flock towards areas of study with strong job prospects.By contrast, the number of students applying for courses in areas such as arts, humanities and languages are down again this year.Overall, a total of just over 77,800 students have applied for a college course through the CAO this year.More than half adjusted their course choices during May and June, a period when it was announced that Leaving Cert exams were being replaced with calculated grades.Among the biggest year-on-year percentage increases in applications for honours degree courses were for physiotherapy (+25 per cent), dentistry (+17 per cent), veterinary medicine, law (+16 per cent).There were also increases in courses linked to the environment (+8 per cent), architecture (+8 per cent), secondary education (+7 per cent), medicine. pharmacy and engineering (+ 6 per cent).Some of the biggest decreases in applications were for humanities (-9 per cent), arts (-7 per cent), agriculture (-5 per cent), and art and design (-3 per cent).Rising unemployment and uncertainty surrounding the Covid-19 pandemic may be attracting students towards courses with stronger employment prospects this year, according to some careers guidance experts.“Once again, we’re seeing that prospect of a solid job at the end of a course is a key driver, as opposed to exploring an area of education in arts and humanities,” said  career guidance columnist Brian Mooney.The surge in applications for high-points courses may also be a sign that some students feel they have a better chance of securing more CAO points under the new calculated grades process, he said.UCD\u0026nbspsaid its applications broadly matched national trends, with significant increases in physiotherapy, psychology\u0026nbsp(both +25 per cent) and\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspcommerce (+23 per cent).Its biggest reductions were in applications for arts and humanities and international languages.Similarly, Maynooth University said its biggest increases in applications were for \u0026nbspbusiness (+21 per cent), psychology (+20 per cent), law (+9 per cent) and biological and \u0026nbspbiomedical sciences (+5 per cent).\u0026nbsp  Both universities said they have benefitted from an overall increases in applications this year, with UCD stating that it has recorded the highest number of first-preferances, while Maynooth said its applications numbers are the highest on record.There is still no firm date for when Leaving Cert students are set to receive their results and CAO offers, though decision-makers are aiming to release them as close as to the traditional mid-August date as possible.Mature, deferred and access applicants are due to receive “round A” offers on July 18th, while graduate-entry medicine applicants and applicants from further-education courses are due to receive “round 0” offers on August 8th.Latest CAO data shows that the vast majority of applications this year were for honours degree or level-eight courses (71,332), while half of applicants listed an ordinary degree course.More than half of applicants - 44,437 - changed their course preferences during the “change of mind” window between May and July 1st, a 7 per cent increase on the same period last year.\u0026nbspIn percentage terms, the highest increases in applications were for transport services (+89 per cent), though this category is one of the smallest and leads to dramatic swings in percentage.Similarly, the biggest decrease was in “interdisciplinary programmes and qualifications involving arts and humanities” (-23 per cent), though this also involves very small numbers."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Analysis confirms Covid-19 lockdown translated to short-term emissions reductions\u0026lsquoI intend to make substantial progress\u0026rsquo on securing our habitats, says Malcolm Noonan"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: Wild grasses have loved the mood swings of our climate this yearAnother Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needsThe list of causes of damage is long, making it hard to know where to startFew, if any, of Ireland\u0026rsquos mammals have evolved the ability to eat venomous creaturesGolden kelp is notably bare of other sea life, so there are concerns over its possible impact"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

File photograph: Dara Mac DonaillThe Bus Éireann has urged people to undertake only necessary journeys and to avoid, where possible, peak travel times on its Expressway routes. The State-owned transport company said that the implementation of public health guidelines to prevent the spread of Covid-19 meant that capacity on buses and coaches was strictly limited to 50 per cent of the total. It said it regretted that some people were not able to board its Expressway services when they wanted to travel.The company said its commercial Expressway operation had 8,000 seats available daily, compared to 16,000 before Covid-19 restrictions were put in place. In addition 64 per cent of licensed coach and bus services were currently not operational and this “very substantially reduced capacity on intercity routes from pre Covid-19 levels”, it added.Bus Éireann chief commercial officer Eleanor Farrell said on Wednesday: “We very much regret that, despite all of our available coaches and drivers being deployed, at the moment some people are not able to board Expressway services when they wish to travel.“Public health and safety is our absolute priority and there can be no flexibility on overloading coaches. We realise this is disappointing, and also that it can be challenging for our drivers. No one wants to leave people without transport.“Full services can be of particular concern to people wishing to travel from intermediate stops and we anticipate that demand may continue to increase.”She said the company wanted to encourage people to consider whether their journey is absolutely necessary and, especially if they plan on joining a service mid-route, to check the Expressway and Bus Éireann live Twitter feeds which will advise if the coach is full on departure.Ms Farrell said it was also important to try to travel outside of peak demand periods. At the moment, the busiest times are from 11am to 1pm and from 3pm to 7pm. There is more demand at weekends, especially Friday afternoons and Sundays.“We very much appreciate the understanding and cooperation of customers and our staff as we manage demand through these unprecedented times and look forward to keeping people connected around the country.”The company said that due to social distancing requirements, bus stations also had reduced capacity for those waiting for departures.“Bus Éireann asks that passengers do not arrive earlier than 15 minutes before their scheduled departure time, as it may not be possible to enter the station before then.” Since June 29th, wearing a face covering is mandatory on Bus Éireann’s services, and terms and conditions of carriage have been amended accordingly.

Mr Naughten said Portiuncula Hospital in Co Galway was among the medical facilities with this problem.Taoiseach Micheál Martin said the Government would consider Mr Naughten’s proposals. He said that despite the financial challenges the Government is honouring public service pay agreements this year and it also applied to frontline workers including An Garda Síochána.He also paid tribute to the frontline healthcare workers and said they put themselves at risk to help their fellow citizens.It demonstrated the value of a “very good quality public service”.The Taoiseach acknowledged the issue of patients waiting on hospital trolleys would be a major challenge for the health service over the coming months.This was in part due to the need to have enough isolation facilities for patients with coronavirus but they wanted to “resume non-Covid services as best we can”.

Video: Oireachtas TV\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Agriculture  Barry Cowen:  was forced to make his inaugural statement to the Dáil in his new role all about himself. Photograph: PAIn an explosive debut, the new Dáil burst from the Leinster House blocks on Tuesday.The coalition’s first day in full session after Government formation brought with it the first abject apology from a Government Minister. That’s quite the start.And it came after a litany of embarrassing episodes for new Taoiseach Micheál Martin, busily concentrating on getting his administration up and running while his party colleagues busily concentrate on covering themselves in ignominy.Although his new Minister for Agriculture can’t be accused of not getting stuck in immediately. Barry Cowen is barely a wet week in his job and already he’s up to his oxters in manure. BabyBiff, brother of a former taoiseach Brian Cowen, was forced to make his inaugural statement to the Dáil in his new role all about himself.It was a deep, deep apology for a drink-driving offence committed four years ago (and saying nothing to his party leader about it) and getting a fine and a three-month ban. As it was at the lowest end of the scale, there was no requirement to go to court at the time.Full apologySo Cowen came into the chamber at 9pm and devoted his six-minute speaking slot to a full apology for his “grave error” and “lapse of judgment” and “stupid, stupid mistake”. There were no questions taken on his “misdemeanour”.While taking full responsibility for his one and only lapse into “the shame of drink-driving” and apologising all round him, he made no attempt to make excuses his action or minimise the gravity of the offence. But his carefully worded statement also referred to how reports on the original incident have now “extended to reporting various speeding and parking fines I have occurred over the years”.Many TDs would have collected similar penalties he intimated and he was clearly unhappy with these issues being “conflated” with the altogether different matter of drink-driving.“I have conducted a full examination of all records that I could obtain,” he informed the Dáil. After dredging though his motoring past he disclosed “a failure to display a tax disc while parked in Tullamore 14 years ago”.Cowen wants to get on with his job. “Now, formally, on the record of this House I sincerely want to apologise to my peers and my colleagues.”In the meantime, he has been very busy. Almost as busy as his boss who earlier told the House that he hasn’t “wasted an hour” since becoming Taoiseach.Cowen detailed all he has done since getting the new job in agriculture, before the premature onset of the manure. He has had made himself aware of the threat of Brexit, acquainted himself with the parlous state of the timber industry and already had the chats with commissioner Phil Hogan and his counterpart in Northern Ireland, Edwin Poots.You’d be worried letting Barry near a car after those conversations which would drive anyone to drink.A day when an attempt at a groundbreaking form of blended learning has entered its second week in Kildare Street. Early results are chaotic but largely inconclusive.It involves Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael running a government together for the first time, with a large handful of Greens thrown in for leavening purposes. Whatever way the experiment turns out, it’s shaping up to be very entertaining. Sorry, educational.How will they get on? Hard to credit, but Tuesday’s sitting was the first with all the bells and whistles since the general election was called back in February.It was a huge occasion for Martin, who turned up in the chamber almost 10 minutes early for his first round of Leaders’ Questions as Taoiseach. The Fianna Fáil leader had already waited 31 years so an extra few minutes to savour the moment wasn’t going to make much difference.Oh, but Micheál was anxious to get his posterior into that coveted top seat, making a swift beeline towards it as soon as he got through the doors. He swerved to take the shortest route, only to be deftly erted by ushers onto the time-honoured walkway all around the top level of the circular chamber, and from thence down the stairs which end where he sits.Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald, in her elevated capacity as leader of the biggest Opposition party, took up position across the floor in the place recently vacated by the new Taoiseach. She also arrived in good time for the Dáil’s daily set piece. A big day for her party too – a nice change.Social distancingCardboard political place-settings were placed at intervals around the benches, setting out precisely where the TDs had to sit to comply with the extremely strict social distancing rules. There were very real fears that Mary Lou and Pearse Doherty might – through no fault of their own – thoroughly orchestrate a regulation-busting Sinn Féin crowd scene in their section, but they didn’t because this was Dublin and not west Belfast.The names on the place-settings changed since the curtailed sessions of previous weeks, when Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael TDs were given separate numbered spots. Now that the 33rd Dáil is under way, those two parties names have been replaced with the generic “Government” tag.Not a day assembled as a coalition in the old chamber and already the big two have lost their identities.On the other side of the floor, it was a case of high hopes and earplugs with Mary Lou finally earning first dibs on questioning a Taoiseach during Leaders’ questions. This is the most high-profile event of the Dáil day (except when a politician has to come in and make a grovelling apology for a lapse in standards).Then we had Cowen hauling himself in from the doghouse to beg forgiveness.Under normal circumstances, with BabyBiff’s tribulations added to the litany of Government howlers marking the start of Martin’s government, a scorching debut might have been expected from the steely Sinn Féin leader. But it was a subdued start from Mary Lou, who stuck to the issue of extended maternity leave and pay for new mothers who are facing particular difficulties are a result of the Covid-19 crisis.She expressed her concerns during two polite exchanges with the Taoiseach, who was equally concerned and polite.Micheál adopted a markedly different tone throughout his first Leaders’ Question, as if emphasising he was listening to the opposition during his time supporting the Fine Gael government and is going to be far more responsive than Leo Varadkar.Bout of hostilitiesAt the end of the first bout of hostilities between the Fine Gael and Sinn Féin leader, Mary Lou’s response reflected her soft approach to this particular episode.“In that case, we are of one mind,” she told Micheál.That won’t happen too often.

Photograph:   Will OliverEPABut the language on both sides was restrained and Frost’s had none of the belligerence that often characterises his rhetoric towards Brussels. The fact that Barnier chose not to give a press conference was seen by some as another happy augury but it was in fact simply an act of deference towards Angela Merkel and Ursula von der Leyen, who were giving a joint press conference later.Before this week’s talks began, the EU told Britain it was ready to compromise in order to accommodate the red lines Boris Johnson identified in a video conference last month with the presidents of the European institutions.“The EU side had listened carefully to UK prime minister Boris Johnson’s statements in recent weeks, in particular, his request to reach a political agreement quickly, and his red lines: no role for the European Court of Justice in the UK no obligation for the UK to continue to be bound by EU law and an agreement on fisheries that shows Brexit makes a real difference,” Barnier said on Thursday.The Europeans hoped that Britain would respond with a step towards compromise of its own but by the time the talks ended on Thursday, Frost had produced no such offer. During the course of the week, it became clear that unless Britain makes a substantial move within days, there will be no significant progress this month.Judgment callJohnson this week named Frost as his next national security adviser and the chief negotiator’s word carries a rare level of authority in Downing Street. Last October, he successfully urged Johnson to accept the revised withdrawal agreement as the best available deal. He faces a similar judgment call today.The British red lines Barnier spoke about on Thursday are those Johnson identified in last month’s conference call. The two sides are also at odds over the governance structure but Johnson did not mention it on the call and British misgivings about signing up to a single overarching agreement have diminished. Some within the government recognise that it offers opportunities as well as risks.The issue of fisheries is highly charged politically on both sides but neither views a compromise as impossible. Although Britain rejects the concept of binding “level playing field” commitments, it will agree to maintain current employment, environmental and consumer standards.The toughest issue is state aid, with the EU calling for Britain to continue to follow EU rules on a continuing basis. This is problematic for Britain both because it limits the country’s freedom to subsidise indigenous industry and because it would give the ECJ a role in British economic policy.One obstacle in the way of a compromise is the fact that Britain has not yet set out plans for how it wants its own state aid regime to operate after the end of the transition period on December 31st. This leaves the EU unable to evaluate how a system of parallel state aid regimes would work, with both sides agreeing guidelines but regulating separately.While the British accuse the Europeans of being too legalistic, the Europeans complain about British amateurishness. But both sides agree that Johnson wants a deal and that he would like to get it as soon as possible.At the start of the coronavirus pandemic, there was talk around Westminster and Whitehall about how the crisis could reduce – or at least obscure – the impact of failure to agree a deal with the EU. But few now talk about the disruption of a no-deal outcome being lost within the greater disruption caused by coronavirus.Cost of no-dealBank of England governor Andrew Bailey said last week that the British government could have struggled to fund itself if the bank had not intervened with £200 billion of quantitative easing to buy government debt. The cost of a no-deal outcome to the EU talks, on top of the ballooning cost of the coronavirus crisis, would test either Bailey’s patience\u0026nbspor his credibility when he insists the bank is not underwriting the British government’s debt.Donald Trump’s declining political fortunes are also driving Johnson towards an EU deal as he prepares to deal with Joe Biden, a multilateralist whose advisers see Brexit as an expression of right-wing populism. As Suzanne Lynch has reported, Biden and his team are also acutely sensitive to any risk to the peace process and will monitor closely Britain’s implementation of the Northern Ireland protocol.Despite the fall in his approval ratings, Johnson remains in a very strong position with an 80-seat majority in parliament and no prospect of a general election until 2024. He has the immediate political scope to move either way on the negotiations but failure to reach a deal with the EU will make it harder for him to fulfil his government’s domestic agenda and to make a success of Brexit.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

A primary is a traditional election where eligible voters select their candidate privately through a ballot system. A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates. All but one – Sanders – said they were opposed to this. The issue may become a headache for the Democratic Party as the primary process progresses."},{"url":null,"title":"former conservative mpcharlie elphicke claimed saying naughty","story":"Former Conservative MP Charlie Elphicke called himself a “naughty Tory” and told a woman he had sexually assaulted we\u0027re all at it, a court has heard.Mr Elphicke, who represented Dover in Parliament for nearly a decade, tried to kiss the woman then groped her breast and chased her around his home while trying to grab her bottom, Southwark Crown Court was told.The incident happened in 2007, three years before he was elected to parliament, and allegedly took place at his family home in London while his two young children were asleep and his wife Natalie was away.On Wednesday, the brother of the alleged victim said that his sister was hysterical and could hardly get her words out when she phoned him to tell him what had happened. He swiftly drove over to pick her up.Under cross examination, the brother said: “In the van she told me he tried to grope and kiss her.

I had to ask her to calm down.She was clearly distressed, she was saying, \u0027He chased me round the kitchen\u0027.When I recalled it to my husband (later), it just seemed totally bizarre.

Certainly no-one I spoke to yesterday about the crippling effects of being put on the British red list was laughing.Jorge Beldade, Director of Operations at Minor Hotels in the Algarve, responsible for Europe’s first Anantara, told me: “Because of the disproportionately bad publicity this has brought us, due to a few, controlled, clusters far away in Lisbon, we have had an enormous amount of cancellations.” The hotel, whose occupancy is normally around 45 per cent British, is currently seeing three per cent of bookings from that market, and has been forced to postpone its re-opening from July 1 to July 20.At family-friendly Martinhal, with hotels in Cascais and the western Algarve, it is a similar story, although both properties are now open. “Cancellations have increased,” owner Chitra Stern explained, “and new enquiries have decreased. We are looking at an occupancy fluctuating between 10 per cent and 20 per cent right now with a huge drop in our strong British market. But the ones who have decided to come feel comfortable in their private pool villas and the outdoor activities, from surfing to hiking, that Portugal excels in.”Read the full story.Australia\u0027s second-largest city returning to lockdown with a stay-at-home order in effect for the next six weeks following a spike in coronavirus cases. Five million residents were ordered back into lockdown beginning midnight Wednesday into Thursday as soaring community transmission of the coronavirus brings more than 100 new cases daily.The border between Victoria and New South Wales, the country\u0027s two most populous states, was closed on Tuesday for the first time in 100 years as authorities attempt to contain an outbreak of the virus in Melbourne.Read our latest advice on when you can travel to Australia.New York City moved into the third phase of its easing of lockdown measures on Tuesday. Nail and tanning salons, tattoo parlours, spas and massages, dog runs and many other outdoor activities are allowed to resume under the third stage of the four-phase plan to reduce restrictions. The National Gallery reopens today, making it London\u0027s first major art museum to reopen its doors after closing in late March. Visitors will be asked to wear masks and social distancing and advance booking are mandatory. The gallery expects around a quarter of the usual number of visitors - or 3,000 to 4,000 people per day.Opening hours have been reduced from eight to five,  although on Friday they will be extended to 10 hours.We had two primary objectives, said the gallery\u0027s chief operating officer Paul Gray.

The anomalous figures from South America may be due to the pandemic\u0027s effect on already volatile economies, according to Invezz’s David Merry.“The impact that Covid-19 has had on the industry is huge, the numbers speak for themselves,” he said.Many countries such as Russia and China are down as much as half when compared to last year. However, Covid-19 has also further exacerbated existing geopolitical issues within South America, and this may well have caused an interesting spike in bitcoin trading activity.This trend is only further likely to continue, with many Latin American countries such as Venezuela, now adopting cryptocurrency to help alleviate the issues of hyperinflation.Venezuela actually saw a slight drop in bitcoin trading, however its already high volumes means it is now second only to Russia in terms of trading volume.The country\u0027s economy has been in free-fall for several years, made worse by crippling economic sanctions imposed by the UK and US.Bitcoin overtakes gold to become the best performing asset of 2020Venezuela\u0027s inflation rate hit 10 million per cent in 2019, prompting many people to turn to cryptocurrencies as a more stable medium of exchange.Since 1 June, 2020, an estimated 20,000 shops and businesses in the country now accept payments via bitcoin and other cryptocurrency.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The NASUWT teacher’s union has asked the government for more information, including over how classroom teaching will carry on in the event of staff absences and what extra support will be available to help schools establish a safe return. Their general secretary said “a significant number of measures” laid out in the guidance for a full reopening in September “require additional resources” in a letter to the education secretary, which urged the government to address the concerns of teachers and school leaders before all students are welcomed back in two months’ time.  Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“How schools will be able to fund these additional expectations is a key question we are being asked,” Dr Patrick Roach said in the letter to Gavin Williamson. As well as mentioning extra funding, NASUWT said teachers and headteachers have also raised questions around protections for clinically vulnerable staff and extra cleaning provisions. What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safelyDr Roach also urged Mr Williamson to address concerns over “the logistical challenge” of getting enough school transport so children from different year groups and schools would not have to mix.He asked the education secretary to design a ”coordinated national plan” for the safe and full reopening of schools in September that addresses the ”many practical and logistical issues” teachers and headteachers have raised.The Department for Education (DfE) said last week “detailed plans” have been released for schools and colleges in England to welcome back all students from September following disruption due to the coronavirus outbreak. Certain year groups, including Year 1 and Year 6, were allowed back from the start of June. Mr Williamson has said it will be “compulsory” for all pupils to go back to school in September.Why Gavin Williamson can’t afford to mess up the reopening of schools“The NASUWT recognises the importance of schools reopening to all children as soon as it is safe to do so,” Dr Roach, the general secretary, said.“Schools have only a few weeks before they close for the summer break,” he added. “Teachers and headteachers need urgent clarification from the DfE if they are to be able to meet the guidance on September reopening consistently and safely.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Whichever may be the case, he is unique,” he said.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But the newly discovered object is the first time that a pulsar has been found in such a strange relationship, with one of the pair far larger than the other.It\u0027s that unusual difference that scientists hope can be used to provide important clues about some of the deepest, unsolved mysteries of the universe. Those include a better estimate of the Hubble constant, or the rate of expansion of the universe, as well as what the objects are actually made of.Astronomers hope that the powerful blast of disruption caused when the stars collide will allow them to see it from Earth, using both gravitational wave detectors and more traditional telescopes. Among other things, that will allow them to get a better measure of the Hubble constant – which is especially useful given that the two main ways of measuring that value are currently in contradiction.Such a disruption would allow astrophysicists to gain important new clues about the exotic matter that makes up the interiors of these extreme, dense objects, said Paulo Freire from the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy.This matter is still a major mystery - it\u0027s so dense that scientists still don\u0027t know what it is actually made of. These densities are far beyond what we can reproduce in Earth-based laboratories.The vast difference between the two neutron stars is not something that scientists had expected to find until now.Most theories about this event assumed that neutron stars locked in binary systems are very similar in mass, said lead researcher Dr Robert Ferdman, from UEA\u0027s School of Physics, in a statement.Our new discovery changes these assumptions. We have uncovered a binary system containing two neutron stars with very different masses.These stars will collide and merge in around 470 million years, which seems like a long time, but it is only a small fraction of the age of the Universe.Because one neutron star is significantly larger, its gravitational influence will distort the shape of its companion star - stripping away large amounts of matter just before they actually merge, and potentially disrupting it altogether.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas from fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telescope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Several areas in England are experiencing a surge in new coronavirus cases, with places in the North West appearing most at risk to a second wave of infections similar to the one seen in Leicester.The latest figures from Public Health England reveal Bradford and neighbouring Kirklees in West Yorkshire have seen high numbers of daily confirmed cases in recent days.Higher infection rates in Leicester prompted the government to introduce a local lockdown just weeks after nationwide containment measures first began to ease.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFollowing Leicester’s lockdown last week, epidemiologist Professor Neil Ferguson warned that more localised lockdowns in the UK are “inevitable”.The former government adviser said that an estimated 8 per cent of the UK population has so far been infected, and that the pandemic is still in its “early stages”.Leicester remains the worst affected area in England in terms of cumulative case rate, with more than 1,000 people per 100,000 residents having been infected by Covid-19.Other areas to have experienced similarly high case rates include Ashford in Kent and Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria, however both places have seen new cases fall substantially since May.The rate of new coronavirus infections in Ashford began to flatten off in early June, according to data collected by PHE. By contrast, daily cases in Leicester appeared to accelerate at around the same time.A similar surge occurred in Kirklees, despite the curve initially appearing to flatten one month ago. The number of new daily cases consistently fell below 20 in the first week of June, before spiking to more than 40 on 11 June.In Bradford, the number of new cases fell significantly in late May, before rising again throughout June.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.A teenager has donated more than 3,000 face coverings to The Independent’s Help The Hungry campaign to protect volunteers delivering food to the most vulnerable people.Business student James Eid, 19, has given thousands of protective coverings to our appeal partner The Felix Project, which is delivering up to 30 tonnes of food every day to those hit hardest by the pandemic.Mr Eid, who lives in Radlett, was inspired to make face coverings because his grandmother, Anna Ross, 68, has Behcet’s disease.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe condition, which causes blood vessel inflammation and has various side effects, also lowers the immune system meaning she is more vulnerable to Covid-19.Mr Eid struggled to obtain low-cost face coverings to protect his grandmother and so, spotting a gap in the market, decided to import specialist production machines and make them himself.How to support our campaignFamilies face ‘summer of hardship’, food charities warnWhat it’s like to volunteer on the frontline during a pandemicUsing money donated by his father, who is joint CEO of food company Signature Flatbreads, the Lancaster University student imported a production line of four machines, naming his new company Signature Masks.The entrepreneur has since opened a factory in Dunstable, Bedfordshire, with production beginning in earnest at the end of the month. To start with, he will make 36,000 face coverings a week, but the size and scope of the factory means he will be able to scale up production and make up to 500 million coverings annually.The coverings are disposable and made up of three-ply non-woven plastic material – meaning they are water resistant and can be worn for up to 24 hours. He will sell the coverings from his website – they will cost £3.79 for 10, or £2.99 if consumers subscribe for weekly deliveries.On donating thousands to The Felix Project, the teenager said: “I want to support those who are helping others in this crisis.” Mark Curtin, of The Felix Project, said: “These Signature Masks will help protect volunteers and staff in our food redistribution warehouses.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Viruferrin has been scientifically proven to block 98 per cent of similar viruses to Covid-19, including influenza and Sars.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe snood-like coverings can be worn for up to 50 hours before they need washing, and their effectiveness only drops to 96 per cent after over 200 hours of wear.The face coverings are cut and sewn together by Cookson \u0026amp Clegg in Blackburn, which is run by Patrick Grant, star of the Great British Sewing Bee. He is also behind a campaign to get Britons making their own coverings, The Great Community Sew.How to support our campaignThe coverings, which retail at £20, are different to medical grade PPE used by NHS workers. However, due to the protein coverings they are more effective than standard face masks at protecting wearers from viruses.There was a buzz at the Royal Park Felix Project depot when boxes of Virustatic Shield coverings arrived.David Clark, who has been volunteering for three years, said: “I think it is important to wear these face coverings when you’re delivering to members of the public who potentially come into contact with vulnerable people.”Mr Clark dropped off some coverings to Ian Breen, centre manager at Acton Homeless Concern, which serves hot meals five days a week to those in temporary accommodation or on the streets. Mr Breen said: “It is fantastic to have a delivery of some masks for free. It is important to protect those working here and the people who use our centre.”Gretchen Fisher, from Ealing, who has been volunteering for four years, added: “I wear them whenever I go out as you have to protect others.” Mantas Keblis, the depot manager, said that having “extra precautions” would help food reach more people in London. “Everyone really likes them. They are very comfortable to wear.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And today, because of the enormous generosity of Virustatic Shield, whose innovative anti-viral snoods we’ve also been producing, 10,000 of London’s most vulnerable people will receive a vital face covering, delivered to them via The Independent’s fantastic campaign.Which star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day It is now mandatory to wear face coverings on public transport, but these coverings are in short supply.That’s why we started The Big Community Sew to encourage people to make face coverings for their friends and neighbours, and by doing so preserve vital supplies of PPE for NHS workers and care home staff who are fighting this virus on the frontline.The science behind face coverings is simple: they help prevent the wearer from unwittingly spreading the disease.

Each section features a famous face, including Morgan Freeman, Whoopi Goldberg and Sir Paul McCartney, and is signed by Sir Peter, 87.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesProceeds will go to two beneficiaries, including The Independent\u0027s Help The Hungry Now appeal partner The Felix Project.Today, Ms Lumley said it was an “honour” to be part of the fundraising effort.

It is a fabulous way of making life worth living.”Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mDame Judi said: “How wonderful that Peter Blake’s amazing artwork will have a new lease of life for such good causes. I’m very glad that maybe my left eyebrow has gone to good use.”Italian actress Caterina Murino, who also stars in the work, said: “The world is upside down. We fight for our life, we fight for the life of our brothers, and this is the feeling I have when I contemplate Sir Peter Blake’s masterpiece! A hundred stars that reflect the ersity of our world fighting to help Help the Hungry.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Our Help The Hungry appeal today passed the £7m mark, enabling our appeal partner, The Felix Project, to deliver the equivalent of 4.3 million meals to hungry schoolchildren and vulnerable Londoners in the 12 weeks since lockdown began.The milestone was reached thanks to more significant corporate donations, including an additional £100,000 from online grocer Ocado, taking its total donation to £390,000, and a further £90,000 from banking group Citi boosting their aggregate give to £250,000.It comes as the charity Feeding Britain warns that 3 million children face the prospect of hunger during the upcoming school holidays. Of these, it cautions, only 1 million are eligible for the government’s free school meal summer holiday voucher of £15 a week, with the remaining 2 million living with parents who narrowly do not qualify but cannot always afford food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHelen Barnard, of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, confirmed that the summer voucher scheme – agreed by the prime minister after being forced into a U-turn by footballer Marcus Rashford – only covers a minority of children in poverty. She said: “Soaring numbers of families are being pulled under and having to rely on food banks to get through the current crisis, even with the voucher scheme in place.”The harsh reality is that an astounding 66 per cent of food-insecure families – amounting to almost 200,000 children in London – cannot access government help and are forced to rely on food parcels from charities such as The Felix Project.Food and 10,000 face coverings donated to charities and vulnerableWhich star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day At the start of lockdown, The Felix Project faced an existential crisis with a total collapse of its fundraising. Thanks to The Independent’s campaign, it has not only been able to survive but has operated at twice its normal capacity, delivering up to 40 tons of nutritious produce a day and supplying 86 schools and 400 charities and community hubs across the capital over the course of a week.The Independent shareholder Evgeny Lebedev said: “These generous new donations take us 70 per cent of the way towards our goal to secure £10m to combat food poverty in London over the next three years. Our pledge is given added urgency by the release of worrying economic data, including that the number of people out of work and claiming benefits jumped 23 per cent to 2.8 million last month.”Jo West, of Ocado Retail, said most of its donation had been raised from Ocado and their customers via their “you give, we give” scheme. She added: “We’re extremely grateful to our customers for their generosity which enables groups like The Felix Project to bring food to people in desperate need.” James Murray, chair of the Bridgepoint Charitable Trust, which donated £50,000, said: “We are delighted to contribute to the work of The Felix Project in feeding vulnerable communities.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I would not be here if it wasn’t for this project,’ one helper saysWhat has it been like to volunteer during the pandemic? Social enterprise Bread n Butter – one of the charities supplied by our Help The Hungry appeal partner, The Felix Project – closed its doors at the end of March.However, its founders saw a growing need among the city’s most vulnerable for regular home-cooked, nutritious meals, so they joined with community centres Stonegrove Community Trust and the Hive Trust.Since then, Bread n Butter’s team, aided by volunteers, have been cooking and delivering more than 1,000 meals a day to Londoners in need in Barnet, Enfield and Brent. Here, we speak to four people who keep this project going.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRichard Simon, a furloughed IT worker, joined the Stonegrove Community Trust’s OneStonegrove project in Edgware at his wife’s suggestion. The 52-year-old said: “Working in the kitchens was like being on Ready Steady Cook. You don’t know what ingredients you’re going to be working with, so you have to think on your feet.” The father of two, who dedicates 20 hours a week, added that the biggest thing he had learnt was the power of “working together”.“For a group of people who don’t know each other, we just get on with it, working flat out.

The former Oxfam shop worker, who has high-functioning autism, said that because of her condition, having a “structured day” is incredibly important. “Without routine, I can’t cope,” she said. “I would not be here if it wasn’t for this project.”Ms Karbritz, who is also anorexic, said working with food had been transformative. “Working to create healthy, nutritious food everyday has changed my relationship with it. I have also learned how to cook, whereas before I lived out of tins.”Mariana Bassi Da Silva, a software developer, wanted to volunteer as she was not working due to the pandemic. A keen cook, the 34-year-old volunteered for OneStonegrove and said the project had helped develop her love of cooking. The Brazilian-Italian, who moved to London seven years ago, said the greatest impact the project has had on her was the sense of “belonging”.“It is hard to settle in when you move,” she said. “Here, I have a community.

Despite the vast differences between the two situations, Fawcett’s extensive military experiences and qualifications have helped him and his team develop a robust response to the Covid-19 crisis.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“I was the only doctor there for about 300 people, which was quite an eye-opening experience,” says Fawcett of his first stint in Afghanistan in 2007 as part of the Army Reserves. Working at the Role 2E Field Hospital in Camp Bastion and at the Forward Operating Base, Fawcett provided key treatment on the Afghanistan frontline.On his second stint in 2007, he spent three months in Camp Bastion as a Trauma Team Leader, and on his third tour in 2011, he was the clinical lead for the Medical Emergency Response Team, a four-person medical team operating from a Chinook flying over Afghanistan, picking up wounded soldiers on the battlefield.What’s more, Fawcett – who also counts a role with the Midlands Air Ambulance Charity as a helicopter doctor amongst his impressive repertoire – has completed an MSc in Disaster Healthcare. Playing an instrumental part of Stoke hospital’s response to the Coronavirus pandemic is just one more string to his bow.“I was able to take a lot of stuff I learnt and apply it from the very start,” Fawcett says of putting his Masters in Disaster Healthcare into practise. “Before the patients even get to the emergency department, we make sure there’s clear boundaries, and patients are directed to the right areas to avoid any cross-contamination.”His army tours also contributed: “Looking at the designs of how they set up field hospitals and stuff helps,” he adds. “And working with international colleagues – it’s good to get a non-UK perspective on how other countries deal with certain circumstances.”This involved an overhaul of the whole emergency area and its processes. “We now run two emergency medicine departments out of one department,” he explains. “We’ve had to basically split the whole department in half.”Now, Stoke hospital features red zones and green zones: the former is for those displaying potential Covid symptoms and the latter is for those who aren’t. As such, the pathways and patient-flow of the hospital have had to be changed to avoid any instances of contact between these areas.“We have separate ambulance entrances for red and green patients. We have two resuscitation departments, two areas for major patients, two areas for walk-in patients, two minor injuries areas, two paediatrics departments, as well as designing alternative pathways to try and stream those patients that don’t have to come through the emergency department to other places.” he explains, noting how such isions have had to be executed throughout the whole hospital to prevent crowding and maintain social distancing.How schools in England are helping pupils return to the classroomThe task may have been monumental, but Fawcett takes pride in the hospital’s response: “This is what we’ve always trained for and it’s been good to see how us as an emergency department have responded to it. We’ve ensured patient safety and staff safety has always been at the forefront.”Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The UK can still in theory participate as it is in the Brexit transition period.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesDowning Street has said the UK is interested in taking part in a European Union programme and says work is ongoing to determine how it would participate.Since Britain left the EU, Brussels has increased its 2020 budget by more than €4 billion to fund a variety of coronavirus related schemes, of which €2.7 billion is to be used to fund an Emergency Support Instrument, intended primarily as a down payment on any future coronavirus vaccine for the EU’s member states, using the EU’s collective buying power, the committee of MPs said in a report.The European Commission says the UK has to pay for the emergency support instrument, but could also benefit from it. Under the terms of the Brexit transition period negotiated by Boris Johnson, the UK has to follow EU rules and policies without any say.The Government apparently disputes whether it has a legal obligation under that Agreement to contribute towards a €2 billion (£1.8 billion) increase in EU spending on the \u0027Emergency Support Instrument\u0027, which could affect the UK’s ability to participate in an EU-led initiative to use part of this money to secure a supply of any future coronavirus vaccine.Created with Sketch.Brexit day: UK says goodbye to EU  Show all 66Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A message projected onto the White Cliffs of DoverBig Ben, shows the hands at eleven o\u0027clock at nightNigel Farage speaks to pro-Brexit supportersPro-Brexit demonstrators celebrate on Parliament Square The Union flag is taken down outside the European Parliament in BrusselsPro-EU campaigners outside the Scottish Parliament, EdinburghA pro-Brexit supporter jumps on an EU flag in Parliament SquareEU Council staff removed the Union Jack-British flag from the European Council in Brussels, BelgiumPedestrians pass in front of the Ministry of Defence Building on Whitehall, illuminated by red, white and blue lights in central London A Brexit supporter shouts during a rally in LondonPro-EU campaigners outside the Scottish Parliament, EdinburghPro-EU campaigners take part in a \u0027Missing EU Already\u0027 rally outside the Scottish Parliament, EdinburghA large pro-EU banner is projected onto Ramsgate cliff in KentPro-EU supporters light candles in Smith Square in WestminsterA man waves Union flags from a small car as he drives past Brexit supporters gathering in Parliament SquareThe five-year old Elisa Saemann, left, and her seven-year old sister Katie hold a placard during a rally by anti-Brexit protesters outside the Scottish parliament in EdinburghPro Europe supporters gather on Brexit day near the British embassy in Berlin, GermanyAnti-Brexit protester hugs a man while holding a placard A decorated, old fashioned fire pump in Parliament SquarePro Brexit Elvis impersonator performs at Parliament SquareAn anti-Brexiteers stands with his dog in Parliament SquarePaddy from Bournemouth wears Union colours as he sits next to an EU flag decorated bag in Parliament Square A pro-EU activist plays a guitar decorated with the EU flag during a protest organised by civil rights group New Europeans outside Europe House, central LondonPeople celebrate Britain leaving the EUA Pro Brexit supporter has a Union Jack painted onto his face at Parliament SquareMen hold placards celebrating Britain leaving the EUPro Brexit supporters dance in the street draped with Union Jack flags at Parliament SquareAn anti-Brexit demonstrator spreads his wings during a gathering near Downing StreetPro EU supporters display a banner \u0027 Here to Stay, Here to Fight, Migrants In, Tories Out\u0027 from Westminster bridgePro-Brexit supporters burn European Union flags at Parliament SquareA man poses for a picture on Parliament Square in a \u0027Brexit Day\u0027 t-shirtPeople celebrate Britain leaving the EUA man wears a pro-Brexit t-shirtAnti-Brexit demonstrators visit Europe House to give flowers to the staff on Brexit dayPro Brexit supporter wears a novelty Union Jack top hat outside the Houses of ParliamentCustomers Scott Jones and Laura Jones at the Sawmill Bar in South Elmsall, Yorkshire, where a Brexit party is being held throughout the dayA Brexit supports holds a sign in Parliament SquareA man carries an EU themed wreathAnn Widdecombe reacts with other members of the Brexit party as they leave en masse from the European ParliamentAnti-Brexit demonstrators in Parliament SquarePro EU supporters let off flares from Westminster BridgeBritish MEPs Jonathan Bullock, holding the Union Jack flag and Jake Pugh leave the European Parliament, in Brussels on the Brexit dayNewspapers and other souvenirs at a store, near Parliament SquareBrexit supporters hold signs in Parliament SquarePro-EU protesters hold placards in Parliament SquareSinn Fein leader Mary Lou McDonald with a Border Communities Against Brexit poster before its unveiling in Carrickcarnon on the Irish borderNational growers organisation British Apples \u0026amp Pears has renamed a British apple to EOS, the Greek goddess of dawn, to commemorate Brexit dayPro-EU protesters hold placards in Parliament SquareBritain\u0027s departure from the European Union was set in law on January 29, amid emotional scenes, as the bloc\u0027s parliament voted to ratify the orce papers.

While defending their actions, government ministers had argued variously that the schemes provided no advantage, that it had missed the deadlines to participate due to a communications error, and that they had in fact joined the scheme.Asked about the situation with the vaccine procurement programme and the budget contribution increase, a government spokesperson was vague and said only: “Work is ongoing to determine whether and how the UK participates in the EU Vaccines Strategy.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The package unveiled today is expected to cost the Treasury around £30bn.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesStamp duty scrapped for homes under £500,000Stamp Duty scrapped on all homes under £500,000 with immediate effectIn an attempt to kickstart the stalled housing market, Mr Sunak is increasing the stamp duty threshold from £125,000 to £500,000 in England and Northern Ireland, taking effect immediately and lasting until March 31 next year.He said this would benefit nine in 10 homebuyers, saving £4,500 on average.“Uncertainty abounds in the market – a market we need to be thriving,” he told MPs.The chancellor said employers that bring back an inidual who was furloughed during the coronavirus lockdown – and continuously employ them until the end of January 2021 – will be paid a £1,000 bonus per employee. He said the bonus scheme would cost £9bn if all employers took full advantage.‘Kickstart scheme’ for young peopleThe new scheme will directly pay employers to create jobs for any 16- to 24-year-olds who are on universal credit, and “at risk of long-term unemployment”, Mr Sunak said. The chancellor insisted these jobs, with a minimum of 25 hours per week, will paid at least the government’s national minimum wage. It is expected that iniduals will be in the first jobs by the autumn, with an initial £2bn set aside for the scheme. “If employers meet these conditions, we will pay young people’s wages for six months, plus an amount to cover overheads,” he told MPs.Meal vouchers for all citizensIn an attempt to get customers back into restaurants, bars and cafes as the lockdown eases, the chancellor announced everyone in the country will be eligible for “Eat Out to Help Out” vouchers. Every diner to get £10 restaurant discount as VAT slashed for hospitalMeals eaten at businesses participating in the scheme, which runs on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays next month, will be 50 per cent off per head, Mr Sunak said.“Businesses will need to register, and can do so through a simple website, open next Monday. Each week in August, businesses can then claim the money back, with the funds in their bank account within five days.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive updates on politics every morning by emailVAT slashed for hospitality sectorFor the next six months, VAT, which is currently 20 per cent, will be cut to 5 per cent on food, accommodation and attractions. “This is a £4bn catalyst for the hospitality and tourism sectors, benefiting over 150,000 businesses, and consumers everywhere – all helping to protect 2.4 million jobs,” Mr Sunak claimed.The chancellor said he wanted to place the environment at the heart of the economic recovery, introducing a £2bn green homes grant. A further £1bn will be made available to improve the energy efficiency of public sector buildings, he said.“From September, homeowners and landlords will be able to apply for vouchers to make their homes more energy efficient and create local jobs,” Mr Sunak said. “The grants will cover at least two thirds of the cost, up to £5,000 per household. And for low income households, we’ll go even further with vouchers covering the full cost – up to £10,000.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Here are some of the measures that schools are implementing to make the transition easier for pupils, staff and parentsIn association with the UK GovernmentHinchingbrooke School is an academy school in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, with more than 1,900 pupils and 200 staff. Teachers started welcoming back A-level students last week.“We’ve only had the Year 12s in so far, but for them it was really clear they were delighted to be back,” says Mark Patterson, school principal, pictured above. “You could see it on their faces. It’s getting back to some sense of routine, structure and normality.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHe continues: “I think a lot of them have been surprised by how much they’ve missed school. I think if you’d asked them before lockdown ‘Would you like a week off?’, they’d have said ‘Please!’. I bet if you asked them now, they’d say ‘Can I come back?’. I think the parents and students now realise how important school is.”Prior to the return, teachers organised a virtual assembly for Year 10 and 12 pupils, and sent a booklet home detailing the new guidelines which would be in place.5 back-to-school tips for parents\u0026nbsp“Don\u0027t give them a lot of small instructions – recognise your child would have had an enormous amount of\u0026nbspinstructions during the course of the day.”“If you are rewarding your child\u0027s behaviour, it\u0027s very important to do it every time.”“For a child who\u0027s been finding it tough,\u0026nbsptalking to another child who\u0027s been in the same situation is by far the best way of letting it out.”“It\u0027s important to encourage a child to work for themselves and get on with their own inner task.”New measures include red circles marked on the ground that are two metres apart and one-way systems throughout the school.“We’ve reorganised all the classrooms that we’re using so the desks and chairs are two metres apart,” Patterson explains. “We’ve got designated areas set aside at break and lunchtime for each group to go to, and we’ve got signage around the school reminding everybody of the importance of hygiene, frequent hand washing and keeping their distance.”Implementing new measuresRheeya Makwana is one of the Year 12 students who has returned to Hinchingbrooke. “We’ve been having online lessons and voiceover PowerPoints, but it’s not really the same as being in a classroom,” she says. “The structure was really good and I felt like I learned a lot more being back at school. I came home in such a good mood.”Rheeya’s father Yogesh Makwana did have some initial worries about his daughter returning to school: “There’s always some concern, but all the communication from school has been excellent in the build up to it and all the measures that have been put in place have reassured us. If you offered our 13-year-old the chance to go back to school tomorrow, he’d do it in a heartbeat. He misses his classes the social interaction. He loves PE and he does so much at school that he misses.Year 10 pupils Vahine and Lucia will also be returning to the school this week. “The twins are really looking forward to it,” says their mother, Alesia Dickinson. “They’ve been messaging all their friends to find out what group they’re in. Less than a week after we said yes to going back we found out what bubbles they were in and we had clear guidelines about times, rooms and what they can expect when they go back to school. They’re raring to go.”Both Makwana and Dickinson agree that their children have missed the structure of school lessons and that the transition back to the classroom has been easier than expected. “I think it’s a positive thing,” says Dickinson. “I think it’s a step in the right direction. We need to let the children start that process.”Going back to Embark schoolsTrust leader at Embark Matthew Crawford, pictured below, has been welcoming back primary pupils to the Federation’s schools across Derbyshire.“The feedback we have had so far from all the schools across the Trust is that it’s going really well in terms of welcoming the children back,” he says. “It’s not a one-size-fits-all. Each school has done a risk assessment based on what they can do.”Most Embark schools are now back at around 25-30 per cent capacity, Crawford says. It\u0027s up from around two per cent when lockdown began, when it was just key workers’ children and more vulnerable pupils in the classroom.“It’s lovely to hear the children playing and see schools becoming vibrant again,” he adds. “As soon as lockdown began, we started work on our Reconnection to Recovery and Resilience programme, a nine-stage support package to welcome children back safely.”Keyworker Vicki Ellis has two children who have returned to one of Embark\u0027s schools Richardson Endowed Primary - Amelia in Year 3 and Darcey in Year 1, pictured below.The first day the girls were back I was wondering how they were all day. I knew the school had done everything possible to welcome the children back in a happy, positive way but I worried whether Amelia and Darcey were enjoying themselves. But when they came home they were so happy to have had that day at school – and eager to go back next day. Crawford explains that the school has tried to make the transition back to the classroom as fun as possible for the children: “We’re following the guidelines but in a way that’s fun for the children. We aren’t marking big Xs on the floor. Some of our schools, for example, are painting snakes in bright colours to show the way.”Embark has also shared its programme with schools as far as Devon, Durham, South Gloucestershire and Wales.“It’s a suite of resources and activities that schools can adapt to their own settings, taking the bits that work for them,” explains Crawford. “It’s lovely that the brilliant work of our staff is making a difference and impacting the lives of millions of children across the country, not just the 3,000 within our Trust.”Information in this article applies to schools in England only.

But when coronavirus hit in March, Ireland’s biggest sportswear brand had to break the habit of a lifetime and sack its entire 750-strong workforce at its Strabane factory due to the lockdown.With sports events cancelled or postponed, orders from teams and retailers vanished.However, the company was thrown a surprise lifeline when, a day after announcing the layoffs, the Western Health and Social Care Trust approached O’Neills on a Friday about fulfilling a shortage of scrubs to safeguard frontline NHS workers.Factory staff spent that weekend making sample scrubs. By the Monday, O’Neills had secured an order for 10,000 sets of maroon tops and trousers for GPs at a coronavirus testing centre at Altnagelvin Area Hospital, Londonderry.As a result, the company rehired 150 workers immediately. It has since brought back more than 400 staff overall as orders from other health trusts across Northern Ireland grew, with the remaining 350 employees being furloughed.The company now produces some 10,000 sets of scrubs a week. Managing director Kieran Kennedy, a veteran of 41 years at the business, says employees have been supportive of the switch from making sporting goods.“We are a close-knit community in Strabane. Many employees know people who work in the NHS and they want to give back,” he explains. “We could either feel sorry for ourselves or be productive and take a bite at the cherry. Without the NHS orders, we would have had no sales and no cash flow. The scrubs kept the show on the road.”Kennedy says the move outside the company’s traditional business area has been relatively easy. For instance, O’Neills had stockpiled a six-month supply of yarn – the raw material for the scrubs and other clothing – from China to hedge against Brexit uncertainty. The company knits the scrubs at its Strabane factory, then dyes and coats them with anti-viral substances at its production plant in Dublin.Workers on the factory floors are social distancing, as well as wearing face masks, sanitising their hands and having their temperature checked.Kennedy is upbeat on the company’s future prospects, noting that big sporting fixtures are returning, which should boost sales and enable him to rehire more workers. But for the foreseeable future, Kennedy plans to continue producing protective gear – an unexpected new revenue stream.   The gift shop owner donating Happy Bags to localsWhen Sarah Lloyd Williams, pictured above, had to temporarily close her quirky little gift shop in Frome on 22 March, she had no idea what she was going to do with the time ahead.At first, Lloyd Williams relished the opportunity to spend every day with her dog, Chester, taking him with other dogs out for walks. However, by nature, she is a hands-on person and soon realised she needed to find something to fill her time other than dog walking and cleaning.She had found out that someone local to her had been having a hard time. “I knew this lady slightly and wondered if there was anything I could do to help, Lloyd Williams explains. I didn’t feel that I knew her enough to contact her offering assistance, so instead I decided to leave a little gift on her doorstep.” She called it a Happy Bag, containing a copy of The Happy Newspaper (a quarterly newspaper by Emily Coxhead containing nothing but good news), a chocolate bar, bath bomb and a little note.This good deed went down very well: the recipient messaged Lloyd Williams to ask if she could buy a Happy Bag for her friend. “I didn’t want any money, Lloyd Williams explains. This was something small that I could do with items that I already sell in Figgins, so I delivered a Happy Bag to her friend and it went from there.”She ended up delivering a number of bags in the local area and it led to doing a few other little things for people, such as picking up medicines, shopping and more dog walking.For Lloyd Williams, this became a lovely way to connect with people that she barely knew, or had never met before, and it made lockdown much easier to navigate: “Giving away some Happy Bags certainly made me feel much happier. It’s a tiny thing, but sometimes that’s all it takes to make someone’s day,” she says.Figgins has now reopened, with Lloyd Williams taking steps to make sure her shop is safer with a screen, hand sanitising stations, floor stickers and limiting the number of people in the shop at any one time. Lloyd Williams is also donating a Happy Bag every week to someone in the local community.At the start of lockdown, Andy Hibbert, above, transformed his car-sharing business.Launched in 2017, Car \u0026amp Away had enabled holidaymakers to rent out their cars from Gatwick and Bristol Airports while they were away, but when the coronavirus forced airports to close, business plummeted.The CEO from south west London quickly decided to use the business\u0027 existing assets to help key workers and launched a new service: Karshare.“We had this burgeoning desire for people to rent their car from home because it was sat there doing nothing,” Hibbert explains. “But then Covid came along. As a business we were stranded. We thought: this is ridiculous. We have all the systems in place to enable us to share cars. Why don\u0027t we launch the car-sharing concept where owners donate their cars to critical-care workers and people who are supporting the most vulnerable in our community?”At the peak of the pandemic, travelling by car minimised viral spread on public transport and limited key workers’ exposure, while making their journeys easier at a stressful time. Karshare encouraged members of the public in Bristol, Brighton, London, Manchester and Leeds to donate their cars for a week to NHS staff and volunteer organisations. The cars were then deep cleaned and matched to local key workers in need of transport.Insurance and road coverage were provided for free, and the owner received a full tank of petrol as a thank you.Impressively, 700 cars have since been donated – including to 31 London NHS trusts – with a total 19,000 days of use. Leasing company ALD donated 30 new cars in Bristol. “We were overwhelmed initially about the donations,” says Hibbert.One key worker who benefited was Michaela Morris, deputy chief operating officer at the NHS Nightingale Hospital London in Docklands. “She was put into a hotel and told she needs to be on call 247, so we quickly found her a car,” says Hibbert. “It’s remarkable that she has been able to continue that work because of the generosity of the public.”Karshare also helped a care worker who had only been able to reach a couple of vulnerable patients a day on his bicycle. When he was loaned a car he could reach up to 11 – and save more lives.While Karshare is now focusing efforts on making the business profitable again, it is also inviting donations to critical workers and will ask for contributions to cover the insurance. Karshare is also being extended to the wider community, allowing people to rent their cars from home.“There are financial pressures for people,” adds Hibbert, “yet they\u0027ve got an asset on their driveway that could really help.”The distillery that swapped gin for hand sanitiserIn the midst of a global pandemic, constrained by lockdown, a fledging gin brand was surrounded by alcohol with no bars open to supply. But reports of hand sanitiser shortages hit the headlines and gave the team an idea.Sean Roche launched Aintree Gin in December 2019. An organic, craft spirit, it takes its name from its home in Merseyside – a village renowned for its famous racecourse which hosts the historic Grand National.By spring, Roche and the team had introduced the gin to over 30 establishments around Liverpool. They were gearing up for the steeplechase, but lockdown put paid to their plans. “As soon as everything started to shut … all of our income went down to zero,” Roche says.Realising online sales would be key, the team started building a website – then they had a brainwave. “News reports started to regularly mention how shortages of… alcohol-based sanitiser were putting NHS and care workers at risk,” says Roche. “We knew that because we were already using pure alcohol to make our gin, we could change our production line to make sanitiser.”Their first batch was ready within weeks. Word got out and, soon after, they were inundated with requests from care homes, hospitals and more, Roche recalls.Volunteers were recruited and more than 600 litres were donated in six weeks. But as supplies ran low, and with no money coming in, the enterprise became financially unviable. “We had two choices,” says Roche. “Stop – or start selling something.”Opting for the latter, new containers were ordered and labels designed so the sanitiser could be sold online. They started offering a range of PPE products too, from face shields to masks. “This created a revenue stream that allowed us to continue,” adds Roche.A PPE pop-up and free hand sanitiser stations at an Asda store followed. “We donated more than we made in profit over the period,” Roche admits.Today, sales are going strong. As businesses look to reopen, many are turning to Aintree Gin for their sanitisation requirements – and also the brand’s primary product. They now aim to supply as many bars and restaurants as possible, and get into supermarkets as well.To read about more inspiring GREAT stories, visit greatbritaincampaigninspirationsWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The provincial agricultural department said in a statement that the dog meat trade had descended into “anarchy” in recent years, causing rabies and other diseases to spread from region to region.The department said in a statement that the “catching, buying, selling and slaughtering of dogs” would be punished “severely”, with maximum penalties including five years in prison and fines of up to 50 million riel (approximately £9,700).Dr Katherine Polak, head of Four Paws, said: “The historic decision by the Siem Reap government to ban the stealing, trading and killing of dogs is a huge milestone for animal welfare in Cambodia and is reflective of current sentiment among Khmer people.UN warns of ‘steady stream’ of infectious zoonotic diseases‘If we don’t buy, they don’t die’: Tackling the wildlife trade demandCan social media be weaponised against the illegal wildlife trade?Prince William backs report to ‘end the illegal wildlife trade’Yulin Dog Meat Festival: How did it start and will it get banned?“We hope that Siem Reap will serve as a model for the rest of the country to follow suit to protect the lives of millions of dogs.”The dog meat industry in Cambodia sees an estimated three million dogs slaughtered for consumption annually. Thousands of animals are transported from Siem Reap to different parts of the country each month, including to the capital, Phnom Penh.Tea Kimsoth, director of the provincial agriculture, forestry and fisheries department, told Reuters that demand for the meat was driven by foreigners, especially South Korean visitors to the country.“They like it, that’s why it led to restaurants serving it, so now we ban it,” he said, adding that the trade was “alarming”.The Cambodian province’s decision follows China recent ban on the sale of dog and cat meat. The animals were kept in poor conditions, making them vulnerable to disease that could be transmitted to humans, said activists.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There have been more than 170 new cases of Covid-19 since last week, marking the biggest increase since the virus\u0027s spread was close to being eliminated in April.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We have two entirely contradictory positions.“If we both dig our heels in on those positions, there will be no discussion or agreement on fisheries and therefore no agreement on trade.

vehicle named Grenadier was due to begin in Bridgend next year.Around  jobs were due to be created initially, but that was expected to increase to  once the vehicle reached full production.Chemicals giant Ineos is run by billionaire Sir Jim Ratclfe, a vocal supporter of Brexit.It was reported in February  that he was moving to Monaco to avoid UK taxes on his fortune.A UK Government spokesperson said: #Were continuing to work to ensure Wales and the whole of the UK is an attractive location for cutting-edge automotive technologies #

The big aim was to save lives and protect the vulnerable.⚠️ Read our coronavirus live blog for the latest news  updatesI doubt it occurred to many parents that schools would be closed for nearly FOUR months, and counting, or that they were about to take a pivotal role in educating their own children.But that is what has happened. And I know from friends with school-aged children that it has been, shall we say, a bit challenging.So I want to dedicate this column to the hundreds of thousands of parents who became home-educators overnight — with a particular shout out to the “lucky” ones who had to do this while also doing their regular jobs.Trying to educate your child, with no idea of when schools will reopen, and at the same time as trying to do justice to your day job, is seriously hard and my hat comes off to all of you.Now that the UK is slowly unlocking, there are many working parents who face the prospect of having to go back to their jobs.Some have children back at school until the end of term. But it is fair to say that no one is in an ideal situation.It has been a slog for everyone — and what we all need is a holiday. But with all the chaos and uncertainty surrounding trips abroad, and most UK holiday homes and campsites now already booked up, many of us will have been lucky to plan any kind of trip.More pressingly, many of the children’s holiday clubs people rely on are closed. After all, try telling a bunch of seven-year-olds to stay socially distant during a game of football.Many families rely on grand- parents to fill the childcare gaps during school holidays.But even though restrictions have eased, lots of grandparents will have underlying health conditions that make it unsafe for them to venture out.They will be stuck at home, missing family and unable to help out with childcare.In short, there is an army of working parents out there, already on their knees after four months of combining school and work, who now face their kids having seven more weeks off school, with no structure and support.What are working parents to do  This is a really tough situation for families.There are some basic things that parents can do to make le easier — and right at the top of that list is to lower your standards.Very few things are so important that they cannot wait until tomorrow. No one died because the house was not Hoovered.One thing I do know is that when you are working all the hours God sends and looking after kids, “me time” is almost impossible. But when you are firing on all cylinders, it is all too easy to burn out.So my advice for this particular Sunday is this — try to find even just one hour to go for a walk or meet a friend.Or find a corner where no one can bother you, and read a book, do some yoga, have a bath and pour yourself a cup of tea or a glass of wine.The rest of the world can go hang while you recharge your batteries and live to fight another day.Parenting is the hardest job in the world at the best of times. It does not come with a manual or instructions. It is relentless and you get very little thanks.The rewards are happy, healthy, balanced adults — but that comes -plus years later.If you are struggling, remember this — it will pass. Meanwhile, take it a day at a time and hang in there. You are doing a sterling job.The BBC has found the perfect solution to lockdown filming, with their revival of Alan Bennett’s Talking Heads series of monologues.No need to worry about social-distancing with a cast of one.And Killing Eve star Jodie Comer playing a part first performed by Julie Walters in the s in Her Big Chance, was brilliant.She is a fantastic actor, as we well know from Killing Eve, and this performance demonstrated her versatility, too.Did you see those pictures of Loose Women star Nadia Sawalha, who is , stripping down to her underwear If you did, then you may well have uttered the word: “Why ”But she wanted to show what women really look like, and to demonstrate the power that a filter, camera angle and ious other cunning techniques can have in efforts to make women look more “perfect”.When you think about the multiple images of “perfection” that women are subjected to daily, you realise that unless there is a visible antidote to this – actual evidence that real women are not perfect after all – we will never change the pressure we are under.So, good on you, Nadia.This was a successful attempt to highlight the degree to which the camera does, indeed, lie – but also the pressure we are all under to distort normality.I know many people who look great in photos but normal in real le.That feeling of need to alter your image can be a sort of self-hatred. It also fuels others’ need to airbrush themselves, so that all of us risk becoming unrecognisable in real le.The problem with altering your image is that you are fooling precisely no one.What is far better is to love yourself, no matter what you look like.Seeking adulation from people you don’t know and will never meet is a fool’s game because it will never, ever pay idends.It’s so easy to indulge in regret – but this is also a fool’s game.Anyone tempted by its lure needs to take a leaf out of Pierce Brosnan’s book.He said this week he has “no regret” after being told over the phone that he was being replaced in his role as James Bond.The actor, now , had his last outing as  in Die Another Day in  – and although he was eager to do a fth film, producers decided they wanted to reboot the role.Instead of feeling bitter and resentful, he said: “There’s no regret. I do not let regret come into my world . . . it just leads to more misery and more regrets.”Pierce is one of those actors who really has mastered the art of growing old gracefully – a le goal for all of us.He is a gorgeous man and comes across as a genuinely nice guy.Oh, and judging from recent photos, he could still play Bond now.I know many people have been disappointed they are having to scale back plans for big summer weddings.If you’ve been arranging the biggest and best day of your le, you might be wondering whether it’s better to just postpone altogether.For what it’s worth, I have some advice. It really is just a day. Yes, it should be lovely but it’s not the wedding that is important – it’s what happens afterwards.By that, I mean the rest of your married le together.It’s easy to get caught up with expectation and convention but maybe this is a chance to think about what you really want and what matters to you as a couple.You may also realise thatyou marry at the moment there can be no first dance – a tradition surely conceived during the s when couples don’t have sex before marriage – and a cause for celebration.The local lockdown in Leicester is a stark reminder that the next few months, and maybe years, could bring plenty more of the same. Anywhere.When this does happen, we will all have to do our bit.But hearing garment manufacturers in Leicester saying it will defy the city’s lockdown shines a light on what, for some, is the nub of the matter – for so many people, lockdown equals a loss of income.They cannot afford to lose any more money, evenit means putting lives at risk.That is going to be a real problem. But staying open “evenit puts lives at risk” is a cavalier and dangerous attitude.If you own a factory, it is your job to make sure your workers are safe.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Many could be thrown on the “scrapheap” and those trying to build a new career will find it tougher than ever to get a foothold on the jobs ­ladder.The impact of unemployment will blight their future, as the knock-on effects — including hopelessness and alienation — will last a letime.The Government has a simple choice this week: Either invest now to ensure youngsters have the training and skills needed to meet the challenges ahead, or we will all pick up the pieces later.That means laying the ground for real apprenticeships and work ­experience, with proper jobs at the end of them. There should be more opportunity to continue learning, developing the knowledge and skills required to land a job or, better still, become a future entrepreneur.We should seize the opportunity to create new jobs in the regions by regenerating the North and the Midlands, including tackling climate change, housing and construction, and the added social care challenges of supporting an ageing population.\" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"The Chancellor should also work with business and the trade unions to recruit , employers willing to assist, by offering them incentives and subsidies, including help with National Insurance and pension contributions.Additionally, existing underspends and the Apprenticeship Levy, together with potential benefit payments, should be topped up to create a £billion fund to meet the challenge of a record ­million under-s predicted to be out of work by Christmas. This is not just a matter of hard-headed public policy.It is about the lives of every inidual and their chances of building a future for themselves, developing a family of their own and contributing to their community. It is about what ­happens when aimlessness turns either into apathy or, more likely, into what my grandfather would have described as the danger of “idle hands”.History has taught us that society begins to unravel when young men without prospects, stability or the capacity to provide a role model become an unattractive prospect as a lelong partner.The future is grim when young women feel that they alone carry the responsibility of nurturing a child, and when a lack of prospects and progress to something better leads to a “live today and to hell with tomorrow” attitude.Former Conservative minister Lord Willetts has written and spoken convincingly about the danger of the generational ide.His honest reflections of how the austerity measures put in place in  hit younger people hardest, and how the protected ­pensions of the past, combined with the enormous rise in property values, have placed the majority of older people in a more favourable place to face the future showed great insight.\" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"Young people lack the prospects of a secure job and either owning their own home or affording the rent.That is why we should face this challenge head-on and invest now, or we will pick up the cost later.In , during the early days of the New Labour government, our New Deal for the young unemployed offered four options.Not surprisingly, the bulk of young people went for either jobs with ­training attached or full-time education, which would lead to much better prospects of holding on to a job with decent earnings.Another lesson learnt, including in -, was that much of what needed to be done should be localised.The tendency to over-centralise ­everything has bedevilled us in this crisis.From the failure to devolve test-and-trace to local government through to months of ineptitude in ­getting our children back to school, the Government has classically created a central bureaucracy then blamed it for failure.While it has done the right thing in investing money in recovery ­programmes for our children over the winter, astonishingly, it failed to put any money in for recovery for those  to -year-olds in further education in sixth-form colleges.These are the young people whose vocational training and practical ­opportunities for work will be vital both for the economic recovery and for their own chances of getting a job.After all, you cannot promise a ­guarantee of apprenticeships or work experiencea business has folded.The Government needs to work with and listen to young people, employers and those in education and training.Unfashionable as it is at this moment to talk about universities, it is crucial that those capable of taking up such opportunities should be supported in doing so.If we don’t, they will be the ones who take the jobs of those less qualied and less confident.The result is simple. The least educated and the most vulnerable will be the ones to lose out most.Thinking these things through ­carefully, being able to act decisively and learning from the past, while not living in it, is surely common sense.And by God, we need a great deal more of that right now.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We’ll pay businesses to hire young apprentices, with a new payment of £,. The scheme will also pay for businesses to take on apprentices over the age of  with a bonus of £,.He said he refused to allow young people - hit hard by the economic impact coronavirus - become a lost generation of workers. He said: Today, we act, with a plan for jobs. Our plan has a clear goal: to protect, support and create jobs.It will give businesses the confidence to retain and hire.To create jobs in every part of our country. To give young people a better start. To give people the opportunity of a fresh start.”The announcement comes after growing fears young peoples earnings could be permanently scarred because of lockdown, and the IPPR think-tank forecast unemployment for under-s could double to just over one million by the end of . Mr Sunak added: In particular the help we want to provide for those who will be hardest hit by this crisis: younger people. Over , people are leaving education this year. Many more are just starting out in their careers. Coronavirus has hit them hard - under s are two and a half times as likely to work in a sector that has been closed.If the first phase of our economic phase was about protection, and the second phase today is about jobs, there will come a third phase to rebuild. He vowed the Government would heal the wounds of the coronavirus pandemic. The Apprenticeship Levy already incentivises large firms to take on apprentices, but small firms will now also be given a cash bonus for taking them on. The scheme to boost apprentice roles for young people is in addition to plans to get more firms to take on trainees for  weeks -  months by offering them £, for every trainee. The Chancellor announced today: The Chancellor said there would be extra support to sector-based work academies, who provide training and work placements. The scheme will get young people into work and stay in work, Mr Sunak said  per cent of apprentices stay in work or do further training afterwards. The massive cut to VAT announced by the Chancellor will allow Brits to eat out at half price, for up to £ discount per head from Monday-Wednesday in August. But it will also help protect jobs - primarily young and low earners. Around , businesses are eligible for the scheme dubbed Eat Out to Help Out and is designed to support . million jobs which are disproportionately young, female and part-time workers. The entire package was part of a three-stage coronavirus economic recovery programme. The first stage - laid out at the start of lockdown - protected jobs and businesses from going under as the country closed up shop. This next stage announced today aims to create a bridge to ensure furloughed workers arent laid off across the country and people who missed out on opportunities were able to find them. Boris Johnsons promise to level up Britain set to be announced in the Autumn budget will form the final stage to help rebuild the nation. Matthew Lesh, Head of Research at the Adam Smith Institute think-tank, welcomed the initiatives to help young people. He said: The Covid- virus harms older people the most, but the economic lockdown is destroying le opportunities for young people. They are losing jobs in hospitality and retail and will find it harder to get onto the jobs ladder, risking a long-term loss of income. The Government is rightly focusing on getting young people into real jobs, rather than establishing expensive make-work schemes. This wage subsidy scheme will get many young people onto the job ladder, building skills that will make them employable in the future.   To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Whatever the reasons, we need to overcome our reservations and wear face coverings whenever we are around others in public.“It used to be quite normal to have quite a few drinks and drive home, and it also used to be normal to drive without seatbelts. Today, both of those would be considered antisocial, and not wearing face coverings in public should be regarded in the same way.”He said the use of masks lowers the chance of future surge and lockdowns which are “economically and psychologically disruptive”.His comments come after new research was released that detailed the effectiveness of the use of face masks and coverings.One study, by the Data Evaluation and Learning for Viral Epidemicsgroup said masks could reduce the risk of transmission and can also provide benefits to those who wear them.While another paper from the Royal Society’s Science in Emergencies Tasking Covid- group, highlighted how behind the UK was compared to other countries.It claims that in April the uptake of people wearing a mask in the UK was  per cent.It claimed that countries such as Italy had a . per cent uptick, while the US had . per cent and Spain had . per cent.Prof Ramakrishnan said masks need to be treated like any other item of clothing and added that we need to get used to wearing them.Speaking on BBC Radio ’s Today programme this week, he added: I think what we would like for the Government is to be a bit stronger and clearer about the messaging and require it whenever you are in crowded public spaces where you cannot get more than two metres away from the next person.If youre in a crowded setting, you ought to wear a mask.He said outdoors was less of a problem for transmission and that mask-wearing was largely required in indoor settings.Charities have also warned that there are exemptions to the rules and said that not everyone is physically able to wear a mask or covering.The government previously released guides on how to make coverings at home from old t-shirts.Downing Street stressed the need for people to wear face coverings properly, covering both the nose and mouth and a spokesperson for the Prime Minister said a wider roll out is always under reviewWe have been very clear about the benefits of people wearing face coverings.Face coverings can help us protect others and reduce the spread of the viruspeople are infected but not showing symptoms.Highlighting the correct way to wear a mask they added: Covid- is a respiratory disease.

She’s delightful company and easy on the eye. Also, I’m not sure she’s a witch. We could do a drowning test first. Thoughts  PS: I have a pool.”Depp continues the shocking rhetoric, adding: Let’s drown her before we burn her. I will f*** her burnt corpse afterwards to make sure she’s dead.”Bettany then replies: “My thoughts entirely. Let’s be certain before we pronounce her a witch.”Grilled about the exchange today, Depp admitted it wasnt the most respectful way to talk about the actress.But he said Heard was very aggressive and quite insulting about my use of alcohol or cocaine.Depp added: She was constantly harping on about things that didn’t exist. She didn’t like me using alcohol or drugs because she had some delusional idea that they turned me into a monster.”He is continuing his evidence after making a string of shocking revelations when he took to the stand yesterday.Among the explosive new claims made in court today was that Depp slapped Heard three times in a drunken rage after she mocked him for his wino forever tattoo.It originally read Winona Forever - but Depp changed it to Wino Forever after he split up with his Edward Scissorhands co-star as it seemed fitting.But he is said to have slapped Heard three times after he had fallen off the wagon following  days sobriety.Sasha Wass QC, representing The Sun, said today: You became frustrated with Ms Heard’s mocking and you slapped Ms Heard across the face in March .“It was the first time you had used violence against her. You slapped her more than once because she didn’t react at first and that made you even more angry.”Depp replied: “It’s not true. It didn’t happen. That is patently untrue.”Ms Wass continued: “It was an outburst of anger on your part and you came to your senses and broke down. You started crying and apologising and said you wouldn’t hit her again.Depp said: “I’m sorry but that’s not the truth. You are mistaken. I did not hit Ms Heard.”The court was also told how Depp was meant to be filming a documentary about The Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards the next day when he started snorting more and more lines of cocaine.Heard, who had obviously been crying, and her sister Whitney Henriquez tried for four hours to get Depp to make his way to the set but he refused to leave, it was claimed.Whitney claimed when she arrived at the home the next morning, Depp had been downing whiskey and there was broken glass and cigarette butts littering the floor.The court was read extracts of text messages between the pair after they first started dating in March .One written by Depp reads: Just thought you should know, there exists a book entitled Disco Bloodbath. That is all.Heard replies: We need that book… is it about last Friday night by any chance Depp then asks how she can make him smile at such a hideous moment, before ending the message: I f***ing love you, you c***.Just days before the exchange, Heard claims Depp hit her several times after an argument about a painting by her ex-partner, Tasya van Ree, which was hanging in her bedroom, it was said.He was accused of becoming obsessed with the idea Heard was having an affair with her ex-girlfriend and denied he tried to remove the artwork and set fire to it.His jealousy was referred to again when Depp allegedly trashed a trailer in a drug-fuelled rage when one of Heards pals touched her sexually.Ms Wass said: You started to get angry, the monster joined the party and you took exception to a woman who was in your group called Kelly Sue.You actually became extremely angry with Kelly Sue and became quite unpleasant, shouting at her and eventually saying to her, do you know how much pressure it would take to break your wrist But Depp fired back: I removed Miss Kelly Sues hand from Ms Heards body and told her not to do that.Ms Wass also referred to an incident where Depp held Heards tiny Yorkshire terrier out a car window and began making howling noises.He was said to have later laughed at a running joke about putting the pooch in a microwave.The barrister said: When you were in the car, you were smoking and you opened the window and you were angry and you were aggressive, rather like you were in that clip we saw yesterday - the monster side of your character.And you took hold of Pistol and you held her out of the window and started making howling noises.The actor responded: I can say it is a very endearing image, but it is absolute utter falsity, it is fraudulent.Heard smiled as she arrived for day two of the showdown today after pulling her red bandana down for the waiting photographers.She looked smart in a black belted dress and waved as she made her way up the steps to the entrance of the court.Depp also appeared in a good mood as he beamed at the waiting crowds.The star showed off his many tattoos as he pointed up at the sky before disappearing inside the court for another day of grilling.In an email written by Heard to Depp, which was never sent, Heard told him: I just dont knowI can do this anymore. It is like Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. Half of you I love madly, and the other half scares me. I cant take him. I wish I could, but I cant. The problem is, I never really know understand which one Im dealing with until its too late.The drinking assures me that I am dealing with the monster. The abused, scared, insecure, violent little boy. I just cant tell where the line starts.Depp was yesterday accused of turning his rage and frustration on Heard, , when he failed to control his drug and alcohol abuse.He descended into physically destructive behaviour - causing him to refer to his drunken and violent persona as the monster, it was said.The revelations made in yesterdays bombshell opening:But in a series of explosive revelations Depp made during evidence yesterday, the star branded Heards abuse allegations complete lies.And he called his ex-we “calculating, sociopathic and emotionally dishonest” as he lted the lid on their tumultuous relationship.Depp told the court Heard severed his finger during a trip to Australia in  by throwing a vodka bottle at him and accused her of repeatedly punching him in the face.He also bizarrely claimed he resolved to orce the actress after finding her poo in the bed.The Hollywood wildchild also laid bare his chaotic Tinsel Town lestyle - includingmega pints of wine for breakfast and a £, monthly booze bill.Depp admitted he first took drugs aged just  - and had tried every substance known to man just three years later.He also told the court he emailed Sir Elton John to celebrate  days sober - and referred to his brain and liver resembling Mrs Thatcher.Depp has brought separate libel proceedings against Heard in the US.The couple married in LA in  after meeting on the set of comedy The Rum Diary.But they orced two years later after Heard, who donated her £.million settlement to charity, accused Depp of abuse.If you are affected by domestic abuse, please call the National Domestic Abuse Helpline on   Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

According to the National Hurricane Centre, the cyclone is forecast to continue moving rapidly before it is expected to be absorbed into a larger front over the North Atlantic today.NASA said the cyclone was officially born on July  and is the fth tropical storm of the Atlantic Ocean this hurricane season.National Hurricane Center forecaster Jack Beven said: “The cyclone is located in a region of strong southwesterly vertical wind shear, is heading for colder water, and is approaching a frontal system. This combination should lead to extratropical transition between  to  hours, and it is possible that Edouard could strengthen a little as transition occurs. After transition, the extratropical low should persist for another  hours or so before the circulation dissipates.”While the storm will be considerably less powerful by the time it reaches Britain, there will still be days of unsettled weather in the coming week.Despite a wet few days, the hot temperatures are set to begin next Sunday with the glorious weather set to take us through to July .However, before Brits are able to bask in summer sunshine, the country is expected to experience heavy downpours from Thursday.Two days of back-to-back showers are expected after the ex-storm makes its way across the Atlantic Ocean.Netweather charts expect temperatures to hit C between next Sunday and July .BBC weather maps suggest highs of C in London by Tuesday with the south set to see several days of warm and dry weather. The Met Offices long-range forecast states: Temperatures are likely to be either around or on the warmer side of average, with the warmest conditions likely in the southeast.BBC meteorologist Chris Fawkes, meanwhile, said two lumps of cloud are set to bring rain today before Edouard arrives, with no sign of the weather settling down just yet.Today, Mr Fawkes said the rain will become a little more confined to the south and will continue in pulses - light one minute and then a bit heavier.It is expected to be cloudy and murky for much of England and Wales and heavy rain is set to fall in the west later on in the day. Scotland can expect slightly brighter weather and Northern Ireland will see the odd shower. For Thursday to Saturday, rain is expected in the south but the north will see sunshine and showers.

Itaposs not the sort of thing a Tory from Southampton is likely to say. Nor an ex-Goldman Sachs banker. Nor an Oxbridge graduate. And probably not the son-in-law of a billionaire. Rishi Sunak is all those things, and yet said exactly that. If you think Keir Starmer is a Tory, then just imagine how the local Conservative Association chairwoman feels about the taxpayer buying Yeezys for the oiks.  It is perhaps an indication of how odd Boris Johnsonaposs government is that his Chancellor can announce such Corbynist measures to cheers from backbenchers and the Tory press. And itaposs not all due to the emergency socialism of the coronavirus crisis - after all, itaposs hard to imagine George Osborne, in the same situation, funding so much as a free slice of cake, never mind  cakes a head.But then, we live in a world where Prince Andrew apparently socialises with Denise Welch. Weaposre not so much through the looking glass, as dangling upside down from the light fittings while Johnny Depp calls us names.How you spend your £ voucher will say everything about you. Half a pound of white truffles, in the hope the price rises  A chest freezer, for future stockpiling  Or clothes, or food, or vinyl, or some alloys for the Fiesta But it would be a safe bet that Rishi wonapost bother to claim his, and will bother to ensure we hear about it. Because there is no better way to position yourself as the replacement for Boris Johnson, than a conspicuous display of humility. Rishi is already the most popular member of the Cabinet. He is considered by polls to be leaps and bounds ahead of the PM in his handling of the crisis, which just goes to show how little of it he handled.Rishi was not in charge of care homes when tens of thousands of residents were wilfully infected with a disease which was more likely to kill them than anyone . He was not in charge of PPE purchases or distribution. Nor was the late decision to lockdown, the continued shaking of hands, the confused and deathly public messaging, his problem.Perhaps most importantly, he has not said what Johnson did today: I take full responsibility for what has happened. But... All Rishi had to do was look competent, find the cash, and stay away from anything heaposd have to issue a non-apology for. Heaposs managed all three. Now all he has to do is wait.  He could wait for Johnson to implode, or for the inquiry, or the Russia report, or a local election wipeout. He may wait for Michael Gove to wield the blade, or to see how much of the human cost Johnson leaves on Matt Hancockaposs desk. But he probably expects enough of those things will happen inside the next  months to clear the way for a move from No Downing Street to No. There are few other contenders for the role. Jeremy Hunt, who lost out to Johnson last year, has sunk without trace. Gove is too closely linked with Johnson, and as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster was one of those giving bad advice to the PM during the crisis. Hancock, Sajid Javid and a host of other potential rivals are floundering. Rishi is the best theyaposve got. Unfortunately, much like Rishiaposs budget plans, itaposs almost certainly not going to be enough.A tiny £bn for six-month work placements on minimum wage for those aged  to  wonapost get the expected million-plus people off the dole. The minimum wage for a -year-old is just £. an hour, and a huge chunk of those facing unemployment are older, have families, or are nearing retirement. Another £bn of vouchers for green home improvements will seed jobs, but % of homes in this country have a gas-fired boiler. Insulation, or a more efficient new boiler, is an improvement, but whataposs needed is affordable, reliable hydrogen-powered boilers that generate electricity too. Theyaposre available in other countries, but in the UK thereaposs no way to get one for domestic use. Despite the government working with industry, itaposs not expected for at least a decade - £bn would speed that up considerably. But perhaps the best policy of all is £m to aposgreenapos Britainaposs below-par social housing stock with insulation, heat pumps, and double glazing. In , there were m social homes in the UK.Thataposs £ a house. Rishiaposs problem is that he is positioning himself, by spending comparitively little money, to be PM ahead of a likely second, winter wave of death, in which he would again be asked to find cash for furlough schemes, tax breaks, grants and bailouts. Heaposll need to properly fund the NHS for the first winter in a decade, compensate the pantomime industry and be held personally responsible for the tight-fistedness of Father Christmas by a generation of children.Heaposs further bedevilled by an independent Bank of England, which may vote to buy government bonds, or alter interest rates, in defiance of his wishes.And then thereaposs Keir Starmer, the most efficient , popular-in-the-polls, and purposeful Opposition leader in  years. Heaposs longer in tooth and claw than the soft-palmed, inexperienced Rishi.

The top Tory admitted the fight for the economy is only just starting as he gave a statement to Parliament today. Stamp Duty is slashed, everyone will get a restaurant discount in August, and homeowners will get £, vouchers to make their properties greener. Pubs, hotels and zoos will also be cheaper as VAT is slashed from % to % - though not on alcohol. And employers will get a £, bonus for not sacking people when the furlough scheme.   The Chancellor said: “I will never accept unemployment as an unavoidable outcome. “We haven’t done everything we’ve done so far just to step back now and say ‘job done’. “In truth, the job has only just begun.” But Labouraposs Shadow Chancellor Anneliese Dodds slammed the government for failing to extend the furlough scheme - which will end on October . Hereaposs everything you need to know from todayaposs mini-Budget. Everyone gets % off in restaurants - between Monday and Wednesday in August. And not for booze  Diners will get % off their meal at restaurants across the UK through August in a state-funded discount scheme. Eat Out to Help Out entitles every diner to a % discount, up to £ a head, at any participating restaurant, café, pub or food service establishment in the UK. The discount can be used at unlimited times, but only Monday to Wednesday, in August, and on eat-in meals including non-alcoholic drinks. You can go on multiple occasions as many times as you like - it’s just limited to £ discount per person per visit. But alcoholic drinks arenapost included. Inidual firms will register on a government website and apply to claim the money back, based on what they sell. The scheme is forecast to cost the Treasury £m. The Chancellor said it would help people find the new balance between safety and normality. The restaurants discount scheme - which can benefit , firms - is for eat-in food only and doesnapost apply to takeaways. If a sandwich shop decides to create an eat-in area i.e. put tables out, it can give the discount - but onlyyou eat in. Officials say there will be a database where people can look up participating restaurants, cafes or pubs. Guidance on the Eat Out scheme will be published on July  and the portal is due to open for firms to participate on the same day. That guidance will address whether it can be used in conjunction with other offers. Britainaposs ailing hospitality industry will be given a £.bn boost by slashing VAT from % to % on food, accommodation and attractions. The cut will come into force from July  and last until January  - making a trip to the pub or a family day out cheaper. It will apply to supplies of food and non-alcoholic drinks from restaurants, pubs, bars, cafés and similar premises across the UK. It will also apply to supplies of accommodation and admission to attractions across the UK. Further guidance is due shortly. Stamp Duty for homebuyers is being slashed - immediately  Right now there is no Stamp Duty on house purchases below £,. Today, effective immediately, the government is increasing the threshold to £,. The £.bn policy will be a temporary cut running until March  next year. The Chancellor claimed the average bill for people buying a home will fall by £,. And nearly nine of  people buying a main home this year will pay no Stamp Duty at all, he said. Unlike other measures it will benefit wealthier people - as cheaper homes had only a small Stamp Duty bill anyway. But Mr Sunak said: House prices have fallen for the first time in eight years and uncertainty abounds in the market - a market we need to be thriving. Officials said they were moved to act after Savills predicted the market would only get back to February levels by autumn . The Stamp Duty cut will take effect from midnight tonight and last until March . The rates of tax once you’re above £, stand as they were before. In other words, Stamp Duty will be charged at % on every pound from £, to £,, and %, then %, on higher amounts over that threshold. So a £, house will cost £, rather than £, in Stamp Duty. A Treasury spokesman said it was “absolutely % not the case” that the cut was brought forward because plans to do it in the autumn leaked out. The Chancellor announced a new “jobs retention bonus” in a bid to get people back off furlough and into their job. But there won’t be a cash bonus for the people on furlough themselves. Instead their employers will get a £, bonusthey bring someone back off furlough - and employ them continuously until January. To qualy, employees must be paid at least £ a month on average in each month from November to January - the equivalent of the lower earnings limit in National Insurance. If every furloughed job takes advantage of the scheme it will pay out £bn. Mr Sunak said: “Our message to business is clear -you stand by your workers, we will stand by you.” The £, bonus applies to anyone who’s previously been furloughed. More detail is expected by the end of July but full guidance is only due in the Autumn. Government officials insisted it would disproportionately help lower-paid workers keep their jobs, because £, is bigger compared to the cost of keeping them on. But it is thought thereaposs nothing legally to stop firms claiming the bonus, then making people redundant on February . But furlough is still being scrapped in October  The Chancellor stood by his decision to scrap the furlough scheme - which has subsidised more than million jobs - on October . He said “I know when furlough ends it will be a dficult moment but the scheme “cannot and should not go on forever” He said “calling for endless extensions to furlough it just as irresponsible” as ending it immediately would’ve been in June. And it“gives people  hope that it will always be possible toto the jobs they had before”, he said. If people spend longer on furlough, he said, “skills will fade” and they will “find it harder” to get new opportunities. Hundreds of thousands of young people will get six-month job placements  The package includes £billion to subsidise thousands of six-month work placements for people facing long-term unemployment.Under the “kick-start” scheme,  to -year-olds on Universal Credit will be eligible for six-month placements with the state covering % of the minimum wage for  hours a week. Bosses, who can top up wages, get a £, admin fee plus the other costs of employing someone like National Insurance. The Resolution Foundation said the scheme could help up to , young into work – but must be delivered quickly. Paul Johnson of the IFS think tank said: “There are risks of course that you will take on a  year old, and  and  year olds who you might otherwise have taken on might suffer “You might be creating jobs that are’t really jobs, pushing other people out of work. Fuller guidance is promised towards the end of July or start of August to explain how the Kickstart scheme will work. Government officials said Kickstart jobs must be genuinely new, not just replacing better-paid staff. Checks will involve checkingfirms have discussed existing or future recruitment with unions. Officials will also look at whether there have been recent redundancies,jobs were already advertised or planned to advertise, andthe posts are dferent to previous vacancies. The Chancellor pledged an extra £billion to the Department for Work and Pensionsas it doubles the number of work coaches for Universal Credit. The benefit system has been inundated with more than million claims since the start of the pandemic. The money breaks down as:£m to double the number of work coaches in Jobcentres across Britain by March  £m to expand the Work and Health Programme with additional voluntary support this autumn for those unemployed for more than three months £m to the private sector to launch a job finding support service in autumn - with one-to-one help for those unemployed for less than three months £m for the Flexible Support Fund to help claimants by removing barriers to work, such as travel expenses for attending interviews.A bonus for companies who employ trainees More than £ million is to be invested in traineeships for - year olds in response to the coronavirus crisis.Businesses offering new traineeships in England will receive a £, bonus per trainee under the £ million scheme. Firms will be paid £, to hire apprentices until January "},{"url":null,"title":"tory ex minister liam fox","story":"NewsTory ex-Minister Liam Fox lined up for World Trade Organisation jobThe former International Trade Secretary and former Defence Secretary is up for a new jobShareCommentsByMikey SmithPolitical Correspondent:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL News \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"What is really going on in politics  Get our daily email briefing straight to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The country stands on the brink of a devastating recession that would bring with it unemployment, poverty and despair. If we are to avoid that fate, the Chancellor must come up with an ambitious rescue package that works for the whole country. The promise of support to help young people find work is a welcome step. So too is the extra investment in the green economy. But there is an urgent need for action for those who stand to lose their jobs as the furlough scheme is wound down. Many of these jobs could be savedthe Chancellor kept the Job Retention Scheme for the sectors worst affected by Covid-, such as aviation, retail and hospitality. He should also use this opportunity to raise wages for our heroic key workers. And there must be more to help our high streets as they emerge from the lockdown. The Government was too slow to respond to the medical crisis. It must not make the same mistake with the economic emergency. If Mr Sunak fails to rise to the challenge, the price will be another generation blighted by unemployment and deprivation. Ban fur cruelty  There are not many industries more abhorrent than the fur trade. Fur farming has been banned in the UK since  but almost £million worth of pelts are still imported each year. Now we have left the EU, the Government can easily ban these imports. Our demand for action has the support of animal rights campaigners, opposition parties and celebrities. There is no place for fur in British shops.

One that focussed on jobs and a plan for growth, so we could start to get our economy motoring again. But what we saw didn’t match the scale of the challenge facing the country. For weeks, the government has been promising Britain a ‘New Deal’. But instead we got a Meal Deal. Take the government’s new approach to furlough. The bonus for firms bringing back staff should have been targeted at those who most need the support. Instead, it is being handed over to any business. This potentially puts billions of pounds of taxpayer cash at risk of being wasted. Or take the government’s stamp duty cut. It could have been directed at families looking to get on the housing ladder or up-size. But because what the chancellor announced was so broad, huge chunks of the money will go to landlords and second home owners in the south east and London. At a time of crisis, should this really be the focus  And weaposre still waiting for details of how proposed VAT changes will work and exactly which firms will benefit. Sadly, this is policy-making on the hoof. And it is also policy making to mask failure. The Chancellor himself admitted the other week that the key to getting customers back on the high street is giving people confidence it is safe to do so.  The reason families aren’t going out for meals is not because they are waiting for a tenner off. It’s because the government has botched its public health response. Above all, this is policy-making that isnapost properly aimed at the businesses and people that need it. Again and again, Labour have called for support to be properly targeted, because dferent parts of our economy face very dferent challenges in the months ahead. Again and again, the government has stuck to a one-size fits all approach. one that risks wasting taxpayer money and not providing the most bang for our buck.

It included a aposkickstartapos scheme to get young people into work and a scheme to protect the jobs of people ing from furlough. And there was a discount offer for meals out - as well as a VAT cut aimed at takeaways and attractions. The Chancelloraposs statement included some eye-catching initiatives but are they enough given the scale of the crisis  Here is what he said and the action he could have taken: What he said: “People need to know we will do all we can to give everyone the opportunity of good and secure work. People need to know that although hardship lies ahead, no one will be left without hope.” What is missing: The measures announced by the Chancellor amount to £billion – .% of UK GDP. By contrast France has unveiled a post-Covid stimulus worth €billionand Germany € billion– % of the countryaposs GDP. There was no additional support for the aviation, transport or automotive industries despite the large number of workers they employ. What he said: “Furlough has been a leline for millions, supporting people and businesses to protect jobs. But it cannot and should not go on forever.” “We’re introducing a new policy to reward and incentivise employers who successfully bring furloughed staff back – a new Jobs Retention Bonus.”  What is missing: Everyone accepts the furlough scheme needs to be wound down but Sunak has ignored calls for it to be extended for the sectors such as aviation and retail which have been worst hit by coronavirus. The £, payment for each furloughed worker firms keep on may not workcompanies bank the money for staff they were going to retain anyway and still make others redundant.It also creates a clf-edge when the scheme ends in January for workers in precarious jobs. A cut in National Insurance Contributions may have been more effective. What he said: “The Kickstart Scheme will directly pay employers to create new jobs for any  to -year-old at risk of long-term unemployment.  These will be decent jobs – with a minimum of  hours per week paid at least the National Minimum Wage.”  What is missing: This is a welcome announcement that is modelled on Labouraposs Job Protection Scheme axed by the Tories. The key will be ensuring these are decent jobs and making sure firms do not hire young people on the cheap, while laying off long-serving staff.What he said: “Right now, there is no stamp duty on transactions below £,. Today, I am increasing the threshold to half a million pounds.”  What is missing: Stamp duty cuts have long been a Tory priority but this temporary holiday may have only a limited impact on boosting the economy or helping people onto the housing ladder.The Office for Budget Responsibility has previously noted the main gainers from stamp duty cuts “are people who already own property, not the first-time buyers.”There was nothing in the Chancelloraposs statement on building more social housing or helping renters despite the fact that , tenants face being booted out when the Covid ban on evictions comes to an end on August . What he said: “At the moment, VAT on hospitality and tourism is charged at %.So I’ve decided, for the next six months, to cut VAT on food, accommodation and attractions.”  What is missing: The VAT cut will be welcomed by firms who have struggled during lockdown but it does not apply to retail which has been one of the worst hit sectors.Nor was there any support for businesses which remain under lockdown such as gyms, beauty salons, nightclubs, conference centres and bowling alleys.Labour fears that encouraging more people to meet in social gatherings could lead to a further spike in the virus when the Governmentaposs Test and Trace system is still not fully operational. What he said: “To get customers back into restaurants, cafes and pubs, and protect the . million people who work in them I can announce today that, for the month of August, we will give everyone in the country an Eat Out to Help Out discount.”  What is missing: The meal deal will be for just  days in August and will apply to hot food outlets, but not sandwich bars and takeaways.The bigger issue is why the Chancellor thinks it is a priority to help people eat out rather than those who cannot afford to put food on their table.The Trussell Trust, the countryaposs largest foodbank provider, has reported an % increase in demand during the pandemic, while the Office for National Statistics has found .% say they have struggled to pay their bills since the Covid crisis began.

Anxiety-ridden teenager Ellis Battersby had been missing for more than  hours when his body was found by school friend Fiona Passingham and her mum near their home, the coroner heard. The -year-old had struggled to cope after moving from the Great Marlow school to a college in Henley-on-Thames and as his exams drew closer he disappeared following a regular day in class. In a statement, Fiona said: I often gave Ellis a lt to school. On February  I had been out with my family celebrating my mumaposs birthday when Tommessaged me askingI had seen Ellis. I said I had not because I did not go to college on Wednesdays. At .am, police knocked on my door and told me they had found a suicide note which had my name in it. I was so worried about Ellis that at .am we went out to search for him in his favourite spots. It was cold and snowing, I expected to see him huddled in the corner shivering. We saw Ellis from afar and it looked like he was standing. The coroner heard that in , Dr Samantha Watts - a GP from Marlow Medical Group - confirmed that Ellis was diagnosed with autistic spectrum disorder and anxiety. In his last appointment in September , Ellis had explained he was increasingly anxious following his move to Henley College but was still meeting his friends on Fridays and speaking to them online. Dr Watts said: Ellis was a young man whose autistic spectrum disorder and with anxiety was exacerbated by school and exams, despite support. His state much improved at the end of exams in .  During the Buckinghamshire inquest, coroner Crispin Butler heard from Henley College counsellor Emma Holmes who had supported the schoolboy since the move. Ellis had a safe space to go to when he found lessons dficult. He had support from a teaching assistant and to one-to-one sessions with me. We did not have concerns for his safety. However, Ellis did not feel he would be able to get a job, learn to drive or be independent.

Steven Platt says ordinary soldiers see their pay skyrocket when they join private outfits, turning many into aposweekend millionairesapos. The -year-old, from Barry, Wales, joined the British Army at  and served in Bosnia, Northern Ireland and Iraq, before becoming a aposgun for hireapos. The former Welsh Guardsman, dubbed the aposbaby assassinapos by his old Army pals due to his youthful appearance, now runs a private military company . He decided to join a PMC after seeing how mercenaries in Iraq were better equipped than British troops. Steven told MirrorOnline: I finished my six months thereand flew back with a PMC. I was getting maybe £, a month in the Army, with the company I made £, a month. Initially the motivation was money. Any mercenary who tells you heaposs got a moral obligation is full of s***. You have a job, there is no right and wrong. You travel across the world and get the best of everything. You basically live like a rockstar. But it comes with huge risks. Despite the incredible pay, Steven saw his colleagues aposlosing arms and fingersapos in improvised explosive deviceblasts and complained about the poor kit he was provided with. He said he used aposhideousapos weapons and drove Ford pick-up trucks with only clip-on armour for protection while carrying out security convoys.  Steven explained: We were hit with IEDs and drive-by shootings. In the Army I hardly discharged my weapon. As a mercenary I discharged it constantly. After surviving a few aposnasty incidentsapos with the Iraqi police and Shia militias, Steven joined a new firm called Erinys in , which he had encountered while serving in Iraq.  During this time he was paid an £,-a-month wage to escort US diplomats. He said: The camaraderie was great. We had BBQs at night and beers. My team was mainly South Africans, as a Welshman we had a bond over rugby. The mercenary saved money to provide for his newborn son, although he admitted many of his colleagues indulged in lavish lestyles. He said these contractors were nicknamed aposweekend millionairesapos, known for spending all of their money during breaks from work.  Steven added: The industry had loads of aposweekend millionairesapos. Lads who would spend their wages within the first few days of leave and then struggle to pay rent or eat. These were predominantly “younger” guys who had families or commintments. Over a period of two to three days, they would blow all their cash on anything and everything, ranging from expensive cars, nights on the p**s, women, you name it. Lads would waste all their money then end up cutting their leave short toto Iraq. We were doing three months in the country and then a month off and I could never understand how they could get through so much money in such a short space of time. Steven claims that while people in his industry are primarily motivated by money, there are still aposgoodapos and aposbadapos mercenaries.  He added: We are just normal people, we do work for money but we are not all bad. There’s the aposgood guysapos who work with ious governments, agencies and organisations. They help maintain and support national security of many nations. Then we have the aposbad guysapos who provide ious services to drug cartels and work with organised crime syndicates. The drugs trade in Myanmar and Latin America has been flooded by PMCs.  Although Steven was initially motivated by money, he believes PMCs are crucial for maintaining peace.  After years as a contractor on land, Steven started working as a freelancer on ships, defending them from Somali pirates.

I was taught to respect people of all races, and I will take the time to reflect on my actions and work to better understand the inequality that so many of those around me face every day.His outburst came as racial isions burn in the US remain high following the death of George Floyd and the coronavirus pandemic.  But Lofthouse continues. You f***ing Asian piece of s**t, he shouts before turning to the waitress and saying: Who are these f***ers  She snaps but: They are valued guests. Lofthouse, himself an immigrant in the States, replies: Are they  They are valued guests in America  Chan later wrote on Instagram, the white supremacist Brit had begun harassing her family soon after they sang happy birthday to her aunt.Aside from the racist comments caught on camera, she said he also told them to go back to whatever fucking Asian country youaposre from and that you donapost belong here.

The woman was horried to find the grub after attempting to clean the machine out. This week the coffee chain has opened an additional , cafes across the country after the relaxing of lockdown. However the barista - who wishes to remain anonymous - hopes the machines stay clean, so there are no other problems with creepy crawlies. I feel so guilty when I found the maggot, the worker revealed. Customers think highly of Costa, they pay a lot of money for the coffee. Theyaposre not always getting a proper coffee from a clean machine. She says she found the maggot when working at a store in Wakefield, West Yorkshire. The woman, who has worked for Costa for more than three years, was concerned about the number of flies hovering around near the coffee machine.  This was quite unusual as there is nothing sweet around there, the woman explained. Staff are supposed to take apart the machine and clean it thoroughly at the end of the day, but this wouldnapost always happen. So the barista decided to give the high-spec coffee machine a thorough wash. I found there were really mucky bits on the side, the woman revealed.  I got a kne to scrape out the side, and out came all these maggots. The revolting footage shows the maggot crawling around amongst the coffee grounds. Itaposs making me cringe now, she said. I was about to vomit. Weaposre using this machine for peopleaposs coffees, that is a health and safety hazard.  The woman explained she told her area manager who said they should keep the incident - which happened in September - under wraps. She chose to come forward as Costa Coffee shops are beginning to reopen as a warning. The cafe has had to adapt to social distancing guidelines.

Stacey Matthews, , mistook her cancer for a bad back caused by her mattress - and brushed off her worries. The Blackpool mum eventually plucked up the courage to go to hospital, where an MRI scan revealed the cancer had spread to her left lung, liver, groin and spine. Further investigations also revealed Stacey had a lump in her left breast. Stacey started chemotherapy immediately in a bid to prolong her le, but after two rounds she was given the devastating news it was too late for the treatment to work and she has just weeks to live. Heartbroken at the thought of not making it to December, Stacey told family members she wanted just one last Christmas with her children Caitlan, , Byron, , Chardanai, , and Lilly, six. Local charity The Albert Project, founded by Wayne Sanderson, heard about Staceyaposs last wish and got to work immediately. They sourced donations of presents, Christmas decorations, a turkey, pigs in blankets, Christmas crackers and games from Morrisons supermarket. Other locals and businesses rallied around to give Staceyaposs last Christmas one to remember - decorating the house with lights, tinsel, and Christmas trees.  Staceyaposs four children had no idea about the plans until they arrived home to find the house transformed into a Christmas grotto and presents piled up in the living room. Full-time mum Stacey said: When the consultant told me the chemotherapy wasnapost working and I didnapost have long left, the first thing I thought about was Christmas. Christmas is a big deal in our house, having four children means itaposs always a day filled with so much happiness, and I knew I just wanted one more Christmas Day with the kids - evenitaposs in the middle of summer. My family appealed to the Albert Project and within a matter of days we were sent presents, decorations, cakes and sweets. It was just overwhelming. Iaposve been honest with the children about my diagnosis. They know I havenapost got long left and we have had some sad days, but weaposre trying to make every day a happy day from now on. I want them to have happy memories of our last few weeks together.  Seeing the kidsapos faces when they came home and found Christmas Day in the middle of summer is something I will never forget. The look on their faces was amazing, but it was very emotional at times too. At one point Lilly asked why we were having Christmas Day, and I had to tell her it was because mummy didnapost have long left and I might not be here at Christmas. It was so hard having to tell her again and the realisation hitting me. We cried a lot. Despite suffering from back pain for weeks, Stacey never thought it was anything serious and was reluctant to visit the hospital due to the virus epidemic.Stacey said: I had back pain for weeks, but I was worried about going to hospital because of coronavirus.I didnapost think it was anything serious at first, I just put it down to my bed or my mattress. I thought I might be sleeping funny, or I thought it might be something to do with my periods, but it turned out the cancer had basically crushed my spine. Iaposd also been sick quite a lot, I couldnapost keep anything down and I lost about a stone in weight, but I didnapost put two and two together. I thought I just had a stomach bug. The thought of cancer didnapost cross my mind.  By the time I went to hospital I was in agony. The consultant told me the cancer had spread and my spinal wall had collapsed, and I was given strong pain medication straightaway, and soon after I started chemotherapy and radiotherapy, but it was too late. Wayne Sanderson, from The Albert Project, said: As soon as we heard about Stacey and her family we wanted to do everything we could to help them. Under normal circumstances we are a homeless charity, but during the coronavirus crisis we have adapted to help anyone in need, and weaposve built up some amazing contacts in the local area, so we knew we could give Stacey and her family the Christmas Day they deserve in such heartbreaking circumstances.

Gemma Hart, , might be self-taught but when she baked an incredible Heinz baked beans tin for her th wedding anniversary with hubby Chris, , daughter Lilia, eight, asked for a slice aposwithout the bean juiceapos. The mum-of-two spent eight hours baking and icing the iconic food container, which was a cherry bakewell-flavoured cake, using inidual bits of icing for the beans. To ensure her little slice of heaven looked as realistic as possible, Gemma - who runs From the Hart Cake Creations - used piping gel and a little food colouring for the controversial sauce. Gemma, from Renishaw, Derbys, said: Theyaposre so realistic, so it can still trick your mind a bit. I got some aposbean juiceapos on my finger and instinctively went to lick it off but stopped because I instinctively thought aposewapos. In reality it was just piping gel with some food colouring in it. Even Lilia asked for a slice without the juice part because she didnapost want that. The beans were made out of inidual icing and then they were airbrushed. Fortunately it was a cherry bakewell cake so it didnapost taste like beans. I made the baked bean cake to celebrate me and Chris being married for  years. Your tenth anniversary is tin, which I thought was a bit rubbish, so I decided to try something a bit funny. Gemma started baking when her eldest daughter, Melody, , was born as she wanted to make birthday cakes for her own children. At first it was only a hobby, but once other mums saw her designs for her own children they asked her to make cakes for them and four years ago Gemma went full time. Aside from making the usual wedding cakes and superhero cakes for kidsapos birthdays, Gemma has made some mind-bending bakes for special occasions. Gemma said: I made a chicken nugget cake for my niece because she was a fussy eater and they were all she would eat, so that was a bit of a running joke. I made a chicken sandwich for a mum in my daughteraposs school as her son had been missing McDonaldaposs so much during lockdown she asked for that for him. I do love doing something dferent. I really enjoy it when commissions give you some room to work with. Itaposs nice to have more artistic license, especially when you get an illusion from it.  The baked beans cake took eight hours in total, it was pretty straight forward. The reaction to it has been fantastic. I had one lady message me saying she thought I was going to cut my finger on the lid of the tin because it looked so realistic. When you see stuff as often as I do, you just get used to things not looking like they do. Itaposs been fantastic getting that reaction though.

They then engaged in aposgrotesque and celebratoryapos conversations, with the -year-old boasting - untruthfully - about having a pregnant girlfriend, saying he would have his own child aposto play withapos and would aposlove to have a go at a babyapos. At one stage in the legal proceedings, a shocked Judge Julian Smith was heard to exclaim aposGood Lordapos on learning the detail of one horric abuse video shared among the perverts online. The explicit chatlogs came to light in , four years after Cumberland had been jailed for a year for causing or inciting a child under  to engage in sexual activity, and possessing indecent images of children. However, he was released by Kent Police under investigation and it was not until February  when he sent images of his penis to an undercover officer posing as a -year-old boy that he was re-arrested and charged. Cumberland subsequently admitted arranging or facilitating the commission of a child sex offence, breach of a sexual offences prevention order, attempting to sexually communicate with a child, and  offences of distributing indecent images of a child. Jailing him on Tuesday at Maidstone Crown Court, Kent, Judge Smith said he aposnegotiatedapos his planned abuse of the girls with their father, and then aposshowed off and rejoicedapos with other paedophiles that they were to be his victims. He concluded that Cumberland posed such a danger that he will have to serve at least two-thirds of his prison term rather than being released automatically at the halfway stage.  Under what is known as an extended sentence, he will also have a further four years added to any time spent on licence. Cumberland, now living in Caersws in Powys, Wales, denied a further eight distribution charges which were ordered by the judge to be left on file. He told the paedophile: This was not idle chat, it was not spontaneous or mere fantastical discussions. These girls were real and you were involved in planning their rape with their father. The contents of the chatlogs with those of a like mind are deeply disturbing and speak in the most graphic terms of what you and they were looking for. You shared images of these young girls expressing your wish, your hope and your expectation that you would be able to abuse them with their fatheraposs permission. Your intentions were very clear, very graphic and vile. You were rejoicing in the fact they were to be your victims. The court heard that the plot with the childrenaposs father was hatched after he sent Cumberland images of them being abused via a chatroom conversation. The man articulated the sexual act he had performed on his daughter and sent images, said prosecutor Rio Pahlavanpour. Attempts were then made to meet up. There was talk of the victims being drugged or given alcohol. The defendant even asked what type of drugs and whether they could be obtained from Boots. He was quite clear as to what acts he wanted to perform. The chatlogs between Cumberland and other paedophiles included references to wanting to rape a young boy and a baby, which Cumberland said would be aposso goodapos.

Venetia Murrayaposs brotheraposs will, which was lost for two decades, was discovered when the cat bumped into documents in her lawyeraposs office. The feline had perfect timing - as the papers that would ultimately bring a decades-long family feud to an end were among a pile destined for a date with a shredder. The long-running legal battle began with a squabble over the siblingsapos late grandfatheraposs £million Hertfordshire farm. Dean Brunt, his brother Dale and sister Venetia, , had between them owned Ettridge Farm. When Dean died in a railway accident in  aged just  a row was sparked over the ownership of the property. Dean was thought to have died without making a will, so his £millon share of the farm went to his -year-old mum. Marlene Brunt in turn handed it to her eldest child, Dale, . But after Venetia discovered the existence of two wills made by her brother in , a family feud was sparked. Venetia and her uncle Bob Wrangle took up arms against Dale and the siblingsapos mum. One of the wills formed crucial evidence of Deanaposs intention to give his sister half his wealth, according to lawyers. But it was unearthed when a solicitoraposs cat knocked over a pile of papers which were about to be shredded. At the High Court in London this week, Judge Paul Teverson this week rejected claims by Dale and his mum that the wills were forged. Judge Teverson ruled that Venetia will get half of Deanaposs share of the farm.  The court heard that the three siblings inherited the farm, at Broxbourne, from their grandfather Arthur Nicholls, who had bought it with his earnings as a prize fighter. He died in . Arthur was Deanaposs hero and it was his grandfather who persuaded him to train as mechanic. Deanaposs own father, a jockey and racehorse trainer, played no part in his upbringing, the judge said. Dean, who the judge said was the gentler of the two brothers, had been starved of oxygen at birth and was thought to have suffered from learning dficulties and mental health issues in later le. A coroner ed an accidental death verdict after his body was found on a railway line near Sawbridgeworth, Herts, in . Following his death, his mum Marlene obtained letters of administration over his estate on the basis that he had died an intestate batchelor, without having made a valid will and with no children of his own.  She inherited his share of the farm and passed on that share to Dale, meaning he then owned two thirds of the land and business, which is estimated to be worth £m, and Venetia the rest. But the family fell out, with Venetia, who lives in a house on the family land, accusing her brother Dale of bullying her out of running the business and treating their -year-old uncle Winston aposBobapos Wrangle badly by trying to force him from his home, which is also on the farm. Venetia told the court she had assumed that, after Deanaposs death, she and Dale were joint owners of the farm and business partnership. And she was shocked when, nearly a decade later, her mum revealed that it was she who inherited Deanaposs share because he had not made a will, and then given it all to Dale. Then in , Deanaposs former legal adviser Howard Day discovered what he said was Deanaposs final will among his files, which backed Venetiaaposs claim to half the £m. Mr Wrangle, who helped bring up Venetia and was close to the family, took the case to court after the discovery of the will signed on Deanaposs behalf by Mr Day.  Dale and Marlene claimed that document was a forgery, made after Deanaposs death. Mr Day died last year before the issue could be settled. But the court heard that in February this year a second will in the same terms was unwittingly discovered by the solicitoraposs cat among the pile of Mr Dayaposs documents waiting to be shredded. Barrister Duncan Macpherson, for Mr Wrangle, told how the crucial second will was discovered following Mr Dayaposs death and only weeks before the case was due in court. Papers relating to disputes within the family had been sent from Mr Dayaposs office to the office of Mr Wrangleaposs solicitor, Katy Sillett, in London. Mrs Sillett was organising the papers and had piled up un-needed duplicate copies ready to be destroyed, Mr Macpherson told the judge. Her cat knocked over the papers for shredding, he continued.  When Mrs Sillett picked them up, she realised that what she believed was a duplicate will was in fact an original. Mr Macpherson said it was agreed that the second will was written at the same time as the first and so it was crucial evidence in support of the authenticity of both. It had a more steady-handed signature than the other document, which weakened claims from Dale and his mum that they were forgeries. Under the two identical wills, Dale and Venetia would share Deanaposs £m slice of the farm, rather than Dale taking it all as he ultimately wouldhis brother had died intestate. However, Dale and his mum claimed that the documents, both dated , were not valid and that they suspected they had actually been made years later after Deanaposs death. Mr Day had signed the wills on Deanaposs behalf, the court was told, but the signature on the first document to be found was unsteady. That suggested that it had been signed years later when Mr Day was less firm. Although experts said there was evidence both may have been written later, the signature on the second document found due to the cat was more steady-handed and more similar to examples of Mr Dayaposs signature of the late s. Ruling in favour of the wills, Judge Teverson said there was a substantial amount of evidence that Dean had talked in the late s about having made a will. He had told friends he had done what his grandfather would have wanted, leaving his share of the farm to his brother and sister, with his mum getting nothing. And the judge rejected the suggestions that Mr Dayaposs notes of the time when the wills were made were part of an elaborate fraud. The judge said he had no doubt but that Mr Wrangle genuinely believes Dean left behind a will and said Venetia was an impressive witness who had been genuinely shocked to learn she had not inherited Deanaposs share of the farm. I do not think she would for one moment associate herself with a fraudulent claim, he said. However, Dale appeared to be intent principally on arguing his and Marleneaposs case and his mother was a most unimpressive witness, he continued. She and Dale had deliberately kept Venetia and Mr Wrangle in the dark about Dean having died intestate and his share having gone to Dale, he found. I heard and saw Marlene give evidence. She denied ever having seen the will when a copy of it was shown to her. Her evidence then shted to saying that the document was Howardaposs will and not Deanaposs will. The court must have sympathy for and respect her grief at the loss of her son. That cannot however justy concealing from her family apart from Dale that Deanaposs estate was being administered under intestacy, which I find that she did. He said the most likely explanation was that Marlene knew there was a will, but chose not to reveal it after her sonaposs death because she thought it was not Deanaposs will but a will done by Howard Day.

The cyclone continues to travel through the Atlantic Ocean and is expected to reach the UK by Thursday - only adding to the deluge of downpours for Brits. But by the weekend, things looks to improve for the country, with summery conditions expected. In fact, temperatures are expected to reach C in some parts.A Met Office spokesperson said: There is a change in the weather into the weekend and next week.There is a better chance of seeing drier and warmer weather coming. From Saturday warmer there will be a warmer spell of weather than what we have seen for the last week. For the weekend, England and Wales is looking dry and there will be spells of sunshine. The warmest of the weather will be in London and the south east, with temperatures reaching C C. And the settled weather looks set to remain for next week for many. Going forward, high pressure looks to continue next week, the spokesperson continued. On the whole, England and Wales is looking largely settled, with temperatures in the mid-s in the sunshine. It is too early to tellit will be a heatwave.  But further north there is a risk of rain. The Met Office long range weather forecast from next Monday reads: Through the majority of this period, it will be mostly dry and settled for many areas, especially in the south of the UK. More unsettled conditions with spells of rain and strong winds may affect the north and northwest at times. These unsettled conditions could spread to other parts of the UK later in this period, but widespread unsettled conditions are unlikely.

A study of , adults found women spend an average of almost two hours-a-day feeling worried or stressed, with two thirds of this time spent feeling anxious about other people rather than themselves. In comparison, men spend just an hour-and-a-half worrying each day, with almost one in  admitting none of that time is spent thinking of others. Almost two thirdsof women have periods where they feel constantly worried, with whataposs going on in the world at the moment - including the pandemic, protests and fears about the economy - the biggest concern. But the health of loved ones, their familyaposs safety and needing to care for older parents is also causing them to feel stressed. It also emerged women are around twice as likely to worry about their childrenaposs or grandchildrenaposs diets, health, education and future than men are. Worryingly,  per cent of those polled, by supplement brand Healthspan, admitted this leads to them neglecting their own health over fears about how it would affect their family. And a staggering  per cent of women have dismissed worrying health symptoms, simply putting them down to stress or tiredness instead. Chartered psychologist Dr Meg Arroll, on behalf of Healthspan, said: Because womenaposs stress response is all about the apostend-and-befriendapos, rather than the classic fight-or-flight, women will quite naturally worry about their loved ones. Womenaposs role in our speciesapos survival is to take care of others, so when thereaposs constant disturbing news headlines, competing caring responsibilities or concerns over putting food on the table, itaposs not surprising that stress levels skyrocket.  Managing all these competing demands often results in high levels of stress which exhibits itself in behaviours such as comfort eating, poor sleep and anxiety. This is why self-care is so very important - remember the old adage put your oxygen mask on first before helping others. This can be achieved by managing stress through techniques such as relaxation exercises and spending time in nature, eating well and adhering to a regular sleep routine. Thereaposs growing evidence that products which include CBDoil may help to tackle anxiety-related disorders, which impact our ability to fall and stay asleep. In addition, self-care treats like bath salts which include magnesium can boost levels of this depleted mineral during stressful times, plus ious non habit-forming sleep aids such as Valerian and HTP should be considered when dealing with poor sleep.

Letourneau - who died from cancer on Monday reportedly with her victim at her bedside - was teaching second grade at Shorewood Elementary School in Seattle when she began a sexual relationship with her student Vili Fualaa in . He was just  or  years old and she was  at the time, married and with four children. They were discovered by police together in a car in the early hours of June ,  but they both gave  names and Letourneau told officers Fualaa was . Letourneau later changed her story, saying she had been babysitting the boy but took him out after she and her husband had a fight. They got away with it and Fualaaaposs mother told police not to take any further action. However the boyaposs mum later said thatpolice had told her Letourneau had lied about his age and what had happened in the car, she would not have allowed her son to go back to the teacher. In March of the following year the teacher was arrested when a relative of her husband contacted police. Letourneau pleaded guilty to two counts of second-degree child rape and her first child with Fualaa was born in May  as she awaited sentencing. The disgraced teacher was able to negotiate a plea agreement where she would serve six months, three suspended, in county jail. But the agreement stipulated she could not contact Fualaa, her four children with her first husband or her most recent baby she had conceived with Fualaa. Just two weeks after completing her jail sentence, in February , Letourneau was again found by police in car with Fualaa. Once again she tried to lie her way out of trouble with police who found evidence the two had met several times since her release, ,   in cash, baby clothes and her passport inside the car. Her prior plea agreement was revoked and replaced with a sentence of seven and a half years. In October , while serving her second stint in jail, Letourneau gave birth to her second daughter by Fualaau. That year the aposcoupleapos - Fualaau was still just  - co-authored a book published in France called Only One Crime, Love. While imprisoned for child rape in May , she orced her husband, and he gained custody of their four children. Letourneau served six months in solitary when letters she tried to send to Fualaau were intercepted. In  a television film was released in America called: All-American Girl: The Mary Kay Letourneau Story. She was released in August  and Fualaau, then , persuaded the court to reverse the no-contact order against her.They married in May the following year with aposexclusive accessapos sold to television show Entertainment Tonight. In an interview Letourneau claimed she did not know having sex with Fualaau was a crime and that they had deliberately waited until the end of the school year. She said: If someone had told me,anyone had told me, there is a specic law that says this is a crime I did not know.Iaposve said this over and over again. Had Iaposd known,anyone knows my personality. Just the idea, this would count as a crime. Fualaau filed for orce in May  it was later withdrawn but the orce was finalised in August .  During their relationship Fualaau had insisted their relationship was not abusive.However since their separation a source is reported to have told People : Heaposs starting to get some perspective.He sees things clearly now, and realizes that this wasnapost a healthy relationship from the start. After the split, he started really going over things in his mind, the insider told People. Just thinking about how they met, and how that affected how they interacted as adults. He was never really a full-fledged partner he was always secondary. He sees that now. Letourneau died earlier this week after several months battling colon cancer.

Moaca, an -month-old street dog from Romania, was only a few months old when she was struck by a train and left for dead. The poor pups face took the full force of the train, causing her to lose her snout, as well as a toe on one of her paws. The German shepherd and husky mix was found in the nick of time and rushed to surgery by the Nomad Vet Association who managed to save her le during a five-hour touch and go operation. However, she was left without a snout. The charity feared that she would not survive the harsh Romanian winter.Luckily for Moaca her story was uploaded online which immediately drew a kind-hearted soul who wanted to give her a loving home Joel Wareman, -year-old, from Zoetermeer in the Netherlands, said: “I found Moaca on an online Marketplace.” “To be very honest when I first saw her pictures I had to laugh and I thought what kind of a pug is this” “Then I read her story and I burst into tears because I had ridiculed her” “Her story was so sad and I immediately messaged the site telling them that I had to have her” “I had contact with a Dutch spokesperson online and he arranged the transport from Romania to Holland” “It was a smooth process and she arrived two and a half weeks later and we got to celebrate Christmas and New years eve together.”  “Moaca is the first dog I have rescued.” Despite her horric start in le, Moaca, meaning “little face” in Romanian, is not in pain although her injuries make certain tasks more dficult. “She makes a lot of mess when she eats and drinks and she can’t pick up little things but she can do everything ” Joel tell us.Joel has been fundraising on her own website Moacale in the hopes of getting a prosthetic snout for Moaca and to raise money for the charity that ultimately saved her le.“I have a lot of contact with her rescuers and I always send them pictures and videos and sometimes they come to visit her.

The young boy claims heaposs been seeing a strange lady in his room each night - and she makes a rather bizarre request.The childaposs grandma is so concerned about the tales of the ghostly figure that sheaposs even written into an advice column for some help on what to do next. In a letter to slateaposs Dear Care and Feeding, titled My Grandson Is Visited by a Spooky Lady Every Night, the unnamed woman explained all and we have to admit, the whole thing does sound like something from a scary movie.She wrote: My .-year-old grandson has been having a recurring nightmare for the past week and a half. He wakes up very upset saying there is a lady in his room. When askedshe talks to him and why he thinks she is there, he says that she has to get something from his room, and she wants to put something on his foot. He is afraid to go to bed. My daughter is in the process of potty training him, and he also has a new sister . I know that these le changes can cause children to have nightmares, and I understand that imagination is vivid at this age. However, this just seems so specic and kind of creepy. She adds that the family are at a loss over how to handle the situation. The agony aunt replies, stating that a week and a half isnapost a tremendously long period of time for a recurring nightmare, so the family should see how it goes for a while and possibly put the breaks on potty training for now. Additionally, the writer suggests trying all the common nightmare remedies - such as sleeping with a night light and using a weird lady spray that renders any weird ladies harmless. If all  fails, they recommend buying a nanny cam so we can all see the ghost.

Images of Edouard from space show it gathering pace and growing as it northeasrward. According to the National Hurricane Centre, the cyclone is forecast to continue moving rapidly before it is expected to be absorbed into a larger front over the North Atlantic today. NASA said the cyclone was officially born on July  and is the fth tropical storm of the Atlantic Ocean this hurricane season. National Hurricane Center forecaster Jack Beven noted, “The cyclone is located in a region of strong southwesterly vertical wind shear, is heading for colder water, and is approaching a frontal system.  This combination should lead to extratropical transition between  to  hours, and it is possible that Edouard could strengthen a little as transition occurs.  After transition, the extratropical low should persist for another  hours or so before the circulation dissipates.” While Edouard will considerably be less powerful by the time it hits Britain, forecasters are warning of plenty of unsettled weather to come.Met Office forecaster Aidan McGivern said the worst of the weather will be seen in Wales before the weekend with mm plus in some of the more exposed spots.Temperatures once again held back because of the cloud and outbreaks of rain, he continued. National Resources Wales has placed two flood alerts in place, as a result. BBC meteorologist Tomascz Schafernaker agreed Britain is going to be left particularly soggy with outbreaks of rain to hang around for  hours or so. However, he said the weekendaposs looking pretty good with lots of warm sunshine on the way - and some forecasters predict the UK could see seven days of heat next week.

We’d been taking bookings on the phone during lockdown but at % of normal levels.“On the first day open we were exceptionally busy. We had four desks operating at the branch and had to call on extra help to cope with the numbers coming in.“In that first week we took as much bookings as the Thomas Cook branch did in the whole of July last year.”By far the favourite destination for Dundee holidaymakers was Spain, he revealed, followed by the Canary Islands and Turkey.With air travel rules yet to be finalised in Scotland, customers were prepared to fly from Newcastle and Manchester airports to guarantee a holiday abroad.England has lted quarantine restrictions for holidaymakers travelling to a list of  ‘air bridged’ countries, but Nicola Sturgeon branded the plan ‘shambolic’.Scottish airport bosses this week called for clarity “as soon as possible” to prevent further job losses and allow routes to be re-established.John commented: “We’re just awaiting an announcement from Nicola Sturgeon which we expect will bring another upturn in demand.#He added: “I’ve been in the travel industry for  years and been through the twin towers, wars in the Middle East – so many global events – but one thing is for certain, the tourism industry is resilient.”While most travel agent branches are now open for business in Dundee, Barrhead Travel – which announced redundancies this week – is currently closed.A spokeswoman for the Glasgow-based firm told the Tele the Dundee branch is expected to open again in the next fortnight.She added: “Our commitment to supporting our customers is not affected by this announcement – we have teams still working remotely and we’re contacting all customers who have bookings affected by Covid- disruptions.“We can assure all of our customers that their holidays remain fully financially protected.”The firm – which employs  staff in  branches throughout Scotland – said the dficult decision to make staff redundant came as a direct result of the impact of Covid-.Jacqueline Dobson, president of Barrhead Travel, said: “Customer confidence has been dented by the ongoing uncertainty surrounding quarantine and travel restrictions.#This, combined with the imminent closure of the furlough scheme, means we have had to announce a number of redundancies.“We will be ensuring that there is full support available for all our colleagues – personally and professionally – over the coming months.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

This is a challenging operational environment for our aircrew and an extremely dficult period for our fundraising teams as the restrictions are preventing all the events, talks and activities taking place which are so essential to help support the country#s only charity-funded helicopter air ambulance service.It costs around £ million each year to fund our Perth and Aberdeen-based helicopter air ambulances. Every penny needed to keep these two lesavers in the air seven days a week,  days a year, is donated by the people of Scotland. We receive no statutory government funding.Yet, as I reflect on how the Scottish public has risen to every request we have made of them over the past seven years, I feel confident they will not abandon #The People#s Helicopter# at this particular time of need.Please support SCAAyou can and help us celebrate the seventh anniversary of this lesaving service # your service.John Bullough, Chairman, Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance, Perth Airport.Sir,Volunteers are always important.

But the COVID- lockdown interrupted proceedings.This season’s Scottish Cup was a bit of a disappointment with Star exiting the competition in the second round after losing out to a vastly improved Dumbarton United side -. On the plus side, the first round saw Star take on Paisley League team Pollok FC and an excellent performance saw Star run out convincing winners -, one of only four defeats suffered by Pollok in all competitions.In the West Region Cup, Star progressed to the quarter-final again. A first round bye, a convincing - win against Cambuslang FA then a walkover saw the Lochgilphead youths face Paisley League A Division team Erskine.In a hard-fought encounter, Star matched Erskine for most of the game but with only  players available they couldn’t get the breakthrough they needed and eventually lost -.Star started their league campaign in September with a competitive match against new team Thorn, who transferred from Paisley A Division. Star lost -.Two strong performances in October saw Star record  a terric - win over Shettleston, last season’s league runners up, and a - win against St Patrick’s Sports Academy # an entertaining but nerve-wracking game.A mid-season stutter in November saw the Lochgilphead boys lose out to Cathcart -, then Clydebank -, both newcomers.The losing run continued into early December as Star faced last season’s champions Drumchapel Amateurs ending up down - at half-time before recovering their form with a committed second half display to pull it back to -. Unfortunately they lost out to a fourth Drumchapel goal as they chased the winner themselves.This set Star back on track as they finished the year with a hugely convincing performance, demolishing Cathcart -.January and February proved a real battle with the weather with wind, rain and freezing temperatures # often all three # only allowing four games to take place. Star secured fine victories over Busby, -, and Glasgow Red Star, -, and fought back to grind out creditable draws with Shettleston, -, and Place Park, another new team, -.Star played one league game in March before lockdown and again it was another entertaining game with a rollercoaster feel to it. Facing up to Drumchapel Amateurs, both teams played out another terric match which had everything.Coming back from a goal down and with only  men, Star played cracking football to race into a - lead but it took its toll as Drumchapel stuck to their task to draw level before adding a couple more goals to secure a win in the final five minutes.This was another fine season for Red Star s, competing well in a strong league, with only  signed players.Though the season was cut short, the boys played  games winning , drawing two and losing seven. They scored  goals and conceded  goals. There were some cracking games and the boys were looking forward to the knock-out stages of the league cup.Inconsistency probably cost Star a few more wins, but that’s what youth football development is all about and there is potential for the boys to develop.Well done from coaches and parents to the  boys who played this season – Craig Aitken, Zak Barclay, Gregor Brown, Keiran Caskie, Lewis Curran, Ruaridh Green, Woody Hoad, Alexander McLean, Conner McMurchy, Leon Murphy, Innes Paterson, Jamie Stewart and Tom West.Thanks for great support goes to sponsors Ardrishaig Community Trust, main strip, SC Crawford Building Contractors Limited, change strip and zip tops, Jewsons, tracksuits, and Mid Argyll Youth Development Services and the parents, supporters, referees and opposition teams that have made the season so enjoyable."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 12 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe selfish and reckless behaviour of many people visiting Argyll is to be deplored.

It shows contempt for those in the NHS who have risked their lives to save others. It shows contempt for those who have died without their loved ones by their side.

Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did.

The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through. They pass multiple residential entrances with limited sight lines with no care for risk. The offensive noise seems to come from two actions modying motorbike exhausts and extreme acceleration in legal bikes.If a car made a similar noise, spewed out the same polluting omissions, or did the same ridiculous speeds they would be pulled over by the police, but bikers appear above the law.As technology reduces the noise pollution of cars, planes and other forms of transport, it seems motorbikes are exempt. Bikers claim #loud pipes save lives# but is safety really the motivation for deliberately creating excessive noise Noise counts as a statutory nuisance it either unreasaonably and substantially interferes with the user or enjoyment of a home or other premises or is likely to injure health.The problem on A is known to all the statutory agencies, but nothing is done.If this is a national problem, what action needs to be taken Concerned Loch Fyne-side resident Sir,I am not qualied to judge economic competence, but considering the party he represents, I think that Councillor Redman might find it advisable to be wary of the phrase #colossal mismanagement# .For my part, I would consider a degree of incompetence to be preferable to the great damage caused over the last decade to  per cent of the UK’s people, as well as to its institutions and its reputation by the cruel, self-serving, xenophobic, elitist, dishonestregime currently in Westminster.Name supplied, LochgilpheadSir,Our charity#s support for blind and partially sighted people affected by the coronavirus lockdown has received a £, boost from the Scottish Government#s Wellbeing Fund.With this extra funding we will be able to support an additional  people and respond to the increased demand for more in-depth, one-to-one emotional support.The practical and psychological effects of losing your sight can have a signicant impact on people’s well-being, and this current situation has exacerbated the anxiety and isolation felt by many.Access to essential services such as food and medicines is more dficult as is social distancing, vital information on staying safe isn#t always in accessible formats, and many of our older members aren#t always confident about using new technology to stay in touch with others.Everyone accessing RNIB#s confidential counselling service will receive eight weekly sessions with an accredited counsellor, delivered via telephone and online, with each session normally lasting an hour.The funding will enable us to reduce the waiting list for emergency mental health sessions and also let existing clients access additional sessions.The RNIB helpline is available on   .James Adams, RNIB Scotland directorSir,Every pub across Scotland should be allowed to stock and sell beer from local independent brewers, to help them recover post-lockdown.CAMRA, the Campaign for Real Ale has launched the #Cheers for Choice# campaign.The campaign wants these arrangements to be relaxed, and MSPs are also being urged to support the Tied Pubs Bill being put forward in the Scottish Parliament by Labour MSP Neil Bibby.

Perhaps for the first time in their lives they have heard the bark of deer or spotted something in nature that is totally new to them.

But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased. All have grave consequences for wildle and nature.The result is the burning, choking, strangling, trapping or poisoning of animals, birds, plants and aquatic le.Taking care of our surroundings and appreciating nature is a real joy.

need to know ahead of the penumbral lunar eclipse.What is it A penumbral lunar eclipse takes place when the moon moves through the faint, outer part of earths shadow.Why do lunar eclipses happen A lunar eclipse happens when the Earth comes between the sun and the moon, therefore blocking some or all of the sunrsquos light from reaching the moon.Therefore, the moon cannot shine ndash because its surface is not reflecting the sunrsquos rays.The eclipse will be visible over ScotlandWhat makes this eclipse dferent According to TimeAndDate, a penumbral lunar eclipse occurs when the sun, earth and moon are imperfectly aligned.When this happens, the earth blocks some of the sunrsquos light from directly reaching the moonrsquos surface, and covers all or part of the moon with the other part of its shadow.Where should I look People in Scotland are urged to find an unobstructed area with a free sight to the southwest for a best view of the eclipse.When can I see it Unlike solar eclipses, which can only be seen along a narrow path from a small part of the earth, eclipses of the moon can be observed all across the night side of earth when the eclipse happens.According to TimeAndDate,

As ruins go, therersquos not a huge amount to explore no cramped spiral staircase to squeeze up, or dank cellars to investigate.But for me, such ruins have a dferent appeal. Not based so much on the physical exploration of what remains, but more an imaginative exploration of what we can no longer see.It has really ancient origins, dating back to the ninth century when the first Christian site seems to have been established here. That gives it over a thousand years of Christian connection, and I suspect it may have been a pre-Christian sacred site before that.The first kirk will have been wooden built, but the oldest surviving parts of the stone kirk we see today date from the late th century.On my most recent visit to the kirk, I stood in the nave and tried to imagine what Scotland was like in the s when parts of the walls around me were built. What a totally dferent world from ours, I thought, as I stood in the footsteps of those who stood on the same spot hundreds of years ago.On reflection, perhaps there were more similarities than we may imagine: pestilence, plague and epidemics, injustice and inequality, cruel rulers and pious preachers.There are some information boards with pictorial reconstructions that help us understand what we are looking at, but a ruin like this is the stuff of poetic imagination.Poets such as Shelley were inspired by ruins, and today they are popular visitor attractions all over the world.Compared to the scale of ruins such as the Acropolis or Pompeii, or even compared to nearby ruins such as Dirleton Castle, the old kirk of St Andrew may not impress. I donrsquot think it will ever be a popular tourist attraction.But thatrsquos why I enjoy visiting this place. Itrsquos a ruin with solitude, while ironically being very accessible and amidst a busy part of East Lothian.Over the years I have never personally met anyone  there visiting it. Many people know of it, of course, but because of its unassuming simplicity, I suspect few have got to know it.ldquoTherersquos not much to see, was an honest comment from a friend once. He was right on one level, but I think what we see depends how we look, and how we connect.For me anyway, the magic of this ruined kirk is not in what is visible but in the atmosphere of its story, and its unexpected tranquillity.Once, of course, it was very busy, for it was the place of worship for people from the edge of Aberlady Bay to the fringes of North Berwick, as well as from as far as four miles to the south. Every Sabbath there would have been processions of people from each direction, coming to meet and worship here together.Stand in the nave and you are at the centre of this ancient weekly migration. From here you will see a Norman arch, decorated with chevrons. Although the information board points out the craftsmanship is not of the finest quality, it makes me imagine some poorly paid, yet skilled, local stonemasons doing their best to beauty their kirk and it is certainly good enough.The arch was walled up many years ago, when the chancel became a burial place for the Yule family. So the decorated arch is now embedded in later stone, and looks like a fossil peeking out from a clf face.As I stood admiring it, I thought it had the atmosphere of a walled-up entrance into the past, in which figures from times gone by could emerge or perhaps I could walk through it to another age. Maybe Irsquove been watching too much Outlander .The kirk was used for worship for over  years, and even survived the Reformation. There is an amusing tale of the vicar from that time, which I shared in my first book. I thought of him as I stood in his church.It became a collegiate church in , so prayers were said here constantly by a group of priors to help the soul of the local laird to get into heaven. The prayers were paid for, of course, and one wondersthe laird got value for money.The kirk was finally abandoned around , apparently because of a petition from parishioners.One issue seems to have been the constant covering of sand blown over the kirk and kirkyard by endemic storms. What image does that conjure in our imagination  And what storms must they have been! But also, many people lived miles away from the kirk, as did the laird, and a new, more conveniently situated place of worship was wanted.I can understand this. Itrsquos a fair trek from, say, Dirleton to here, especially on an unpleasant, dark, cold winterrsquos morning. So a new replacement kirk was built at Dirleton, and St Andrewrsquos Kirk fell into disuse. Yet the kirkyard remained in use, and has many of its own tales to tell.I have never been a fan of crowded places, to be honest. Irsquove had my enjoyment of some favourite places ruined by being placed on a tourist lsquomust-seersquo list.I doubt the ruins of the old kirk of St Andrew in Gullane will ever be on a tourist lsquomust-seersquo list unless some celebrity gets married there, or itrsquos used as a movie location.It remains for me a wonderful place to visit, and I always spot small details that I missed on previous visits. My kids are fascinated by the stories told on the gravestones.As the lockdown eases, we are all understandably desperate to get out from our confinement and feel free once again to enjoy places. But then we often too readily build a new prison for ourselves by following the herd to overcrowded places where we are crammed into lsquomust-go-torsquo popular places.Maybe a gt from the lockdown is the discovery of those places nearby, less well known, but in their own way special and magical.For me, East Lothian is full of such small, less-well-known, special places, that will never be a on a lsquomust-seersquo list, but are all the more enjoyable for it. This old ruin is one of them for me.It is such places I look forward to visiting as the lockdown eases."},{"url":null,"title":"farewell-alfred-alf-tesoro","story":"He died suddenly of a presumed heart attack at the age of , as he ed to his home in Eskside West after buying his daily newspaper on June .Due to current Covid- restrictions, a private service was conducted on Monday, June , at Inveresk Cemetery by Father Basil Clark, from Our Lady of Loretto Church on Newbigging, Musselburgh.The funeral cortegravege travelled along North High Street, passing his former cafe premises for the last time, to applause from members of the local community who lined the street to pay their respects.His niece Anita Cullinan said: ldquoOur family were truly touched by all who turned up to witness Alfrsquos last journey through Musselburgh ndash people who perhaps personally knew Alf or who had grown up during the years the shop was open.ldquoWersquod like to thank them for turning out and for the deeply respectful applause as the cortegravege passed by.Alf was born in the house above the shop on  North High Street on July , , the middle child of Edoardo Tesoro and Zelinda Costa Tesoro, whose other two children were Eolanda and Bert.Edoardo started the cafe known as A.Tesoro in , and his brother Emilio also started a Tesoro cafe across the bridge in Musselburgh around the same time.

This means that, under current rules, only members of the same household or extended household group are permitted to stay away from home together.The previous five mile travel distance limit for leisure has been lted, though the public are still being encouraged to stay within their local area where possible.Self-contained self-catering holiday accommodation across Scotland has also begun to reopen for bookings, including a iety of businesses such as caravan parks and camping sites.

Irsquove looked out my monthly cinema pass in anticipation of re-opening around July .I appreciate not everyone feels this way, but Irsquom ready to start living again. Irsquom also ready to accept some fundamental political realities.Letrsquos face it, wersquore all just guinea pigs now, part of a radical public health experiment the likes of which has never been attempted before. This experiment is reaching its most dficult phase yet, the bit where the Government has to somehow let people start doing normal things ndash like going back to work and spending money to keep the economy going ndash while simultaneously reminding us that we wersquore not out of the woods yet. They have to encourage people to go out, while keeping them scared.Many ndash including me ndash have criticised politicians for their missteps and mixed messages over the last few months. But I also recognise a number of basic truths that itrsquos better to get onersquos head around sooner rather than later, regardless of party politics.The first is that until coronavirus has been completely eradicated around the world, risk is going to play a part in our lives for the foreseeable future. The second is closely related: the state cannot tell us exactly how to manage this risk in every single circumstance. We may get health advice and government guidance, but ultimately we have to navigate this new, more precarious world on our own.How we do this, and, crucially, how we feel about doing it, depends on many dferent things, of course, not least our age and underlying health, our financial situation and, to a signicant extent, our personality.I know there are some who believe that through lting lockdown restrictions politicians in Westminster and Holyrood are very deliberately handing over responsibility ndash and thus blame ndash to the public for what comes next. And there may be some truth to this. But come on, letrsquos get real.Accusations of ldquomaking it up as they go along are thrown around asthis was an insult rather than simply a fact describing the predicament governments everywhere find themselves in. How could it be otherwise given the extraordinary events of the last six months  And whatrsquos the alternative to us being public health guinea pigs  Staying at home forever Community levels of the virus in Scotland are now low and falling. Our hospitals lie empty. We have a test and trace system in place to ndash hopefully ndash crack down on infections. Meanwhile, wellbeing continues to suffer under the restrictions and hundreds of thousands of jobs hang in the balance. All of these things mean we can and should lt the lockdown. And lting restrictions means the vast majority of folkmust decide for themselves what level of risk they are comfortable contending with, taking into consideration how it might affect their family and community as well as their own personal circumstances.We can help ourselves along the way. Firstly by staying up to date ndash through trusted, legitimate scientic and public information sources ndash about how the virus is transmitted and the best ways to stay safe.We can also resist the temptation to judge others for their decisions. Frankly, Irsquom sick of the army of armchair virologists spouting their culture war vitriol on social media. On one side you have those who seem to relish the lockdown, the class swots who shout too loudly about how they follow every part of the guidanceand seem to revel in the idea of a second wave. On the other side, you have the virus deniers. Both groups peddle fear and misinformation, whether that is their intention or not.At the end of the day none of us, not even the scientists, know whether and when there will be another wave of the virus. Uncertainty permeates through every part of our lives now, and we must find ways to live with and even embrace thiswe are to make it through the tough months ahead.

Nationality, for me, evokes contentedness, at best, rather than pride. I canrsquot get excited about which flags fly on buildings, what colour my passport is, or whether a copy of The Gruffalo is available in Scots. Indeed, I find the all-too-prevalent Scottish and British exceptionalism cringeworthy and insular, especially in those areas where we claim world-leading status when all the sensible evidence points to the contrary.Although I would have been prepared to vote Yes, I voted No in  based solely on my view that Scotlandrsquos inherited fiscal deficit combined with the leftism of a new, ideologised nation would leave me and my family poorer for a signicant period of time.:Support for Scottish independence surges in new poll as SNP look set for landslide victory at Holyrood electionsThe  campaign made me feel that a Yes vote would be an act of personal self-harm a virtue signalling affirmation of non-Englishness. The stuff of a second Scottish Enlightenment it was not.That said, polling trends are now clear enough to be sure that, slowly but most definitely surely, the country is moving towards independence. From the : position of , the No vote has gradually declined. Evenwe strip out polling during the pandemic, which may fairly be seen to be skewed by a seismic current event, numbers for No now normally tend to be in the low rather than the mid-fties.Since the peak of coronavirus passed, Yes has begun to build what may be seen as a psephologically consistent lead. This particular set of warning signs for unionistswere there in the polling conducted by Ipsos MORI for the BBC in May, in which First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was given a net approval rating of % for her handling of the pandemic. Only one-in-eight people thought she was doing badly.That means, plainly, that a large number of died-in-the-wool unionists thought that Ms Sturgeon was doing a good job. As soon as I saw that poll I wondered whether unionist leaders north and south, who have long hitched their wagon to the negative perceptions of Ms Sturgeon that they claim to hear on the famous doorsteps, would understand the potential implications of their people offering her their approval, even during a crisis.The question in my head, now, is this: have the unionists given up, or are they just asleep at the wheel To be sure, positives for nationalists are plentul. Simple demographics play their part bluntly, young people are more likely to be ideological nationalists, and unionists are more likely to die. Secondly, without being pejorative about Boris Johnson, on whom the jury remains out, the very presence in Downing Street of a figure largely unpopular in Scotland also helps the case, especially when he and his partyrsquos demise still seems distant. And, thirdly, the uncertainty ushered in by Brexit, in a nation which did not vote for it, is another push factor for soft unionist Remainers.However it would also be a mistake to think that this most recent trend towards nationalism is particularly sticky. Ms Sturgeonrsquos communications around coronavirus has been as outstanding as it must have been exhausting, but her strategy has so far been a near carbon-copy of Mr Johnsonrsquos.During a crisis, opinions are transient and often frankly hysterical. So all should not be lost for unionists. And, yet, their prospects look bleak. Bleak not because of the last two months, or even the last two years, but as a result of decades of poor strategy, guided by emotional anti-nationalism rather than calm, clinical calculation.One word sums up British unionism: ldquoreactive. The Smith Commission was a reaction to the independence referendum result. The Calman Commission was a reaction to the SNP winning in . Devolution itself was a reaction to nationalist strength.Unionism is forever chasing the curve of Scottish public opinion. It is never ahead of it. It is never proactive. If it wants to save itself, it now needs to be. If unionists think they can just say no to indyref  and eventually it will all go away, theyrsquove not been paying attention.Unionism has some strong fundamentals in its favour. Firstly, it may well be the case that at any future independence referendum voter fatigue plays a signicant role. Scots have, in six years, been asked to decide upon their future in the UK and their future in the EU, have faced three general elections and a Scottish election, with another around the corner, not to mention enduring the coronavirus crisis, during which their job has a good chance of having been saved by a UK Chancellor. They might simply think ldquoenough is enough.That is, perhaps, rather a depressing reason to vote No. But there are more uplting ones. The transfer of such large volumes of No voters to Yes over recent years means that, by definition, a large proportion of the vote is soft. It can go back under the right conditions.:Never before have the foundations of support for the Union looked so weak - Professor Sir John CurticeThose right conditions, I think, inevitably involve the proactive creation of a New Unionism, discussed in some quarters but not so far ostensibly embraced by anyone with their hands on the levers of power.This New Unionism would read the changing mood, not just in Scotland but also in Northern Ireland and even to a degree in Wales, and try to get ahead of it. It would almost certainly move beyond the immature unionist debate which presumes power to be binary, either shting from Westminster to Holyrood or vice versa, either a strong Scotland or a strong Britain, and instead enhance the role of both parliaments and governments through a structure built to last for decades, rather than one built to last until the next time the SNP does well at an election.When you ask two unionists how to defeat nationalism you get five dferent answers. Unless they settle on a New Unionism in short order, they will probably still be arguing with each other when the independence train leaves the station.Andy Maciver is Director of Message Matters"},{"url":null,"title":"opinion-stuart-waiton-keir-starmer-channels-new-mccarthyism","story":"McCarthyism was a form of terror that used unsubstantiated evidence, fear and threats to destroy potentially anyone, especially those in the entertainment industry, who were seen as left wing. The inquisitorial question, ldquoAre you now or have you ever been a member of the Communist Party, has gone down in history as a chilling expression and reminder of the dangers of right-wing political panics.Today, we find the so-called left, in the form of Rebecca Long Bailey, being sacked, McCarthy style, by Labour leader Keir Starmer, for daring to retweet a newspaper interview with the actor Maxine Peake that had in it a crass and inaccurate reference to Israeli security forces training US police to use the kneeling tactics which killed George Floyd.The irony, of course, is that this sacking does not come with rants about communist atheism, a defence of Christian mortality, ideas of treachery or the lack of loyalty to the nation. It is not a right-wing sacking but an all too familiar ldquoprogressive sacking.It is unlikely that Starmer thinks Long Bailey is actually anti-Semitic and many have suggested this is an opportunistic move on the Labour leaderrsquos behalf to clear out some of the Corbyn supporters in his shadow cabinet. The problem being, of course, that in so doing he is simply applying the modern McCarthyite approach that has been developed by the ldquoleft when dealing with those with whom they disagree.McCarthy and his ilk hated the liberal and left-wing progressives that they saw as dominating the entertainment industry, the luvvies who transgressed from American patriotism and Christian morality. Today, this too has changed, and it is often the cultural elite, the left-luvvies, who are the most ldquoright-thinking, censorious and keen to demand that people be ldquocancelled.Just ask Lawrence Fox, the actor who has been blacklisted for questioning the idea of ldquowhite privilege. Fox fears he may never get another acting job he may well be right.Until relatively recently it was only the most small-minded of bigots who thought it acceptable to sack people because of their ldquoimmoral opinions.

The Government has a plain duty to maintain public health, and so may forbid close physical contact, solo or collective singing, and risky forms of speech.

Covid- has starkly revealed that some of our everyday lives have clear measurable impacts. A desire to Build Back Better, to restore our economy but also protect our planet and create green jobs has grown. With a recent BBC poll finding that  per cent of people think climate change is as serious as Covid-, itrsquos vital we listen to what they want.Key workers in recycling and waste management have performed an essential service during the pandemic and now, the sector so vital to driving a better environment, must answer the demand to drive a greener recovery.Even during such a devastating crisis, or perhaps because of it, we must think again about the waste we produce. We must drive resource re-use, end waste exports and ert from landfill to achieve a zero-waste economy.For Viridor, the key to unlocking this change is to see waste as a resource, and not as rubbish turning packaging and products back into new products which are reused here in Scotland. This could create new skilled jobs while driving down waste and carbon emissions. Making sure waste is truly valuable is key to ensuring what we discard does not escape the recycling net, going on to harm our environment.Last week we launched our vision of how we might make build back better a reality in Scotland. A Scottish Circular Economy and Innovation Park. A site dedicated to moving towards a zero-waste economy where our waste is reprocessed into new materials to be reused in Scotland. A site that brings major new investment and green jobs with a better environment. A site that meets the hopes and expectations of the Scottish people.But this vision is far bigger than one company. This is why we brought together  people in this sector, including Scotlandrsquos Minister for Trade, Ivan McKee Sepa CEO Terry ArsquoHearn, Scottish Enterprise, Zero Waste Scotland, Heriot-Watt University and Glasgow Chamber of Commerce. Innovating to make a zero-waste economy, securing Scottish investment, creating green jobs can only be doneeveryone works together.Mr McKee noted the ldquotime had come for Scotland to be clear about the infrastructure investment required to deliver the world-leading circular economy it is committed to. This is crucial. Recycling and reprocessing of plastics, glass, paper and card does not happen without a signicant investment. This sentiment and ambition were matched by the Princess Royal who, in a video message recorded specically for the event, noted that investing in the circular economy is key to ldquogiving our young people the opportunity to play a major role in the world they will inherit.Time and again, people focused the opportunity we have to ensure Scotland emerges from this crisis with a brighter future. Too many Scottish resources are being lost to export along with the investment and jobs that goes with it. If we stand back and respond to what people want, this crisis could spur a truly sustainable economy and ensure the recycling sector remains more relevant than ever.Investment in the crucial recycling infrastructure needed to create a zero-waste economy and retain our resources in Scotland cannot be achieved overnight nor by any one organisation. Now is the time to start working together, to define the skills and innovation required and to invest in the future to ensure we emerge from this crisis better and stronger.Tim Rotheray is Viridor Director of Innovation and Regulation"},{"url":null,"title":"Opinion  Iain Macwhirter  There is method to the madness of spend  spend  spend","story":"Advocates include Democrat Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the economist Stephanie Kelton and the Labour-supporting tax specialist Richard Murphy. It may be that the Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has also become a devotee of this theory, which says governments can spend public money without having to worry about debt.He is in the hole for pound billion because of Covid and has seen the UK debt pile rise to nearly pound trillion. He borrowed a record poundbn in April alone. But he doesnrsquot sound all that worried and will be adding to it today in his summer statement.Modern monetarists believe that the traditional view of government finance ndash that it has to raise tax revenue to pay for services like the NHS ndash is wrong. Governments can spend on anything they want by printing money or borrowing. Just think of a number, print it and yoursquore off to the races. Rodger Malcolm Mitchellrsquos MMT book Free Money sums it up.So whatBritainrsquos debt has rocketed to more than  per cent of GDP  Doesnrsquot matter. Japan has public debt of % of GDP and seems to be surviving. An independent Scotland shouldnrsquot bother about debt either, so long as it has control of its currency, because it can just print Scottish pounds to pay for it.It sounds crazy, like Zimbabwean economics. And ultimately Modern Monetary Theory is a reductio ad absurdam. Fiat money has no intrinsic value soyou just increase the volume of it, without generating equivalent wealth, then its value will tend to reduce to nothing ndash as in Weimar Germany where people needed wheelbarr,ows to collect wages.However, there is method to MMT madness. It contains an important kernel of truth: that government spending, given low inflation, does not need to be financed by tax revenue.The traditional Thatcherite view, that you can only spend what you can afford, is back to front. If the state spends to get the economy moving in a recession the debt effectively finances itself by generating future taxation from the people newly employed.This was what John Maynard Keynes ndash really the grandfather of MMT ndash argued during the Great Depression. If governments spend money on, say, arms production the people employed in these factories go on to pay for goods and services from where in the private sector ndash food, clothing, housing and so on. This creates more private sector jobs through the so-called ldquomultiplier effect.Thus, a pound spent by the government generates more pounds in future by stimulating economic activity. So long as there is less than full employment governments should spend whatever it takes to get the economy running at full capacity. They could even pay people to dig holes and fill them in again.Yes, itrsquos a kind of free lunch argument and has been much criticised by conventional economists ndash including the European Central Bank - who believe excessive government spending debases the currency, distorts the market and leads to financial collapse, Greek style. Environmentalists donrsquot like the emphasis on growth.What has made Keynsianism, or MMT, so plausible recently is that many central banks have been printing money like therersquos no tomorrow since  and so far prices have remained stable and the roof has not fallen in. In the UK, the Bank of England has created an astonishing poundbn through Quantitative Easing ndash buying government debt.Conservatives like Boris Johnson, hardly radical leftists, are increasingly seeing debt as a good thing ndash or at any rate nothing to worry about. In order to keep his ldquored wall gains intact, Mr Johnson has promised to ldquobuild, build, build.Right now, interest rates are near zero, so there seems little reason to forgo spending. And thatrsquos precisely what Mr Sunak has been doing. In sheer volume terms he has spent more rapidly than any government in British history, mostly paying for furloughed employees.Paying private sector wages goes beyond what Modern Monetary Theorists advocate. It is more in the style of old-fashioned Marxists who wanted the state to take over the economy entirely. MMTers donrsquot want to nationalise the means of production.Of course, common sense says public spending canrsquot increase indefinitely. What about the interest on government debt  Surely that has to be paid. The UK currently spends poundbn a year on debt interest ndash more than on defence.Modern monetarists like Richard Murphy say the government should simply print more money to pay this, which it can do up to a point. However most government debt is owned by private pension funds and institutional investors or by foreign banks and financiers. In the long term,the government paid its debts in worthless printed pounds, theyrsquod soon stop lending.ldquoBut in the long run, said Keynes, ldquowersquore all dead. The Bank of England has printed hundreds of billions in QE since  and financiers are still falling over themselves to lend. Indeed, theyrsquore effectively lending at zero interest and getting nothing for their money.Mr Sunak will promise that Britainrsquos debts will be paid ndash he has to say that because free money sounds irresponsible. But he is likely to keep borrowing and spending because it is politically the sensible thing to do avert a Covid depression.People on the left are puzzled by this. Why is a Tory politician adopting the economics of Bernie Sanders  Well, it might be worth mentioning that one of the main founders of MMT was a hedge fund manager and tax exile, Warren Mosler, in the s. MMT is not a particularly left wing idea, nor is public debt.The former Republican Vice President, Dick Cheney, said in  that ldquodeficits donrsquot matter. Republican Presidents like Ronald Reagan and George Bush massively increased US public debt. It has been Democrats like Barak Obama and Bill Clinton who have sweated to reduce deficits.Donald Trump has ramped up more debt than any US government in history,  trillion, and is about to borrow trillion more.

But with our unique perspective of  years of helping people deal with their problems, we feel we understand the issues that need to be addressed, and we are keen to contribute to making the re-boot happen.So over the summer we will use our weekly column here to set out in detail how we believe public policy needs to be re-focused. We will look at the role of social security how we can help people stay in their homes how debt holds iniduals back and hampers wider economic recovery and how telecommunications can be used to keep people connected both socially and to services. Today I will start by looking at the issue of employment and workers rights.Since the start of lockdown the proportion of advice the Scottish Citizens Advice network has given about employment has swelled to three times what is typical. Itrsquos been our biggest area of growth during the pandemic. And in particular, in the first three weeks of June, one in five pieces of employment advice we gave was about redundancy.So, while the Job Retention Schemewas a bold and necessary measure, both governments need to think now about how to protect existing jobs as the economy recovers.We would like the UK Government to consider greater flexibility in the timescales for winding down the furlough scheme, taking into consideration the needs of dferent sectors, and the dferent pace to the easing of lockdown in Scotland and other parts of the UK.

For the medium term we would urge more investment in new jobs, particularly in sectors that can have wider social benefit.Scotlandrsquos transition to net zero can be supported by investment in energy efficiency improvements for homes, which reduces fuel bills for iniduals while boosting employment.We also welcome the Enterprise  Skills Strategic Board in Scotlandrsquos focus on employment for young people, older low-skilled, low-waged workers and women. Since long before Covid-, we have been concerned by the prevalence of low-paid and insecure work, which makes it hard for people to budget and to balance caring responsibilities.Many of these workers have been among the hardest hit by the financial impact of the pandemic ndash unable to access the furlough scheme or statutory sick pay. Others have found themselves out on the frontline, providing key services like care and food retail whilst better paid workers have been able to continue their work safely from home.Scotland cannot plan a recovery on the basis of training everyone on a low wage into so-called ldquohigh-quality jobs, because recent months have highlighted how critical many of those low-paid jobs are. Instead, the value of those jobs needs to be recognised in a new deal for those in traditionally low-paid sectors. A new deal based on higher wages, better terms and conditions and greater flexibility around caring responsibilities. This would involve prioritising the Scottish Governmentrsquos Fair Work agenda, with the care sector being an obvious place to start.These are not radical or new ideas, but without these kinds of changes many workers will continue to rely on benefits to top up low pay.

He has said he believes fans are the reason why no current professionals have come out as gay.He became the first male English footballer to come out since Justin Fashanu in . Mr Fashanu came out while still playing top flight professional football in the US. He would laterto the UK to play for Torquay United, Airdrie and Hearts.Justin FashanuOther international players such as Robbie Rogers and Thomas Hitzlsperger only came out after retiring from British football.In stark contrast to the menrsquos game, womens football has many role models. US womens soccer star and talisman Megan Rapinoe competed for her country in the World Cup last summer, during Pride month, along with the  other proudly gay players in the tournament.Other top womens players include Magdalena Eriksson the -year-old captain of Cha FC Women who plays for the Swedish national team is an open LGBTQIA+ football player.Mr Nicolson, , who became the first BBC network television presenter to come out as gay when a presenter on BBC Breakfast in , has told the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport committee that the first current footballer to come out stood to gain massively financially - but it appeared to be not enough.\"Lets be blunt, I suspect we all know what the problem is. It is that footballers are frightened. It is fear that stops them from coming out.\"I have a friend who is an agent and he told me the first gay footballer would make an absolute fortune because big companies would want to be associated with the first footballer to come out. Financially it would be very lucrative for that footballer.\"I suspect it is the fear that they are going to be harassed online and they might not feel safe walking in the street in certain communities and that they would have a target on their back as the first person to person to come out.\"That really is shocking in the st century.\"What seems to me, speaking as a gay man myself, is that footballers are in an enormously privileged position. The high profile ones are very wealthy, they can protect themselves from immediate physical danger. Andthey are too scared to come out, what does that say to kids living up and down the country, who look at them and say thathe doesnt feel safe coming out, what hope is there for me in my housing scheme, or estate. That is the real worry about this.Magdalena Eriksson\"I feel we have been talking about this for years.

I dont recognise a concern about this.:Mark Smith -I know there are gay footballers in Scotland because I tried to convince one to go public\"There is some concern but it doesnt seem to be a pressing concern.\"The SNP MP said that Richard Masters, chief executive of the English Premier League had told MPs that footballers that came out would be embraced by the game which he said was a far more welcoming place in . But he also conceded that it was a failure in the game that a player had not felt able to do so.But Mr Nicolson said: \"I dont have any sense at all that it is a far more welcoming place. By definition,it was a far more welcoming place, people would feel free to come out.\"His commentary came in a discussion with Paul Cleal, an adviser to several relevant organisations including the Premier League who told him that mens football was \"not welcoming enough\".He believed football was more concerned about behaviour of people in the stadia and social media, which he said was \"a shame\".A spokesman for the FA the governing body of football in England said: \"Coming out, irrespective of gender, is an inidual and personal decision. Having a support network and allies, whether thatrsquos teammates, friends or family, can be crucial in this process and we will always offer the full support of The FA to anybody that chooses to come out.\"We continue to work with our partners across the game, such as Stonewall, LGBT fan groups, campaign groups and the leagues, to help create a safe and comfortable environment for any player to come outthey wish to do so.

The concentration of commercial headquarters and entertainment venues in the capital ensure that the service sector thrives in the south-east.One may have hoped that after four centuries of the existence of the Union there would have been a more equitable distribution of wealth and resources throughout the entire British Isles not all concentrated in the one wee self-absorbed corner of England.Scotland too poor  Wait a minute, Westminster is bankrupt. The Government in Westminster has failed to balance the budget for years and despite a decade of crippling austerity it is forced to borrow consistently. The current UK national debt is in the region of pound trillion and that is before one adds in the pound billion we ldquoborrowed to bail out the banking industry or the recent poundbn the Bank of England gave the Treasury despite the fact of the bank having a positive balance of less than poundbn. Before criticising what could happen to Scotlandit were to become independent, I would suggest that those intent on maintaining the Union should fix Westminster as it is imploding.So, letrsquos dump the ldquoScotland too wee, too small, too stupid trope that the Establishment has brainwashed unionists to spout and letrsquos replace it with the more accurate ldquoWestminster too inept, too corrupt, too bloody useless.David J Crawford, Glasgow G.ANDY Maciverwrites that the debate on constitutional issues is seldom ldquothe stuff of a second Scottish Enlightenment.The great figures of the Scottish Enlightenment used an evidence-based approach to thinking. Perhaps Mr Maciver should try it some time. There were a number of statements remarkably free of this approach, Irsquoll confine myself to some of the highlights.He states that Nicola Sturgeonrsquos approach to handling the Covid- epidemic ldquohas been a near carbon-copy of Mr Johnsonrsquos. There were six deaths from the disease in Scotland last week. The number of deaths in England was . Given the proximity of the countries and the fact that Scotland has no control over its borders, this is an extraordinary ergence. How could this be achieved with a ldquocarbon copy approach  Let me help Mr Maciver here: it couldnrsquot. Those outcomes were achieved by the Scottish Government strictly following the advice of its scientic advisory body.Mr Maciver believed in  it would have been an act of self-harm to have voted Yes. While the Scottish Government works hard with limited powers to protect him and his family, in the true spirit of the Scottish Enlightenment, he can reflect on the wisdom of that statement, as a hard Brexit looms on the horizon, threatening to redouble the hardships brought about by the virus.Jim Daly, Edinburgh EH.MARK Smithtries valiantly to make the widespread Scottish desire for independence look equivalent to English nationalism. The first rhetorical trick is to call supporters of Scottish independence ldquonationalists. This sleight of hand is so common as to almost escape notice, but in a professional political commentator itrsquos either sloppy or deliberately slippery. Later, he acknowledges that strident types of English, or Scottish, nationalism have been unattractive to many, but he attributes this cooler view only to those in what he calls ldquothe centre ground. Those who support Scottish independence for reasons of bringing democracy closer to the people, or from dismay and disillusion with the seemingly endlessly dysal and self-absorbed Westminster establishment, or any other rational argument, donrsquot seem to enter his thinking.He also doesnrsquot notice that the question in YouGovrsquos poll that puts Tory support for English independence at  per cent is highly misleading in the context of Brexit. It asks how the the respondent would vote in a hypothetical referendum to the question ldquoShould England be an independent country  It surely should be obvious that for that still very large proportion of English people who have dficulty distinguishing between England and the UK, this is a direct echo of the Brexit referendum, and that they would be likely to answer it correspondingly.That of course is YouGovrsquos survey howler, but Mr Smith should have known better than to build his convoluted argument about ldquonationalisms around it. Neither does he address the fact, inconvenient for his thesis, that English Tories apparently tend toEnglish nationalism but Scottish Tories are quite free of Scottish nationalism. He has started, it seems, from his pre-determined conclusion that wanting independence for Scotland is little more than a sentimental, even strident, patriotic reflex, and therefore the same sort of thing as Little Englandism. He might not approve of Scottish independence himself, but that does not excuse such spurious ldquoanalysis.Lyn Jones, Edinburgh EH.IN response to questions directed at me by John Jamiesonas to why Scotland has ldquofailed to thrive compared to England: first, he failed to acknowledge that in my letter of July  I was answering specic nonsensical claims by a previous correspondent and at no stage did I suggest that Scotlandhad not performed as well as rUK, which indeed it has.The problem for an independent Scotland is that we spend nearly  per cent more on public servicesthan England and because of our geography most of our businesses and economic activity are directed towards England ndash approximately %. In other words, provided we remain within the UK internal single market these anomalies do not matter a jot. However, a Scotland with hard borders and outside the lucrative UK market, with a massive borrowing requirement , dferent currency, and outside the EUwould make the proverbial perfect storm look a squall in comparison.Ian Lakin, Aberdeen AB.IN the midst of this continuing independence debate, I consider two questions remain unanswered and unresolved. Will Scottish-born UK passport holders and British citizens living in Scotland be deprived of those rights post-independence And will English-born, but happily-settled, UK citizens living their lives in Scotland be deprived of their rights to retain their UK citizenship and passport and be forced to accept a Scottish versionthey wish to remain living here It is neither democratic nor fair to deprive so many of their birthrights andindependence supporters ndashSNP or otherwise ndash wish to secede from the UK they may well be entitled to do so, but they do not have the right to make others secede against their will and they might display some social democratic principles by acknowledging and answering the above.Gerald Marshall, Kinnesswood.Read more: Letters: Covid cannot mask indy

an internal investigation into her predecessor, what action she took and the extent of her involvement,any, in the decision to refer complaints to the police.Meanwhile, her husband Peter Murrell, chief executive of the SNP, has been asked to hand over all relevant party communications relating to the internal Scottish Government complaints.He has also been asked to provide the inquiry with details of when he first became aware of the complaints against Mr Salmond and who informed him,as well as any discussions or communications he had with ministers or special advisers.MSPs on the inquiry are looking at how the Scottish Government botched a misconduct probe into Mr Salmond and left taxpayers with a pound, legal bill.They have already decided witnesses will be required to take an oath.Now they have published  letters sent to key players requesting written evidence by August .This will allow the Committee on the Scottish Government Handling of Harassment Complaints to start taking oral evidence in mid-August.The inquirys focus is the Scottish Governmentrsquos in-house probe into complaints of sexual misconduct made against Mr Salmond in  by two female civil servants.After this became public in August that year, Mr Salmond resigned from the SNP, before launchinga crowdfunded judicial review at the Court of Session to have the probersquos findings struck down.In January , the Government admitted in court its probe had been unfair, unlawful and ldquotainted by apparent bias because the investigating officer was in prior contact with the complainants, leaving taxpayers with a pound, bill for Mr Salmondrsquos legal costs.It emerged Ms Sturgeon maintained contact with Mr Salmond while he was being investigated by her officials, leading to accusations she broke the Scottish ministerial code.Now a Holyrood committeewill examine how the Government probe was bungled, the judicial review, and whether Ms Sturgeonrsquos behaviour broke the code.The letter to Ms Sturgeon, published on the Scottish Parliaments website, requests copies of all communications relevant to its remit between the First Minister, Mr Salmond and other relevant iniduals.It also seeks details of all \"relevant communications with the SNP given your dual roles as First Minister and as the leader of the SNP\".It adds: \"This includes all communication, relevant to its remit, relating to the complaints made against Alex Salmond under the Procedure on handling of harassment complaints involving current or former ministers.\"It says the committee is focusing partly on the culture within the Scottish Government between  and , when Mr Salmond was first minister, and on to the present.The letter adds: \"The committee requests details and any relevant correspondence from this period on the culture within the Scottish Government.\"Meanwhile, aletter to Mr Salmond seeks a \"full chronological account of the complaints handling process\" from his perspective.MSPs want to establish who first informed the former first minister of the existence of complaints, when he was informed and the level of detail shared.The committee said it is also interested in \"all contact since then between yourself and Scottish Government officials\" as well as all contact with ministers.The letter adds: \"The committee also requests a list of all those you discussed the details of the complaints with during this period including details of any requests you made for people to support you, including to act as intermediaries.\"The inquiry wants Mr Salmonds full account of the judicial reviewand copies of all relevant documents he holds.It also asked him for all communications with the SNP relatingto the internal Scottish Government complaints made against him.Referring again to the culture of the Government, the letter asks for Mr Salmonds perspective on the safeguards in place for staff, how supported he considers staff would have felt, and what could have been done dferently.Elsewhere, Mr Murrell has been asked for \"details of your first awareness of, presence at, or contributions to, any meetings between two or more of the following: the First Minister the First Ministerrsquos chief of staff [Liz Lloyd] the former First Minister, Alex Salmond and the former First Ministerrsquos former chief of staff, Geoff Aberdein\".Further letters from committee convenerLinda Fabiani have been sent to Ms Lloyd, MrAberdein, deputy first minister John Swinney, Lord Advocate James Wolffe, union leaders and former permanent secretaries Sir Peter Housden andSir John Elvidge.The latter two have been asked about the outcome of any staff surveys on incidences of bullying and harassment, as well asthe level of complaints made under previous policies, among other things.Mr Salmond was cleared of multiple charges of sexual assault earlier this year after a trial at the High Court in Edinburgh.The former First Ministers allies have suggested he was the victim of a politically motivated plot to destroy him.Ms Sturgeon has dismissed this as a ldquoheap of nonsense."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"July ,  at : pmYet

After eating far too many patisseries, she enrolled at the Alain Ducasse cookery school to learn how to make macarons. She said: “They’re just so pretty. They’re so delicate. And they’re quite hard to make because there’s a lot that can go wrong.”Once Rachel ed to Edinburgh and noticed a gap in the market, she decided to set up her very own macaron business.She said: “I wanted to have that little bit of Paris with me. I focused on taste bud tourism, so when you eat these macarons you’re transported to the Champs-Élysées.” After nine months of trading from home and going to food markets, Rachel set up her first bricks-and-mortar store.She said: “It was in the centre of Edinburgh, it had a view of the castle. It was beautul.” vw, px\"  But since launching their online store in , and realising that they could send macarons across the country, plus the fact that they had large bookings from both wholesale and wedding customers, the bricks and mortar became unnecessary.The company, which employs eight people, lost all their wholesale customers overnight due to Coronavirus.Rachel said: “It was really scary. All the weddings, all the wholesale customers, and the bulk of our production disappeared. And then, of course, you have phone calls from people wanting to cancel future orders and refunds.“We entered the cash flow situation whereby the wholesale customers stopped paying the invoices. And we’ve now got over £, worth of overdue invoices.”But, it’s not all doom and gloom, as Mademoiselle Macaron has started to see an increase in online orders. It’s thanks to the UK Government’s furlough scheme that her business has kept afloat. Rachel said: “The furlough scheme has been a real leline in this time of crisis. I asked people to volunteer for furlough. So the people who wanted to and were happy to, they were the first ones to go. I cried.“I just felt like I was stuck in this moral quandary. Do we keep going and safeguard the business, so there’s a business for everyone to come back to  Or do I shut down because I can see that this is causing people severe anguish  We managed to recall stock that was sitting in hospitality clients freezers. That is the only reason we survived. What you make, you keep in the freezer and you use when you need to. It’s not like it’s a cupcake,we were perishable goods we would never have survived.”“We have a big kitchen so the space isn’t the issue. It’s more that we wanted to keep the team safe,” adds Rachel.Mademoiselle Macaron’s online sales have increased so much that they’re potentially in a position to hire more people on temporary contracts. Ideally, Rachel would like to help younger people and develop a training program with a college. “They’ve been so much more affected, and it’s just something close to my heart,” she said. vw, px\"  But when the Covid- pandemic struck, the managing director of Wales-based The Seren Collection required urgent assistance from the UK Government’s support schemes to pay his creditors and maintain supplier relationships.Mr Kedward and his we Zoe entered the hospitality industry almost by accident in .He said: “We just happened to come home to South Wales for the weekend and stumbled across The Grove. It was a calamitous trip with lots of wrong turns and family arguments, but we found the owner in, made our offer and that was that.“Our aspiration was much smaller than that, in fact we just wanted to convert the six outlying buildings into self catering units – now we’re a  bedroom hotel.”Neil and Zoe went on to open two restaurants in Saundersfoot and Oxwich on the back of the success of The Grove.Asthat weren’t enough to keep the team busy, he also spotted a gap in the tour operator market.Neil said: It struck me that there weren’t enough tour operators bringing people into the country. So we started a business called routescape, which had a hugely encouraging start, launching at World Travel Market before a big business development trip in . We had built up all our bookings for this financial year.“And then of course the whole project was wiped out by the virus. We lost every single booking. Not just for Routescape, but for The Grove too.”Neil added: “The loan from the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme has allowed us to pay off all our creditors and we will be able to relaunch owing nobody any money.”When Covid- struck, one of Northern Ireland’s leading providers of tyres and automotive services, had just invested £.m in a new head office and distribution centre in Antrim and cash reserves were low.But thanks to their ability to adapt, ersy as well as the invaluable support from the UK Government, Kerr’s Tyres  Auto has been able play a vital role in servicing and keeping the province’s key workers on the road.Managing director Norman Kerr said: “The Antrim site used up our cash reserves and had a big impact on our cash flow.“Unfortunately the coronavirus kicked in three months later, when we still didn’t have a chance to build up any cash reserves that we would normally have. So it had a massive impact on ourselves.“But the problem was we had to continue trading because we supply the food sector and the white delivery van man.“So our business had to continue. We had to pay suppliers, we had no choice in it.”However thanks to a UK Government Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme loan of £, through the Ulster Bank, as well as the furlough scheme, the family-run business was able to remain solvent and save over  jobs.Norman said: “Had we not been able to get the UK Government loan scheme, it would have had a huge impact on our business. Our business, in essence, dropped probably  per cent within the first month.“Thankfully that has grown steadily back since then.”Here are some examples of the support available for businesses and workers.Details of the support available to businesses across the UK can be found at gov.uk coronavirus business-supportcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Everyone is in the same boat trying to step-up and deliver.“Before anyone had heard of Covid- we were already planning to equip GP practices for appointments and started that in October last year.”On March  national guidance was issued asking boards to accelerate the roll-out of the technology in an effort to curb the spread of the virus across the country.Kenny added: “Ultimately the increase in Near Me appointments has protected both our patients and staff from possible infection. We were looking to gradually introduce it but events over took that. We have trained more than  clinicians in range of specialisms since then.“There are benefits to Near Me over phone consultations and evidence shows visually you can pick-up signs and body language far more than on a phone call. So where it is clinically appropriate to do so we are having as many of these using Near Me as possible.“The initial focus was on enabling GP Practices, attention was shted to Mental Health Services, AHP and other clinical services traditionally delivered from the Balfour as the pandemic response developed. Working closely with service leads, training was delivered, equipment put in place and appointment processes modied to mirror the GP roll-out.“Uptake from both patients and clinicians has been very encouraging. Our Mental Health service has been able to meet the demands within the community at a time of increased anxiety and isolation.”He added that the uptake across the entire Mental Health Team led to them being asked to contribute to a national learning event to share their experiences.“Our maternity service is also doing very well and, despite only recently taking up the use of the technology, was similarly invited to contribute to a future national learning event due to its success,” Kenny said.“GP Simon Kemp from Daisy Villa has been selected, as one of only six practices in Scotland, to be part of a joint project with NHS Scotland and the Royal College of General Practitioners to develop guidance and help embed virtual appointment within GP practices across Scotland.“Near Me isn#t just about a response to Covid- – it was around before the pandemic. The trick for us is going to be to embed it and it can be the new normal in the future as we continue to protect our community.“For Orkney it has many benefits including providing care closer to home and reducing spend in relation to off island patient travel.“Going forward we will be targeting specialities where we have high numbers of patients travelling – sometimes on a three day round trip. We will work closely with our partner boards to ensure that the recent momentum continues and that the virtual clinic option becomes #business as usual#, where it is clinically appropriate to do so.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He bought a field from William Isbister of Kethesgeo and hired Samuel Baikie. Baikie’s obituary says that he designed the hotel but the local story was that it had been a show-house at the  Glasgow Exhibition. Perhaps the plans came from the Exhibition.Good though the fishing was, John Mackay wanted to make it even better. He got some trout spawn and put the fry he had hatched in a specially built pond at Stairwaddy. A year later, he had a lot of good- sized fish.The hotel opened in June . It had a coffee room, drawing room, smoking room, fteen bedrooms, lavatories and one bathroom. The Orkney Herald thought for beauty and comfort it could not be excelled in the north. The first phone line in Orkney connected the hotel to the Masons Arms and this featured in the advertising.In , Mackay had an “Illustrated Guide to Orkney” printed. The useful information included the charges for Maeshowe:- sixpence for one person one shilling for more than one, up to four persons and for more than four, threepence per person, up to ten shillings, the maximum charge for one party. In WWI, Houton was the main seaplane base but late in  it was decided to increase the number in Orkney from  to , to fight the threat of submarines, and a camp was built in Stenness. The Admiralty had not listened to the locals but soon found out that they were right, and the loch was too shallow. The planes were moved to Houton but the hotel remained the HQ of the Naval Air Service.At the end of WWI, another long running battle restarted, as John Mackay fought the Temperance movement. Stromness was dry from  to  and campaigners were determined that Stenness would be the same. Successive owners promised not to sell drink to locals, but it was no use, the petitions kept coming.John Mackay died in  and the hotel was briefly owned by Mrs Jessie Smith. The Misses Catherine and Jessie Harper from Thurso took it over in , announcing they were going to bring it up to date.Patricia Long is a tourist guide based in Stenness with a particular interest in social history.

They were aimed at informing communities about the process around the closure of their local church, and the future options for the buildings.Unfortunately only the Sand Church event, on the West Side on Thursday th March was able to take place.As a result the Rev Fran Henderson, transition minister for the Shetland parish, has now invited all interested people to take part in an online buildings consultation to ensure all views are reflected.Dr Henderson said: “Ideally, we would have had face-to-face public community meetings about the upcoming closures, but unfortunately only one – at Sand Church – was able to go ahead due to the lockdown measures.“We are concerned that communities need to have their say on what’s going to happen to our church buildings when they are sold, so we have therefore moved our public consultation online.“No guarantees can be made, but alongside our legal duties as charity trustees, all suggestions and requests received will be taken fully into consideration as we make decisions about the future of these buildings and their contents.”The newly launched buildings consultation surveys are composed of  questions each, with some slight iations according to local circumstances. They are open to all interested community members.The first round of surveys to launch, coinciding with the first phaseof the closures, are: St Ninian#s Church in Bigton the Weisdale kirk the Fetlar kirk the Sullom kirk the Fair Isle kirk St Magnus Church at Hamnavoe, South Yell and the Quarff kirk.These surveys will close at midnight on Monday th August while more will launch in the coming months...Jim Tait is news editor at The Shetland Times.The Lounge Bar in Lerwick is set to re-open on Wednesday th July # although they have warned it will be a #very dferent experience##People shielding from coronavirus will no longer have to remain physically distanced from members of their own home from Friday.A man appeared in private at Lerwick Sherf Court on Wednesday on misuse of drugs charges.

this time to do battle in the Glamaig Stableford competition.Only two played in the competition won by Sandi Beatson # that#s three-in-a-row for her.The boys to come out to play and play they most certainly did in earnest competition for the RNLI Shield.There was a very good turnout on the Saturday of this weekend competition with the weather conditions certainly predicted to favour that particular day#s cohort.Covid  restrictions meant that instead of the normal random #draw# for partners players arranged their own #friendship groups# and appropriate tee times on the required booking sheet.Battle commenced # and what a scrap it turned out to be.Five players reduced their handicaps but there could only be one winner, and that was Robert Macaskill.Off the first tee at am his golf was very steady with  bfs required to navigate the outward nine but a miserly  hits required to conclude his great round.His #touch# round the greens was apparently sensitive in the extreme with a chip-in for par on , #up and down# from Billy the Bunker on , a chip-in birdie on  and several other good chances.All in all just a very good, tidy performance. points then for loop one and  points for loop two and that strong finish was to be the decisive factor as his margin of victory was only decided by virtue of the #better inward half# in a photo-finish with good friend and Vice-Captain Ally Young who was to submit his tremendous score in very inclement playing conditions some  hours later!Ally#s two nines, off his  handicap were  and  with a birdie thrown into each loop for good measure and a stableford points conversion for his halves of  and  points respectively.Incidentally, the putter must have been behaving because it holed a  foot putt on the fourth hole and a  footer on the th for #birds#.NB it was the tool and not the workman.Ally also had the consolation of reducing his handicap by two shots # the biggest reduction among the prizewinners # because of the status of his exact handicap which, like all players is calculated to the decimal point.We had enough jargon last week so we#ll let that slip by unnoticed shall we No question his was the better performance in the respective conditions but it#s Robert who will receive the trophy-and quite properly regain the bragging rights in the house of Macaskill.Two points behind the leaders a trio of players each ed very respectable totals of points.Andrew Long made contact with the ball  times on his outward half with the highlight being a good birdie on the dficult th hole and required but  strokes coming home with a remarkable run of ten straight pars from holes  to .John Maclean played steadily, albeit with early drama in his round # a nasty triple-bogey seven on the second hole.Chapfallen  No chance as composure regained he recorded  for his first lap of the circuit followed by  blows next time round.Ross Cumming#s two nines were  and  off his #mark# so in the company of his #old fella# that day he showed who was #the man#.Ross too suffered an early dig in the ribs with a triple bogey on the second hole but also did well to recover and tickle a touch off the handicap on completion of his round.No midweek competition for the gents this time round but the ‘Trouts’ came out to play in a pop-up Seniors Mixed Stableford competition later that week.With outdoor catering billed as an #attraction# for the silver sharpshooters the beau monde of the area swarmed like locusts to the feast.The format for the day was successful as almost  of the area#s finest ladies and gentlemen golfers paraded their skills on a course displaying promising signs of extremely rude health # apart from the reepach humple on the second fairway # and it was to be an overseas raider who was tohome victorious.Ally #Doc# Mackenzie, now domiciled in Plockton was to be #the man# with an extremely comfortable victory following a rich harvest of points in the forgiving Stableford format.His winning total of  points was four clear of Chris Mackinnon in second place.Alaisdair # a #friend# said his father couldn#t spell # rather limped out in  strokes but a fine  off his  mark coming home garnered a whopping  points to add to the earlier  and his unassailable total.Nothing much of interest in the  but an evil nine and an excellent wee two showed the extremes to which our man travelled on his homeward journey.Rumour has it that #our hero# offered to buy free drinks for everyone # in the sure and certain knowledge that with the lockdown still to be relaxed his money was safe!I also have it on good authority that his often misunderstood droll countenance momentarily offered a fleeting smile of satisfaction in victory before swtly and almost immediately reverting to type.Chris Mackinnon started brightly with only three dozen shots required to pilot his ball round the opening nine holes but  coming home with an horrendous triple bogey  on the final hole may have left a wee bit of a bitter taste in the mouth afterwards.Third place went to Dave Webster who ed a very impressive total of  points off his  handicap mark but a few more performances like that and he could be back playing with the big boys again.The size of the field offers a wee bit more scope for reflection and Donalda Johnston found form and Peter Mackenzie, kin to the winner smoothed in one further point behind Dave Webster.Honourable mention too for George Neill who might have #thought he was Archie# having recorded two birdies in his opening seven holes but sadly thereafter the ba# burst.And finally to the mystery of the #Captain#s eagle#.It#s been dficult trying to untangle the whole story occurring as it did in an unofficial, non-counting charity game but a source, when catechised offered the following description -#a Phil Mickelson-type shot landed like a dislodged swan#s feather on the green with precisely the correct velocity to carry it to the hole with not a millimetre to spare#!What preceded the shot that elicited that magniloquent delineation is still to be ascertained. .

But a study last December by research workers at Manchester Universitysuggests that we may have got it all wrong. as we prepare for sleep .Sleep  I should be so lucky.The garden is going frantic the gardener is going frantic: up before six while Janet prepares breakfast – any excuse to disappear from the kitchen armed with a bucket and fork to weed the carrots before sunrise, before the dreaded root-fly snfs out the chemicals on the leaf surface, except that by am, the sun is already up, and so I have to be quick at pulling out the chickweed and replacing the cover.And then there is all that sorrel and rampant grass, and nettles that appear to grow by the inch by the hour, and the Canadian salmonberry that I once planted in desperation for a windbreak  years ago and have spent the last  years regretting, trying in vain to stop it swallowing-up the entire garden, including and especially the onion bed.Flies everywhere buzzing round my head as I try and turn the compost clegs landing on my sweating forearms as I scythe down the salmonberry midges up my nose and in my ears and landing deliberately on my eyelids – deliberately, and biting them – deliberately.And ticks, always ticks, which land and embed themselves behind the knee within minutes of my brushing through the long grass to scythe down the salmonberry yet again, even though I’m wearing trousers tucked tight inside my socks.Solstice: no proper darkness hardly any sleep.Keep meaning to buy some blackout blinds for the bedroom skylights. Expensive.Perhaps a black silk eye pad would be just as good.Dawn chorus at am. I thought I’d come to terms with the chaffinch, except the one that has chosen the electric transmission line as its favourite perch, just opposite our bedroom skylight.All the while, Janet has been sitting calmly with her tablet, bathed in its blue light, trying to find herbal remedies for high blood pressure and lack of sleep, and has come up with green tea and hawthorn tea.But I’m not having it.At least the nights are drawing in, and as Bob Dylan once said, “It’s not dark yet but it’s getting there.”The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until th July .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/EARIE-QUIRAING-5.jpg","title":"local news playparks re open lochcarron power upgrade edf festival","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe £. million investment by Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks includes the construction of a new electricity substation, boosting the resilience and strength of power supplies in Lochcarron, Slumbay, North Strome, Ardanaeskan, Strathcarron, Achintee and Attadale.The six-month long programme of works will benefit approximately  properties.SSEN will be installing a new underground cable along the A, and removing the overhead power line through the Tullich Industrial Estate.The company says it will keep disruption to a minimum but customers can register for SSEN’s Priority Services Registerthey require extra assistance during a power cut.Comhairle nan Eilean Siar is to play host to the online festival via its Facebook page.The Comhairle has been broadcasting weekly Cèilidhs on its Facebook page and welcomes the opportunity to host a range of talented artists who have performed at the festival overOrganiser Roddy MacKay said: “This would have been the fth anniversary of the Festival and we felt it was important to find a way of keeping it going despite the restrictions.

The Eco-Schools Programme is the world’s largest Environmental Education programme and aims to make environmental awareness and action an intrinsic part of the le and ethos of a school. Its participatory approach and combination of learning and action makes it an ideal way for schools to begin improving the environments of schools and their local communities. Eco-Schools work through a simple seven-step process resulting in the programme becoming central to the schools ethos. Schools can choose from ten eco-topics ranging from litter and waste to energy, bioersity and transport to name a few. Eco-Schools work towards achieving awards - bronze, silver and the prestigious Green Flag.The internationally recognised Green Flag is this highest award given to Eco-Schools and symbolises excellence in the field of environmental activity. Over the past two years, pupils of Buick Memorial have been working hard on many initiatives in order to address their chosen topics of Waste, Litter and Bioersity. Together with Eco Coordinators Mrs Carleton and Miss Stirling, they have produced policies on printing, recycling and litter for staff and pupils within the school to follow. Their continued commitment to regular Cash for Clobber collections enabled the school to purchase a number of new bins for the playground. Thanks to Catherine Hunter, Mid and East Antrim Education Officer, the children were able to give each class a bin for food waste, allowing the Eco Club to produce compost for their many planting activities. A highlight of the Eco-School endeavours is the annual litter-pick with Cullybackey Community Partnership and thanks must be given in particular to Margaret Murphy who is always keen to help the children in any way she can. The school is extremely grateful to Cranswick Country Foods for providing a superb wooden structure for the ‘plastic bottle greenhouse’ project and to Barry Tapster, Mid and East Antrim Recycling Officer, for his guidance. This year has been exceptionally busy, with the introduction of a termly ‘Walking Week’ which the pupils and parents have strongly supported. The Eco Club have spent a lot of time tending to the school pond area building mini-beast and frog hotels, making bird feeders and planting flowers for pollinators amongst many other tasks. None of these opportunities would have run as smoothly were it not for the unwavering input from Mr Fleckand the dedication of Ms Harkin . The positive attitude and increased awareness of environmental issues is evident within the school from Nursery through to P and this Green Flag is a welcome acknowledgement of the children’s efforts.The International Eco-Schools Programme is operated in Northern Ireland by Keep Northern Ireland Beautul and is a free to enter programme.

This is entirely within the Education Minister#s remit, and to not consider alternatives as a matter of urgency is both negligent and unfair.Mr Lyttle, her Alliance colleague and education committee chairman, said Mr Weir#s refusal was surprising and unacceptable, and should be reversed.This year#s post-primary transfer tests have been delayed by two weeks because of the coronavirus pandemic.The parents of two children in Northern Ireland have won High Court permission to challenge decisions to delay the tests.Their lawyers argued last month that the decision to delay by a matter of weeks amid so much disruption to their education is unlawful.Meanwhile, a number of Catholic grammars and an integrated school have said they will not use transfer test results to admit pupils in .Belfast Related ContentEditor#s ViewpointEditor#s ViewpointOpinionEducation Minister Peter Weir was wrong to snub worried parentsApart from the NHS, education has been the public service hardest hit by the coronavirus pandemic.

There is a potential for public disorder.The north Belfast parade is one of three to have been so far categorised as sensitive by the commission, which was informed last month by the Attorney General that it had no legal powers to prevent parades from taking place.As the Twelfth falls on a Sunday this year, official demonstrations were due to take place the next day. However, the Orange Order announced in April it would not hold demonstrations due to the pandemic.More than  loyalist bands have made notications to parade between July  and . The watchdog said the Ballysillan notied route includes a parading area with a history of sensitive parades and it had previously received substantial objections to loyalist marches.The parade has been limited to two-and-a-half hours and it is prohibited from certain residential areas, conditions the commission described as proportionate, necessary and fair.It noted the parade organiser had said they were willing to avoid Squires Hill Road and had prepared a banner reminding supporters not to follow the band, adding leaflets echoing the same message had been distributed to households.Meanwhile, the Stoneyford Somme parade has been told by the commission not to enter Stoneyford village on July , and must only last  minutes. The original notication had requested an hour.The same time limit restriction has been imposed on the local Sons of William Flute Band parade, which is to take place on July  and has been ordered to reroute its outward parade, as well as being prohibited from walking itsroute.The commission noted that the respective organisers of the Stoneyford parades had a history of notying paradesthat do not take place, adding both bands have fewany members, and may exist in name only.

This will clary the sequence of events that took place, and what measures the council will take to ensure that a situation like this does not happen again.“The past few months have presented us with enormous challenges in terms of the Covid response, adaptation of our services, and the constant change in guidance and legislation. This has required us to make rapid decisions on many fronts, and in a very complex political landscape.“We pride ourselves in maintaining the integrity of the council in what is at times, a very dficult environment. We and all chief officers have always done our utmost to serve all eight political parties in this council and do our best to serve this city.“We are concerned about certain statements and comments that have been made, and the impact these may have on our roles in Belfast City Council.“We are formally raising these issues with party leaders and the chair of the Strategic Policy and Resources Committee.“Due to an ongoing process, we will not be commenting further.”Meanwhile a special meeting of the council is set to take place on Friday.The meeting was at the request of the DUP group on the council to consider the events of Roselawn on Tuesday June , and discuss steps to be taken.The motion to be discussed by councillors proposes to commission an independent investigation into the incident to provide a written report to the council.PAMost ReadNoah Donohoe dad: The son I never metFor sale!

Molly Elliott died on June . Molly, who lived in the Top of the Hill area of the city, was -years-old. Her sudden death has left her family and many friends heartbroken. Mollys family say they do not want her death to have been in vain, and have urged her friends and other young people to speak to others about problems they are experiencing. Addressing the congregation at Mollys funeral last week, her aunt, Lynn, asked for prayers for all those without hope. googletag.cmd.push “Help all the young people here today, help them Father to talk, to listen, to hear and to seek the help they need. “This is not the answer,you could all just look to your left, to your right, front and back, you will see mums and dads praying this is not coming to their door. “Please, please let our beautul Molly be the last,” she said. Also speaking at Mollys funeral service, Father Michael Canny said she was a person who had time for others and would chat with themthey were feeling down. “Of course, immediate and extended family were important to her,” said Father Canny. googletag.cmd.push “She also was a volunteer at Hillcrest House and involved down through the years in their summer schemes and other things. “The days ahead will be challenging, most of us will go from here but the immediate family will be left on their own to try to pick up the pieces of le again. “It won’t be easy, le will go on, le goes on, but for you le will be much, much dferent. “But at the same time I think you will be able to reflect on Molly and on the dferent rays of sunshine she brought into your lives.” Mollys uncle, Denny Elliott, said she loved giving and receiving hugs. “She was bursting with affection and would give you hugs that you felt the love flowing from her into you. They’ll now stay with us forever,” he said. “She never shut up - ‘wait til you hear’ she’d say and then you’d just listen and not get a word in edgeways. “Those one way conversations will now stay with us forever.” Mr Elliott said his niece was someone who was there for everybody. “Only last week, Mollys best friend felt a wee bit down and did the right thing, reaching out to his best friend Molly, not knowing for the last time. “Come down for a wee chat and a hug, she said. That chat will stay with him forever.” Mr Elliott said Molly loved her family deeply but they were struggling to come to terms with her sudden death. In a direct message to Mollys friends and other young people, he quoted renowned poet Walt Whitman who wrote ‘the powerful play goes on and you may contribute a verse. “What will your verse be ” Mr Elliott asked of young people. “Let Mollys verse be this: No other young person who knew her or reads about her will ever feel the need to end their le but instead reach out all around them and share their fears, doubts and insecurities to their mothers, fathers, siblings, carers and friends and relations.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I have had several queries from dferent sources about why we can’t just go back to normal appointments. I have prepared a short pieceyou wished to publish in your respective papers. Due to COVID- GP practices have had to adapt like everyone . Despite the wishes of staff and patients that we go back to normal services which includes letting people book their own appointments, it just isn’t possible. googletag.cmd.push We have a duty to all patients as well as our staff. Before any attendance at the practice you will be contacted to make sure you do not have COVID- symptoms. This will be similar for any appointments. We must also remind people not to attend any public placeyou are ill as you should be isolating and getting tested. All services like immunisations, and advice regarding any condition can still be accessed. Practices have become very efficient and even our practice staff are triaging calls to help the smooth and speedy delivery of services. We also have new team members, like physios, social workers, pharmacists and mental health workers. It is vital that you are connected to the correct team member to sort out your problem. googletag.cmd.push The reception staff may ask details regarding the problem to help this process. Practices are still asking people to attend the surgery for tests or examination and to avoid unnecessary trips or exposure we are also using things like video consults. Despite the talk about the ending of lockdown, COVID- is not ending. It is still there and will spread unless we continue to take precautions. This means we cannot have waiting rooms full of patients and allow someone to land in with symptoms and possibly infect a whole waiting room. If you attend the surgery you will be asked to wear a mask. It remains good practice to wash your hands regularly and wear a maskout. Despite the end of lock down, high risk patients remain high risk, and while the government restrictions do not apply, personallyI had been shielding I would continue to limit my contact with crowds during to the risk of infection. We do not have a vaccine yet, and according to figures we are nowhere near herd immunity levels, so any thoughts that COVID- is over are premature. This explains why GPs cannot go back to how things were pre-COVID and may not be able to for some time.We thank the public for their support in this.“ Dr Paul Molloy Western LMC Secretary.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

This week I want to highlight the plight of many small businesses across the city and tell you what you can do to help them survive. For the past  weeks many businesses have shut their doors and either furloughed staff or made them redundant. Now, however, is the time to get the economy on this Island back up and running. We cant as a society afford to stay shut any longer. There isnt the option to stay closed and until a vaccine is found. googletag.cmd.push This is just fancul thinking and would bankrupt any economy that attempted this strategy. We must learn to live with the virus within our society and shield the most vulnerable from it. The rest of us must take responsibility for our own protection and follow the guidelines set out by government. Both the British and Irish governments in fairness have risen to the challenge and supported businesses and workers for the last four months. The continuation of this support indefinitely isnt economically sustainable. The cost of the support to date has been largely borrowed by governments and will need to be repaid at some stage by raising taxes. googletag.cmd.push There is no such thing as free money from any government in the world. If you get something from government, it will most certainly will be got back by a tax.  So, lets all accept that we have suppressed the virus and now is the time to re-open our economy and get back to work as best we can in the circumstances. Now let us not forget that many of our local businesses watched in dismay as their income streams totally dried up in March. Over the last three months many have had virtually no income, but bills have still mounted up. Some got reduced rates and rents, however bills unpaid since March are waiting for them now as they open. Landlords will be looking rent again and creditors will be looking paid. The Inland Revenue who has been quiet for a while will be back looking for taxes due for last year and on account for . As these small firms re-open their doors and staff come off government furlough schemes the next few months will either make or break them. They really need our support folks so please support themyou can. Very few businesses havent been affected by this crisis and as the economy begins, the bills may come at them quicker than their customers. There could be a bloodbath in terms of bankruptciesphysical re-opening is ahead of consumer confidence. Many local businesses are opening tentatively not knowingcustomers willin the pre-Covid numbers. For some businesses consumer confidence is their biggest issue. Many customers might shun these businesses for fear of catching the virus. The fear factor is still pretty high amongst some consumer groups, but I hope this is confined just to people that fall into the highest risk of infection . For other businesses like restaurants hairdressers etc. the problem will be the new guidelines and how they effect the delivery of the service and capacity of the business. A good example of this can be seen in the recent price hikes announced by hairdressers in Dublin before they re-opened. With capacity reduced signicantly due to social distancing and the additional costs linked to cleaning hygiene etc. many had to increase prices by as much as %. I dont expect increases of this scale in Derry but I have a lot of sympathy for a business that is forced to increase their prices due to reduced capacity. Its not price gauging and has more to do with the current restrictions and capacity reduction. People shouldnt jump to social media with tales of being robbed or fleeced. Its really a case of pricing to survive for many businesses. These next few weeks will be make or break for many companies re-opening after the lockdown so I believe its our civic duty to do as much as we can to support them. What can we do  The simplest answer is get out there and spendyou can afford it. Put the keyboard down and stop buying online unless you really have to. Book a meal and get out there and enjoy a might out. By doing this you are not only supporting your local restaurant but you’re also helping to preserve jobs. Get up the town and spend a few pound, would be my advice. What we all do over the next few months can make a huge dference and could help save hundreds of jobs in the city. If we dont engage with our local businesses, they will be forced to lay people off. Go out and buy a bed for the spare room. Get that much needed haircut. Take the boyfriend out for that steak dinner. We really have to support local shops, service providers and manufacturers now more than ever. And remember, we can do all of this and stay safewe follow the rules, wear a mask and keep the proper distance. Taking holidays in Ireland or a Staycation will also help. And folks this is not me crying wolf. Huge jobs losses are already occurring across these Islands as we come out of this crisis. Intu Properties, which owns or part-owns  huge shopping centres across the UK and Spain, including the Trafford centre in Manchester, has filed for bankruptcy already last week. It will not the last business casualty of the Covid- crisis. So do your bit folks. Get back out there and spend what you can afford locally, and help keeps jobs in Derry.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

As more and more companies continue to get back to work, we look at how the financial support is helping firms across the nation to adapt, innovate and protect jobs. Here are examples of how companies have been helped, and what support is available. CASE STUDY KERR’S TYRES  AUTO When Covid- struck, one of Northern Ireland’s leading providers of tyres and automotive services, had just invested pound.m in a new head office and distribution centre in Antrim and cash reserves were low. googletag.cmd.push But thanks to their ability to adapt, ersy as well as the invaluable support from the UK Government, Kerr’s Tyres  Auto has been able play a vital role in servicing and keeping the province’s key workers on the road. Managing director Norman Kerr said: “The Antrim site used up our cash reserves and had a big impact on our cash flow. “Unfortunately the coronavirus kicked in three months later, when we still didn’t have a chance to build up any cash reserves that we would normally have. So it had a massive impact on ourselves. “But the problem was we had to continue trading because we supply the food sector and the white delivery van man. So our business had to continue. We had to pay suppliers, we had no choice in it.” googletag.cmd.push However thanks to a UK Government Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme loan of pound, through the Ulster Bank, as well as the furlough scheme, the family-run business was able to remain solvent and save over  jobs. Norman said: “Had we not been able to get the UK Government loan scheme, it would have had a huge impact on our business. Our business, in essence, dropped probably  per cent within the first month. Thankfully that has grown steadily back since then.  ON THE RIGHT ROAD: Norman Kerr, of Kerr’s Tyres  Auto “We also had to furlough  per cent of our staff in month one. As business picked up again and things moved forward, by month two we were probably down to  per cent. “Month three was  per cent working and we hope within the coming weeks we will have nobody left on furlough. But againit wasn’t for furlough, this would have also had a huge impact on cash flow. “Honestly, when you have  staff, it’s a big bill at the end of every month. We would have had no option but to have laid off around  staff and there was nothing we could have done about that. “So the schemes that the UK Government has introduced have been very helpful.” With  branches, including four in the Republic and seven in Northern Ireland, plus a workforce of over , the UK Government schemes also gave Norman and his team the freedom to ersy and keep some of the leading supermarkets and delivery firms up and running. He said: “We had to ersy dramatically in our business. Collection and delivery rather than customers coming to us. “We had to operate a night sht. So we put four breakdown fitters on our night sht rota. That was to cover the likes of Tesco, Asda and the white van man. “The delivery men have been working   because everything is getting delivered at home. So we found the need to have to serve them on a night sht rota.” With over  years business experience, Kerr’s also adapted to ensure Government guidelines were adhered to. Norman said: “Because we did ersication and received the UK Government help we were able to continue to do business and can look forward to the future.” ‘A real letime in this time of crisis’ CASE STUDY MADEMOISELLE MACARON Rachel Hanretty, of Mademoiselle Macaron, fell in love with macarons while living in Paris. Once Rachel ed to Edinburgh and noticed a gap in the market, she decided to set up her very own macaron business. After nine months of trading from home and going to food markets, Rachel set up her first bricks-and-mortar store. She said: “It was in the centre of Edinburgh, it had a view of the castle. It was beautul.” But since launching their online store in , and realising that they could send macarons across the country, plus the fact that they had large bookings from both wholesale and wedding customers, the bricks and mortar became unnecessary. The company, which employs eight people, lost all their wholesale customers overnight due to Coronavirus. Rachel said: “It was really scary. All the weddings, all the wholesale customers, and the bulk of our production disappeared. And then, of course, you have phone calls from people wanting to cancel future orders and refunds.  TASTY TREATS: Rachel Hanretty, below, has used the furlough scheme to keep Mademoiselle Macaron going  “We entered the cash flow situation whereby the wholesale customers stopped paying the invoices. And we’ve now got over pound, worth of overdue invoices.” But, it’s not all doom and gloom, as Mademoiselle Macaron has started to see an increase in online orders. It’s thanks to the UK Government’s furlough scheme that her business has kept afloat. Rachel said: “The furlough scheme has been a real leline in this time of crisis. I asked people to volunteer for furlough. So the people who wanted to and were happy to, they were the first ones to go.”   ‘We paid creditors and maintained relationships’ CASE STUDY THE SEREN COLLECTION With plans for a new spa at his five-star hotel, a Michelin-star chef in his restaurant and the launch of a tour operator business underway, Neil Kedward was looking forward to a good year in . But when the Covid- pandemic struck, the managing director of Wales-based The Seren Collection required urgent assistance from the UK Government’s support schemes to pay his creditors and maintain supplier relationships. Mr Kedward and his we Zoe entered the hospitality industry almost by accident in . He said: “We just happened to come home to South Wales for the weekend and stumbled across The Grove. It was a calamitous trip with lots of wrong turns and family arguments, but we found the owner in, made our offer and that was that.”  FINANCIAL AID: Neil Kedward, of The Seren Collection Neil and Zoe went on to open two restaurants in Saundersfoot and Oxwich on the back of the success of The Grove. Asthat weren’t enough to keep the team busy, he also spotted a gap in the tour operator market. Neil said: “ It struck me that there weren’t enough tour operators bringing people into the country. So we started a business called routescape, which had a hugely encouraging start, launching at World Travel Market before a big business development trip in . And then, of course, the whole project was wiped out by the virus. We lost every single booking. “The loan from the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme has allowed us to pay off all our creditors and we will be able to relaunch owing nobody any money.” Help available to companies and workers Here are some examples of the support available for businesses and workers. middot The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has enabled businesses to put employees on a period of temporary leaveand apply for a UK Government grant to cover  per cent of those workers’ usual monthly wage costs, up to pound, a month. middot The Self-Employment Income Support Scheme will allow eligible self-employed iniduals to claim a taxable grant of  per cent of their average monthly profits, up to pound,. middot UK VAT-registered firms have been given the option to defer VAT payments until the end of June.

The Derry News has learned that planners at Derry City and Strabane District Council have recommended that planning permission be granted for the store.

In its planning submissions, Lidl said that they wanted to build a new larger store in Derry because of the lack of expansion space at its present store. The proposed new store would have much more parking facilities. The entrance to the new store would be via the Springtown Road which would reduce the traffic pressure on the busy Buncrana Road.

Marie Lindsay is to step down as principal of St Marys College. Among those to pay tribute to her work was a spokesperson for St Eugenes Cathedral. A parish spokesperson said Mrs Lindsay had a great impact on the lives of students and staff through her leadership in St Marys College. She has also directly advanced the mission of evangelisation of the Church here in the Diocese of Derry. As an educator and leader, Marie has made an exceptional contribution to Catholic education here in the City and beyond. Marie, on behalf of everyone in the St Eugenes Parish we wish you very well in your retirement, the spokesperson added. googletag.cmd.push Mrs Lindsay joined St Marys in  and taught science for  years before being appointed principal in . During her time as principal, St Marys were involved in the first formal Shared Education Programme with Lisneal College. In , the school was awarded Specialist Status in Science and continues to promote STEM subjects and career paths. In , Mrs Lindsay was named Principal of the Year at the Foyle Blackboard Awards and in April  she was inducted into the Business Excellence Hall of Fame. Derrys Mayor Brian Tierney said Mrs Lindsay had done so much for education within the city. googletag.cmd.push Its with great pleasure that I offer my congratulations to Marie on her retirement, and with great admiration that I look back on everything that she has achieved both as teacher and, later, as a principal at St Marys College. Marie perfectly captured everything that teaching is about as she went above and beyond every day to put the needs of her students first. She was incredibly active within the community, including on our Council Education and Skills working group, to ensure that those not just within her own school, but across the district also,were receiving the best education they could. With two of her daughters recently welcoming a set of twins each Im sure she will certainly be kept very busy, and I look forward to welcoming Marie, her husband Collie and her family to the Mayors Parlour to celebrate her career when the guidelines allow it. I wish Marie a healthy and happy retirement, and offer my sincere thanks to her for everything she has done for theeducation sectorin our district.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Bernadette Radclfe, from the Brandywell, bought a ticket for a competition to win a black Lamborghini Gallardo on a whim when she saw it advertised on social media. Mrs Radclfe had just a one in , chance of winning the prize from Derry company Vogue Competitions She couldnt believe her luck when she got a call from Derry singer and entertainer Micky Doherty who had picked her name out using a computerised random number generator. Micky then paid a surprise visit to Bernadette who was celebrating with a cup of tea at her sister Siobhans house in Galliagh Park. googletag.cmd.push Shes doesnt drink, she doesnt smoke and she doesnt drive so she was celebrating with a cup of tea and a Club biscuit, laughed Micky. Anybody  would be drinking a bucket of vodka. Micky said he was delighted Mrs Radclfe had won the prize because shes a lovely person. Shes from the Lecky Road which is where my mother was from so it was very special to me. At first I didnt recognise her name because I would know her as Bernie, but then I realised that I know her and all her sisters for a long time. Shes a lovely person and a real lady. googletag.cmd.push I always say nice things happen to nice people. Earlier that day Bernie was out handing out candles of Sister Clareand I said a wee prayer to Sr Clare before I picked the winner that I would pick the person that deserved it. She works in mysterious ways. The Lamborghini was part of a three part prize draw that also included a Rolex watch which was won by Niall McDaid from Bishops Street from a pound ticket and a lawn mower which went to Patrick McDaid from Rosemount who purchased a ticket for pound. Blaine Tierney of Vogue Competitions and Vogue Car sales in Springtown has given away a large number of cars in competitions since lockdown began in March. The Lamborghini is our biggest giveaway yet, its an amazing car and it would cost pound, new, he said. Its brilliant to be able to give people le changing prizes and the majority of the prize winners have been from Derry.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

There will be no official Orange Order parades after the organisation announced their cancellation earlier this year. Grand Secretary of the Orange Order, Mervyn Gibson, urged people to stay at home, while the Order have launched a ‘Twelfth at Home’ campaign to urge people to celebrate safely. “This year the Twelfth is about everyone’s health. You have to understand why we cancelled the parades. Parades attract large crowds,” he said. “Bandsmen will simply be going into a village or an estate or a street and playing some music. googletag.cmd.push “We would be saying to everyone to stay at your door, stay in your garden, listen to them and enjoy, butyou see a band, please don’t follow them.” The Parades Commission list for July  includes parades in Maghera, Moneymore, Limavady, Garvagh, Articlave, Tobermore and Magherafelt. Two separate bands will parade in Coleraine, Castledawson and Macosquin, but none will take place simultaneously. Numbers of participants have been capped at , with ten of the thirteen bands applying for the maximum amount, while all but one list the number of planned supporters as . The exception is in Magherafelt, where the Ballymoughan Purple Guards Flute Band have specied an ‘unknown’ number of supporters will be attending the parade. googletag.cmd.push Maghera Sons of William Flute Band said no members of their local Orange Lodge would be parading with the band. “No members of MSOW LOL will be on parade with the band,” they said in a post on their Facebook page. “Social distancing protocol will be followed, and we ask members of the public not to gather around the area of the Orange Hall. “The route is the longest we can do, taking in the majority of the town. We encourage you to stay in your gardens and enjoy the time with your family as the band passes by.” The Ulster Bands Forum, an online  for marching bands, have issued a plea for supporters to protect themselves and the bands. “Bands are going to a lot of effort for you, please afford them the same respect and support,” they said. “Dont follow the band, they will make every effort to come to you. Do not travel outside your local area to see bands. “If you need to use a car to see your local band, stay inside and park safely. Observe social distancing measures at all times. Dont invite all and sundry to your garden. “Lets hold our heads high after this and be able to say we respected and observed our culture whilst staying within the law,” the statement concluded. Mid Ulster District Councillor Paul McLean said the bands have made it clear that everyone should obey safety guidelines. The DUP group on Mid Ulster Council believe bands that have organised such events are clear that they wish everyone to abide by the social distancing regulations and guidelines, he said. They will bring the Twelfth to the community who they ask remain in their homes and gardens and not to participate in the parade.I welcome the bands’ commitment to celebrate proudly and safely and I would ask everyone to do as they have asked. Abiding by the regulations and guidelines ensures our friends, our familIes and our neighbours are protected and demonstrates the ongoing commitment to our NHS.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

culturersquo in Comber have been unveiled.A meeting to discuss the way forward was held in the town on Monday morning, with Ards and North Down Council officials joined by Chamber of Commerce representatives and local councillor Deborah Girvan.Work has been ongoing to develop a strategy on the way forward for Comber as coronavirus lockdown measures continue to ease, with more and more businesses reopening after being closed for four months.News of Mondayrsquos meeting comes ahead of the reopening of the hugely popular Comber Farmersrsquo Market tomorrow which also coincides with its sixth anniversary.A special cake will be cut by council chairman Trevor Cummings who will be joined by Northern Ireland Officer Minister of State Robin Walker.The market has been closed for the past three months as a result of Covid- with its reopening viewed as a boost for existing traders who will benefit from the increased footfall.Alderman Girvan mdash who arranged Mondayrsquos meeting in conjunction with Comber Chamber of Commerce mdash said cafes, restaurants and pubs have been among the hardest hit industries during the coronavirus pandemic.And with the hospitality businesses able to open their doors to the public this Friday, she thought that it would be beneficial to meet with the council to see what support it give to catering businesses to allow food to be served outdoors on pavements.ldquoEven though the two-metre social distancing rule will be halved, it will still be dficult for hospitality businesses to increase their capacity unless they expand outdoors, said Mrs Girvan.ldquoComber is the perfect place to introduce a cafeacute culture as there are wide footpaths on three sides of the town square and,permission for this is granted, it will create a kaleidoscope of colourful tables, chairs and umbrella shades.Mrs Girvan hopes that it will also attract more shoppers, cyclists and visitors to Comber as it slowly emerges out of lockdown.She also recognises that before anything happens, there are many issues to consider and for consultation with residents and businesses, describing Mondayrsquos meeting as a ldquofirst step to explore the opportunities and possibilities of reconfiguring footpaths to ensure the safety of visitors, shoppers, and cyclists.News of the cafe culture plan comes just days after the local council agreed to help hospitality businesses back on their feet by waiving the pound fee for a so-called pavement cafeacute licence fee, initially for nine months.Comber Chamber of Commerce chairwoman Laura Bradley, who is also director of the Indie Fude delicatessen, described the past few as ldquoextremely dficult for retailers across Northern Ireland.She said apart from shops that are selling food and drink, the majority of businesses in Comber have been closed for almost four months.ldquoComber has been branded the lsquohome of great tastersquo and the town has built up a strong reputation for producing, cooking and serving excellent food, continued Laura.ldquoWe have the monthly artisan farmersrsquo market, award winning restaurants, cafes and food shops, and a discerning customer base which comes from far and wide to avail of high quality, locally grown produce.The Chamber chairwoman said she had no doubt that creating a cafeacute culture will not only help all the businesses in Comber, but also help build upon the success of the food industry that is firmly established in the area..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd July 2020

resumption of church services after they were suspended  weeks ago due to the Covid- pandemic.Services resumed on Monday after the Northern Ireland Executive announced that public worship could restart.While the parish priest of Castlewellan and Kilcoo, Fr Denis McKinley, was happy to be finally able to celebrate Mass again with his parishioners he said he remained apprehensive over some peoplersquos reluctance to follow social distancing.He said: ldquoI have noticed people are getting fed up with adhering to government guidelines especially over the course of a wake and a funeral. They seem reluctant to continue with the measures that are in place.ldquoI fear the ramications for a further spike in virus casestoo many people all come at once. I would hate to have to turn people away because there are too many already attending Mass. That would only serve to hurt people and I donrsquot want to offend anyone.Fr McKinley suggested that he may have to develop a whole new regime to facilitate parishioners attending Mass and receiving communion.He added: ldquoI have no problem with weekday Masses as the numbers who attend are certainly more manageable. However, I would much prefer to continue to celebrate Mass online on Sundays and distribute Holy Communion at the back doors of the church at a scheduled time later on that day.ldquoWhen the R rate of the virus s to zero and the threat of contamination ceases we will be a lot more relaxed about ato normality. Until then we will be monitoring the situation carefully.The Rev Owen Patterson, minister of Downpatrick Presbyterian Church, shared Fr McKinleyrsquos reservations.He said: ldquoWhile I welcome ato normality some members of our congregation are either elderly or already have underlying conditions that would make them more susceptible to the virus.ldquoWe have found our online worship on Sunday mornings has proved extremely popular. We have many more people tuning in online than we other wise would have had attending our services in Church.ldquoHopefully, we will have an increased congregation when weto Sunday worship in church. We will begin introducing services slowly but without offering a creche or Sunday School to begin with. We will review the situation carefully in August.Mr Patterson said provision had been made to have the church ready to facilitate the resumption of services.He added: ldquoWe have established pens for families who can sit together for worship and sectioned off other seating areas for the more vulnerable. Sermons will also be kept short.He said that anyone wishing to view their Sunday worship online can log on to downpatrickpresbyterian.org or visit their Facebook page for live streaming.The Dean of Down Cathedral, the Very Rev Henry Hull, said he was looking forward to beginning public worship again and welcoming everyone back this Sunday.However, he urged anyone feeling unwell not to come to church.In a letter to parishioners he said: ldquoTheto worship will be on a phased basis beginning with some of the larger churches first.ldquoWe will also adopt a dferent pattern of service times during the summer period, spreading services throughout the day.He added that face coverings were not a requirement at this stage..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd July 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Driving force  ","story":"TEENAGE motor racing sensation Daniel Harper has successfully tackled the world famous Nurburgring race circuit in Germany.The  year-old from Annahilt drove the notoriously dficult -mile track for the first time when he made his debut outing in the Nurburgring Endurance Series with the BMW Junior Team.Afterwards he described it as an ldquoinvaluable learning experience, despite an unfortunate technical problem which meant he couldnrsquot contest the race itself.Harper, who has enjoyed a meteoric rise in motorsport was announced as a member of the coveted BMW Junior Team programme in January.He was completing an extensive pre-season training schedule when the coronavirus pandemic led to the postponement of the programme in March.At the start of June, he ed to Germany and last week he drove the Nurburgring mdash scene of some of motor racingrsquos greatest feats mdash as he successfully completed his DMSB permit test for the track.For the opening race event, Harper and his team-mates shared a BMW Mi Racing, the German manufacturerrsquos potent, entry-level car.

There are over , megaliths in Europe alone but the one outside Killyleagh is quite possibly the most recent of them all.It was erected in  with one thousand young people raising the so-called Strangford Stone using only their bare hands and a lot of scientic know-how.Joe speaks to the people involved in the original design and installation of the stone which was a feat in civil, mechanical and electrical engineering.Safety was a massive consideration, given that , young people were to be on site pulling the stone upright by hand into position.It is certainly a very special monument, not only because itrsquos a Millennium Stone, but also because of the remarkable way in which it was erected.Among those whom Joe talks to are Saintfieldrsquos Martyn Todd, who was heavily involved in the megalith project. His daughter, Katy, one of the volunteers who helped pull the giant stone into place.The tallest megalith in the British Isles faces the Mourne Mountains from where it was excavated.After being quarried in the Mournes, the huge stone was transported by road to the country park and was described by the Millennium Commission as ldquoone of the simplest and most directly appealing of all the year  projects.Four years before it was hauled into place, a group of people decided to bring , young people together to celebrate the start of a new millennium by pulling up the stone.They hoped, as the peace process was gaining momentum, to involve young people from all backgrounds in Northern Ireland to create a lasting testament to a shared future.In November , the Millennium Commission awarded pound, to the Strangford Stone project, with the remaining costs donated as contributions in kind by all the people who worked on it.The former Down Council gave permission for Delamont to become home to the stone which is located on an elevated site which boasts superb views over Strangford Lough and towards Slieve Croob and the Mountains of Mourne.The McConnell family quarried a single block of granite weighing over  tonnes mdash the largest ever-quarried in Ireland mdash trimmed it along the grain of rock, using the ancient plug and feathers technique, to its smallest natural size, twelve and a half metres long.However, during the trimming, a weakness in the granite was discovered, resulting in the stone being split into two parts and then rejoined with three stainless steel dowels.A special steel cradle to support the stone during the pull was designed, as were special low-stretch ropes, a hydraulic safety system and the three metres deep concrete foundation for the stone.

They can afford to employ a mountain guide like me. Doing the Matterhorn and Eiger are much more technical guiding as it on a one to one ratio.ldquoMont Blanc is mostly snow and ice and really exposed with some sections of scrambling where with the Matterhorn, you are pretty much on your hands from the start all the way to the top and all the way back down.Mont Blanc at , metres is the high European peak outside Russia and a mountain that Paul has come to know very well. He prefers to take his clients up later during the day, descending near sunset, to avoid the growing numbers of commercial climbers.Supported by the French government during lockdown from March , Paul has been able toto guiding over the last six weeks but he was still hampered by the fact says that British and Irish people were unable to fly.Born in Vancouver to Northern Ireland parents who emigrated to Canada to escape the Troubles, Paul was  when the announcement of the first IRA ceasefire came in . A year later the family moved back and decided to settle in Newcastle.He was one of the first students to attend Shimna Integrated College at its current King Street site in Newcastle and within years Paul showed his love of the outdoors, particularly mountains.ldquoMy dad and I used to walk in the Mourne mountains, he said. ldquoI had skied in Canada, but really got into the mountains back home.ldquoMy first experience of rock climbing was being taken to Altnadue Quarry just outside Castlewellan by a family friend and I just loved it.ldquoWhile I had played soccer and done a bit of running for the school, I wasnrsquot really into sports. It was around my fth year that I really veered to be more interested in outdoor pursuits. I really didnrsquot knowI wanted it as a career but after getting into climbing, it did shape what options that I was interested in.Paul went on to do a degree in outdoor education at the University of Central Lancashire and made the Tollymore National Outdoor Centre his second home when he ed home during holidays and post-college.Once he completed college, his time was split between taking climbing and outdoor pursuit courses back home. While working in France, he would ski and climb during the day in the Alps and work in bars at night, with the sole focus of funding trips such as climbing El Capitan twice or climbing in Patagonia.He went on to become a guide with the International Federation of Mountain Guides Associations, which is the highest recognised mountaineering qualication in the world and the only qualication valid to work outside the UK and Ireland for climbing and off-piste skiing on glaciated terrain.Paulrsquos only salaried job to date was as a youth development officer for Mountaineering Ireland for four years from  based out of Tollymore where he taught young climbers the importance of enjoying the mountains responsibly and safely.Paul said: ldquoI worked every minute I could freelancing to fund the next trip and when I ran out of money, I came back home to work again. Up until my late s, I never thought much about the future, it was just living for the moment.ldquoIrsquove never really had a secure income until I had the Mountaineering Ireland job and it allowed me to buy a house in Castlewellan.While his responsibility to provide for his family is uppermost in his mind, Paul is not yet finished with his need to climb and explore mdash although, interestingly, the worldrsquos highest mountain, Everest, is not on his wish list.ldquoTherersquos a letime of climbs that I would love to do, said Paul. ldquoI love to go back to Patagonia in Argentina to climb Cerro Torre, which for me is the most beautul mountain in the world every climber dreams of standing on top of it. Or the Blasket Islands innorthern Canada would be quite high on my list.ldquoEverest has never appealed to me to go and climb as itrsquos not very dficult technically now. Itrsquos a challenge due to the seriousness of the weather and acclimatising to the attitude makes an extremely serious mountain because of its height.ldquoBut I donrsquot think you need a huge amount of skill to get up Everest and I donrsquot believe you actually have to be a rock climber. You do need to be fit and to be able to acclimatise your body to altitude and you need to have a lot of money.His friend and mentor Dawson Stelfox mdash who became the first Irish man to ascend Everest on his own in May,  mdash is something of a trailblazer to Paul.ldquoI didnrsquot realise that in , when Dawson made the summit on his own, there were no fixed ropes as there are today, there wasnrsquot the support from Sherpas and so on, said Paul.ldquoThat would appeal to meEverest was like that now, then I would love to go. But I donrsquot want to and sit and wait in a queue of  people to get to the top of the mountain.ldquoI really like to explore and there would need to be technical challenge to it as well, apart from overcoming the physical challenges and altitude.ldquoIf you were to take El Cap and put it somewhere a bit remote where it would take you a couple of days to get to it and very few people have climbed it, you would have about , metres of vertical rock to climb.

Powys.NRW proposed the dam as one option to alleviate potential flood risk.More NewsVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldMillions become unpaid carers due to coronavirus crisisPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownThe campaign by the Save Dinas Powys Woods and Protect Homes from Flooding group was launched in March  after the Woodland Trust said NRW was proposing to build a dam within its site of Cwm George and Casehill Woods.The group said the proposals would involve cutting down  square metres of trees including  square metres of ancient trees and regular flooding upstream during high rainfall would result in further destruction of ancient trees, hedgerows, wildle, and plants.Dormice and other protected species like bats were at risk, the group said.The woods, much-loved by the community, attracts visitors from other areas and is the Woodland Trustrsquos most visited site in Wales with more than , visitors.Hundreds of people took part in marches in  to oppose the dam.NRW released its draft Outline Business Case in February  and a consultation period with the local community took place.Hundreds of people attended a meeting in February to oppose the dam and they wrote to NRW, with their views, during the coronavirus lockdown.Chairman of Save Dinas Powys Woods  Protect Homes From Flooding, Peter Smith said the group welcomed the announcement that NRW will not develop a dam in the Dinas Powys Woods.ldquoLocal people recognise the flood risk in the village, but are overwhelmingly in favour of a natural flood management programmein the Cadoxton River and Eastbrook catchments, plus improved channel maintenance andrequired local hard defences, rather than an environmentally unfriendly dam, Dr Smith said.ldquoOur proposals will slow the flow of the rivers upstream thus reducing the risk of flash flooding, and by removing obstacles improve flow downstream.ldquoWe now look forward to working with NRW and The Woodland Trust to design an effective NFM scheme.ldquoBoth have expertise in this area, and, having made funds available for NFM projects, we know that the Welsh Government is keen for Wales to become an exemplar of good practice. community involvement and support will remain key features of our campaign.He added: ldquoWe are grateful to people far and wide who have supported our campaign, including the Woodland Trust, our local community councils, and county councillors.ldquoWe extend our particular thanks our local MS, Jane Hutt, for her advocacy and support.Community councillor, Chris Franks said NRW must not now ignore any problems.ldquoClearly over the years there has been reduced spending on maintenance of the stream through Dinas Powys and towards Barry, he said.ldquoThe public has said that the NRW must improve monitoring of flows on the Cadoxton River, implement natural flood management measures and improve flow at Cardf Road bridge where the stream passes under the A to reduce flood risk.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquolsquoFollowing our meeting on May  Sir David Henshaw chairman of NRW wrote to me on May  to say that NRW received almost  responses to our consultation on the Outline Business Case with the vast majority being opposed to the upstream storage option on the Cadoxton Brook.NRW chairman, Sir Henshaw said: ldquoWhen we consider the marginal case for this option, it is therefore clear that we will not be pursuing an upstream storage scheme. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url

has spoken of the plight of rural communities during lockdown in Uganda.Three months ago, Jenipher Wetaka Sambazi, a Fairtrade coffee farmer from the Mt Elgon region in Uganda, was sharing her experiences of the benefit of Fairtrade in Penarthrsquos Tabernacle Baptist Church.More NewsVictory in campaign to save Dinas Powys ancient woodland as dam plan is abandonedVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownNow she and her family, like communities around the world, are under lockdown.In March, campaigners, businesses, supporters, and students from around Wales heard Jenipherrsquos story, face to face.Now she is unable to travel or even meet with her neighbours.This means the coffee picked at the end of the last harvest remains on the mountain and Jenipher and her fellow farmers are prohibited from travelling to gather it for processing under the current lockdown rules.There are currently several hundred known cases of covid- in Uganda, but none in the Mount Elgon region and no fatalities in Uganda as yet.Farmers want to keep it this way, but lockdown is causing other concerns such as limiting access to food and healthcare.This is the time of year when there is the least amount of food available, and the closing of markets and freedom to travel for farmers to source food and water means that times are exceptionally hard.Jenipher as vice-chairwoman of a Fairtrade coffee cooperative, is responsible for many who rely on the cooperative for work.The expert hand-sorters who are seasonal workers and rely on this part of the coffee chain to feed their family at this time, have no coffee to sort.While they may have some spare eggs, vegetables or matoke to trade, the threat of soldiers prohibiting them from doing so is too much for them.Farmer co-operatives, an essential element of Fairtrade, enable and encourage communities to work together.Fairtrade also requires an extra amount of money, the Fairtrade premium, to be paid to producers.Fairtrade farmers like Jenipher are struggling, but they have the benefits of a strong local community as well as the backup of the Fairtrade premium.Fairtrade International have announced a .m euro Fairtrade Producer Relief fund targeting the immediate needs and Resilience Fund to help producers rebuild their businesses after Covid-.Jenipher Wettaka Sambazi said: ldquoLe is hard.ldquoThe markets are shut so there is nowhere to sell or earn money, or to buy food and basic essentials.ldquoLocal health centres have been shut to reduce the chance of spreading the virus, but since all transport is banned, those who need operations, treatment or antenatal care need to walk  km to the nearest hospital.ldquoTwo women and their unborn babies have died on the way.\"Roger Casey, who attends Tabernacle Baptist Church said: ldquoIt was wonderful to meet Jenipher and hear her story.ldquoWe get through a lot of coffee in our office and meeting a real coffee farmer from Uganda makes you think about the real people and real lives behind that Fairtrade logo.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquoMeeting Jenipher during her visit to Wales earlier this year was inspiring.ldquoThe increasing dficulties facing rural farming communities because of the pandemic has shown how important Fairtrade cooperatives continue to be and I am glad that leaders like Jenipher continue to promote the benefits of Fairtrade and to support communities.National co-ordinator of Fair Trade Wales, Aileen Burmeister added: ldquoFair Trade producers are being impacted by covid- restrictions.ldquoGlobal stock markets are falling, meaning that farmers and workers are receiving far less for their produce.\"It is in these times that we can really see how important the Fairtrade minimum price is. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey

It centres on long-standing racism and disadvantage, and the lack of BAME representation within decision-making processes,\" said Professor Ogbonna, who is also a trustee and vice-chair of Race Council Wales.ldquoThe coronavirus pandemic is, in some respects, revealing the consequences of a lack of action on race equality.ldquoMany of the issues wersquove highlighted have been identied and discussed previously, but they havenrsquot been addressed in any systematic and sustained way.Analysis of Covid- related deaths across England and Wales by ethnicity showed that people from a black ethnic background are at a greater risk of death involving COVID- than all other ethnic groups.The Office for National Statistics study showe that the risk for black males has been more than three times higher than white males, and nearly two-and-a-half times higher for black females than white.Adjusting for socio-economic factors and geographical location partly explains the increased risk, but there remains twice the risk for black males and around one-and-a-half times for black females.

have seen a massive increase in areas such as recycling and waste.The other area of increased spending is in social services, which normally spends around  per cent of our budget.\"That is going to go up dramatically because people are getting frailer and succumbing to covid- and we are also supporting people in care homes and providing PPE for our staff and the care homes.Overall the virus is

while the council takes steps to mitigate further issues.A meeting with residents and the local community council was held on Tuesday, June  to explain the steps the council would be taking, in the

From this date, passengers travelling on most bus, train and ferry services in Northern Ireland will be required to wear a face covering. Face coverings will also be required in public transport stations. There will be exemptions for those who are not able to wear a face covering for health and medical reasons, and for children under the age of . Outdoor areas of a ferry where social distancing can be maintained will be exempt from the requirements, along with school transport.  The Executive has agreed that the cross-departmental group that has been established to consider face coverings will engage with the tour coach and taxi industry to explore extending the requirement to these transport modes. Making the announcement, Minister Nichola Mallon said: “As we move through the Executive’s recovery plan, more and more of the economy and society is opening up. Wemust remember however that Covid- is still with us. We need to remain vigilant and continue to play our part in controlling the virus to protect ourselves and others. “As restrictions on our movement are eased, the safety of passengers and staff remains my priority.The evidence suggests that you can reduce the risk of spreading the virus by wearing a face covering. That is why, with the support of my Executive colleagues and the unions, I am announcing that face coverings will be mandatory on public transport, from Friday July th. “The requirement will apply to passengers and also staff in public areas who are not protected by a screen. However, there will be exemptions for those who are not able to wear a face covering for specic health and medical reasons.” A face covering is a covering of any type which covers a person’s nose and mouth it does not have to be a surgical face mask. While face coverings can offer protection to others, they are not a substitute for other protective measures and it is important that people continue to follow social distancing and wash or sanitise hands regularly. Minister Mallon continued: “We are asking you to take personal responsibility and do the right thing to protect the health and well-being of others. The fact of the matter is you can spread the virus to other more vulnerable people without even knowing you have it. By wearing a face covering you are showing your support and consideration for other passengers and staff. “It is important to be aware that wearing face coverings will not be suitable for all members of the public and we need to be sensitive to this and know that reasons for not wearing a face covering may not always be visible. “Advice will be available on nidirect and social media channels. Translink staffwill begin preparing commuters for the requirement to wear face coverings. “It is also important that you do not get a  sense of security about the level of protection a face covering offers. They are not a substitute for social distancing or good hand hygiene. While I know many will find it challenging in the coming days and weeks to keep up compliance with the rules, I want to applaud the public for their leadership. The public have done the heavy lting and kept us all safe. You have been the leaders in Northern Ireland fighting Covid- and I am asking you to keep it up and we will beat this together. “By acting together and thinking of each other we can reduce the risk of transmission.”  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_babddaabcca   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_bbbbcebbaaceefbc   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/258/172/true/GN4_DAT_3132859.jpg--.jpg?1589969356000\\","title":"castlederg security alert ends ","story":"A security alert at Millbrook Gardens in Castlederg has ended, and a suspicious object which was examined at the scene, declared a hoax.
