The Duke of Sussex brusquely rips up royal unity again by saying deal is NOT what he wanted, writes RICHARD KAYWere these the first cracks in the highly polished exterior, an unmistakably emotional outburst ripping up the carefully choreographed royal script and, for the first time, appearing to directly question the agreement struck with his grandmother the Queen?Privately, friends insisted he was doing no more than clarifying his position when he forthrightly spoke out about his future at a dinner in a fashionable restaurant.But others around Prince Harry fear it was a sign of something more fragile, something that has echoes of his late mother Princess Diana.With the ink barely dry on the deal that allows him to escape the straitjacket of being a working royal, Harry\u0027s sudden decision to use a private event to pass a very public judgement on it was not just discourteous to the Royal Family, but also dramatically undermined the harmonious accord it had been presented as hours earlier.         Above all Harry\u0027s speech demonstrated how raw and how unpredictable the drama over his and Meghan\u0027s split from the royals really isNo wonder there was consternation at the Palace yesterday. Above all Harry\u0027s speech demonstrated how raw and how unpredictable the drama over his and Meghan\u0027s split from the royals really is.Harry\u0027s intervention has been likened to that of a merger between two companies when, after it has been successfully concluded, the chief executive of one of the firms suddenly announces \u0027this isn\u0027t what I wanted\u0027, blindsiding directors, shareholders and workers.His remarks – included in a speech he delivered on Sunday evening at a glossy event at Chelsea\u0027s Ivy Garden in aid of the charity Sentebale, which he founded to honour his mother\u0027s legacy supporting those affected by Aids and HIV in the African kingdom of Lesotho – addressed the crisis over his future head on.Coming just 24 hours after he had apparently signed off on the agreement struck between him, the Queen and his father Prince Charles, Harry\u0027s anguish couldn\u0027t be clearer: he was telling the world that this was not what he wanted.He had, he said, hoped to continue to serve the Queen and Commonwealth and, crucially, retain his military associations.\u0027Unfortunately that wasn\u0027t possible,\u0027 he declared.For all his optimism about leaps into the future, it was a speech tinged with regret. \u0027It brings me great sadness that it has come to this,\u0027 he said at one point.           The Harry I know will be desperately torn over the repercussions of his decision to walk awaySomething, surely, with which the Queen would heartily agree.Her Majesty may be less pleased, however, that her grandson decided to speak out at all. In her own measured and generous statement the previous evening, the Queen deliberately spoke warmly of Meghan, describing her pride at how quickly the 38-year old duchess has become \u0027one of the family\u0027.And in promising that Harry, Meghan and their son Archie would always be \u0027much-loved\u0027 members of the Royal Family, she was mapping out a future in which they would not be exiled. These words were intended to be conciliatory, a peace-making gesture.Did Harry wilfully misinterpret this kindness or was he simply hell-bent on showing that his exclusion from those aspects of his royal life which mean the most to him was not his doing?As someone who has followed the fortunes of Prince Harry for this newspaper since his first day at nursery school, I would like to think that it is the latter.Less charitable voices within the Queen\u0027s household are not so sure. One figure suggested that at the very least Harry had demonstrated an act of incivility to both his father and his grandmother.This was hardly the first time Harry has so brusquely intervened as the crisis unfolded in ways not to his liking.It is almost two weeks ago that he sensationally announced that he and Meghan were quitting their frontline royal roles – without forewarning the Queen, Prince Charles or Prince William. Indeed, the first the Queen learned of it was from an evening television news bulletin.The reaction of the Queen – and Charles – since has been informed by their desire to avoid repeating the mistakes that occurred with Harry\u0027s mother over her split from the Prince of Wales.Almost exactly 24 years ago the long-term discussions about Diana\u0027s future also erupted into the public consciousness with the princess accusing the Palace of playing \u0027ping-pong\u0027 with her.It concerned her status as a orced woman outside the Royal Family and also pivoted on a title, in her case the style Her Royal Highness. Like Harry, she viewed the handling of her issue quite differently from the Palace.Royal officials claimed she had offered to surrender the HRH title without duress. Diana angrily disagreed insisting it had been a \u0027pre-condition to any orce negotiation\u0027.The Palace hit back with a chastening statement oozing with disdain, which spelt out that it did not \u0027say something specific on a point like this unless we are absolutely sure of our facts\u0027.Shattered by the ferocity of the negotiations, Diana did not fight the title issue and in the end it helped secure her £17.5million orce settlement, a sum that Charles\u0027s then financial adviser said had \u0027taken him to the cleaners\u0027, forcing him to sell his entire investment portfolio. But Diana bitterly regretted losing the HRH style and pointedly quit as patron of 100 charities as a result.She felt passionately that organisations like Help the Aged and British Red Cross Youth deserved a royal patron and that the loss in her standing as result of her title being forfeited would be to diminish them.           The reaction of the Queen – and Charles – since has been informed by their desire to avoid repeating the mistakes that occurred with Harry\u0027s mother over her split from the Prince of WalesHer only consolation was the promise from the then 14-year old Prince William that he would restore it when he became King.There are other parallels with the Sussex crisis, too. Diana was constantly linked with commercial deals, from a fragrance named after her by a French perfume house to being the face of a high street fashion brand.They offered her mega-bucks but she turned them all down – just as she did Kevin Costner who wanted her to star with him in a remake of The Bodyguard. She could have made millions but didn\u0027t.Significantly, she also resisted the constant blandishments of money-rich US TV networks. In her case she was pursued by the veteran Barbara Walters.Did all this turbulence in his mother\u0027s life resonate with Prince Harry at the Ivy on Sunday evening?Certainly, he made no fewer than four references to his mother during his brief speech, including one poignant reference to her death. \u0027When I lost my mum 23 years ago, you took me under your wing,\u0027 he said.And to be fair there was humility in his words too as he spoke of his \u0027utmost respect for my grandmother, my commander in chief\u0027.He also acknowledged how grateful he was to the Queen and \u0027the rest of my family\u0027 for the support they have shown Meghan.But that gratitude is somewhat tested by remarks made as he attempted to put his side of the story.\u0027What I want to make clear is we\u0027re not walking away,\u0027 he said. \u0027Our hope was to continue serving the Queen, the Commonwealth and my military associations, but without public funding. Unfortunately that wasn\u0027t possible.\u0027As an ex-soldier, with distinguished service in Afghanistan, quite apart from his work with veterans and the Invictus Games he founded for wounded, injured and disabled veterans, losing those Army links clearly hurts.Elsewhere in the speech, if it wasn\u0027t his mother\u0027s influence it was his wife\u0027s, who he was proud to say \u0027upholds the same values as I do\u0027.           Elsewhere in the speech, if it wasn\u0027t his mother\u0027s influence it was his wife\u0027s, who he was proud to say \u0027upholds the same values as I do\u0027He insisted the decision to \u0027step back\u0027 was not one he had made lightly. And using an Americanism he added: \u0027I know I haven\u0027t always gotten it right, but as far as this goes, there really was no other option.\u0027Really? Some might say that after less than two years as a working royal couple, Harry and Meghan had barely got started.After all he stresses his commitment to duty and service. You can almost hear the anguish in his voice when he says at one point: \u0027We were here to serve.\u0027So why aren\u0027t they? And what went wrong in his mind that stopped them doing just that?When royal couples in the past have struggled matrimonially or with the burden of their role, the Queen has always been a sympathetic ear.But she also has the \u0027five-year test\u0027. Don\u0027t do anything hasty, let\u0027s see how things work out over five years, is her measured response. In recent years both the Duchess of Cambridge and the Countess of Wessex have been challenged by searching public criticism and they have emerged as two of the most reliable and popular members of the Royal Family.And what about Camilla, Harry\u0027s stepmother? No royal figure has taken more knocks in public life but she has been quietly transformed as Duchess of Cornwall performing a vital role as Prince Charles\u0027s consort.Even Charles and Diana delayed their separation at her request to try to make the marriage work.The more one looks at the whole sorry situation it does seem the Sussexes decision to walk away is one made in haste. But then everything about them has happened at speed.From that first meeting – a blind date in a London restaurant – to Harry almost immediately whisking Meghan away to camp out in the Botswana bush to her settling in to cosy Nottingham Cottage, his London home at Kensington Palace, everything has been at pace. Everything conducted like a holiday romance – him in Canada, both going to Africa, she visiting England – but with drama at every turn. And in the flash of an eye they were engaged, married and undertaking big overseas tours.Was it any wonder that after that breathless trip to Africa – its brilliance overshadowed by the spectacularly misjudged decision to complain about their life in the spotlight in a television interview – they needed a break.Seven weeks of introspection later they appeared to make their announcement without any real thought about its impact and now find themselves fire-fighting public anger and disappointment at their treatment of the 93-year-old Queen.Perhaps this was really why Harry spoke as he did. The Harry I know will be desperately torn over the repercussions of his decision to walk away. One thing he could do which would assuage public criticism concerns his promise to repay the £2.4million of taxpayers\u0027 money spent on Frogmore Cottage.Rather than have it transferred into an anonymous fund where it will be used to the repair costs of royal properties, a friend of the prince has suggested he earmark it for a specific project such as a school or a hospice.Diana would certainly have approved. When she learned of the money being used to build the Millennium Dome in 1997, she pleaded with ministers to spend the estimated £750million on a new regional hospital instead. Her wishes, alas, were ignored. "},{"url":null,"title":"RICHARD KAY Queens sake Harry start think acts","story":"Share this article And to be fair there was humility in his words too as he spoke of his \u0027utmost respect for my grandmother, my commander in chief\u0027.He also acknowledged how grateful he was to the Queen and \u0027the rest of my family\u0027 for the support they have shown Meghan.But that gratitude is somewhat tested by remarks made as he attempted to put his side of the story.\u0027What I want to make clear is we\u0027re not walking away,\u0027 he said. \u0027Our hope was to continue serving the Queen, the Commonwealth and my military associations, but without public funding.

Putin today issued a decree outlining the structure of the new Cabinet and named its members, appointing his economic adviser Andrei Belousov (pictured) as first deputy prime minister Observers say that the proposed changes could allow Putin to stay in charge by shifting into the position of the State Council\u0027s head.The lower house quickly scheduled the first of three required readings of the constitutional bill for Thursday.Putin said that the constitutional changes need to be approved by the entire nation, but it wasn\u0027t immediately clear how such a vote would be organised.Russia\u0027s leading opposition politician, Alexei Navalny, and other Kremlin foes have denounced Putin\u0027s move as an attempt to secure his rule for life, but the proposals didn\u0027t immediately trigger any major protest. The public response was muted by the vagueness of Putin\u0027s constitutional changes, and the dismissal of the unpopular Medvedev also helped ert attention from the suggested amendments."},{"url":null,"title":"Pippo Weimaraner time life sledging owner Italian mountains","story":"Share this article          Pippo goes over Victoria\u0027s shoulder and sprawls out on the snow, yet quickly gets back to his feet and runs after herThe clip was posted on Pippo and Bella - Victoria\u0027s other Weimaraner that her and her fiance got in October 2018 - Instagram two weeks ago.It had the caption: \u0027Happy 27th birthday to our human mom, who sometimes lets us fall, but never lets us down!\u0027 Social media users commented on the video, with one saying: \u0027Omg we need to try this!!

As he unveils a powerful virtual reality artwork, he talks about needing a monster to fight – and why he’d like to be a barber‘When we filmed this,” says Ai Weiwei, “the elephants didn’t know what to do. Once they were used for labour, and now they have lost their job.” The artist is talking about the groundbreaking documentary he has just made about unemployed logging elephants in Myanmar. You watch the film, shot with 360-degree virtual reality technology, through a special headset. Turn your head slowly and your view gradually changes. Turn your head 180 degrees and the picture changes completely.“When they lost their job,” he continues, “each elephant had a few people to take care of it, so those people also lost their job.” Ai (Weiwei is his first name and means unknown or future) relates to the elephants as readily as he does to the subject of the second part of his VR project – this one about the lives of Rohingya refugees in a Bangladeshi camp.The Chinese artist and activist understands loss, displacement and existential danger as well as anybody. And what he wants to talk about today is his personal sense of threat. It’s four months since Ai quit Germany for Britain, and he is adapting quickly to his new home. He orders English breakfast tea and lays into the country that gave him refuge after fleeing China in 2015. Germany is intolerant, bigoted and authoritarian, he says. And he’s barely started.Does he really believe that post-Brexit Britain will prove a haven of tolerance? He smiles and says he’s here primarily for his son. He believes 10-year-old Lao will get a good education in Britain – and will be safe. “I don’t want him to live in harsh conditions. I don’t think Germany provides a good environment for foreigners.” He mentions that Lao was recently threatened by a shop owner there.While Ai insists he has no illusions about Britain, he still thinks it will be better for his family. “In Britain they are colonial. They are polite at least. But in Germany, they don’t have this politeness. They would say in Germany you have to speak German. They have been very rude in daily situations. They deeply don’t like foreigners.” If Britain does let him down, he assures me he’ll let us all know.We meet at an upmarket hotel in Cambridge, the city where the 62-year-old now lives. He is dressed in trademark black, head shaved and beard clipped. There is something mesmerising about him: he has the appearance of a bouncer, the manner of a priest and the language of a revolutionary. With the gentlest of voices, he continues to eviscerate Germany. “I don’t like a state or culture that so obeys authority.” Ai has never been one for obeying authority.He slurps his tea and smiles. “Germany is a very precise society. Its people love the comfort of being oppressed. In China, too, you see that. Once you’re used to it, it can be very enjoyable. And you can see the efficiency, the show, the sense of their power being extended through the connected-mind condition.” You mean there is no room for iniduality? “Yes. They have a different kind of suit: it doesn’t look like what they wore in the 1930s, but it still has the same kind of function. They identify with the cult of that authoritarian mindset.”Is he comparing today’s Germany with Nazi Germany? “Fascism is to think one ideology is higher than others and to try to purify that ideology by dismissing other types of thinking. That’s Nazism. And that Nazism perfectly exists in German daily life today.”Then there is his own experience. He mentions the three times he has been thrown out of taxis. There was no overt racism, he says, but he was pretty sure what lay beneath it all. Tell me, I say. “It’s a long story,” Ai replies, as he often does. “On one occasion, there was a strong perfume. I am sensitive to perfume, so I have to take down the window, and they say, ‘Pull up the window.’ I say, ‘No, the perfume is too strong.’ And they say, ‘Just get out of my taxi.’”Where was this? “Berlin! Berlin, every time. And another time in a taxi, the driver was listening to music and my phone rings. My mum calls me from China, I have to answer. He says, ‘Shut off your phone.’ I say, ‘This is my mum.’ He says, ‘You have to shut off your phone.’ Then he suddenly braked and me, my son and girlfriend were thrown forward.”Ai has spent his life fighting for justice. Perhaps it’s in his blood. His father, the poet Ai Qing, was sent to a labour camp in the countryside for criticising Maoist communism. Ai shows me a photo of the family home – a cave in the middle of nowhere. “My family had to live in this black hole for five years.” Ai Qing’s new job was to clean the ditch that served as the village toilet. How did he cope with his change in circumstances? “He was a man with a big heart, and had great acceptance.”Following Mao’s death in 1976 and after 19 years of manual labour, Ai Qing and the family returned to Beijing. His work was “unbanned” and he regained his prominence. “He is still considered the number one national poet,” Ai says proudly. “They call him the people’s poet. He was a really passionate, romantic fighter. A soldier. He always talked about justice, beauty and integrity. He believed in a perfect world. I believe life is a struggle for it.”Ai enrolled in the Beijing Film Academy and studied animation – one of many courses he failed to complete. He then became one of the first of his generation allowed to study in the US. He was told by his tutor that his drawings lacked heart. He never drew again. (Ai shows me a drawing of a forest he did as a student, which his father used to illustrate a book of poems. It is exceptionally beautiful). He did all sort of jobs to support himself: collecting rubbish, factory work, carpentry, babysitting and barbering.He befriended beat poet Allen Ginsberg, went to the same parties as Andy Warhol, whose work he adored, discovered Marcel Duchamp and dadaism, and began transforming readymade objects into art (including Hanging Man, a homage to Duchamp made from a wire coat hanger).Ai returned to Beijing in 1993. Since then there is little he hasn’t done in the name of art, protest and fun – often in the same work. So we have the 100m hand-painted porcelain sunflower seeds that filled the floor of the Turbine Hall in London’s Tate Modern the gorgeous Forever Bicycles sculpture composed of 1,254 stainless steel bikes and Dropping a Han Dynasty Urn, in which he smashes a 2,000-year-old vase. His art delivers social critique as visual puns. With the sunflower seeds he suggests we are all different despite appearances with the vase he destroys history just as Mao did and with the bikes he comments on cultural uniformity.Some work is more solemn: a list of names of the 5,219 schoolchildren who died in the 2008 Sichuan earthquake (obtained from a year’s research) the documentary Human Flow, in which he visits refugee camps around the world and reflects on man’s inhumanity to man. Other work has transformed the landscape – Ai co-designed the Bird’s Nest, as the 2008 Olympic stadium in Beijing became known, though he has since said he regretted creating such a monument for the state and has never stepped foot inside the finished building. And some work, if it is work at all, is just plain bonkers, such as the joyous video of Ai and his friends dancing Gangnam Style.With the Bird’s Nest, he became famous as a dissident artist and seemed untouchable, protected by his popularity. Then in 2010, he claimed to have been beaten by police while trying to report a previous incident, in which he was punched in the head by a policeman, leading to him suffering a brain haemorrhage. “I was hours away from dying,” he says. That same year, the authorities tore down his government-funded studio. Rather than protesting, he turned the event into a piece of performance art, holding a crab feast to celebrate the act of destruction. (This was another classic Ai pun. He xie, the word for crab, sounds just like “harmonious” in Mandarin – a word used by the government to describe society, and reclaimed by critics to mean censorship.)In 2011, Ai was jailed and told he faced 13 years in prison for subversion of state power, but was released after 81 days and given a $2.4m (£1.5m) fine for tax evasion. The money was raised by supporters worldwide. Ai’s passport was confiscated and he was placed under house arrest for four years. When his passport was returned, he left for Germany, where he had been offered a professorship at Berlin University of the Arts.I ask if he thinks he would have been an artist if he hadn’t grown up in China. “No,” he says. “No, I would not be an artist because an artist is not something I would have rated as important. My interrogator in the secret police once asked me, ‘Weiwei, if we don’t give you so much pressure, you would never be so famous, right?’ And I said, ‘Yes, you are right. It takes an enemy to make me a soldier. If I don’t have a great monster to fight, who am I?’”Ai is clear about the purpose of his art: it is not primarily aesthetic or cerebral, it is political. “If my art has any meaning, it is as a tool for freedom. If I see people victimised by authoritarianism, I am a soldier in defending their freedom. I can be as brutal as any animal to protect the essential value I love.”As I’m talking, I notice him taking a picture with his phone. Was he taking a photo of me? He laughs. “No, the camera is taking the photo.” He has been doing this for years wherever he goes. Ai really is gloriously eccentric. Whether his selfies are in the name of art, entertainment or bearing witness, it’s hard to know. I’m not sure he even knows.Ai has spent a great deal of the last five years filming displaced people (and now animals) in the world’s troubled spots. And he’s exhausted. He thinks his days as an artist may be coming to an end. For 15 years, he adds, the world has treated his work with respect, and that is never good for creativity. “I almost don’t think of myself as artist now,” he says. “My curiosity is getting less and less. The art culture institutions say, ‘Oh, Weiwei have a show next year with us.’ I’m suddenly very privileged, but now I’m getting tired.”Privilege does not sit easily with him. You sense part of him would like to return to his days in the cave with the family, or struggling on $3 a day in the US. Will he retire? He looks at me in disbelief. “I cannot say I’ll retire, but maybe I’ll disappear.” Where to? “Maybe I’ll disappear in Cambridge!” Will he go back to China? “I want to. My mum’s old and I want to see her. I’ve not seen her for a few years.” But he worries that he may be arrested or have his passport confiscated.So what would he do if he stopped making art? He smiles mischievously, slurps his cold tea and takes out his phone again. He shows me four short films of young people with trendy haircuts. Their hair is entirely shaved on one side, then they flick their heads and magically they have a full head of hair. “When I was young I used to cut all my classmates’ hair. Three days ago, I cut the hair of these four students.” He looks so chuffed with these “optical illusion” haircuts. “I did four in 20 minutes. I am a proper professional! I may open a barbershop in London.”He seems to be getting more into the idea by the second. “I think it is more fun to be a barber than an artist,” he says. Couldn’t he mix art with barbering? He shakes his head vehemently. No, he says, definitely not. “You would never mix such a holy profession with art.”• A trailer of Omni will be shown at a  event with Ai Weiwei on 30 January at Cadogan Hall, London."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e904c64013425f650ee52cfc2ed74eed3c86ba62/537_453_5369_3221/master/5369.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90227ea198c8bfdd94a8791b6ec4bfbe","title":"buy a classic sport photograph penny farthing racing","story":"The latest in a  Print Shop series featuring classic sports images from the likes of Gerry Cranham, Mark Leech and Tom Jenkins – yours to own for just £55 including free deliveryImagine the perils of riding a penny farthing at high speed while wearing only a crude helmet.

Would God be female? Would there be violence? This collaboration between the new woman at Dior and the great feminist artist had some terrific bannersOn Monday, Dior’s haute couture show took place within the mighty womb of a female deity, created by formidable American artist Judy Chicago. Guests were seated within a custom version of an unrealised sculpture the influential feminist had first proposed in 1977 as Inflatable Mother Goddess. Chicago’s proposition “What If Women Ruled the World?” set the tone for a fashion collection inspired by proto-feminist heroines dating back to prehistory.Embroidered banners, three-metres high, posed follow-on questions: “Would Buildings Resemble Wombs?” “Would God Be Female?” “Would There Be Violence?” “Would Both Women and Men Be Gentle?” It was a spectacular backdrop for the fashion show, though Chicago pointed out that the sculpture and its hangings were more than that. “We made art,” she told the New York Times.This is not the first time Maria Grazia Chiuri, artistic director of Dior, has looked to women artists for inspiration. For her second collection, models trod the runway in Breton tops embroidered with “Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?” in tribute to art historian Linda Nochlin. Ever since, feminist art has been as much of a house signature as the bar jacket.The springsummer 2018 couture show paid tribute to sexually upfront surrealist Leonor Fini. Last spring, ready-to-wear was shown surrounded by Italian gender provocateur Tomaso Binga’s naked Mural Alphabets. The setting for the couture show last June was designed by the magnificently forthright and inventive Penny Slinger: the collection closed with a golden dress shaped like a doll’s house in tribute to the British-born artist’s psychologically charged work.These spectacular collaborations are not gimmicks. As an art nerd they may excite me, but I don’t kid myself that the fashion world will necessarily thrill to collaborations with less-known octogenarian feminists. These are not easy or flippant references: internationally renowned, Chicago is a better-known exception among those whose work Chiuri has celebrated on the runway. For all, the Dior collaboration offered a wider audience – and, I imagine, a welcome injection of cash toward the end of uncommercial careers. As Chicago has pointed out: “It’s no fun to be old and poor.”Chiuri is to be congratulated. As the first female artistic director of Dior she has a highly visible public platform and is using it to celebrate work she is passionate about, and which she believes deserves a larger audience. Not only is she supporting women artists, whose work continues to be underrepresented in museum collections and undervalued at auction, in celebrating magnificent older women she resists the fashion world’s obsession with youth.Is it weird for a feminist artist to work with a fashion brand? Only if you believe that fashion and feminism can’t be bedfellows. Does fashion promote unrealistic beauty and body ideals? Yes, but no more so than social and network media. Does it engage in the oppression of women through reliance on a casual, unregulated workforce, much of it female? Often, yes. These are all wider social and industrial issues that need to be addressed on a wider social and industrial level. (Chicago’s banners, incidentally, were made with the Chanakya School of Craft, a nonprofit organisation based in Mumbai.)Fashion is also about play, identity, challenging ideas of beauty, celebrating well-made things, sexual allure and the transmission of coded cultural messages. Chicago – who sports violet hair, dark purple lipstick, sharp suits and eye-catching jewellery – is not shy of the transformative effects of colour, form and beautifully crafted objects. She celebrates women as sexual beings, as creators, as mothers and caregivers, and has recently explored the process of ageing and the prospect of death with great frankness.The very reason that Nochlin felt the need to pose her question “Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?” – and by extension the reason that Chiuri has felt it important to celebrate women at Dior – is that the art world has been, and continues to be, bedevilled by systemic prejudice, of which sexism is only one component. It seems to me no more anomalous for feminist artists to engage with the fashion world, for all its faults, than an art industry that has for decades failed to adequately engage with and value their contribution.The impulse to question the validity of support offered to one woman by another perpetuates a destructive ideal, according to which no feminist gesture can ever be adequate, no cultural contribution sufficiently pure. Cherish the support. Learn from it. Emulate it. As Nochlin wrote at the end of her famous essay: “While great achievement is rare and difficult at best, it is still rare and more difficult if, while you work, you must at the same time wrestle with inner demons of self doubt and guilt, and outer monsters of ridicule.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8cb924d8f0faaaa5f93a4b808712dbe2692ae4af/0_0_4288_2848/master/4288.jpg?width=300\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1fa0a7051bdd41a114f13ea21c9124da","title":"aldi to become uks best paying supermarket with wage rise","story":"German discounter to raise hourly rate to £9.40 and to £10.90 for staff within M25From 1 February, the German discount chain will raise the hourly wage of its store employees to £9.40 from £9.10, or to £10.90 from £10.55 for those inside the M25.Long service will also be rewarded, with a national rate of £10.41 for those who have worked for Aldi for at least three years, and £11.15 for London colleagues with two or more years’ service.Giles Hurley, the chief executive for Aldi UK, said: “The dedication and commitment our store colleagues deliver every day when serving our customers underpins our success. We have the most efficient and productive workforce, and this is why they earn the highest rates of pay in the grocery sector.”Aldi’s new hourly rate slightly surpasses the pay rise announced by its rival German discounter Lidl for its UK workers in November. It also exceeds the hourly income set by the Living Wage Foundation to reflect the true cost of living, which stands at £9.30 across the UK and £10.75 in London. The government-mandated national minimum wage will rise from £8.21 for workers aged over 25 to £8.72 on 1 April.Katherine Chapman, the director of the Living Wage Foundation, welcomed the decision by the retailer, which employs 33,000 people in the UK, but said: “The next step is for Aldi to become an accredited Living Wage employer, otherwise we can’t be sure that subcontracted staff, such as warehouse workers, cleaners and trolley collectors, are paid a real living wage.”The announcement comes amid aggressive expansion plans for the UK’s fifth largest grocer. Aldi currently has 874 stores, and aims to increase the number to 1,200 by 2025, while it is also recruiting 3,800 people this year. Lidl is also targeting reaching 1,000 UK stores in the next four years."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/292509a55d117425c66d6667a57f4a049199dabe/0_0_5950_4000/master/5950.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=d206acaa04f4608dcfb691f505fd552e 1760w","title":"easyjets grab of thomas cook spoils wont be flying too high","story":"You had to travel a long way down easyJet’s bullish trading update to find the main reason for the “positive momentum” in the business, but eventually it appeared. Thomas Cook went bust, which is very helpful if you’re a competitor.One can’t exactly call the event a piece of good fortune since rivals go out of business all the time in the short-haul European market, but Thomas Cook was a biggie. The stock market caught the message early, of course: easyJet’s share price has improved by two-thirds since last autumn. Meanwhile, Brexit suddenly feels less terrifying, at least for this summer, and easyJet now has a carbon-offset policy to wave at its critics.TalkTalk’s sale of its fibre broadband business, FibreNation, was delayed by Labour’s “free broadband” idea during the election campaign, but the interruption was brief. The business is now being bought by CityFibre, the Goldman Sachs-backed outfit, for £200m.Fine, but the pause obscured the real question: why is TalkTalk selling so soon? It is only two years since the chairman, Sir Charles Dunstone, announced a great opportunity for TalkTalk in rolling out full fibre. A £200m fund-raising in 2018 was pitched, in part, as a way to fund the ambition. There was brave talk about finding a financial partner and passing 3m homes by the mid-2020s. As it is, the sale of the FibreNation ision is happening when only 49,000 homes have been covered, mostly in York.TalkTalk can boast a handsome return from the disposal – more than three times the £60m of capital invested – so the adventure has been worthwhile. The company also gets a long-term supply deal with CityFibre. But one can look at things the other way around. If the returns are so good at the start of fibre roll-out, why not stay for a few more laps?The answer, it seems, is that TalkTalk can’t afford it. It could only compete if it found a partner, but a joint venture deal with M\u0026ampG Prudential fell apart.A return to life as a wholesaler and retailer of broadband is probably just a sensible recognition that taking on the likes of BT Openreach and Virgin in new fibre infrastructure requires deep pockets. All the same, the shares have gone roughly nowhere since Dunstone returned as executive chairman in 2017.The profit on disposal is nice to have, but FibreNation was supposed to be a business for the long-term.What quantities do you currently finance?

What most non-members don’t know is how many members have no clue which faction is which either. The shorthand “centrist”, “hard left” and “soft left” is deployed because life, itself, is short, but the common assumptions about each fail to explain almost anything about the way the contest is unfolding.Why, if the hard left was united and organised enough to see off every challenge to Jeremy Corbyn, did it struggle to choose a candidate, and observably fracture as soon Rebecca Long-Bailey’s campaign was under way? How has it found itself presenting someone with such a mild political hinterland as the only true-left name on the ballot? She didn’t join the party until 2010, and became an MP after a politically unremarkable career as a solicitor. Why did Clive Lewis, the obvious bridge between hard and soft, fail to make the ballot? How did the soft left, seen as the least reactive element of the compound, the emollient middle child, manage to get three candidates – Lisa Nandy, Emily Thornberry and Keir Starmer – on to the list? Why, if the centrists are so pragmatic and sensible, so all-about-the-win, did they hit upon Jess Phillips, a wildly impractical candidate who has now dropped out?It makes so little sense that we look for answers among the assorted personalities, and there are indeed plenty of reasons why Jon Lansman, John McDonnell and Len McCluskey might fall out. But that’s only a fragment of the story. Long-Bailey has emerged as the Corbyn-continuity candidate, endorsed by Momentum, with the heavy lifting of her campaign undertaken by Lansman. Unite has yet to endorse, but its support for Long-Bailey is considered inevitable. What’s emerging is a bid that is extremely well-organised in terms of data and resources and yet absolutely riven with internal strife, with former Corbyn and McDonnell staffers joining, then swiftly leaving camp RLB, after clashing with Lansman.The hurdles her campaign faces are threefold: first, Momentum is not a snug fit with long-standing hard-left groups such as the People’s Assembly, Stop the War and Socialist Action. It draws its members from the student movement and the political movement, the World Transformed, and it contains plenty who reject the first principle of the old school, which is obedience. (This was plain when members were balloted before the Momentum nomination, giving them only one choice: endorse Long-Bailey as leader and Angela Rayner as deputy, or don’t. Both were endorsed, but Rayner very narrowly so, and on a very low turnout.)Second, McDonnell – whom no one could call a traitor to the Corbyn project – is conspicuously failing to get behind the idea that Labour has only one possible successor in the wake of fractious relations with Unite in the runup to the election. Last, the hangover from Brexit has further shattered the hard-left coalition, as the internationalists in Another Europe is Possible got passionately behind Lewis, and are now ided themselves on whether to rally behind Starmer or Long-Bailey.The broader pro-Corbyn coalition is more fragile still. The support of the soft left – which accounts for most Labour members – was vital in Corbyn being elected leader. This has been completely erased, pincer-style, by both the centrists, who painted the era as a hard-left takeover, and the hard left, who were happy to take the credit. The soft left has always been decisive, and it is no longer boxed in by limited choice, as it was in 2015. At the grass roots, it is strongly leaning towards Starmer, and it is this, rather than any resurgence of the centre, which explains his early and consistent lead in all members’ polls. He is a highly recognisable figure to Labour activists, going back to the 1980s: anti-militant but also anti-triangulation, socialist but not purist, the antithesis of the career politician who came to define the 00s.Starmer has also attracted support from the right of the parliamentary party – Jenny Chapman, the former vice-chair of Progress and ex-MP for Darlington, is chair of his campaign. I don’t share the disquiet some on the left feel about that. It is entirely natural for some pragmatists to turn a blind eye to the radicalism of his politics of justice – environmental, social and economic – in response to the need for pluralism and effectiveness. It doesn’t mean he is wearing that radicalism for effect.The conundrum of the centre is fascinating. The least fissiparous group – it prides itself on its ability to stay united – it ought, in theory, to be the most effective. But its relentless focus on electability lands it at the assumption that the party exists to meet the rest of the country where it is, bang in the centre. Since this space has no ideological definition, this means accepting and trying to embody the dominant narrative. Before 2010, when the narrative was the centre’s own, it was able – via Progress and Labour First – to generate ideas, many of which were half-baked, but at least they existed.Trying to reach meaningful conclusions when “common sense” is defined by the political right is much more difficult, and leaves it with a slew of contradictory imperatives – it absolutely must have a mirror-Johnson, a “world queen”, a celebrity, a clown who is also fiscally credible, a leaver who is also a remainer, a working-class woman who can also appeal to the identities of Tony Blair’s politically homeless middle class, a fearless defender of the dispossessed who also accepts the need for austerity. The centrist conception of what the left leadership should look like is so complicated yet so shallow that, in a way, Phillips, who was doing an impossible job at least with gusto, was its best possible iteration. They could have ended up with Lorraine Kelly. Yet you can see in the warmth of the some other candidates as she stepped down that this was a hospital pass that few felt she deserved.It would be asinine to call for unity when I support Starmer (“we can all be friends, so long as we line up behind my guy”). Yet if we separate which of these isions are about power and which are about ideas, all these gulfs look more bridgable."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14f6a3e613420d0907862daac9860f5ee5659d67/0_108_2850_1711/master/2850.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2bedf526f1866fa7771449365760bd5f","title":"the guardian view on the labour leadership a deep and wide debate","story":"Lisa Nandy is almost certain to be on the ballot for members to choose the next Labour leader. She offers a change not just of speed, but of direction for the partyFifteen years ago, after a third crushing loss, it was widely assumed that the Conservatives would be out of power for a decade. With William Hague, Iain Duncan Smith and Michael Howard, the party did not have a record of picking winners. Then along came David Cameron. By 2010 he had gained 97 seats – 20 short of an overall majority, but enough to enter Downing Street with Liberal Democrat support and herald a decade of Tory dominance. If the next Labour leader could match Mr Cameron and win an extra 97 seats, then they too could walk into No 10 with coalition partners. But that would mean choosing the right leader.In a system of government that concentrates power in the ruling party, the Tory political ascendancy is unhealthy. Labour’s next leader should be the person best able to make their party an attractive alternative. But first its leadership contenders must be able to convince members that their mission is to put Labour into government and create a sense that Boris Johnson could be vulnerable. This requires as wide and as deep a debate in Labour as possible. Labour suffered a shattering defeat at the general election last month and the party needs time to reassess its ideas and its policies, and to introspect about the reasons why it lost.The GMB’s decision to back Lisa Nandy is therefore to be welcomed. The frontrunner Keir Starmer did not need the GMB’s vote: his was the first name on the formal ballot to become the next Labour leader, following the endorsement of both the shopworkers’ union, Usdaw, and Unison, the UK’s largest union. Unite, the other big trade union, is likely to throw its weight behind Rebecca Long-Bailey, who is seen as the keeper of the left’s flame. Party members have six weeks of auditions to sit through for the role of leader of the party. There had been a feeling that the frontrunners would tell members they had to change speed, rather than the direction of political travel. With Ms Nandy’s name on the ballot, this will no longer be the case. The contest will benefit from her presence.The same is true of Emily Thornberry, perhaps the best parliamentary debater in the race. Once feted as a successor to Jeremy Corbyn, she has fallen out with those who once praised her. The shadow foreign secretary’s name will only go forward to the party membership if she can win 33 nominations from local Labour parties or get the backing of the Communication Workers Union.  hopes that she does so. Both Ms Nandy and Ms Thornberry would provide a stiff and necessary test for the favourites. After all, if Ms Long-Bailey and Mr Starmer cannot best party rivals, what hope do they stand of taking down Mr Johnson?Infighting and a failure to understand Brexit’s reshaping of politics have strained Labour’s relations with voters. Casting the Tories as mean and selfish will be hard when Mr Johnson won’t play the part. The Labour party itself needs rebuilding, in Scotland and northern England. Whoever wins has to come to terms with the historic mistake of leaving the European Union – and understand which parts of it voters can live with and which to jettison. By being smart but not otherworldly, a new leader can give Labour hope and Britain a new opposition."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a9fedcc7b26f47fe2cca5d93461a7d353db1353/0_47_2360_1415/master/2360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5fbf453e940cf8ea51ffdcaf1a13ec93","title":"what explains prince andrew rehabilitation and harry vilification misogyny","story":"Both royals have been forced to quit their roles, yet the Duke of York is being rehabilitated by the press while the Sussexes are being houndedPrince Andrew – His Royal Highness the Duke of York – is a man of many titles, but seemingly few talents. He does, however, have one superpower: scandal doesn’t stick to him. Having spent several weeks keeping a low profile following the whole being chummy-with-a-sex-offender thing, it looks as though Andrew has crawled out of the woodwork and is being rapidly rehabilitated.On Sunday, the Queen appeared in public with her 59-year-old son for the first time since his car-crash Newsnight interview in November. Photographs of the two going to church show Her Majesty looking pleased and the prince looking pleased with himself. The man claims he has had trouble sweating, but by God can he smirk.He certainly has a lot to smirk about: the coverage of his outing with Mum was a PR coup. “Disgraced Prince Andrew has become the Queen’s ‘rock’ during Megxit, royal insiders have revealed,” bellowed the Sun. According to these “insiders”, Andrew has been a “tower of strength” recently, “supporting his parents in their hour of need”.Talk about a tale of two princes. While Andrew is described as a rock (he has the charisma of one), Harry is torn apart by the redtops, painted as an entitled brat who has abandoned queen and country to jet off and start a new life. Andrew has kept his titles and stipend from the Queen since the Epstein scandal, when he was made to step back from his public duties for the “foreseeable future”. On the other hand, Harry and Meghan have been forced to make a clean break from the firm and relinquish their Royal Highness titles and taxpayer funding. The Sussexes will also pay back £2.4m in public money spent renovating their home Andrew has made no statements about his debts to the taxpayer.The parallels between the princes are fascinating and infuriating. They were born into the same job: “spare” heir. Andrew is eighth in line to the throne, while Harry is sixth, so neither has much hope of becoming king constitutionally speaking, it doesn’t much matter if they step away from their roles. They have been forced – in very different circumstances – to resign from their “jobs”. Yet their resignations have been treated wildly differently by the media. Harry and Meghan’s decision to relocate has been treated as a far bigger story than the fact that the Queen’s son was friends with Jeffrey Epstein, a child sex offender, and has been accused of having sex with a teenage girl who claims she was trafficked by Epstein, an allegation Andrew denies.Why the discrepancy? Most obviously, there is racism towards Meghan. Then, as Alan Rusbridger pointed out in the Observer, there is the fact that the “major newspaper groups most obsessed with Harry and Meghan are … being sued by the couple for assorted breaches of privacy and copyright”.Another reason is old-fashioned misogyny. The accusations levelled against Andrew aren’t reputation-ruining, because society doesn’t care what powerful men do to vulnerable women. Look at the president of the US, for God’s sake.In many ways, the narratives around Andrew and Harry represent age-old archetypes. Andrew is the prodigal son Harry is a hen-pecked husband. After decades of dissolute living, Andrew is proclaiming how sorry he is inevitably, he will be forgiven. But the one thing society won’t forgive, as Harry is finding out, is a man putting a woman’s needs first."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40a42a2299a6b44456b74732a4d05bedfced62e0/0_0_4979_2987/master/4979.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3cfb1b6381e9a863be1c3e8e9cd91124","title":"teachers tell us if you think the planned pay rise is enough","story":"If you are a teacher working in England we would like to hear your thoughts on salaries in the profession In light of the government announcing plans to raise salaries for teachers in England, we’d like to find out whether this measure is enough to stop teachers leaving the profession.

Our most seen and recognisable amphibian has had a rough couple of years, at least in the south, because dry winters and warm early summer weather dried up many of its natural breeding sites leaving tadpoles stranded. The frog is still relatively common only because it has moved into urban areas and breeds readily in garden ponds. Out in the country, the combination of farmers filling in ponds and poisoning ditches and other breeding places by overusing fertiliser and pesticides means that many cereal-growing areas are now without frogs at all.The species started breeding in the far south-west this month and, as the weather warms, their spawn can be found during February and March gradually spreading further east and north. The timing of the rush to the breeding ponds is driven by warmth, so the climate crisis and mild winters have moved this process forward by as much as three to four weeks since 1990. The warming has also confused frogs. They once seemed to have a common signal about when to arrive at a particular pond. Now pioneers and stragglers turn up to spawn at different times, making breeding success ever more chancy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3933b20db0e55dfcdd0f8cc66c2bc52dd7c187b/0_40_4300_2580/master/4300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ddece0b40b2f81de05756fc57364f21","title":"uk africa off grid solar power","story":"Rapidly growing sector could prove lucrative as Britain seeks post-Brexit trade opportunitiesUK investors could seize a $24bn investment opportunity by helping to connect millions of people without access to electricity to off-grid home solar power systems.The market for pay-as-you-go home solar packages is expected to boom in Africa, where millions of homes are using mobile technology to rent low-cost solar panels.UK companies have played a leading role in helping more than five million households sign up to pay-as-you-go home solar systems in the past four years. But with 600 million people without access to an electricity grid, there is huge potential for future investment.A report by Kleos Advisory, published during the first UK-Africa Investment Summit in London, has found that the commercial opportunity from off-grid solar panels could generate about $24bn (£18bn) a year.The market is growing rapidly since the collapse in the cost of solar panel technologies and the emergence of mobile banking and affordable financing in the continent’s fast-growing economies.Households that earn an income are increasingly using mobile phones to rent small-scale solar panels, and ultra-efficient electric lighting strips and appliances to access electricity for the first time.Once the solar panels are paid off, households own the equipment outright and in effect have free energy. Many then choose to upgrade their packages to add televisions and electric cookers.The off-grid solar market is expected to grow rapidly, in part because eight of the world’s 15 fastest-growing economies are in Africa.Tedd George, the author of the report, said the combination of solar technology and affordable financing was “driving an economic transformation in Africa, making the ‘unbankable’ bankable and embedding African consumers in the digital economy”.UK companies including Azuri Technologies, which commissioned the report, and Bboxx are racing to corner the market for off-grid solar in Africa with the help of private investment and major international companies.Azuri sells its home solar systems in Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Nigeria, and Bboxx is active in Kenya, Togo, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Mali, Rwanda, Senegal, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Nigeria.The scale of the off-grid solar market across Africa has emerged as UK investment leaders consider future investment in the continent after Brexit.Tony Blair said the summit this week “should open a new chapter in Britain’s relationship with Africa” to one based on “economic cooperation rather than simply an aid-based, donor-recipient relationship”.The former Labour prime minister said: “If we can use the UK-Africa Investment Summit to become a true economic partner to African countries, it would be of great strategic benefit to the continent and to the UK.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92e0e45de5376c35eb3ff7faba8358eeb05bd056/96_543_1720_1032/master/1720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b6df1a1b25e66d57c6421e08dad44b5e","title":"gabrielle the eye patch alone was a talking point so i made it bling","story":"This outfit, which I wore to the Brit awards in 1994, was quite quirky: a short jacket over a dress by Ann Demeulemeester.

His first best-actor nomination has been a long time coming. At the age of 72, he has arrived. “Best newcomer,” he says ruefully. “Although I already do have a best newcomer award. It was for Breaking Glass. Back in 1980.”It is no surprise to see Pryce honoured for his lovely performance in The Two Popes, a likable Netflix drama that spotlights the bromance between Benedict and Francis, but it knocked him sideways all the same. He had not thought he stood a chance he had just come out of the shower when the news came through. Since then, his phone has barely stopped buzzing. Congratulations and requests. Demands on his time. “But it’s great,” he adds quickly, and almost sounds as if he means it.Whether by accident or design, Pryce has spent much of his career as the quiet man of British acting the coiled spring in the works, unobtrusive, precise and usually critical, whether he is playing a Bond villain on screen or Shylock on stage Cardinal Wolsey in Wolf Hall or the High Sparrow in Game of Thrones. Like Pope Francis, perhaps, he is the connoisseur’s choice, the progressive dark horse. Still, you should never make the mistake of confusing an actor with the characters they play.His latest appearance, in Terry Gilliam’s The Man Who Killed Don Quixote, brings him full circle. It was Gilliam who provided Pryce with his breakthrough role in 1985’s Brazil, and the two have remained firm friends ever since. The film itself is a rackety, rambunctious affair. Adam Driver headlines as a jaded commercials director at large in rural Spain. Pryce co-stars as Javier, a deluded old shoemaker who fancies himself as Quixote. He comes clip-clopping through the desert in tin-pan armour, his peevish stare fixed on the far horizon.The way Pryce tells it, he was essentially playing two men at the same time. “And that’s the get-out-of-jail card. Because if I’m not very good as Don Quixote, you can blame it on the shoemaker, who’s not a very good actor. But also Quixote’s playing a role himself, the noble knight. So it’s all role play and the masks are always slipping.”Pryce was offered a slot in Gilliam’s first, ill-fated, stab at the film in 2000, but turned it down because he thought the script was weak. Since then, the role of Quixote has bounced from Jean Rochefort to John Hurt to Michael Palin before landing in Pryce’s lap. Gilliam now suspects this was preordained. “Jonathan has basically been waiting to play this part ever since our first collapse,” he says.The director has said some other things, too. Earlier this month, Gilliam told the journalist Alexandra Pollard that #MeToo was a witch-hunt. He said that women in Hollywood should take more responsibility for themselves and that he was “tired of white men being blamed for everything”. But that’s Terry, Pryce says. “He’s always been a provocateur. That’s what he thrives on: being outrageous, going to extremes.” Besides, he adds, the whole #MeToo issue remains so fresh and raw people are still working out how to discuss it. “That’s not to say he was misunderstood or misconstrued,” he adds. “I think it was very clear what he was saying.”Until now, I have filed Gilliam and Pryce as odd-couple collaborators: the disreputable old goat and his cerebral, soft-spoken alter ego. Pryce nods. “The straight man and the clown. Except that, in this case, the clown is playing the role of straight man. Meanwhile, I’m stuck on the horse, playing the clown.”In contrast to Gilliam, Pryce would rather stay out of the limelight steer clear of trouble. By and large, he has been successful. But in 1991, he sparked fury in the US with his portrayal of a Eurasian pimp called the Engineer in the Broadway production of Miss Saigon. Equity labelled the role “an affront to the Asian community” and demanded he withdraw. The ensuing standoff almost derailed the production.I ask whether, three decades on, he has more sympathy for Equity’s objection. He says that, on the contrary, he had sympathy for it then. The experience was horrific. He felt like the lightning rod for a wider cultural storm. “I mean, I was always confident that I wasn’t portraying a stereotype,” he insists. “But all I could do was sit back and let other people have the argument. And I got support from very strange and unwanted quarters. Charlton Heston sent me a photo of him playing Fu Manchu. He signed it: ‘From one yellowface to another.’ And I thought: ‘That’s not what I’m doing, Charlton. Thanks for your support.’”The point is that Pryce had always been at pains to work with multi-ethnic casts. In Stratford, on Broadway, wherever it was. “So you’re thinking: ‘What the hell is this? I’m the nice guy here.’ But that’s the way change happens. It showed there was an inequality in the casting process. It’s just tough when you’re on the receiving end.”It infuriated him then. It still rankles today. “You know, I was in New York recently, at an influencer, as I think they call them. Academy members watch your film. You meet them. Schmooze-fest. And this Asian lady grabbed my arm and was shouting: ‘I protest you! I protest you!’ Talking about what she’d done 30 years ago. ‘I stuck paper down your toilet in the theatre!’ Because we had protesters who used to come to the show to disrupt it.”Pryce appears to be giving the protester a comedy accent. I hope this wasn’t the voice he used for his Eurasian pimp. Anyway, he continues, the upshot was that, at the end of this rant, she still wanted to have her picture taken with him. “And then, in the photo, she’s pointing like this in my face. Saying: ‘I protest him!’”We are still sitting in the corner of our becalmed London bar. By this point, Pryce has turned a little wild-eyed. A woman sidles over and apologises for interrupting, but says she simply had to say hello. She says she is from his home town of Holywell in north Wales and adds: “Did you know there’s a big picture of you up in the local pub?”Pryce shakes his head distractedly. “You should go back and see it,” she says.It is funny, he confides, people tend to think he is Jewish. Even Mel Brooks, of all people, assumed that he was. In fact, he is a Celt, raised Presbyterian, the son of a miner who later ran a grocer’s shop. “But I left home when I was 18,” he shrugs. “I’ve got fond memories of home and I’ve got negative memories of home. I don’t really get back there as much as I should.”Some years back, he returned to Holywell for a school reunion. It was nice he met classmates he hadn’t seen in decades. “But I was thinking: ‘Oh my God, they all look really old. Thank God I don’t look like that.’ Then we did a group picture. And then they sent it to me.” He dissolves with laughter. “And in among all those old people was just another old person.”Our conversation has been a little choppy. All the same, I am pleased Pryce is finally being honoured by the Academy. By rights, he should have been nominated for Brazil, for Carrington or for his role as Glenn Close’s preening novelist husband in The Wife. I ask which of his roles he feels was unfairly overlooked, and he chuckles and says it is not a question he can answer. “It reminds me of the argument we’re having now about women who should have been nominated, or ethnic minorities who should have been nominated, when people forget that it’s a competition, it’s a ‘Who’s best?’ I mean, when I vote or when I look at a film, I don’t think: ‘Oh, it’s a woman director, therefore I’ll watch it in a different way.’ I’ll watch it as a film and judge it as that.”Hang on, I tell him, it is not as simple as that. He is assuming there exists an objective standard of excellence. The truth surely, is that our ideas of what is good and what is bad are conditioned by a whole bunch of factors: gender, ethnicity, class, what have you. If people are angered by this year’s Oscars, it is because they feel the Academy is not representative of cinema as a whole. If you broadened the voter base, you would get a richer spread of nominees.The actor winces. “Well, you can have that argument,” he says. “But it is rather patronising, the idea that if you get more African-Caribbean voters they’ll only vote for African-Caribbean films. And I’d only vote for Welsh films. Sometimes I can’t believe that we’re still having that argument. It’s only a fucking prize.”He reaches for his water he is practically spluttering. Yes, of course, he admits, people are herd-like and tribal. You can see it in politics, in society and in the film industry, too. People view the world – or the Oscar nominations – from their own particular vantage point. He gulps his drink and attempts a joke. He says: “I think there’s a definite shortage of 72-year-old Welsh men.”The Man Who Killed Don Quixote is released on 31 January.

While Frank Lampard seethed at Chelsea’s lack of conviction at both ends of the pitch, Mikel Arteta wondered what on earth he is going to do with Shkodran Mustafi and marvelled at the fearlessness of Gabriel Martinelli. It was that sort of night, absorbing and bonkers in equal measure, and in the end it was difficult to know whether to focus on Chelsea’s sense of bewilderment or Arsenal’s joy.For Lampard, the twist was tough to take but easy to explain. Chelsea played for more than an hour against 10 men, led twice and still dropped more points at home. They lacked creativity again, bolstering the argument that they need attacking reinforcements before the transfer window closes, and paid for their carelessness when Martinelli, an 18-year-old winger with a wonderfully direct style, hauled Arsenal level with a stunning solo goal just after the hour.Chelsea’s imprecision is hurting their push for Champions League qualification – fifth-placed Manchester United will go three points behind them if they beat Burnley at home on Wednesday – and it spoke volumes that they were incapable of holding on after César Azipilicueta restored their lead with six minutes left. Lampard’s side are too loose and Kepa Arrizabalaga’s indifferent form was captured by the moment when Héctor Bellerín, cutting on to his left foot, rescued a point for Arsenal with a shot that somehow squirmed beyond Chelsea’s goalkeeper.Arrizabalaga has conceded too many soft goals this season but Arteta was entitled to argue Arsenal merited a draw after a show of defiance in the second half. His side stood up to be counted after Mustafi’s disastrous error led to David Luiz’s red card on 26 minutes. Granit Xhaka excelled as a makeshift centre-half, Martinelli ran Azpilicueta ragged on the left and Arteta, who has lost only one of his seven games, was delighted with his new side’s spirit on a ground where they have suffered in the past.Initially David Luiz was the story against his old side. There was no respectful celebration from the Brazilian when he scored here for Paris Saint-Germain in a Champions League tie in 2015 and he looked to make his presence felt from the start, attracting the ire of the Chelsea fans when he charged into the back of Tammy Abraham and kneed the striker up the backside. Battle lines had been drawn.Abraham would have the last laugh, though David Luiz’s dismissal owed much to the brainlessness of Mustafi. While there have been signs of progress under Arteta, the fact remains the Spaniard has inherited a squad containing a multitude of weaknesses. There is only so much Arteta can improve with his work on the training ground and that was underlined by Mustafi’s blunder.After a promising opening Chelsea simply had to wait for Arsenal’s most unreliable player to self-destruct. Abraham had fooled Mustafi with a clever turn before scoring his side’s late winner at the Emirates last month and this time he was in the right place when the centre-half sold Bernd Leno horribly short with a staggeringly incompetent back-pass. Abraham raced away, rounded Leno and went down following a desperate lunge from David Luiz.Stuart Attwell pointed to the spot and how the Chelsea fans chortled when they saw the referee reaching for his red card. David Luiz had denied Abraham a clear goalscoring opportunity and he departed with mocking chants ringing in his ears. All that was left was for Jorginho to tuck his penalty away, giving Chelsea a lead their enterprising football deserved.Yet Lampard, who hopes to beat Atlético Madrid to the signing of PSG’s Edinson Cavani, would despair at Chelsea’s inability to kill the game. While Callum Hudson-Odoi tested Leno with a rasping drive, they struggled to make the most of their numerical advantage. They lost their shape in midfield, where N’Golo Kanté had a disappointing game, and allowed Arsenal’s belief to grow.The hosts flirted with disaster early in the second half, Arrizabalga almost playing Jorginho into trouble. Chelsea’s game management was dismal and Arsenal, who looked blunt at first without the suspended Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, equalised in the 63rd minute. A Chelsea corner was cleared, Martinelli took possession in his own half, outpaced Emerson, raced clear after a slip from Kanté and slipped the ball past Arrizabalaga.Lampard turned away in disgust. Chelsea are an infuriating side and they did not convince even after Azpilicueta turned Hudson-Odoi’s cross past Leno. Arsenal fought and Lampard struggled to understand why his players turned down opportunities to put the ball out of play when Abraham went down with an ankle injury. The move progressed, Bellerín drove inside and the Arsenal right-back’s tame shot left Lampard fuming."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7297b90f9953dd3b92b215787f7056b8607e2d66/87_307_3038_1823/master/3038.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2421e2f18cafcedcc16a59cf5324a342","title":"everton newcastle united premier league match report","story":"Carlo Ancelotti clasped his hands to his chest in sheer disbelief. He was not alone. The Everton manager has inherited a team with a reputation for throwing points away but this was a spectacular and staggering implosion even by their standards. Two goals up in the 94th minute, in complete control against a Newcastle team devoid of attacking intent or options, yet held to a draw thanks to two goals in the final seconds from Florian Lejeune.Steve Bruce cavorted on to the pitch in celebration of the heist before offering a sheepish handshake to his counterpart. “I lost the final of the Champions League after being 3-0 up,” the former Milan manager said. “So it can happen sometimes.” It seems to happen to Everton frequently.The hosts were cruising towards a third win in three home Premier League games until a chaotic finale fuelled by weak goalkeeping from Jordan Pickford, poor game management, careless defending and Newcastle’s refusal to concede defeat.The tale should have been one of redemption for Moise Kean, the 19-year-old striker who scored his first Everton goal in his 22nd appearance for the club and produced a display that earned a standing ovation from the Goodison Park crowd.The match also provided another demonstration of Dominic Calvert-Lewin’s growing prowess as he scored his 12th goal of the campaign but it will be remembered for Everton conspiring to find another ridiculous way to squander points, confidence and momentum.At 2-0 down Bruce introduced defenders Lejeune and Fabian Schar to audible grumbles from the away section. “Do you think I really wanted to do that?” the Newcastle manager asked. “We’ve got nothing else.” Both were asked to play out of position and Everton could not handle the extra physical presence that muscled into their penalty area at set-pieces.Pickford failed to deal with a 94th-minute corner that resulted in Lejeune scoring with an acrobatic overhead kick. It should have been no more than an impressive consolation. But Everton offered Newcastle a second bite by conceding possession and cheap free-kick. Ancelotti’s substitutes, Oumar Niasse and Tom Davies, were both culpable and after Schar plus Isaac Hayden both threatened Pickford’s goal, Lejeune forced the ball over the line with the England keeper standing yards behind it.“There’s no disputing we were second best for long periods and it was a real struggle but we hung on in there,” Bruce said. “We lack in certain areas but you can not fault their fight or endeavour.”Ancelotti took consolation in Everton’s overall performance, much improved on recent showings, and the contribution of Kean but he should note that the lapses that cost his team victory are a recurring theme with this group of players. “It is true we could have stayed more focused on set pieces and it’s true we could have been more focused in the last minutes but I think the team played a fantastic game for all 90 minutes,” he said.One of his many considerable tasks as the Everton manager is to nurture the raw talent that prompted the club to pay up to £29m for Kean in the summer. The Italian continued that process by handing his young compatriot only the fifth start of a difficult debut Premier League season and Kean repaid that faith with a fully committed display. His first Everton goal was a merited reward.The breakthrough for the teenager and Everton owed plenty to the ingenuity of Bernard. The Brazilian took possession midway in the Newcastle half after Calvert-Lewin flicked on Djibril Sidibé’s searching ball. He released Kean with a deft lob over the visiting defence and, though the striker’s first touch gave Hayden chance to intervene, a sharp finish with his second touch beat both the wing-back and Martin Dubravka. Kean understandably erupted in joy, sliding on his knees in front of the Gwladys Street, while Ancelotti responded with a thumbs-up to the goalscorer.Calvert-Lewin provided the cushion of a two-goal lead when Lucas Digne threaded a perfect pass into his stride in the second half. Jamaal Lascelles was unable to intercept at full stretch and the Everton centre-forward, his England credentials extolled by Ancelotti on the eve of the game, swept it inside the far post.Everton wracked up a procession of chances for a third with Calvert-Lewin, Yerry Mina and Mason Holgate all going close. A foul by Calvert-Lewin on Emil Krafth appeared to result in a mobile phone being thrown on to the pitch but that was the least of Everton’s problems when Lejeune suddenly, inexplicably, transformed the game in the dying seconds."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b229bf0f04602dbee8f4e6d60f82a6de97ab0cc4/0_4_2739_1643/master/2739.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9b91193227c29ca51785bc1682b93f10","title":"sheffield united manchester city premier league match report","story":"Sergio Agüero came off the bench to restore normal service for Manchester City, securing a win with a sharply taken goal when the defending champions appeared in danger of being held for a second game in succession.Certainly before Agüero’s introduction there had been little to choose between the sides, which is as much a compliment to Sheffield United as a criticism of City’s performance. And then there was Gabriel Jesus’s first-half penalty, saved by Dean Henderson. The striker has been unsuccessful with all three penalties he has taken for club and country this season, and if Pep Guardiola is going to persist with using Agüero sparingly he may like to consider giving someone else a turn from the spot.“I am definitely going to reflect on it,” the City manager said. “It’s not just Jesus, Agüero and Sterling have missed too, and in tight games like these penalties can make a big difference. We knew this was a tough place to come but we put in a solid performance and the big plus was the performance of Aymeric Laporte. I think he is the best left-sided central defender in the world, and when a player like that is out for five months you are bound to miss him.”City welcomed back Laporte a few days earlier than anticipated and nearly lost him again after a mere 12 minutes when Mo Besic was booked for an untidy challenge that left the defender in a heap, though after receiving attention he was able to continue. City retained Fernandinho in a back three to match up with the home side’s formation, yet United almost found a way through in the opening minutes when Oli McBurnie played Billy Sharp behind the City backline. United briefly held a numerical advantage but Sharp was unable to pick out John Fleck with his cross.It was United’s turn to get lucky midway through the first half when Chris Basham miscontrolled on halfway to leave Raheem Sterling sprinting clear. The winger supplied Riyad Mahrez on the right and moved up to meet the return pass with a first-time shot, only to see Henderson e to his right to save.While it was a good stop by the goalkeeper United had been opened up, and from a position near the penalty spot a more accomplished finisher, Agüero say, might have scored. Henderson came to his side’s rescue again just minutes later, when Nicolás Otamendi came up for a corner and managed to improvise an aerial volley that stayed low and on target but was kept out by the goalkeeper’s legs.Henderson’s finest moment was still to come, because 10 minutes before the interval the goalkeeper on loan from Manchester United kept out the penalty. City had perhaps been a tad fortunate to see it awarded. Mahrez appeared to be losing control of the ball on a slalom through a crowded area by the time Basham arrived to bring his progress to an abrupt halt. With Agüero on the bench Jesus stepped up to take the kick and put it at a comfortable height for Henderson to save. The goalkeeper was a yard off his line when the ball was struck and VAR could theoretically have ordered the kick to be retaken but as applause for Henderson’s heroics were still ringing round the ground as the game restarted the officials wisely opted not to start a riot.The home crowd were incensed enough by half-time as it was, after seeing Ollie Norwood booked for a foul on Fernandinho when the City player had already got away with a couple of similar tactical offences without punishment.By the time the Brazilian did receive a caution, right on the stroke of the interval, he almost appeared to be asking Lee Mason to take action by piling into McBurnie from behind with no chance of winning the ball.The travelling support had been singing Agüero’s name for some time before he was sent on with 23 minutes remaining. The effect was close to immediate, for with 17 minutes left the visitors were in front. All it took was one measured Kevin De Bruyne pass, expertly placed between Jack O’Connell and John Egan, and a typically well-timed Agüero run to meet the ball and tap it home. United would have been doubly aggrieved because, moments before, McBurnie had narrowly failed to connect with a similarly inviting cross from Enda Stevens after Kyle Walker had lost the ball, though replays gave the impression a goal might not have passed a VAR offside test.“When top sides come here we want them to go through the mixer to get a result,” Chris Wilder said. “We went toe to toe with City and that’s something to be proud of but they have real quality and they won through a world-class pass and a fabulous finish.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/300c7b1faba8eb9c5ea2737b5e5c6d38e658c6d8/0_229_1593_955/master/1593.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a544e6a40d3bb1b4e2d149acb0021d5","title":"chelsea v arsenal premier league live","story":"Ten-man Arsenal had a grand total of two shots yet somehow twice came back from a goal down to earn a 2-2 draw from ChelseaRight then, I’m off. Here’s the match report again. Bye!Disappointed. Cos the situation of the game. Deserved to go 1-0 up, not just the sending off but the general play anyway, the way we were playing. Of course we created enough in the second half, it’s the same story for us that we don’t finish our chances, and we make errors to give them two goals on the break. It probably shows us where we’re at. We work hard but basic errors when you should control a game can end up losing you points.It’s not the slip from Ngolo, that can happen, it’s the fact they get away at the edge of our box. That’s a moment sleeping. People should know their jobs. And then the last goal, so easy. It’s a goal you see every day over the park, a right back who moves it slowly onto his left foot and rolls it into the far corner. That can’t happen.I asked Hector if he was ready go play today, and his first answer was, ‘Boss, I’m ready.’ So let’s go. These things happen. If you want to play, you enjoy your profession, these good moments come.Arsenal’s discovery of a backbone has caused some surprise:Only four times since 2006, across Europe’s top five leagues, has a team scored with their only two shots of a game. That’s four of about 26,500 matches.Here’s Jacob Steinberg’s match report from Stamford Bridge:Two inconsistent sides, two baffled managers. For Frank Lampard, this result was tough to take. Chelsea played against 10 men for more than an hour, took the lead twice and ended up dropping more points at home. They lacked creativity again and paid for their carelessness when the electrifying Gabriel Martinelli dented their push for Champions League qualification with a stunning equaliser.While Lampard seethed, Mikel Arteta celebrated Martinelli’s fearlessness and considered the defensive frailties that left Arsenal with a mountain to climb. For all the talk of progress, Arteta will know he must be ruthless with players like Shkodran Mustafi, whose catastrophic error led to David Luiz’s red card against his old side. Yet there was resolve from Arsenal when it mattered. They fell behind again when César Azpilicueta restored Chelsea’s lead. It did not last. Chelsea are too soft and Kepa Arrizabalaga’s form in goal is of grave concern. The Spaniard was the villain when he somehow let Héctor Bellerín’s shot squirm past him.Much more here:Arsenal were very good in the second half, and that will be a massively morale-boosting result for them, for all that it relied on a two moments when Chelsea players either slipped or snoozed.Chelsea had 19 shots to Arsenal’s two. That’s got to be sore.Tammy Abraham is being helped off the pitch by two members of Chelsea’s medical staff.90+5 mins: It’s all over! The corner is cleared, and the referee blows his whistle to end a wild London derby.90+4 mins: TV is watching David Luiz watching on TV, as the game enters its final moments. Chelsea have another corner, their 16th.90+3 mins: Chelsea eventually get it back, and now they’ve got themselves a corner. They play it short to Hudson-Odoi, which they’ve done a lot from the left side, and he crosses straight out of play, not for the first time.90+2 mins: Arsenal have the ball, and are happy to keep it by the left corner flag.90+1 mins: We’re into stoppage time, and there’ll be about four minutes of it.90 mins: One final substitution, as Willock comes on for Martinelli.89 mins: What a chance for Chelsea! Hudson-Odoi sends in a low cross from the right, but Batshuayi turns it wide from the near post! Xhaka, throwing out a leg, might have got the slightest touch on it to put the striker off.88 mins: Frank Lampard is going to give someone an absolute rollicking when he goes back over this goal in training tomorrow. Bellerin is given the ball, wide on the right-hand corner of the penalty area. Emerson and Abraham are in front of him, but neither of them makes even a vague attempt to stay with him when he jinks inside, and his left-footed shot curls into the far corner!Arsenal take their second shot of the game!85 mins: Abraham was offside, but the officials decided he wasn’t interfering with play (although he absolutely got in the way of Mustafi when the defender could otherwise pretty easily have cleared the cross).Abraham wins a corner, and then looks to injure an ankle on an advertising hoarding. As he limps back into the penalty area the corner is played short, Hudson-Odoi sends the ball in low and it’s tapped in by Azpilicueta!83 mins: Arsenal’s attacking intent in this half has been commendable. Still, though, they’ve only had one shot.81 mins: After Chelsea bring on another striker, Arsenal counter by adding a centre-half, as Holding replaces Pepe.80 mins: Save! The ball is chipped into the penalty area, where Barkley runs beyond the defence and flicks a backwards header towards the near post, but Leno es to his right to palm it away!79 mins: Bellerin slides in to take the ball from Willian, at the expense of a corner. That’s the Brazilian’s final action, Batshuayi replacing him.77 mins: Emerson sends the free kick into the area, and Abraham heads it towards goal from 15 yards, but Leno makes an easy save.76 mins: Guendouzi gets a yellow card for tugging Mount’s shirt and then kicking him in the knee from behind. There were at least two bookable offences there.76 mins: Chelsea haven’t really created a clear chance from open play since the 15th minute.74 mins: Torreira with a fifth-minute-of-stoppage-time clearance, from Willian’s cross. Chelsea get it straight back.72 mins: Lacazette is played in by Pepe, turns and slams the ball past Kepa, but Chelsea are saved by the fact that he was three yards offside.70 mins: Chelsea bring Mason Mount on for Kante."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60bf16db90c32ea1791d82c292e4ae2c22321e25/0_0_2829_1698/master/2829.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1f3db5b648043b7e6c503e2d321dd958","title":"sheffield united v manchester city everton v newcastle and more live","story":"Sergio Agüero wins it for City, incredible late drama at Goodison Park, Aston Villa beat Watford at the death, Brighton overpower Bournemouth and Saints defeat PalaceIt’s full-time there!

See you soon!It’s now Chelsea 2-2 Arsenal ... but you probably know that. Azpilicueta and Bellerin have traded goals in double-quick time. What a game that has turned into!Any thoughts on any of these games? Maybe you were at one!And finally, this from Villa’s own late show:Here is Andy Hunter at Goodison – and what a fantastic report this is, given the scale of the late turnaround there:Ed Aarons, now, at Selhurst Park:And this is Ben Fisher at the Vitality Stadium:Match reports are coming through! Here is Paul Wilson’s take from Bramall Lane:That Villa goal is being given to Mings by some parties – he tapped the ball to Konsa but then fell over the Konsa’s shot may have glanced off him when he was grounded. Doubt they’ll care overly. That was huge for them.Martinelli is one of the best 18-year-old forwards I have ever seen. Seriously. He has it. There are shades of Suarez and Batistuta. He is going all the way.Gabriel Martinelli has equalised for Arsenal’s 10 men at Chelsea! Simon Burnton has more!Very, very hard to do justice to the scenes at the end in those games at Goodison and Villa Park. Everton had that game won, two goals up, in the last minute of stoppage time. Then Lejeune, who had never scored for Newcastle in 43 appearances, put two in! Utterly remarkable. His first was a cracking finish too.And that win for Villa, secured by a fairytale added-time strike by Konsa, ensures that they – like tonight’s other big winners, Bournemouth – can believe again ...And Villa win theirs at the death! Konsa, another defender, strikes in brilliantly from the edge of the box after Mings - I think – tees him up! Remarkable scenes there!I don’t believe it!!!!! He’s done it again! There’s an almighty scramble and Lejeune’s shot crosses the line before Pickford can bundle it out – Newcastle, and the most unlikely of scorers, have pulled this right out of the fire in injury time. They go berserk!!It’ll be too late, surely, but it’s a very slick acrobatic finish by the defender after the hosts don’t clear a corner properly.That was a hell of a battle, that, and you sense Pep knows that as he shakes hands with Wilder – both men smiling.And some late, late pressure by the Blades at Bramall Lane but there’s a minute of stoppage time to go. Aguero’s goal will surely, surely decide this now ...Both sides knocking on the door for what would be a huge winner at Villa Park ...If Palace had a chance of pulling things round against Saints they probably don’t now, as Connor Wickham has blazed a decent opportunity wide of the near post. Five minutes or so to go.Chelsea lead Arsenal - now minus David Luiz of course – 1-0 at the break at Stamford Bridge A lifeline for the Seagulls? Mooy puts it in off the post and, via VAR check for handball, it is given ...Ryan Fraser curls just wide for Bournemouth, who have rode their luck at times defensively but looked so much more like their old selves going forward tonight.Laporte goes off at Bramall Lane but it looks more like cramp than anything else. A good return for him today.And at the other end Bournemouth make them pay! They spring from back to front and Wilson rounds Ryan to tap home – for his first league goal since 28 September!Brighton are really having a go at Bournemouth but cannot beat Ramsdale, who has just thwarted them *yet again*.He’s ridiculous, isn’t he? So is De Bruyne, who weights a delicious ball across from the right – impossible to defend really – that gives the substitute a chance he simply cannot miss. The Blades’ good work goes up in smoke, just minutes after a big miss from close range McBurnie – who may or may not have been just offside.There’s a goal, and potentially a big one in the relegation fight! Luiz crashes in at the back post after a left-sided shot is parried.The goals have dried up for now! Which means Everton, Bournemouth and Saints are all getting nearer to the points. They’re all 2-0 up although Ramsdale has, again, made a decent save to nip Brighton’s comeback hopes in the bud for now.Watford lead 1-0 at Villa and it’s Blades 0-0 City going into the last 20.Brighton come close to a lifeline as Ramsdale bravely saves from Dunk. We are 65 minutes in there, and Graham Potter’s side trail 2-0. This result would give them a little bit of a problem.The Blades might have one of those now as Aguero is on for Jesus ...Saints should seal the match at Palace but Long, in a similar position to that seemingly crucial Tosun miss from earlier, sidefoots straight at Guaita.A fine Blades move sees Basham get to the line and see his cutback fingertipped out by Ederson to the sub Mousset ... who goes for an elaborate backheel, which the keeper saves, rather than laying the ball off for a totally open – and subsequently furious – Fleck!And it’s nearly 3-0 for Bournemouth, Ryan denying Billing smartly. They are half an hour away from the points they so desperately require.Not quite sure how Watford haven’t scored a second at Villa Park there but Nyland has just made a quite superb double save from Deeney.Over at Stamford Bridge, David Luiz has been sent off for Arsenal and Jorginho has converted a spot-kick for Chelsea ... 1-0 there.Digne slots Calvert-Lewin, who is improving a lot these days, in and he swipes a clinical left-footed finish across Dubravka.City finding it harder to create chances early in the second half at Bramall Lane. The Blades are such a tough, tough side to face.As things stand, Southampton – a team beaten 9-0 at home a few weeks back – go into the top half.At Goodison, Bernard has a chance for 2-0 but dinks just over ...Saints’ second pearler of the game! Armstrong takes possession 25 yards out, has a touch, and then whips a wonderful effort past Guaita and into the corner!Everton threatening a second against Newcastle, for whom Dubravka erts a dangerous left-sided centre away.It’s Chelsea 0-0 Arsenal after about 15 minutes there by the way, but Arsenal are yet to really get started by all accounts.Strap right in ...All we want is consistency (and for VAR to be flung in the bin, no matter the rights or wrongs here).Tom Hopkins is another among the Henderson fanclub:“I was (fairly randomly) at Wembley for the play off final while Dean Henderson was on loan at Shrewsbury. He certainly looked the real deal that day, I’m wondering when Southgate is going to have a look – none of his other options seem entirely compelling?”Bit of a scuffle as they go off at Selhurst! It’s Zaha vs Ward-Prowse. Not quite sure what happened there but there were fingers jabbed and pointed, particularly on Zaha’s side.Get your assessments in!A smart counter almost sees the Cherries granted a chance to make it three – Brighton are, all of a sudden, absolutely all over the show.A corner is swung in from the Bournemouth right and is allowed to bounce right in front of goal. Billing challenges Gross and it’s the Brighton man it ricochets off, by the looks of things. What a turnaround for Eddie Howe!Well we have goals now, don’t we? And a missed penalty in the goalless game. Nearing half-time in them all but the drama is ratcheting up ...A slick move down the right, Deulofeu’s ball in, Deeney’s bullet of a header, and Nigel Pearson can do absolutely no wrong at the moment.The Liverpool loanee drives in a fine finish to – maybe, just maybe - reignite Bournemouth’s season!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f0829d774d9f26248946b1df7e2b4cb3bacf9e93/0_89_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f4e6f23472af9a55d7faf9e62650655a","title":"what happens when we dont believe women","story":"Not listening to women’s experience of abusive men – and of other areas from health to the economy – harms all of society It’s become a grim ritual among the women I know: as soon as there is news of another mass shooting, we wait to hear the inevitable story about the shooter’s history of hurting women. (The shooter is always a man.) Sometimes he’s been violent to his mother or grandmother. More often, police reports reveal his history of abusing his girlfriend or wife.But almost always he practiced his violence on a woman long before he planned his massacre, and within a day of the slaughter we’re sharing this history with impotent grief, asking again and again, what will it take to take women’s lives seriously? If we took women’s lives seriously, if men who abused the women in their lives faced any kind of real consequences, would the people we are now preparing to bury be alive today?That’s a complicated question, tangled up with gun politics and our failed criminal justice system. But the core reality remains stark: it’s impossible to contain the suffering that stems from discounting and disbelieving women.If we refused to accept the daily suffering of women and girls at the hands of men who claim to love them, we would have a federal policy removing guns from abusers, and we would ensure that it worked in practice. And we would have a lot fewer gun deaths. Period.It’s vile to have to make this argument. It should be enough that women are hurt. But it’s not. Women’s pain is expected, part of the wallpaper of life. In her indelible essay “The female price of male pleasure,” Lili Loofbourow points to the chasm between what men and women define as “bad sex” to illuminate this basic fact of modern culture: if men find a sexual encounter boring or unsatisfying, they call it “bad”.But we’re not. And when you don’t listen to us, we’re not the only ones who pay the price. Our national failure to take women seriously is a public health crisis, and not just because of bad guys with guns.Take, for example, the medical establishment’s long-documented refusal to take women at our word about the symptoms we’re experiencing. Whether we’re suffering from acute and chronic pain, mysterious weight loss or gain, neuromuscular conditions, or depression and anxiety, we’re suspected of being melodramatic, told that all we need is an attitude adjustment and some self-care.The result? Increased healthcare costs, lost workplace productivity, and the worst maternal death rate in the developed world. This last cost is borne disproportionately by black women, who are treated as even less trustworthy than white women. And mistrusting black women has this massive public health cost as well: if Congress and President Clinton had listened to black women in the reproductive justice movement in 1994, we could have fixed our healthcare system decades ago.Or consider that if we could simply all agree to believe trans women that they exist and are the experts on their own gender identity, the sky-high rates of murder and suicide in the trans community (a recent study found that trans girls have nearly double the suicide attempts of their cis girl peers) would surely be reduced, as would the elevated rates of housing and job discrimination, sexual violence, and street harassment they are currently forced to suffer.Imagine the lives and livelihoods that would have been saved if we had listened to Brooksley Born. In 1996, as the new head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, she realized that the derivatives market, if left unchecked, would eventually cause a catastrophic economic collapse. She spent years trying to get powerful men like then-Fed-chair Alan Green and treasury secretary Robert Rubin to help her sound the alarm. Instead, they fought her every step of the way, until she finally gave up on them and released a report about her predictions on her own. It was ignored and derided by the powers that be. A decade later, the very dynamics she warned against caused the Great Recession.The list seems endless. If we trusted poor women, we wouldn’t withhold aid from their kids to prevent them from procreating as some kind of “scam”, and poor kids would grow up with better nutrition, more stable family dynamics, and better education. If we trusted women to make their own reproductive decisions, we would have unfettered access to safe, reliable birth control and abortion care, and that would likely decrease poverty levels, improve women’s mental and physical health, and create better outcomes for the children they choose to have.Consider how brief and unimportant the Flint water crisis could have been if Michigan officials had trusted the mothers of Flint when they said their water was suddenly undrinkable. How many kids would have grown up without lead exposure? What could those kids have achieved without the lifelong cognition problems and emotional challenges that can result from childhood lead poisoning?And of course, any discussion of the public health costs of disbelieving women must address itself to Hillary Clinton. It was so hard for voters – including white women – to believe in Clinton as a leader that we are all now suffering through the age of Trump. One chilling experiment suggests that the simple fact of Clinton’s gender could have cost her as much as eight points in the general election.We don’t need science to tell us that it was more believable to almost 63 million US voters that Trump, a man who had never held a single public office, who had been sued almost 1,500 times, whose businesses had filed for bankruptcy six times and who had driven Atlantic City into decades-long depression, a race-baiting misogynist leech of a man who was credibly accused of not only of sexual violence but also of defrauding veterans and teachers out of millions of dollars via Trump University, would be a good president than it was to imagine that Clinton, a former first lady, senator and secretary of state and arguably the most qualified person to ever run, would be a better leader.It is not an exaggeration to suggest that every public health impact the Trump administration is having on us – and the list is long and includes making quality healthcare access less accessible for millions, enabling rapists to roam free of consequences on American campuses, and literally speeding up catastrophic climate change by pulling out of the Paris accords – can be linked to our stubborn unwillingness to believe a woman about her own competence, or even just her assertion that a man is dangerous.The truth underlying the public health crisis of women’s believability is even worse than it looks. That’s because social researchers have long demonstrated that it’s not just that we hold women to much higher standards than we do men before we believe them. It’s more perverse than that: we prefer not finding women credible. As a culture, we hate to believe women, and we penalize them for forcing us to do so.In other words, as women’s credibility increases, especially in ways that defy gender norms, their social likability decreases. They become shrill bitches, ball busters, too aggressive, too bossy, such intolerable know-it-alls. It is not enough that we demand women clear a much higher bar than men do to prove their trustworthiness. It’s that we’re mad when they manage to succeed anyway. And we’re all paying the price for that anger.Some of the losses are literally immeasurable. I know of no woman who doesn’t house inside her the nagging feeling that maybe what she has to say is not that important, or will cause too much trouble, or will put her in danger. I know of no woman who has not at least some of the time allowed that feeling to prevail, to smother her impulse to speak. I am haunted by the losses to humanity those infinite silences represent.What inventions and innovations are we suffering without? What tragedies proceeded un-prevented? What kindness and community are we starving for that we could be sustained by, had women not silenced ourselves? For that matter, what offerings could we be benefiting from if women simply didn’t have to work so hard to prove our credibility to ourselves and others? How many hours of our lives have been stolen from us in this way?And yet still today, how many women does it take to overcome the credibility of one man? It took 60 for sexual abuse allegations to become credible against Bill Cosby. For Harvey Weinstein to be credibly accused of sexual harassment and assault, the number is more like 80. For some, we have yet to find the number. Over a dozen accused Donald Trump of sexual assault and he is still the president of the United States as of this writing.Ultimately, the systemic disbelief of women is less about actually seeing women as untrustworthy, and more about fearing what happens if we are able to step into our full power. Not that this distinction matters in practice: do anti-abortion activists really think women are so easily duped by doctors, or is it just more convenient for them to blame “doctors” and posit women as frail-minded and in need of protection than it is to admit that they just want to dictate what we do with our own bodies? Do we not believe that trans women know themselves better than we do, or do we just fear how destabilizing it is to admit that gender is a construct? The damage is done either way.But it’s important to understand how deeply rooted this dynamic is. As has been observed of many oppressive institutions, the delegitimization of women’s authority isn’t the unfortunate side-effect of a broken framework. It’s the grease that makes the entire system go. Women’s erasure is an essential part of the deal powerful men have always made with the men they would have power over: let me have control over you, and in turn I will ensure you can control women. It’s the same bargain white women make when they support misogynist white men in power: if I acquiesce to you demeaning me because of my gender, you will at least allow me to demean others because of their race.But those who refuse to take women seriously rarely admit – to themselves even – what they’re really defending. Instead, they often imagine they have more “rational” concerns. Won’t innocent men be falsely accused? Will women have too much power? Can we really assume women are infallible? These are less questions than straw men, a sleight of hand trick drawing our focus to a shadowy boogeywoman who will take everything you hold dear if you don’t constrain her with your distrust.There is one meaningful way in which the fearmongers are right. Because the existing power structure is built on female subjugation, female credibility is inherently dangerous to it. Patriarchy is called that for a reason: men really do benefit from it. When we take seriously women’s experiences of sexual violence and humiliation, men will be forced to lose a kind of freedom they often don’t even know they enjoy: the freedom to use women’s bodies to shore up their egos, convince themselves they are powerful and in control, or whatever other uses they see fit. When we genuinely believe in women’s leadership capacity, men must face twice the competition they previously had to contend with. And none of us, whatever our gender, are immune from the tremors that can come when the assumptions at the foundation our social contracts are upended.But while we’re constantly obsessed with how risky it is to trust women, what we most of the time fail to consider is the cost of our ongoing mistrust, the cost of missing out on the unfettered power of women. A world in which we treat women as de facto credible is not a world in which men are doing women a favor. It’s a world in which everyone benefits from women’s increased power and knowledge and talent, one in which we recognize that addressing women’s suffering makes it more possible for people of every gender to thrive. The data bear this out in every sector: when girls and women have access to secondary education, their communities and future children have better outcomes. When women are well-represented in the top management of companies, those businesses do better. Even movies that pass the Bechdel test do better at the box office than movies that fail it.Seeing women as fully human may cost men certain kinds of oppressive power, but it pays idends to the human race in nearly every other way. It should be enough to believe in women simply because it’s better for women. But for every time it isn’t, remember this: the costs of disbelieving us are astronomical, and no one escapes the bill.From Believe: How Trusting Women Can Change the World (28 January, Seal Press), an anthology edited by Jaclyn Friedman and Jessica Valenti"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e94b01c9a046f47d4e96501979d10d8a2519fb64/0_192_2334_1400/master/2334.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=00fa34dc4be41a43085e83d8b181e4f2","title":"chris packham urges tv makers to shout louder about nature crises","story":"Springwatch presenter laments past failure of environmental shows to spark actionWildlife and environmental TV programmes have “failed wholeheartedly” in the past to spark action on the climate, bioersity loss and the growing human population, Chris Packham has told an audience of TV executives.The Springwatch presenter said that although recent series had “turned a corner”, programme-makers must “shout more loudly” to tell the truth about environmental crises and call out politicians’ lies.He said future generations may come to regard today’s leaders such as Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin, Jair Bolsonaro and Scott Morrison in a similar way as current generations see Hitler, Stalin and Pol Pot, because they could by then have caused the deaths of millions of people.“If we let them, they have the capacity to become genocidal maniacs because of their inactions, because of their actions when it comes to caring for our planet,” he said in the annual Bafta television lecture at the Barbican in London on Tuesday evening.Packham, whose Horizon documentary 7.7 Billion People and Counting was broadcast on BBC Two on Tuesday night, read the audience a short story he had written, set in a future where starving people queue to look at the last tree on the planet. He said science fiction might become science fact given the rising population, the “terrifying” collapse in bioersity and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s warning that runaway global heating must be tackled within 10 years.In a video segment filmed in Tanzania, Packham said he was often told while making wildlife documentaries that it was not his job to make statements of environmental fact, “because that’s news, that’s something that’s got to be reported by journalists”. He said the recent UK general election had been marked by many journalists’ failure to challenge lies.“If someone tells you it’s sunny and someone else tells you it’s raining, you don’t quote them both, you look out of the bloody window and see whether it’s sunny or raining and then you tell the truth about it,” he said.“At this point in time, when it comes to environmental journalism, it is dangerous to lie because we have to tell the truth. Truth is the most essential component of progress.”Packham added: “For most of the last 30 or 40 years we’ve been making bits of the world look like paradise, absolute utopias. We go to places, there are never any people there, everything is functional, everything is beautiful. OK, we’ve excited people, we’ve fascinated people, we’ve shown them things they could never, ever have dreamed of, and they have fallen in love with that environment through awe and wonder and affinity – but has their love actually transformed into making a real difference? No.”Packham praised Blue Planet II for bringing plastic pollution to global attention and the One Show’s campaign to raise awareness on the same issue. The BBC’s Seven Worlds, One Planet contained some “hard-hitting stuff”, he said.“We are starting to make these programmes and the BBC has a real commitment to make more,” he told the  before the speech, describing his Horizon documentary as “like a smack in the face with a sledgehammer”.“It’s going to hurt a lot,” he said. “It’s pretty hardcore. It’s the hardest programme the BBC have done yet.”Packham said Bafta’s We are Albert campaign, which encourages the film and TV industries to reduce their environmental impact, was a step in the right direction but he urged programme-makers to set meaningful targets to become carbon neutral within three years.He described recent environmental TV productions that used single-use plastic, where crew members flew home for weekends and where two camera operators flew to a location in a private jet. Such practices were “an open door for enormous and justified criticism”, he said.He told the audience: “You’re going to say it’s going to come with a cost, budgets are getting smaller. They are not getting as small as the wildlife populations out here in the world … you can’t have your cake and eat it too. It’s that simple.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c796a370bf5955c2c57cb8e1bcc3caf3c7a9b92/0_4_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a4a8eb7caac61ebaf5e0139214f38dbe","title":"netflix quarterly earnings streaming competition","story":"Company posted strong fourth-quarter earnings but added fewer customers than predicted in the last three months of 2019Netflix shares briefly stumbled after the streaming giant posted strong fourth-quarter earnings but gave disappointing guidance on the coming quarter.The quarter four earnings announcement on Tuesday comes as the company faces a field increasingly crowded by new streaming services like Disney+ and AppleTV+. The company also disclosed it had added 420,000 new customers in the last three months of 2019, fewer than the 600,000 it had predicted.The company’s fourth-quarter revenue was $5.47bn, slightly above the $5.45bn predicted by analysts.

It said it expected slower subscriber growth in the first quarter of 2020, reinforcing investor fears that it will not be able to stand up to growing competition. Netflix said in a letter to shareholders its new show The Witcher is “tracking to be our biggest season one TV series ever”. The company is placing an increased emphasis on original content after receiving Golden Globe nominations in both TV and film, including its series The Crown and Unbelievable and films The Irishman and Marriage Story.

James Purnell, the former Labour minister who now runs BBC radio and education and who was once considered Hall’s likely successor, does not intend to apply, but there is no shortage of others who might be interested.The chief executive of BBC Studios, the corporation’s commercial arm and production hub, Davie is considered a leading internal candidate. He has a mix of commercial and public service experience, having worked at Procter \u0026amp Gamble and Pepsi, and previously ran the BBC’s audio and music operation. Davie briefly acted as director general while the BBC waited for Lord Hall to start work.Last year Davie turned down an offer to take over as chief executive of the Premier League, which observers believe was because he was eyeing a run at taking over from Hall.Apple’s creative director in Europe has previously held top roles at the BBC, where she worked for two decades, plus Channel 4 and Channel 5. The Australian-born Hunt was responsible for Channel 4’s audacious £75m deal to poach The Great British Bake Off from the BBC, where she had previously been controller of BBC One.Hunt was considered a strong candidate to become chief executive of Channel 4 in 2017, at which time she held the role of chief creative officer, but she missed out to Alex Mahon. There could be a question mark for Hunt over pay: Hall’s £450,000-a-year salary is far less than Channel 4 or Apple pay. However, no one takes on the director general role for the money. She may be considered the frontrunner among the external candidates.The Channel 4 chief executive has had to address similar issues to those the BBC is facing, including political pressure and the shift in viewer habits in the digital era. She has been outspoken about the threat of US tech and TV firms shaping the national culture, and she led the relocation of a significant part of Channel 4’s operation out of London.Mahon was the first woman to run a UK broadcaster larger than Channel 5, and the first female chief executive of Channel 4 in its 38-year history. She has previously worked closely with the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, having served as a member of the advisory panel put together to help map out the future scope and remit of the BBC before the renewal of its royal charter in 2016. McCall is in the early stages of transforming ITV’s digital future having just launched BritBox, which aims to challenge Netflix in the UK, in partnership with the BBC. A former chief executive at easyJet and  Media Group, the publisher of the  and Observer, McCall boasts impressive commercial credentials. Having been chief executive at ITV only since 2018, McCall may feel it is too early in her stint at the UK’s largest commercial free-to-air broadcaster to throw her hat in the ring for the top BBC job.The BBC’s director of content has a £1bn budget and has been responsible for delivering some of the most popular shows in the UK, from Bodyguard and Bake Off to Luther. She has shown a willingness to stand up to the government in the past. A 14-year BBC veteran, Moore may be seen as lacking in commercial experience outside the environs of the corporation. The director general of the CBI has strong credentials in both broadcasting and politics. A member of the No 10 policy unit under John Major, she has also worked as a director of strategy at both the BBC and ITV. During her time at the BBC she designed and launched Freeview. Earlier in her career she worked as a journalist at the Economist and was a partner in the management consultancy McKinsey’s media practice.Having just started as chair of John Lewis Partnership, the former chief executive of Ofcom may feel the time is not right to apply for the BBC role. She knows her way around Whitehall, having worked in the Treasury in charge of public finances. White’s lack of broadcasting experience counts against her but she has plenty of insight into the BBC as Ofcom regulates the corporation’s activities as well as the wider media and broadcasting sector.Rebuck is the chair of Penguin Random House UK and has worked in publishing for more than four decades. She is a former member of the government’s creative industries taskforce. In 1998 she founded the World Book Day charity.

Two years of parliamentary warfare over Brexit had left deep scars on the personal relationships that once formed the glue for Corbyn’s radical political project.Speaking to many of the leading figures in Labour’s election campaign, a picture emerges of tactical spats, mixed messages and frayed tempers – not least Corbyn’s own.Many of the senior players were the same as in 2017 – the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, chaired the daily 7.30am calls to set the agenda for the day ahead the policy chief, Andrew Fisher, oversaw the manifesto the former Corbyn aide Karie Murphy led the operational side of the campaign, and Milne was in charge of strategy and communications. Jennie Formby, handpicked by Corbyn to be Labour’s general secretary, oversaw management and budgets.Yet this group had been on different sides in the painful dispute about Labour’s Brexit stance – McDonnell and Fisher were instrumental in helping to persuade Corbyn that backing a second referendum was the only way of safeguarding the leftwing political movement they had built. By contrast, Milne and Murphy – as well as the Unite union’s chief of staff, Andrew Murray, and the Corbynite PR Steve Howell, both of whom sat on the election strategy group – believed that fateful decision would cost Labour dear in leave-supporting seats.And this difference of analysis continued to reverberate throughout the campaign. There was a strongly held perception in Labour’s HQ at the outset that Labour still had more work to do to pacify remain voters, after its switch to backing a second referendum.As for leave voters, many of whom were heavily concentrated in a swath of Labour-held seats being targeted by the Tories, the plan was to change the subject – focusing as much as possible on other issues, including public services and the NHS.“It felt like the People’s Vote campaign in there,” said one senior member of the campaign team, who recalled being warned, in respect of Labour leave voters: “We don’t want to prod the beast!”Howell, who had overseen Labour’s digital campaigning in 2017 and was brought in this time to look at targeting and polling, was alarmed by the prevalence of the view that Labour could win by focusing on remainers.He and other sceptics about Labour’s shift towards a referendum always felt it was fruitless to try to skirt the issue. “In the end, you can’t just fight a battle and ignore your opponent. You can’t just say: ‘We’re fighting at sea’, if your opponent is mounting a land invasion,” said one party strategist. Even Labour’s attack line on the NHS – focusing on the risk that it would be handed to Donald Trump as part of a trade deal – had an anti-Brexit undertone to it. And focusing on austerity, which still featured heavily in Corbyn’s stump speeches, was perhaps a less potent weapon against a Tory party that had ditched Philip Hammond’s rigid fiscal discipline.“That was one of the things that we were a bit caught on the hop about: Boris suddenly started throwing austerity overboard. He had deprived us of our core message,” said the adviser.Labour’s approach to targeting was almost a mirror image of 2017’s. Then, Corbyn and his lieutenants blamed the excessive caution of party officials for blunting their attacking edge.This time, they began with an ambitious list of 96 targets – 66 of which were attacking seats, and 30 defensive.That was partly because the job of any opposition is to get into government, and it would have appeared defeatist to target fewer seats than Labour needed for a majority.But the campaign team also hoped some of the magic that propelled them to such a close result in 2017 would spark the campaign into life again: the rousing rallies, Corbyn’s comfortable-in-his-own-skin authenticity, Tory missteps. “We were all too hypnotised by our achievement in 2017, and we thought that however bad the situation was, once the campaign got going we would catch up,” said one party source.Some events – including an upbeat launch at Battersea Arts Centre, and the unveiling of the manifesto at Birmingham City University, where Corbyn held the document triumphantly aloft against a dark pink backdrop – almost recaptured the buzz of two years earlier. But veterans of that election remarked that the crowds in 2019 were generally smaller this time, and failed to build as the weeks went on.Labour’s manifesto itself was a casualty of the fractious working relationships that dogged the campaign. Milne was widely viewed internally as the most important single decision-maker in the 2017 campaign. But this time, a day before the crucial clause V meeting at which the manifesto was to be signed off, he had not seen the final printed version.Key policies had been thrashed out in discussions, including among the strategy group – but Fisher’s policy team kept a firm hold on the finished document, and his relationship with Milne had been badly frayed by the Brexit battle.“No one really knew what was coming until it emerged, from a process only really accessible to Andrew Fisher and John McDonnell,” said one Labour source. “And so major policies were coming out – free broadband, Waspi women – which really nobody knew was coming.” But Labour’s policy wonks insist they were just doing what they could to fill the hole where they felt an electoral strategy should have been. Unlike in 2017, policy and strategy were working in silos.The general election was Fisher’s final job for Corbyn, after he resigned in September, with an email leaked to the Sunday Times in which he gave a blistering critique of Labour’s incompetence, including what he called “a blizzard of lies and excuses” about the party’s failure to come up with a strapline for its conference until the last minute.The same indecision dogged Labour’s election slogan. “It’s Time for Real Change” was meant as a riposte to Johnson’s phoney claim to be offering a fresh start for Britain, but was the outcome of a fraught debate, including external consultants and focus grouping, and as such was little loved by anyone.As the campaign went on, and anxiety increased at the risks Labour faced in defensive seats, “Labour Is On Your Side” took over – though one insider laments with hindsight that voters in leave seats who felt the party had betrayed them over Brexit appear to have been moved to respond with “fuck off”.The “grid”, overseen by the combative Murphy, and discussed at a 10am daily meeting, was packed with policy announcements: but there was scant sense of a theme or direction for each week or phase of the campaign.“They had all these policies drafted and waiting, and that would lead the grid – a different policy announcement every day,” said one member of the campaign team. “I think it was pretty obvious that there was a lot of throwing a lot of stuff at a lot of walls and hoping it would stick.”As the campaign went on, and reports flooded into the Victoria HQ from anxious candidates in defensive seats, those who had always believed Brexit was Labour’s overriding challenge felt increasingly vindicated – and alarmed.On Sunday 24 November, about halfway through, the strategy group met to review how things were going – and agreed it was necessary to make more of a pitch to leavers – and to resource defensive seats more generously.As a result, Howell recommended adding another 16 seats to the target list, and it was decided to ask Labour’s regional directors for more recommendations – a process that resulted in a further 21 seats being put on the list, taking the total to more than 130, though not all of those were fully resourced.The group also decided to focus more on Labour’s bread-and-butter offer to working-class voters in leave-supporting communities – including giveaways such as free prescriptions and social care – and to extend the party chairman Ian Lavery’s campaigning Brexit bus tour.But in the event, much of the following week was overshadowed by Labour’s record on tackling antisemitism. On Tuesday, as the party prepared to launch its race and faith manifesto, the Times splashed with a letter from the chief rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, claiming Corbyn’s handling of allegations of anti-Jewish racism meant he was “unfit for high office”.At the Bernie Grant Arts Centre in Tottenham that morning, Corbyn was more than half an hour late for the race and faith event, and the MP Dawn Butler filled the time by reciting the lyrics to the Labi Siffre classic (Something Inside) So Strong, to a bemused audience of hacks, who bombarded Labour aides with questions and requests. Until the last moment, it was unclear whether she and Corbyn would take questions from journalists.Later that day, the Labour leader recorded a pre-planned interview with Andrew Neil. Corbyn was at his most petulant, as the broadcaster challenged him to apologise over antisemitism, grumpily interjecting “will you let me finish?” – a clip of which found its way on to that week’s Have I Got News for You.Colleagues say that throughout the campaign Corbyn was keener to be personally involved in day-to-day decisions than in 2017 – and grumpier, sometimes even angry if he felt his views had been disregarded.Labour tried to use a moment of political theatre to seize back the agenda the next day, by staging a press conference where Corbyn dramatically held aloft a 400-plus page leaked dossier suggesting the government was ready to put the NHS up for sale. “These uncensored documents leave Boris Johnson’s denials in absolute tatters!” he cried.But the impact was nothing like the furore in 2017 when Labour’s manifesto was leaked – or when Theresa May insisted “nothing has changed”, after executing a swift U-turn on her social care policy. “It worked for a day, and we had a 36-hour row about whether Donald Trump was going to buy the NHS, but that was it,” said one insider.And as the strategy group tried to hone Labour’s message, focusing on a bread-and-butter offer to leavers, some began to fear Corbyn’s straight-from-the-heart, unscripted authenticity was not the best medium for delivering it. “It’s just Jeremy, isn’t it?” said one exasperated member of the campaign team. “You judge him on a different marking scheme, almost. Did this person in this stump speech hit the five key messages to get on the evening news? No. Was he ever going to? No. I went to rallies where there was a billboard and he didn’t say what was on the fucking billboard. He just talked about whatever he wanted.”As polling day loomed, some aides would have liked Corbyn to make more aggressive attacks on Johnson, whose loose relationship with the truth was openly laughed at by the Question Time audience when the pair met in a head-to-head debate. But “no personal attacks” was one of the rules written for Corbyn’s 2015 leadership campaign by Fisher, and he stuck to it doggedly.The Labour leader told the  at the outset of the campaign, “they go low, we go high” – though one despairing party aide described it as “they go low, we go wandering across the country”.After six gruelling weeks of criss-crossing the country, including a dawn rally in Glasgow on the final day of campaigning, Corbyn watched the grim exit poll with his wife, Laura, his fiercely loyal sons – who released a statement shortly afterwards lambasting the media for treating him badly – and a few officials, including Milne.They had been on a long journey together, from the political wilderness to the brink of government, but they believed their electoral chances had been crushed, in what one rueful Labour source called, “the Brexit vice”.“This campaign was lost before it began,” the source added. “Even if nothing had gone wrong in terms of targeting, messaging, Jeremy’s schedule, TV interviews, anything – I still think we would not have won.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95356b3865f87d2d84885dcd54996a41ebb70704/0_190_5107_3064/master/5107.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e35b38fcda9367713fdab5c12706ae96","title":"dominic cummings thinktank called for end of bbc in current form","story":"New Frontiers Foundation said in 2004 the BBC was ‘mortal enemy’ of Tory partyDominic Cummings’s thinktank called for the “end of the BBC in its current form” and suggested rightwingers should work to undermine the credibility of the broadcaster, branding it the “mortal enemy” of the Conservative party.Cummings, who is Boris Johnson’s most powerful adviser, was the director of the New Frontiers Foundation when it called in 2004 for a campaign to target the BBC and the creation of a Fox News equivalent that would not be constrained by impartiality rules.Opposition MPs said on Tuesday that the views of Cummings’s thinktank would fuel suspicions that Johnson’s administration is gearing up to overhaul the BBC.The disclosure comes at a sensitive time for the corporation, whose director general. Tony Hall, announced on Monday he was standing down. Several Tories have since called for an end to the licence fee, while Labour figures have warned that the BBC is facing a dangerous moment as it approaches its 100th anniversary.The thinktank also suggested an end to the ban on TV political advertising to allow politicians to speak directly to the public in ad breaks during Coronation Street, for example, and the “development of the web networks scrutinising the BBC and providing information to commercial rivals with an interest in undermining the BBC’s credibility”.One post from September 2004 said: “There are three structural things that the right needs to happen in terms of communications... 1) the undermining of the BBC’s credibility 2) the creation of a Fox News equivalent  talk radio shows  bloggers etc to shift the centre of gravity 3) the end of the ban on TV political advertising.”Another idea proposed was that government ministers should avoid appearing on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme – a policy that has come to pass since Cummings entered Downing Street as Boris Johnson’s de facto chief of staff last year.The suggestions were made in a series of long blogposts in 2004 and 2005 by the New Frontiers Foundation, which was a short-lived free market thinktank that aimed to emulate rightwing US organisations such as the Heritage Foundation. Cummings was the director of the thinktank and described as one of two “principal staff”. It folded due to lack of support.No 10 declined to comment but a Whitehall source said it was “not particularly uncommon for special advisers to have expressed opinions before entering No 10”.There are signs that Johnson’s government is already looking at changing the BBC’s funding model, including the possibility of decriminalising non-payment of the licence fee as a first step.The prime minister first called the licence fee into question during the election campaign and Nicky Morgan, the culture secretary, has suggested a move to a Netflix-style subscription system could be considered for the BBC, potentially ending almost a century of public broadcasting funded by a licence fee.Ben Bradshaw, the Labour MP and former culture secretary, said Cummings and some Tory MPs “would like nothing more than to replace the BBC with a rightwing propaganda channel like Fox”.He added: “The BBC belongs to the British public, not the government, and the public value the public service ethos of the BBC, objective and accurate information and news and the broad range of much-loved radio and TV programmes and would not take kindly to them being sacrificed to Rupert Murdoch.”Ed Davey, the acting leader of the Liberal Democrats, said: “The BBC is a national treasure and if Dominic Cummings thinks he has got a mandate to go after Strictly and David Attenborough he has got another thing coming.“Every politician and party will have their problems and frustrations with the BBC, but often that’s because the Beeb are doing their job. The Liberal Democrats will fight for the BBC tooth and nail.”Cummings has criticised the BBC in personal blog posts since 2013, accusing it of showing pro-remain bias, but his thinktank’s proposals from a decade earlier went much further, calling for a campaign to target the corporation and transform the broadcasting landscape to make it more favourable for rightwingers.In a post offering advice to the Tories, the thinktank said the party should copy the US Republicans by realising they were in a “culture war” in which they needed to “shape the culture actively in their favour over long periods with large efforts”.In November 2004 Cummings wrote an article for the Business, a now defunct newspaper, calling for a “campaign to end the licence fee and break the BBC’s stranglehold” and for people to “hire lawyers and investigate whether the ban on television political advertising can be overturned in the courts”.The same argument was made multiple times by the New Frontiers Foundation throughout 2004. The thinktank suggested the Conservatives “can only prosper in the long-term by undermining the BBC’s reputation for impartiality in the way CBS’s reputation is being undermined now, and by changing the law on political advertising.”It added: “The BBC is a determined propagandist with a coherent ideology. We are paying for it. We should not be. We should be changing the game.”Another post from July 2004 said the right “should be aiming for the end of the BBC in its current form and the legalisation of TV political advertising”. Another argued that the “privileged closed world of the BBC needs to be turned upside down and its very existence should be the subject of a very intense and well-funded campaign that involves bringing out whistleblowers armed with internal memos and taped conversations of meetings”.The New Frontiers posts advocated a number of ideas that Cummings has since promoted while in government office. These include the creation of a US-style research body to fund high-risk scientific projects, and reform of Whitehall.One of the thinktank’s blogposts said: “A serious Conservative government would thoroughly purge the civil service and remove swathes of the top people. Rather than pretend that they are neutral, it would be healthier for Britain to adopt the American system and have routine purges as different political parties gain democratic power.”The thinktank also made the argument that appearing on the Today programme was not helpful to ministers. “It is a mistake in general for a Conservative leader to appear on the Today programme unless he is announcing a major new positive proposal, especially if it is to answer a series of attacking questions about ‘strategy’. Today exists to try to make him look stupid and create an echo of ‘U-turn’  ‘gaffe’  ‘confusion’ stories, as with other major politicians. Effort should be erted from Today to programmes that affect the public far more,” it said.Johnson’s ministers have been banned from appearing on Today since after the election in December.Other ideas floated by the thinktank included research into “hypersonic bombers”, reducing trade tariffs “to zero, thus bringing cheaper goods for us and profits rather than disaster for the developing world”, reform of the United Nations and a closer alliance with the US.This was to involve creating with America a “different kind of networked global alliance based on free trade (not a customs union and single market harmonisation), mutual defence, and systems administrator units capable of peacekeeping and disaster relief”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7004c801df1690d6750a01f407cb4dc2484835f3/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8b9f879810dbbebec14136f7d6fa47b","title":"government loses child refugee vote in string of lords defeats","story":"Peers vote to restore right of unaccompanied child refugees to be reunited with families The government has suffered five defeats on its Brexit deal in the space of 24 hours in the House of Lords, with the heaviest defeat in a vote to restore the right of unaccompanied child refugees to be reunited with their families in the UK after Brexit.There was a vote of 300 in favour and 220 against, giving a majority of 80 in support of an amendment, proposed by the Labour peer Alf Dubs, requiring the UK government to maintain the principle of family reunion for child refugees fleeing conflict.“Either the government is mean and nasty or they are giving the impression of being mean and nasty they could quite easily change that impression by accepting this amendment,” Lord Dubs said. “We have shown very clearly that the Lords vote is based on humanitarian principles. It’s now the turn of the Commons to show what they’re made of.”The majority of children flee persecution and endure dangerous journeys across continents alone, often falling into the hands of traffickers or smugglers en route. In 2018, 3,063 unaccompanied child asylum seekers arrived in the UK, the third highest number in Europe.These are children who come here having applied for asylum elsewhere in the EEA, to join family or relatives. In 2018, 159 unaccompanied children arrived in the UK via this route. The Home Office has confirmed The UK will continue to be bound by the Dublin provisions during the Brexit implementation period.Enforced by section 67 of the Immigration Act 2016, these are unaccompanied children brought to the UK having applied for asylum elsewhere in Europe. The number agreed between the government and local authorities was 480. Other than the 220 brought when the Calais camp was cleared in Autumn 2016, the government has stated that they will not provide incremental figures but will announce when the 480 quota has been filled.This scheme was also announced during the passage of the 2016 act. These are not all unaccompanied children some will arrive with family members. The number of iniduals resettled via this route in 2018 was 688, but this also includes adults, as many children on this scheme are resettled with their families. The scheme was not designed to be a route primarily for unaccompanied children, but some children have been resettled without any family members and were placed in local authority care.In 2018, 1,072 children were granted refugee status with a further 73 granted humanitarian protection.The Home Office minister Lady Williams had urged peers not to force a vote on the issue, stating that the government was not dropping its commitments to family reunion for child refugees. She said more than 41,000 children had been granted protection in the UK since 2010 and over 5,000 unaccompanied children were being cared for in England alone.She and two other Home Office ministers had last week summoned Dubs to ask him to stop pushing for this amendment to the EU withdrawal agreement bill, but he declined. He had successfully led a campaign for family reunion rights to continue after Brexit in an earlier version of the withdrawal bill, but the protections were removed in the latest version, published after the December election.The ministers told Dubs that despite the decision to drop the measures from the bill, they would be included in the long-delayed immigration bill later this year.During the debate, Dubs, who came to the UK as a Kindertransport child refugee after fleeing Prague in 1939, said he failed to understand why the government had removed the protection from the bill.He asked the government not to “close the door” on the children affected, noting that some lived in shocking conditions in French camps, and were at risk of sexual exploitation.By providing them with a safe, legal route to the UK, peers would be “thwarting the traffickers” and avoiding the need for youngsters to take more dangerous options to get to their families, he said.The issue will be debated again in the House of Commons on Wednesday, where the government may use its large majority to overturn all the Lords defeats.Beth Gardiner-Smith, the chief executive of Safe Passage, an organisation working with unaccompanied child refugees in Europe, said: “It’s simply not good enough for the government to claim they still back family reunion, whilst taking away the legal protections that support it. All this does is create fear and panic amongst some of the most vulnerable children. The prime minister should now show compassion and agree to the Lords amendment.“Many of the children we support have lost their parents but they have grandparents, siblings, aunts and uncles living in the UK and ready to care for them. It is illogical that these children be denied safe passage to the UK, left with no other choice but to consider smuggling just to reach their loved ones, or to grow up alone without the care of their family – many surviving in camps and car parks across Europe.”The government was defeated in the Lords three times on Monday evening, on an amendment requiring EU citizens living in the UK to be given physical proof of their legal status, an amendment removing the power of ministers to decide which courts should have the power to depart from European court of justice judgments, and an amendment allowing cases to be referred to the supreme court to decide whether to depart from EU case law.On Tuesday afternoon, the government was again defeated on the Dubs amendment, a fifth time, as peers backed calls to reassure Scotland and Wales on devolution powers.The prime minister’s official spokesman said: “We are disappointed the Lords have chosen to amend the withdrawal agreement bill, which the Commons passed unamended with a majority of 99. Protecting vulnerable children will remain our priority after Brexit, and the withdrawal agreement bill reaffirms our commitment, while clarifying the role of parliament and government in negotiations. We will seek to overturn this amendment as the bill returns to the Commons.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d675423d5d1f73c0bac3bb0e13517dc623afae2/516_307_1464_878/master/1464.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fe70798d9a7fa4bd62c676d9c1c98f56","title":"happy fleet could electric vehicles enhance the joy of driving","story":"EVs mean cleaner cities, but could they improve the experience for drivers too? One ground-breaking partnership piloted by Audi and Addison Lee Group uncovered some surprising benefits to going electricFor companies that rely on fleet vehicles, change is inevitable. A raft of green policies have introduced zero-emissions targets, along with financial incentives encouraging businesses to adopt cleaner cars and vans, such as no vehicle tax for electric company cars in 202021.However, as well as helping the planet and improving a company’s bottom line, the “greening” of vehicle fleets by going fully electric could bring additional benefits. A recent widely reported study found that jumping behind the wheel of an electric car – rather than a traditional petrol or diesel – could also make drivers happier, calmer and less stressed too.Those findings are backed up by Audi’s own research, which found that electric vehicle drivers typically get more pleasure from the experience. According to a combination of 1,350 surveys and 2,000 minutes of interviews, the benefits include a reduction in vibration and engine noise, which can leave drivers feeling less drained after spending time in traffic. EV drivers also reported being able to perform difficult manoeuvres much more easily, and a greater sense of control. Others felt more at one with the vehicle as a result of all the technology. As one respondent put it: “It’s part of me when I drive. It has so much tech involved in it.”That Audi research is now being put to the test as part of a forward-thinking pilot partnership with the Addison Lee Group’s business class car service, Tristar.Addison Lee Group has added five new luxury e-tron SUVs, Audi’s first fully electric cars, with a range of up to 237 miles, to its premium London lineup. The aim is to offer chauffeurs, customers, and both businesses a unique opportunity to understand the real-world performance, opportunities and challenges of going fully electric to achieve a zero-emissions future.The Addison Lee Group chauffeurs underwent simple training with Audi’s electric vehicle specialists before going out to work as usual, driving premium customers around the capital.The ongoing trial enables Addison Lee Group and Audi to see how the cars perform in a real-world, business-critical situation – where running out of battery is not an option. That includes collecting hard data on mileage and usage from the car’s telemetrics, along with the driver’s subjective feedback on the challenges of adopting electric in real-world conditions, including things such as the availability of charging.The proof, though, is in the driving. So what did Addison Lee Group’s trialists make of the experience behind the wheel?“From the beginning I said that I was going to drive it the same way I would a diesel car and that’s what I’ve done,” says Alan Meere, a platinum chauffeur for Tristar. “I feel more relaxed when I get home because I haven’t spent the day fighting the steering wheel. There’s also no droning constantly in your ear like you can get with diesel cars, and you notice that especially after a motorway run. You still get the noise of the tyres but even that’s quieter.”According to Meere, who lives in Sittingbourne, Kent and has been driving for the Addison Lee Group for nine years, any potential anxiety about range soon subsided.“When I came into the pilot, my main reservations were things like whether there would be enough chargers,” he says. “Also, would living so far from London make a difference? But once you realise how good the car is, and you start to understand how to fit charging into your daily routine, that all goes away. Many service stations now have these chargers.”“Being able to plug it in and leave it overnight is hugely convenient,” says Meere. “But if I’m not home long enough for work reasons, then there are also options close by where I can charge it quickly, ready for the next day.”According to figures from Zap Map, a listing app that helps you find your nearest charge points, there are more than 10,000 charging locations in the UK. Finding nearby charge isn’t dissimilar to seeking out your closest petrol station – you learn the locations of the points you use most often.“I’ve developed a map in my head of where I can charge,” says Meere. “If I need a speedy charge, there are three places I use regularly – one at Heathrow and two near where I live. On the 150Kw points I can get close to full in 40 minutes,” he adds.This partnership has been so successful that it’s been extended beyond the initial six months. “I believe our collaboration with Addison Lee Group has been invaluable as a means of further demystifying the concept of the fully electric Audi,” says Andrew Doyle, director of Audi UK.“Although the e-tron is revolutionary as far as our brand is concerned, this project has helped to emphasise its uncomplicated, user-friendly normality to everyone who travels in one. On the one hand, it has proved that it requires minimal compromise as a daily-use proposition by meeting the understandably rigorous demands of Addison Lee Group’s professional drivers in an undeniably challenging working environment. On the other, it has driven home the fact that in terms of comfort, configuration and general usability, the car is a home-from-home for anyone familiar with a contemporary Audi.”Paul McCabe, corporate director at Addison Lee Group, says the pilot has helped to inform the group’s decisions about the fleet choices it will make as it works towards its target of having a fleet capable of zero emissions by 2022. “By generating data-driven insights, the e-tron pilot has allowed us to evaluate the real-world performance and requirements of electric vehicles in our fleet of the future,” he says.Although big change is coming, much will stay the same, and that’s a comfort for those who will experience the revolution first hand.“It’s still a car and you still just drive it the same way,” says Meere, “but it’s just more pleasant to drive. If I had the choice, I’d stay with the electric vehicle now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b554c589762cbd4d108fea72ed3bcf8cedbe873c/646_413_1251_751/master/1251.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a32d4d67e74e507fc122efad1cc75337","title":"five ways to resist the seductive allure of pointless technology","story":"When faced with shiny new tech, many companies and startups feel the urge to jump on the bandwagon, but innovating for the sake of it is rarely a good idea. Here’s how to avoid the pitfalls …Whisper it quietly, but often it’s much simpler to push an old-fashioned light switch than to shout three or four times at a hard-of-hearing voice-activated smart assistant. And, let’s face it, do workplace managers really want to install motion scanners under the desks of their employees to see who takes the longest toilet breaks?Sure, it’s obviously important for businesses to stay on top of tech advances, but there’s a thin line between innovating with purpose and innovating just for the sake of it.Ryan Abbott, professor of law and health sciences at the University of Surrey, specialises in the impact of AI, machine learning and technological advances, but even he believes that common sense sometimes makes more sense than deep learning: “It’s not clear there’s value to technology for technology’s sake and people may adopt it for the wrong reasons – maybe because there’s hype associated with it, rather than considering whether it’s really efficient to use things like artificial intelligence for different tasks.”He’s also less than convinced about all of his smart watch features: “I’m not sure I need my watch to tell me to breathe every five seconds either. I’m not sure it does much more than raise my blood pressure.”Bear in mind that there’s a litany of wonder-technology fads that led nowhere. Do you see many people wearing their computer screen in their glasses? Or using their telephones to monitor whether their toothbrush is scrubbing those hard-to-reach parts?A few years ago, the travel industry got very excited when Icelandair became the first ever airline to allow people to book flights through Facebook Messenger via a booking bot. It has quietly been retired.It’s also tempting to get caught up in the hype around the “smart city”, with its lamp-posts that listen for sounds of trouble. Even Laurence Kemball-Cook, founder and chief executive of Pavegen – which installs paving slabs that turn kinetic energy from people’s footsteps into electricity – thinks that a lot of city development is frivolous, not functional. “Everybody is talking about smart cities, but they are talking about smart for smart’s sake – Bluetooth umbrellas that tell you when it’s raining, multiple connected devices, smart watch, smartphone, smart shoes,” he says. “I’m fed up with that. Our mantra is technology that works for people.”In a world in which shiny innovations have become seductive siren calls, how can businesses resist the allure of pointless tech fads?TeamworkAbbott recommends involving the whole business in creating a new product from the start. “Make sure products are being developed by multidisciplinary teams – not just tech people who may be interested in doing something for the sake of technology but without an ultimate view of what would benefit the consumer,” he says.Explore low-tech alternativesAnother good tip is to consider whether a low-tech solution might exist to your problem before investing in the latest one. You could equip your reception with all kinds of gadgets, scanners, buzzers and heart-rate checks – or perhaps you could make a beautiful garden so everyone walks into work feeling a little more relaxed.Due diligenceOther experts suggest looking at the people behind the company of the tech you are considering: do they live their own principles or are they living the high life? “Do the founders have a purpose other than making money?” Kemball-Cook always asks. “Look at their values: I try to live as sustainably as possible. If your primary goal is making impact, all the good things will follow.”The sustainability testKeep an eye on the environmental impact of what you are doing. Prof Nikki Dibben, a University of Sheffield academic who worked on Bjork’s high-tech project Biophilia, an album that works with all kinds of tech and applications to teach elements of music and science to children, adds: “The value of technology has to be seen within a sustainability agenda. If we’re simply doing things for the sake of doing things, we are going to end up ultimately wasting resources.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/561914f0a37f1f62165beb4b2384b5cd0cde9c36/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=58759f8b51fe9bd22ea9d189d8325362","title":"coronavirus screenings global travelling airport","story":"More countries are carrying out health checks after the virus was detected outside ChinaCountries in Asia and elsewhere are checking the body temperatures of arriving airline passengers and adopting precautionary quarantine procedures in response to a new coronavirus that has sickened nearly 300 people in China.China was blamed for making the 2003 Sars outbreak far worse by initially hiding information and blocking the work of the World Health Organization. This time, leader Xi Jinping has called for tough measures and said “party committees, governments and relevant departments at all levels should put people’s lives and health first.” At the airport in Wuhan, the temperatures of departing passengers were checked and outbound tour groups were banned from leaving the city. Virtually everyone in a public role, from traffic police officers to bank tellers, is wearing a protective face mask.One case of new virus has been detected in Japan. The prime minister, Shinzo Abe, has urged officials to step up quarantine checks at airports and other entry points and visitors arriving from Wuhan, China will be required to fill in health forms. Authorities have tracked down and are monitoring 41 people who had contact with one confirmed case. None of them have developed a fever, tight chest or other initial symptoms of the new virus.Along with stepped-up surveillance, additional cleaning and disinfection measures have been ordered for planes and trains from Wuhan as well as for train stations and the airport. Authorities are ready for a worst-case scenario and are on extremely high alert.As in much of mainland China, Hong Kong residents favour traditional markets where live poultry and other animals are sold. The government health department has advised people against visiting such markets or touching animals or their droppings.Screening for the coronavirus has started at three airports for flights from Wuhan: New York’s John F Kennedy and San Francisco and Los Angeles international airports. The Center for Disease Control has developed a test to detect the new coronavirus and plans to share the tool with domestic and international partners.It a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals, or possibly seafood. New and troubling viruses usually originate in animal hosts. Ebola and flu are examples.The virus causes pneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. Antiviral drugs may be used, but usually only lessen the severity of symptoms.\u0026nbspChina’s health ministry has confirmed human-to-human transmission. As of 21 January the Chinese authorities had acknowledged 217 cases, double the number previously reported, and four deaths. Those who have died are known to have been already in poor health - but mild cases may not be reported at all.There are fears that the coronavirus may spread more widely and person to person during the Chinese new year holidays at the end of this month, when millions of people travel home to celebrate. At the moment, it appears that people in poor health are at greatest risk, as is always the case with flu. But the authorities will be keen to stop the spread and anxious that the virus will become more potent than so far appears.At Incheon airport near Seoul, the only airport in South Korea with direct flights from Wuhan, authorities have been operating two special gates for passengers from the city since 3 January where officials use ear thermometers to check passengers’ temperatures. Handrails of moving walkways and escalators, elevator buttons and doors, drinking fountains and other sensitive areas are also wiped with disinfectant twice a day.Nigeria, China’s top trading partner in Africa, has asked that travellers from Wuhan report to a medical facility if they feel ill and health authorities at points of entry are on alert for cases of coronavirus. India announced on Tuesday that it will expand thermal screening of passengers arriving from China, including Hong Kong, to seven airports from the current three. In-flight announcements before arrival will direct passengers with a fever or cough who have traveled to Wuhan in the previous 14 days to declare themselves to health authorities. Thermal screening will begin in Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Cochin, and continue in Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata.Singapore will expand temperature screening at Changi airport, one of Asia’s busiest travel hubs, for all travellers on flights arriving from China beginning on Wednesday. The health ministry said iniduals with pneumonia and a history of travel to Wuhan within 14 days of the onset of symptoms will be isolated in a hospital as a precautionary measure and investigated. Malaysia has also beefed up screening at Kuala Lumpur international airport. Civil aviation authorities have ordered airport managers to start screening incoming passengers from China, looking for fevers, coughs, breathing difficulties and sore throats. Biosecurity staff and state health officials in New South Wales are meeting flights from Wuhan and are distributing pamphlets printed in English and Chinese to all passengers. The pamphlets describe symptoms of infection and ask people to identify themselves if they are experiencing any.The Russian public health service has said it has developed a testing kit that would allow labs to detect the new coronavirus quickly. Russia is one of the three most popular tourist destinations for people from China, according to Russian officials. Passengers making direct and indirect flights from Wuhan, China to Rome’s Leonardo da Vinci airport will be checked for potential signs of the virus and people with suspected infections will be quarantined at an infectious disease hospital in Rome. Posters at the airport advise travellers to consider delaying trips to the Wuhan area and if they do go there to avoid touching animals or uncooked animal products."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4b8ddbea84a0fc7866ca0216c19ee80b2cc6622/0_138_2120_1273/master/2120.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e49cbc28cf6cc78ea7bae89cc9dcb358","title":"social workers tell us how you feel about your job","story":"Take part in our survey to have your say about the profession and the wider sectorWhat’s it like to be a social worker in the UK right now?We have launched the latest edition of the  Jobs Social Lives survey into the issues affecting staff at all stages of their careers – from the frontline to management.The research, carried out by Ipsos Mori on behalf of the  and new regulator Social Work England, is an opportunity to have your say about issues including workloads, pay and how the profession is viewed.Our last Social Lives study, published in 2017, found more than four-fifths of participants were proud of what they do, and more than three-quarters said they enjoyed their jobs, but most thought their caseloads were too high.Help us to find out whether the picture has changed.

Five years later, when Fane really did die, they only gave him 230, and a good chunk were by way of explanation: “Owing to a similarity of initials, Wisden reported his death when he was 79. The man concerned was Francis L. Fane, his cousin.” Some people, like Fane, get to read their obituaries, and some people don’t need to because they already know what they’re going to say anyway. RG “Bapu” Nadkarni, who died in Mumbai last week, aged 86, was one of the second lot.Nadkarni was, as almost every one of his obituarists noted, a parsimonious left-handed spinner. He played 41 matches for India through the 1950s and ’60s, and 191 first-class games for Bombay and Maharashtra. He scored an unbeaten century to save a Test against England, took 11 wickets in a match against Australia, worked as the national team’s assistant manager, and was a mentor to Sunil Gavaskar. But each of these achievements was eclipsed by another, his world-record spell of 21.5 consecutive maiden overs – 131 balls without conceding so much as a single run. It was Nadkarni’s 99.94, his 501, his 19 for 90. Sachin Tendulkar said last week that he grew up hearing about the feat.It was in Chennai in 1964, the first Test against England. It was, Nadkarni said, a peculiar match, a fight in which neither side wanted to throw a punch. India batted first and declared on 457 for seven. By the start of the third morning, England were 63 for two and, worse, four of the team were suffering from food poisoning. Micky Stewart and Jim Parks had it so bad they were laid up in bed with fever. They kept a car waiting outside in case they needed to be rushed to the ground to bat. England had to stall for time till they were better, so their two doughty batsmen, Brian Bolus and Ken Barrington, decided to start blocking. And blocking. And blocking.And Nadkarni just kept bowling. And bowling. And bowling.Nadkarni had learned his cricket in Bombay, a hard school. “Bombay cricket at that time was so disciplined,” he said later. “The basic principle was to be accurate to the point of perfection.” He’d drop a coin on a length outside off-stump, sketch a chalk circle around it, and spend hours bowling at the spot. “His favourite term from where we all learned from was ‘chhodo mat’,” Gavaskar said last week. It means hang in there. “Chhodo mat. You are playing for India. That thing we learned from him.”The Chennai Test became a blinking contest. After lunch there were 12 maiden overs in a row. “Neither batsman attempted to score any but the most obvious runs,” wrote Henry Blofeld in the . “A number of half volleys were pushed back defensively.” Nadkarni gave up a single soon after he’d come on, and after that, it was maiden, maiden, maiden, maiden, maiden, maiden, maiden, maiden, maiden, maiden, maiden, maiden, maiden, maiden, maiden, maiden, maiden, maiden, maiden, maiden, maiden, as monotonous as the tick tock of the classroom clock.Finally, just after three in the afternoon, Nadkarni was five balls through what would have been his 22nd maiden when the man at mid-on misfielded and the batsmen stole a single. And, just like that, Nadkarni’s captain took him out of the attack, “as if”, the Times noted, he was all of a sudden judged “altogether too expensive” to carry on. Nadkarni was still annoyed about it 50 years later. He had bowled 131 consecutive dot balls. It is one of those records that will likely stand as long as they’re playing the game. South Africa’s Hugh Tayfield once bowled 137 in a row but they were spread across two innings.The Chennai Test was a draw. So were nine of the 10 other games they played on that tour, including all the other four Tests. It was one of the most stultifying boring series ever played and yet it pulled in a total of over a million spectators. “Day after day,” Wisden reported, “the Test grounds, who capacity varied between 30,000 and 45,000, were packed. Financially the tour was a rousing success, though the nature of the play inflicted sore wounds on the game of cricket.” Back in England, they were already trying county one-day cricket as a tonic, soon enough they’d start playing it internationally too. Fifty years later, they’re still coming up with new cures.Because there is no getting around it, Nadkarni’s duel with Barrington and Bolus must have been one of the most singularly dull passages of sport anyone was ever asked to pay for the privilege of watching, a psychological Sahara of a day out at the cricket. A strange entertainment, this, and not one they’re interested in showing on free-to-air TV in the 21st century. But Nadkarni is still remembered for it, celebrated for it, all these years later, because as everyone who loves Test cricket knows, the boredom’s part of the pleasure, what would the good bits be worth without all those lovely lulls when the game drifts like dust in a sunbeam? There are days of play we euphemistically describe “for the purists”, some vanishing band of diehards, a dwindling audience of Bapu Nadkarni fans."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f54605b26753998f3a2987bed54f2eeeefe1a08/0_232_4315_2589/master/4315.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=afd917d9d58c9218722c3bad6f61382d","title":"premiership rugby saracens come clean salary cap report","story":"Premiership Rugby has rejected any suggestion that other leading clubs may be breaching the salary cap following Saracens’ relegation to the Championship. The chief executive, Darren Childs, has acknowledged, however, that the champions’ repeated financial misconduct has tarnished the league and unfairly impacted on their rivals.In his first interview since the news of Saracens’ demotion was confirmed last weekend, Childs described the club’s serial cheating of the regulations as “a dark cloud” hanging over the Premiership.He said he would prefer to see Lord Dyson’s initial report into the Saracens affair made public and is adamant the rest of the Premiership is complying with the cap.“I’ve asked our salary-cap manager that question a dozen times now and there is no current investigation or anything else he is looking at,” said Childs, who joined Premiership Rugby last year from UKTV. “All the other clubs are compliant and feel really let down by all this.“I get the fact they feel let down. The salary cap is the right thing to have and they have all signed up to it. I’ve sat in a box and watched a club lose to a side where there’s a question mark as to whether they are compliant or not.“The emotion is palpable. Everyone wants a level playing field. It’s not about rigging the system in your favour and winning at any cost.”To help restore trust, Childs indicated he would like to see the report into Saracens’ cap-busting behaviour released in full, rather than withheld at the request of Saracens’ lawyers, and would like the club to reconsider its stance.“Premiership Rugby has got absolutely nothing to hide in that judgment. In fact, quite the opposite. It demonstrates we’ve got a good, well-enforced, fair salary-cap system. I must admit I am very minded to take that decision on again and look at whether we should be publishing these things. I would welcome the opportunity to set the record straight.“It is very important to stress that we have specifically not been given that permission. We cannot publish Lord Dyson’s full decision regardless of what anyone would like us to do. Saracens are not supportive of that document being published.“It was very much their lawyers’ decision that it should remain confidential. Why wouldn’t they want it published? That’s a question for them. But if they’re prepared to change their mind I would be prepared to discuss it with my board with a view to publishing it.”Childs also remains frustrated by the widespread belief that Premiership Rugby should have clamped down more swiftly on Saracens’ wrongdoing, defended as mere “naivety” by their former chairman Nigel Wray.“It’s been complex and important to get right,” Childs said. “After a number of conversations with Saracens over the last four to six weeks it became inevitable relegation was the right measure to take.“It couldn’t wait until the end of the season. We needed to crack on. A lot of people are pointing the finger at us, which is a bit tough to take, but we’re trying to keep people on a level playing field. I don’t think the existing regulations are at fault. The regs have not cheated.”Those running the league are also sensitive to the reputational damage to the sport and Childs has confirmed that, had they not accepted relegation, Saracens would have been required to open their books to show exactly how they remunerated a squad who have won three of the past four European titles and five domestic titles in the past decade.“It would have been inevitable that we would have started a forensic audit imminently had we not reached this agreement,” Childs said.“I want a dynamic, competitive tournament that people up and down the country can enjoy knowing their side has got a chance of winning. I’m not going to turn a blind eye to this stuff. I will enforce the rules and regulations to the absolute letter of the law. I’m trying to make sure this never happens again.“It has been a massive distraction for us but I hope one day we get some acknowledgement that we dealt with it in a robust way.“It would also be nice to talk about what is happening on the pitch rather than in the boardroom.”Any changes to the salary-cap regulations, such as making players’ salaries public, are to be considered in a detailed review by Lord Myners, with an initial consultation period to commence this week.“I realised there were a number of things that should be looked at and I also want a more open approach in the future,” said Childs, insisting the new commercial shareholders CVC were fully supportive of Saracens’ demotion.In the meantime he hopes the spectacle will not be diminished by the fact the relegation picture has already been settled.“We’ve got assurances from Saracens that they will maintain the integrity of the tournament until the end of the season before they go down into the Championship.“I think they are going to want to go out and put their best foot forward – there are some fascinating games still to come. The fan is crucial to this industry and that’s the bit that makes me sad. That is not something we take lightly.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c739b8224c94a63b10b5fb59441c64a3f8cb923/0_160_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bdc6f38f57f9e120ce4cffb224b56958","title":"the gift review black britons queen victoria janice okoh","story":"Belgrade theatre, CoventryThe story of Sarah Bonetta Davies, given to Queen Victoria, is contrasted with a modern black British woman in Janice Okoh’s playThe historian David Olusoga has spoken of black Britons across the centuries whose stories have been forgotten, untold or “hidden in plain view”. Sarah Bonetta Davies is one of them. A 19th-century Yoruba princess, she was orphaned and enslaved before becoming the goddaughter of Queen Victoria and living in Brighton.This co-production by Eclipse Theatre and the Belgrade is part of an initiative to deliver new black British stories. One of the achievements of Janice Okoh’s clever and complex script is that it is not a straightforward retelling of Davies’s life. The Gift offers a formally original and intellectual engagement with forgotten history, cross-racial adoption and the impact of imperialism on black British lives today.The play travels from the Victorian era – featuring Queen Victoria herself – to the present and back again, with time frames colliding at times. Actors double up as characters in both worlds to expose how little has changed in attitudes around black Britishness between now and then. Davies (Shannon Hayes) is realised as an urbane woman contending with house guests who speak of African “natives” and open bigotry from neighbours.In the present, Sarah (Donna Berlin), is an accomplished, middle-class woman from Chelsea who has moved to Cheshire with her university professor husband. She is met by the same barely veiled racism from neighbours. Both women encapsulate the enduring paradox within their British identities: they look, sound and feel British but are not accepted as such by the white world around them.There are huge strengths to Dawn Walton’s production, from the striking symbolism of Simon Kenny’s stage design – Davies and her maid wear black Victorian dresses set against a pure white room – to the drawing-room satire. These scenes are full of sharp, stinging dialogue but they come to feel prolonged and too static, with the arguments around race not entirely digested into the drama.The Gift is filled to the brim with great writing and good performances. But there are so many ideas that it feels too much for a single play."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b505edf55899591343d02ef2b8308a2b5b7ac5f/57_0_4457_2676/master/4457.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9722c8696d127de776029b70e3d878e7","title":"bank of england to consider adopting cryptocurrency","story":"BoE one of central banks weighing potential benefits amid decline of cash and emergence of Facebook’s libra The Bank of England will examine how Britain could adopt a bitcoin-style digital currency as part of a global group of central banks that have joined together to examine the possible pitfalls of relying on electronic money.Bank officials will meet with the Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank (ECB), the Sveriges Riksbank, the Bank of Canada, the Swiss National Bank and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) to pool research and experiences of the potential for a central bank digital currency (CBDC).The BoE deputy governor Sir Jon Cunliffe will co-chair the group with Benoît Cœuré, a former ECB board member and head of the BIS innovation hub.The move comes amid the emergence of private sector digital currencies, such as bitcoin and Facebook’s libra, which is due to be launched this year.Facebook’s plans for its libra coin and a digital wallet have caught the attention of regulators and central banks worldwide, with Threadneedle Street being among those vowing tough new rules.The BoE was among several central banks to warn that libra would need to be regulated, leading many  supporters to end their relationship with the digital currency.The idea of a central bank digital currency has been increasingly mooted worldwide to help improve payment systems and cross-border transactions.The Bank said the new working group would look at “CBDC use cases economic, functional and technical design choices, including cross-border interoperability and the sharing of knowledge on emerging technologies”.It will also work closely with other global forums and groups, such as the Financial Stability Board and the committee on payments and market infrastructures (CPMI), which is also chaired by Cunliffe.Just last month, Sweden’s central bank said it would sign a deal with the consultancy firm Accenture to create a pilot platform for a digital currency, known as the e-krona.The Riksbank has been exploring the idea of its own digital currency for some time, especially given the rapid decline in the use of cash in Sweden.The European Central Bank has also been investigating the possible benefits of CBDC since last year.Fran Boait, executive director of Positive Money, said policymakers had been slow to realise how much enthusiasm there was for digital money.“They have been asleep at the wheel over the future of our money system being determined by a small number of banks, payment companies and now tech giants.“The rapid decline of cash and threat of private digital currencies like Facebook’s libra have served as a much-needed wake-up call, but central bankers have a lot of catching up to do.“Central banks need to accelerate plans for a central bank digital currency, which would both ensure that people have the choice of a safe public banking option and prevent our monetary system being completely surrendered to unaccountable private interests.

It’s contrary to our values.”The US alleges Meng lied to the bank HSBC about Huawei’s relationship with its Iran-based affiliate Skycom, putting the bank at risk of violating US sanctions against Tehran.On Monday, defense attorneys argued that the US was abusing its treaty with Canada by asking it to detain Meng for prosecution as part of a campaign that Ren, Huawei’s chief executive, surmised aimed to crush China’s largest international company.They argued that Meng’s misrepresentations, if they occurred, did not amount to fraud, and that Canada had repudiated the US sanctions against Iran.“Would we be here in the absence of US sanctions? Our response is no,” Richard Peck, the lead defense lawyer, told a packed courtroom.The hearing is scheduled to last until Friday.Meng’s arrest during a stopover of a Hong Kong-to-Mexico flight in December 2018 placed her at the center of a US-China trade row, with Donald Trump once musing that he would gladly trade her release for Chinese trade concessions.It also put Canada in the middle of the feud between the US and China, with which Justin Trudeau had hoped to nurture closer economic ties.Nine days after Meng was taken into custody at the Vancouver airport, China arrested two Canadians – the former diplomat Michael Kovrig and the businessman Michael Spavor.Their detentions on espionage suspicions, along with Chinese restrictions on Canadian agricultural imports, have been widely interpreted as retribution by Beijing aimed at pressuring Canada to free Meng.Former Canadian political leaders have urged the prime minister to concede and release Meng in a “prisoner swap” for Kovrig and Spavor.But extradition experts consulted by AFP said that that would encourage “hostage diplomacy”.China’s foreign ministry on Monday characterized Meng’s extradition case as a “grave political incident”, while renewing calls for Ottawa to release her to normalize relations.Canada’s deputy prime minister, Chrystia Freeland, responded that Ottawa “honors its extradition treaty commitments” and would not interfere in the case while it was before the courts.In a statement, Huawei said that it trusted Canada’s judicial system and believed Meng would be found innocent."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e87d813465d69c4c9121a749f9b465123941b5f3/352_283_6902_4140/master/6902.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=106ac6b3e03f41de3a9968cb37ee4550","title":"danny mcbride kanye asked me to play him in a movie of his life","story":"He was plucked from obscurity by Will Ferrell and soon found himself sharing scenes with Tom Cruise and hotels with Steve Coogan. Now, TV’s funniest egotist is back – and taking on televangelists Danny McBride has been a lot of arrogant men over the years. He’s napalmed jungles for fun. He’s pronounced himself the world’s greatest baseball player – despite a paunch like a department-store Santa. He has made deluded braggadocio into an artform and recently, he achieved its holiest of holy grails.“Kanye asked me to play him in a movie of his life,” he laughs. “That was a pretty stunning phone call to get. I don’t know why he wanted me to do it. Maybe that sense of ego I’m able to portray? I have no clue.”This, however, is not the project he is here to promote, though it is just as riotous as you imagine a Kanye biopic would be. McBride is in the UK for the launch of his third HBO sitcom, The Righteous Gemstones, a spoof about a money-grubbing church family in the US South. As he lolls affably on a sofa at a Soho hotel, it’s hard to reconcile the humble McBride with characters like West, or the conceited televangelist Jesse Gemstone.He emphasises the luck behind his big break, which thrust him almost instantaneously from dead end jobs into critically acclaimed comedies and Hollywood roles alongside Tom Cruise, Ben Stiller and Robert Downey Jr. And it’s all down to the fact that one day in high school, he decided to go to the toilet in the middle of a class.“Ah, I think about that piss often,” says McBride. “I passed this kid in the hall by chance who was dropping his resume off for the North Carolina School of the Arts. I was like: ‘What’s that? I’ve never heard of that!’ and he was like: ‘Oh, it’s this new film school.’ I applied and got in and he sadly didn’t. I stole his life.”There, he met long-term collaborators Jody Hill and David Gordon Green. Inspired by a love of English comedy (think Ricky Gervais and Steve Coogan), Hill and McBride decided to write a character “that had an underlying sadness – something pathetic about them which makes you unsure whether you’re meant to hate or like them”. Fist Foot Way, a low-budget film starring McBride as an egotistical taekwondo teacher, saw Will Ferrell sign the pair to his production company. It also earned them an invite to the set of Judd Apatow’s Knocked Up, where McBride found the likes of Seth Rogen quoting lines back to him. “It was nuts. I’d never even been on a real movie set before,” he recalls. “Jody and I went back to his apartment and were like: ‘Is this happening? Is this real?’”Within a year, McBride was playing a dopey drug dealer in Pineapple Express and an explosives expert in action movie parody Tropic Thunder. The latter found him sharing a hotel with Steve Coogan, though he’s not sure if their mutual love of anti-heroes came up in conversation (“We definitely had a few nights which were pretty awesome. Did we talk about comedy? I can’t remember. It was mainly drinking.”)But it was with his first HBO show, the Ferrell-produced Eastbound and Down, that he really began to make ripples. McBride’s determination to “dare people to have a bit more empathy with someone you don’t like on the surface” certainly challenged his colleagues, as he put his all into the role of Kenny Powers: a cocaine-snorting, morally repugnant failed baseball star turned high school sports teacher.“When the episodes started coming in, HBO were like ‘What is this? Who is this guy? He’s such an asshole!’” Only Ferrell’s involvement stopped the show from being canned, and the network refused to market it unless the character was toned down. “But we were young, and went: ‘Fuck it. I’ve never seen a commercial for something on HBO before. People just tune in.’ So we stuck to our guns and kept it the way we wanted.”In the end, they didn’t need the ads. The show took off to the extent that McBride was offered a job as a pitcher on a genuine Floridian baseball team (“I said no: I can barely throw a baseball”) and became so inseparable from his character that it made socialising impossible. “I couldn’t go to bars any more. It was like a nightmare,” he sighs. “I was doing Kenny Powers to make fun of him and people just thought that was how I was.”Ten years on, this is less of a problem, particularly given attempts to shun type-casting with more serious work such as a role in Ridley Scott’s Alien: Covenant and writing the 2018 remake of John Carpenter’s Halloween. But, like Eastbound and Down and 2016 high school drama Vice Principals, there are plenty of things that will cause a stir in The Righteous Gemstones. For one, there are more flaccid penises than in a football changing room (“we just felt like showing cock was very Old Testament – a lot of ancient works had penis in them,” he laughs). Besides, the show is rife with demeaning barbs at its female characters. “Reading the Bible, there are a lot of misogynistic points of view in there. I wanted to explore that with this family,” he explains.The show is also a fascinating insight into the US phenomenon of megachurches. A form of corporate Christianity, it sees old shopping malls turned into giant places of worship, with owners whose business goals demand a congregation that grows year-on-year – or they fire the pastor. “Some of the things are beyond even the jokes we were doing,” laughs McBride. “When we were making it, a video went viral of these two pastors taking about how god wanted them to have private jets because he didn’t want them riding in those tubes with all the demons.”HBO has already renewed the show for a second season. Which is good news, given that it’s a hilarious watch. But bad news, given that it stands in the way of that Kanye film. Might it happen? After all, Ye’s obviously keen – he made the effort to fly all the way down to visit McBride, even agreeing to watch his seven-year-old son play online shooter Fortnite. “That was a pretty incredible day. Maybe someday we’ll make the film. Who knows?” Indeed, for the moment, it’s Jesus, not Yeezus he’s got on the brain. The Righteous Gemstones is on Sky Comedy and NOW TV from 5 February at 9pm"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/374b5090d904dbb80d427816f5e62be8e54eb4d6/372_0_2710_1627/master/2710.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bf94108d2a24e280922b3717f5029f92","title":"disney streaming service to launch earlier in uk on 24 march","story":"Netflix rival’s move also comes at ‘dangerous moment’ for BBC, soon to lose its director generalA new TV streaming service, Disney+, is to launch in the UK earlier than scheduled in a move that underlines the increasing competition facing the BBC.Disney had planned to launch the service on 31 March, but has now brought it forward a week to 24 March.It has confirmed the service will match the cost of Netflix by charging subscribers a monthly fee of £5.99. Disney will also offer a yearly rate for the service of £59.99.Disney’s announcement comes a day after the BBC’s director general, Tony Hall, said he was stepping down earlier than planned. It prompted warnings that the corporation faces a “dangerous moment” due to the hostility to public broadcasting among many in the Conservative government and the changing viewing habits of licence payers as they switch to streaming services.The new platform focuses on spin-off shows, films and other series from studios including Disney, Pixar and Marvel. Disney has pledged to make any new film releases exclusive to its platform, and has already begun the process of pulling its content from competitors such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and Apple TV+.Unlike Netflix it will release new episodes of selected shows weekly to avoid binge viewing.The new Disney+ service, which has been available in the US and Canada since November, will also go live in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Austria and Switzerland on 24 March.All of the original and prequel Star Wars films – as well as The Force Awakens – will be on the service at the launch. The recent Captain Marvel movie will also be included.When it was launched in the US in November, the service gained more than 10 million subscribers on its first day. But the figures were boosted by a deal that allowed some customers a year’s subscription for free as part of phone and broadband packages. Disney is hoping to repeat the success of Netflix, which has has gathered about 158 million subscribers since launching its streaming platform in 2007.This Star Wars spin-off is billed as a spaghetti western in space and has been dismissed as “dusty disappointment” by the . But the story of a helmeted gunfighter played by Pedro Pascal has been the service’s biggest hit so far. The eight-part first season features the viral hit character the Child, colloquially known as Baby Yoda, who looks like a young version of the beloved Star Wars figure.Another spin-off that tries to exploit the success of the franchise among children and teenagers. The show returns to East High as a mockumentary series about how a group of teenagers stage High School Musical: The Musical as their school play. It stars Olivia Rodrigo as Nini Salazar-Roberts, who is cast as Gabriella Montez in the school show, while Joshua Bassett plays Ricky Bowen, who is cast as Troy Bolton.Following remakes of The Lion King and The Jungle Book, this retells the 1955 Disney classic using photorealistic animation. Lady, a posh cocker iel, is voiced by Tessa Thompson, while Justin Theroux voices the inner-city mutt, Tramp.This will not be available until next year, but its star Tom Hiddleston describes it as “one of the most exciting creative opportunities I think I’ve ever come across”. It will be a six-part series devoted to Hiddleston’s villainous character from Marvel’s Avengers series.The Hollywood star promises to reveal all about ice-cream, tattoos, jewellery and trainers in a Louis Theroux-style documentary.

As he returns, he talks self care, sexism – and much more Heston Blumenthal doesn’t stop talking. At speed. His thoughts veer off in a thousand directions, seemingly simultaneously. “Question everything” is the motto the chef plumped for on the coat of arms he was granted a few years back, and he does just that: our conversation takes in Newton, Darwin, Homer, Harry Potter, the Bible, the Qu’ran, the invention of the telephone, the invention of social media, breathing, Jaws and saws.The violence of the last two make me blink. Having spoken out in 2015 about TV becoming “too formulaic” and subsequently disappearing from our screens, Blumenthal likens the need to take a step back to the scene in Jaws where Roy Scheider is on the beach and hears a scream in the water, as the camera simultaneously zooms out and moves in. He segues swiftly into another metaphor, of a carpenter sawing away with an ever-blunter implement. “He should stop and have a rest,” he says, “resharpen his saw and start again. But when you’re in the middle of it, you think ‘I can’t stop, I don’t have time.’” Is this a sign of the culinary wizard coming back an even more intense character? Or perhaps he’s just bringing the drama he’s famous for in the kitchen to our conversation. “I have some funny metaphors I still need to work on,” he concedes.In any case, Blumenthal is very much back. This week, the man famous for serving up giant lit candles, ‘dismembered corpses’ and edible icebergs as food returns to television as one of the “kitchen gods” on Channel 4’s super-kitsch new cooking show, Crazy Delicious. Styled like a cross between Willy Wonka’s garden and the My Little Pony universe, Crazy Delicious is all puffy clouds and cherry blossom, babbling brooks and blue skies. Crucially, it is TV’s first entirely edible set – just the thing to bring Blumenthal out of his hiatus.In each episode, three intrepid home cooks are let loose in the fairytale garden to go forth and forage. With their haul, they compete in three tasks, presenting their spectacular, offbeat creations to Blumenthal and his cronies – American soul-food big-hitter Carla Hall and Michelin-starred Swedish fire-pit master Niklas Ekstedt – to compete for the golden apple.“It taps right into my heart, my blood, my culinary DNA,” says Blumenthal. The challenge he has always embraced, he says, is to make things that taste as good as they look, while being at odds with exactly what they look like. Doing it all in chocolate would be too easy. Instead, unleashing wild creativity – travelling to the outer rim of Bake Off, so to speak – is what he’s all about.Creativity is one thing, but the past decade has also brought Blumenthal a lot of pain. A norovirus outbreak got his signature restaurant The Fat Duck shut down not once but twice, in 2009 and again in 2014. Blumenthal and Zanna, his wife of 28 years, split up in 2011, then orced six years later. And the tabloids had him in their gossip-spewing sights in the interim. The Daily Mail couldn’t stop quoting his next girlfriend, US food writer Suzanne Pirret, saying food and sex were her favourite two things, “best one after the other in either order I’m not picky.” And the secrets that followed – the affair, the baby and subsequent nuptials with French real estate agent and lover 20 years his junior Stephanie Gouveia – sent the red tops into a tail spin.“You know,” he says, “I wouldn’t want to go through those things again. But I wouldn’t want to change them either. I wouldn’t have anything to learn from if it wasn’t for failure.” All those experiences have given him the opportunity, he says, to question a lot about himself. The last time he was interviewed by the , he was asked if he’d been in therapy. “Of course I have,” he replied. Now, he tells me he’s been thinking a lot about the importance of breathing: “It’s the most intimate relationship a human being can have, that with themselves and their breath.”Meanwhile, last week, he’s taken flak for suggesting diners should stop Instagramming their meals and just eat them instead. “Oh keep up” has been the general response to that bit of boomerism, which makes the undeniable tongue-in-cheek quality of Crazy Delicious most welcome. When I said Blumenthal, Ekstedt and Hall were gods on this show, I meant it: they’re dressed in head-to-toe white and sit at a table up in the set’s clouds. It is ludicrous. But when you think of the pedestal on which celebrity chefs are placed – their books as Bibles, their followers as disciples (incidentally, in 2014 Blumenthal invested in a racehorse named Acolyte) – it is refreshing to see the three of them so game.Was irony part of the appeal? “No, I was very scared of that,” says Blumenthal. “When we first walked up the stairs with our white trousers and shoes on, Niklas and I looked at each other and went, ‘gods??’” White being the worst colour for food-tasting notwithstanding, they thought to hell with it, and tucked right in. And that is not a metaphor Blumenthal has actually been walking around eating the set.He wants the loopy ideas and bold dreams of Crazy Delicious to inspire everyone. “Imagine a candy floss cloud above the roof of your house attached with liquorice string, blowing in the wind,” he says – and I try to. Well, he continues, people imagining things like that collectively is how we talk on the phone, or interact on social media. After all, as he puts it, “we’re all born artists.” And if there’s anyone who can demonstrate how to stay that way, surely it’s the guy who brings fairytales to the table. Now, anyone for strawberry chicken wings?Crazy Delicious starts tonight at 8pm on Channel 4"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84143fc5127d9ab87103a47185f10d59df21c6b4/0_200_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6ee4a73fb20d5d8878215c6e504e4b8d","title":"florida frozen iguanas weather report","story":"National Weather Service warned of reptiles falling from trees as iguanas are susceptible to freezing once temperatures fall to 40FThe National Weather Service (NWS) took the unusual step on Tuesday of warning that frozen iguanas are expected to shower south Florida as temperatures drop to unusually low levels for the region overnight.Iguanas, as it turns out, are susceptible to freezing once temperatures drop to around 40F (4.44C). When frozen, these cold-blooded creatures lose their grip on the cozy trees they call home and slip. But the experts informed the public to be aware that the chilled reptiles may be stiff and appear lifeless – but they are not dead.The NWS made the decision to alert the public on Twitter to the increased likelihood of the falling iguanas.Floridians seem relatively unfazed that green reptiles may freeze up and show up petrified around their pools or on their decks. The possibility has come about every winter for years.Iguanas are an invasive species in Florida and can be little nuisances when not frozen. They can damage infrastructure by digging small burrows into sidewalks or foundations and leave their droppings on decks and inside swimming pools.But when winter comes around, frozen iguanas warm the hearts of even their worst enemies.Frank Cerabino, a columnist for the Palm Beach Post, wrote in an article last winter that his backyard iguana was no friend to his home for the “Jimmy Dean-sausage-sized memento” they tend to leave behind. But this time around, he “got the pool skimmer, and moved his whole body out of the water so he was flat on his back on the patio next to the pool. I decided to give him a fighting chance,” he wrote.If the thought of interacting with a green reptile makes you squeamish, you are in luck: wildlife conservationists recommend not touching frozen iguanas, as they may thaw unexpectedly and feel threatened if a person comes close to them.“Like any wild animal, it will try to defend itself,” Kristen Sommers, from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, told the Washington Post last year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/adef7602cf8cbbb934276af370a85cc349437fe6/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=65b82f9d87ed3300ff1f275f03d32ee8","title":"heads could roll pwc isabel dos santos links chairman luanda leaks","story":"Exclusive: Bob Moritz says he is ‘shocked and disappointed’ by Luanda Leaks disclosuresThe global chairman of PwC has warned that heads could roll at the professional services firm over its links to Isabel dos Santos, Africa’s richest woman, who is battling allegations that she obtained her wealth through corruption and nepotism.Bob Moritz, whose firm advised companies belonging to Dos Santos and her husband across multiple jurisdictions, told the  he was “shocked and disappointed” by recent disclosures about the British-headquartered accounting firm’s work for the daughter of Angola’s former president.The complex financial schemes that helped Dos Santos amass an estimated $2.2bn (£1.7bn) fortune at the expense of the Angolan state have been revealed this week in the Luanda Leaks investigation, based on a huge cache of documents leaked from her business empire.The Luanda Leaks project is based on a trove of 715,000 emails, charts, contracts, audits and accounts detailing the business operations of Isabel dos Santos, the daughter of the former president of Angola.The files were initially obtained by the anti-corruption charity Platform to Protect Whistleblowers in Africa (PPLAAF), which shared them with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ).The documents, which cover a period between 1980 and 2018, have been reviewed by more than 120 journalists from 37 media outlets, including the , the BBC and the Portuguese newspaper\u0026nbspExpresso.Moritz said a PwC investigation would examine whether any iniduals at the partnership should lose leadership positions, have their bonuses docked or lose their jobs.Dos Santos has denied that her fortune is the result of nepotism or corruption, and she and her husband have rejected any allegations of wrongdoing, saying their wealth is the result of decades of hard work, and that moves to freeze their assets in Angola are part of a politically motivated “witch-hunt” by her father’s successor as president.“There is an orchestrated attack by the current government that is completely politically motivated, it’s completely unfounded,” Dos Santos told BBC News. “I can say my holdings are commercial, there are no proceeds from contracts or public contracts or money that has been deviated from other funds.”The move comes as the fallout from the Dos Santos revelations shifts to the lawyers, accountants and other western companies that aided her business empire.The Luanda Leaks consist of a cache of 715,0000 files from the administrators of her empire, examined by the  and media outlets in 20 countries in an investigation led by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ).The documents suggest PwC, one of the big four global accountancy firms, acted as auditor, consultant and tax adviser to companies controlled by Dos Santos and her husband in Switzerland, Malta, the Netherlands and Angola. According to the New York Times, another ICIJ partner, PwC worked with 20 of their companies.Moritz said that from a reputational perspective, the Dos Santos story was the worst thing to have happened to PwC under his chairmanship, but he believed it was an exception and not the norm.The company, which made millions from its work for Dos Santos, previously said it was terminating any work for entities controlled by members of her family “in response to the very serious and concerning allegations”.After graduating from a British university, Dos Santos began her career at Coopers \u0026amp Lybrand, which went on to become PricewaterhouseCoopers, or PwC. She later hired former PwC staff as close advisers.They include the chair of Fidequity, the Lisbon wealth management outfit that helped administer her empire and whose data forms part of the leak. When Dos Santos was appointed to run the Angolan state oil company, Sonangol, she recruited her chief financial officer from PwC.Moritz said he was disappointed that PwC had not picked up warning signals from its work in Angola. “When we look at some of the signs that were there, we should have picked them up earlier, and that was our mistake,” he said.Moritz said the investigation at PwC would go as high as it needed to, but he denied that his own job was at risk. Appointed in 2016, he is the chairman of the PwC International Network, which supports more than 276,000 employees in 157 countries. In this capacity, he leads a network of PwC firms that serve clients around the globe from multinational companies to startups.“I’m not worried about my job, but I’m worried about making sure this organisation does what it needs to do,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0430f65264e62ed1b18860cb9c8016b815f033d1/0_0_3406_2044/master/3406.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=786f2f782130f61f428a9514a5764d67","title":"top russian ministers keep posts as putin appoints new cabinet","story":"Defence, foreign and interior ministers remain in place while sport and culture change handsVladimir Putin has appointed a new cabinet in the latest step of a broad government shake-up seen as the early groundwork for his eventual exit from the presidency, if not from Russian politics.The lineup introduces a new stable of deputy prime ministers and shows considerable turnover among ministries tied to social affairs and cultural policy.Prominent ministers tied to Russia’s security and foreign policy have retained their positions, including the defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, and the foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, as well the interior minister, Vladimir Kolokoltsev. The economy minister, Anton Siluanov, has also retained his position in the cabinet, although not as a deputy prime minister.New ministers were named for justice, education, health and economic development. There were also new heads for the ministry of sport, which has struggled to manage the fallout from Russia’s doping scandal, and the ministry of culture, which had tried to fight the foreign influence of Hollywood and has backed patriotic films made in Russia.Putin announced last week that he would introduce constitutional amendments that would largely weaken the power of the presidency, and then abruptly announced the resignation of the government, including the long-time prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev.Medvedev’s replacement was Mikhail Mishustin, Russia’s top tax official and a technocrat seen as removed from the political infighting around the Kremlin.Putin also said he would limit presidents to two terms in office, effectively affirming his plans to step down in 2024 under term limits. He is likely seek a new position in government to retain influence over the system he has built.Speaking to military veterans during the weekend, Putin rejected a return to the Soviet-style system of leaders for life, saying it would be “very worrying” to go back to a situation where leaders died in office without “ensuring the necessary conditions for a transition of power”.The speed of the shakeup has surprised many. Constitutional amendments are due for a vote in parliament later this week, driving speculation that the government may also be preparing for early elections.The draft amendments, which Putin sent to the parliament on Monday, would give new constitutional status to the state council, an advisory body that analysts believe may become a new power centre for Putin after 2024.The state council would “set the main directions of the domestic and foreign policy of the Russian Federation”, the draft of the amendments said. But it remains to be seen what would be the exact scope of its powers, as well as whether it could direct the president to execute certain policies or if it would remain as more of an advisory body.The amendments did less to limit the powers of the presidency than was initially expected after Putin’s speech, appearing to leave the presidency with key powers to direct security and foreign policy. A public vote on the amendments has been scheduled for April, and the Kremlin has said it will not be a formal referendum."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0da62f03250c88a717e0beab4972cc7584b9e333/0_275_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=36c54c28278a25eb7cd76746d5feb38a","title":"what does your 10 manicure really cost the unvarnished truth about nail bars","story":"Are vulnerable young Vietnamese people being routinely trafficked into the UK to work in cut-price nail salons? Amelia Gentleman joins a police raid on one shop suspected of involvement in exploitationOnline reviews for this small south-London nail bar are mixed. “Best nail bar in Peckham,” one says. Most comments, however, are more grudging. “Suppose you get what you pay for,” another concludes (customers here do not pay very much, just £10 for a full manicure). Most telling are the comments about the staff. “The younger girls and boys seem to be learning as they go” “Communication is close to none as they don’t speak English.”It is this lack of English that is one of the warning flags that has put the shop on a list of nail bars requiring investigation for possible exploitation. On a slow Thursday afternoon, the shabby venue is being raided by 20 police officers three people are later arrested on human trafficking charges and four frightened young employees are taken temporarily to a council-run reception centre, where they are given medical treatment and advice.Cut-price nail bars have become a cornerstone of the high street, flourishing as more established shops close. In the past 20 years, manicures have gone from being an extravagant luxury mostly enjoyed by a moneyed elite to an affordable treat, easily accessible to everyone. But the public awareness of what the low costs may mean for those who work there remains hazy. It is easier to associate cannabis farms and brothels with exploitation. Operating in plain sight, nail bars seem more improbable fronts for modern slavery it is very hard to link such an innocuous service with such serious crimes.Kevin Hyland, the UK’s first anti-slavery commissioner, who stepped down in 2018, says people remain confused about the presence of exploitation on the high street because they expect trafficking to be hidden. “People see the shops, they’ve been there for years, police cars drive past them, the local authority collects their rubbish, so they assume they can’t be one of the places where modern slavery happens – an offence that carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.” Familiarity can also add a sense of respectability to the premises. “The longer the shop has been there, the more accepted it is,” he says.Unease about the treatment of vulnerable young Vietnamese people in the UK manicure industry, however, has been slowly rising over the past decade. Then, in October, 39 Vietnamese people were found dead in the back of a refrigerated lorry in Essex. Ten were teenagers. Pham Thi Tra My had texted her mother from the lorry: “I’m sorry Mum. My journey abroad hasn’t succeeded. Mum, I love you so much! I’m dying because I can’t breathe.” Anti-trafficking experts believe that they were brought in to the country to work in nail bars, restaurants and cannabis farms. Southwark council has been working with the politan police on inspecting nail bars since last summer, and the operations have been stepped up in the wake of the Essex tragedy. Yet even news of these deaths has done little to dampen customers’ enthusiasm for £10 manicures.The venue in Peckham is one of five in Southwark being raided simultaneously by 100 police officers. The shop’s thin veneer of frivolity is rapidly stripped away. Inside, there is confusion as eight of the 20 officers crowd inside the narrow space between a row of battered, mismatched treatment chairs, where two startled customers are having their nails painted, and a wall lined with rainbow-coloured pots of varnish. “This is a search warrant giving police the authority to search these premises for evidence of human trafficking,” one of the officers announces. The customers hurriedly leave, while police begin attempting to interview the seven members of staff, all of them Vietnamese.Unravelling who is a victim and who might be exploiting them in this kind of scenario is not always easy. And in this operation it is hampered by a decision to allocate just one interpreter to the 25-strong team of police, social workers, immigration officers and council staff squeezed inside the shop and gathering on the pavement outside.The nail-bar workers, who are told by the translator they face questioning, look alarmed, but say nothing. By the window, a boy in a grey top, clearly a teenager, sits on a swivel chair, his hands pressed anxiously between his legs, his feet not quite touching the floor. With the translator elsewhere, two social workers try without success to speak to him.“How old are you? How old are you? You don’t know how old you are? Your age?” one asks, using the time-honoured British technique of communicating with a non-English speaker, of slowly repeating the same question, louder and louder. He replies quietly in Vietnamese, looking unhappy. “How old are you? Do you speak English? I can’t get anything out of him,” she says, with unreasonable irritation.A teenage girl, who, like all the staff, is wearing a grey top, tells officers through the interpreter that she is 17, but says she isn’t actually working in the shop, and has just stopped by to say hello to a friend as she was in the neighbourhood. “Are your parents here? You mum or dad?” a police officer asks. She shakes her head.The only adult man among the staff is very agitated, and repeatedly requests to be allowed to go to the toilet. Police refuse, concerned that he wants to get rid of something incriminating. Instead, he sits gloomily, snipping his nails, dropping the clippings on the floor. An older woman says she is worried about her baby at home, and asks to leave, but she is told that no one can go until checks have been made on everyone’s immigration status she is later arrested. One of the younger women says all the takings (the nail bar accepts only cash) are put in a drawer until the end of the day no one will give a clear answer about how, or how much, they are paid.Outside the shop, more police officers are questioning a tired-looking Vietnamese man who has been peering through the back of the building, then watching proceedings from the other side of the high street and making calls. They ask him to hand over and unlock his phone.“It’s not my phone,” he tells them, speaking Vietnamese to the translator. “Some lady just gave it to me.”“Can you just tell him I’ve never heard such rubbish in my life,” the police officer says, holding the phone in front of the man’s face to see if it would unlock with facial recognition.“Tell him we are going to arrest him on suspicion of theft of a mobile phone.” The man unlocks his phone and officers look through the 20 calls he has made and received during the 45 minutes since the raid began, establishes that a number of calls have been made to staff inside the shop and decide to arrest him on suspicion of involvement in modern slavery and people trafficking.Shortly, another man comes to the shop, pushing a small baby in a pram, and looks through the windows at the staff inside. “Is this your shop?” police ask him. He shakes his head, but when asked to show ID, police recognise him as the man named as the shop’s manager on a notice inside. Another officer takes the pram, handcuffs him and tells him: “You are under arrest for arranging and facilitating modern slavery. We’ll look after the baby, don’t worry.”The mother of the baby has already been taken from the shop to a waiting police car. “He’s been nicked she’s been nicked. Do we bring the baby to the police station?”“We don’t want that. We’ll have to take her into care.”Beneath the pram’s plastic rain cover, the baby peeps out, waving its arms around peacefully.“Is there anyone else who can look after the baby?” a police officer asks the translator to ask the man, adding in an aside: “We’re getting our money’s worth out of you … Ask him: Is there another family member? When does the baby need food and drink?”A lorry driver waiting at the traffic lights by the shop in a truck piled high with scaffolding, shouts: “Let him off!” before driving away, laughing.In total, 13 people working in the five shops are arrested on suspicion of modern slavery and human trafficking offences, and another seven are arrested on suspicion of immigration offences and possessing counterfeit goods, mostly counterfeit cigarettes. Five children and nine adults are deemed to be vulnerable and taken to a temporary reception centre. The council says later that no one was taken into care, because “police weren’t able to establish that any of the young people were children”, although 10 children were found working in Southwark’s nail bars earlier in the year and placed with foster carers. It is unclear what happened to the baby.Mark Rogers, the detective chief inspector leading the operation for the politan police’s central specialist crime unit, says he is happy with how things have gone. “Human trafficking, modern slavery and sexual exploitation often occur in plain sight, and it is often the case those carrying out these offences exploit those from less fortunate backgrounds who have travelled to our country for a better life, in the knowledge these iniduals will carry out hard, labour-intensive work to provide for themselves.”So, how can customers tell if a nail bar is not all it seems? Kevin Hyland recommends looking out for anything that doesn’t look right. “The price is sometimes an indicator but there are other signs.” Are the instructions given through a third party? Are you told: sit here, and that person will do your nails? There should be some ability to interact with the staff does the worker carry on in silence, never removing the protective face mask? Is there a man sitting at the door, behaving in a dominant way?Samantha Sweet, who runs Creative Nail Design, says it is impossible to tell which discount salons are likely to be exploitative. “If we knew more about the discount places I think we would choose different places. Some of them are absolutely fine and employ people legally. But I don’t think the general public think about it they think – well it’s dead cheap and dead quick.” As a benchmark she said the average gel polish treatment should cost at least £25. But, she says “part of the problem is that in the cheaper salons, people don’t talk anyway – they hold out one hand and they’re on their mobile on the other, and then they swap hands.”Millie Kendall, CEO of the British Beauty Council, says two decades ago she only knew of two nail salons in London, but new products, (extensions, fillers, shellac) and the rise of instagram sharing of nail art has made this a rapidly accelerating industry with multiple shops on most high streets. “The business has changed beyond recognition. Nail art has changed the game and made it a more creative industry. The flip side is that we are very under regulated and that’s a real problem for us. Bad products are being used, people get funguses, skin problems and there are slaves.” She hopes the government will move to license the industry.Mark Rogers says he hopes media coverage of the arrests will “continue to raise the public’s awareness of these shocking crimes.” But even when people learn about the issue they tend not to believe it could affect the salon they use it is hard to understand that you could be in such close proximity to someone who has been trafficked, holding your hand, and silently painting bright varnish on your nails.Despite Southwark’s high-profile campaigns, online reviews of other nail bars in the borough continue to reveal how clients’ irritation with the language barrier is carefully weighed up against the joy of a cheap pedicure. Despite the intimacy involved in the treatment, hands and feet being washed and tended to by strangers, many seem remarkably uncurious about the workers, and concern for their welfare seems negligible. One customer writes: “The staff were rude both in person and on the phone, some barely spoke any English, you could clearly see they didn’t want to be doing the job. Got a manicure and pedicure – the job was just about mediocre.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4147175.1579640603!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"scientist says methane from farming should be treated differently to co2","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tProf John Fitzgerald, chairman, Climate Change Advisory Council and Prof Frank Mitloehner, University of California at the IFA’s Climate Action in Agriculture conference in Dublin . Photograph Nick Bradshaw for The It does not make sense that Ireland is regarded as producing more greenhouse gases than Los Angeles, a city of 13 million people, a US scientist has told a conference on climate action in agriculture. Prof Frank Mitloehner from the University of California, Davis, told the Irish Farmers’ Association event in Dublin that the case for methane arising from farming being treated differently to long-lived greenhouse gases, such as CO2, was undeniable.He said that methane, the main greenhouse gas in livestock production, only lasts in the atmosphere for 10 years, whereas CO2 persists for up to 1,000 years, he said. Methane was short-lived but carbon from fossil fuels was “a one-way street” to rising emissions.If herd numbers were kept constant, there would be no additional carbon added to the atmosphere while recycled carbon from methane would be consumed in a “biogenic cycle”, he said. If methane was reduced with the right incentives for farmers it could induce global cooling.There was a reason why Ireland was green. “You have an enormous amount of forage in Ireland. The natural land use for a place like Ireland is the use of ruminant livestock because a lot of the land is not arable.”A lot of land could not be used for crops as it was marginal, “it doesn’t have good enough soils for the most part and, therefore, it is used for grazing.” This had a massive beneficial impact as carbon sink.Prof Mitloehner said improving efficiency and adapting new technologies were “the most effective ways to mitigate the impact of food production in contributing to emissions”.He rejected criticism of his views on methane, notably by Johns Hopkins Centre of a Livable Future in the US. Climate Change Advisory Council chairman Prof John FitzGerald, told the conference, Climate Action in Agriculture – A Balanced Approach, that all sectors must take climate action, as all sectors were to blame for failure to address the issue.The agriculture sector had been set less demanding targets compared to other sectors, so farmers were not being scapegoated. There was a need to cut national heard numbers by between 500,000 and 1.5 million cattle, and reduce dependency on beef.If methane was to be accounted for in a different way, this had to scientifically proven and verifiable.Teagasc research director Prof Frank O’Mara, said agriculture could reach its decarbonisation targets if key mitigation measures in Teagasc’s “roadmap” were adopted. This could be done while maintaining the national herd. Ground rules for reducing greenhouse gases up to 2030 were set the hope was after that methane would be treated differently and greater allowance made on ability to land to capture carbon.IFA president Joe Healy said the agri-food sector was actively engaged in climate action. “The future must be about safeguarding Ireland’s climate-efficient model of food production, while providing innovative opportunities for farm families and rural Ireland to climate proof their futures. Farming’s entrepreneurial spirit is ready to respond.”But he warned: “Farmers cannot afford to be green if they are in the red.”An Taisce environmental group has questioned the attempt to “rebalance debate around climate action”, claiming it was “likely to further mislead and misinform, rather than offer any scientifically-justified balance”.Dr Mitloehner views, it added, “are highly contested by scientists and his comments are noted in published literature as textbook examples of efforts to create policy confusion with a view to further delaying or avoiding vital climate action.”Scientists from Johns Hopkins University, it said, took the unusual step of issuing a rebuttal to Dr Mitloenher’s “mis-statements”, noting that cutting total emissions is the only meaningful measure of climate action and that animal agriculture has an enormous environmental impact.On scapegoating farmers, it added: “In fact, critics, including An Taisce, are saying farmers have been misled by the IFA, which has worked hand-in-glove with the food processing industry, into supporting an agri-food strategy since 2010 that benefits processors.”This had increased farmers’ input costs, financial risks and exposure to climate change impacts without offering any coherent plan for transitioning to less polluting forms of agriculture – “when total agricultural emissions continue to increase.” "},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Consultant highlights inequity which sees public sector workers get supplementary pensionHome for Good says change to Constitution not a solution to housing crisisIrish live exports do not meet highest welfare standards \u0026ndash Ethical Farming Ireland claimsPair presented themselves at Garda station in relation to attack on father of three in CorkGarda Commissioner rejects claims force not always able to deal with terror and gun attacksProf John FitzGerald warns all sectors must take climate actionUCC had most students sign up to be included on supplementary electoral role in last weekCouncil intending to use Sean McDermott street site for education and housingFormer RT\u0026Eacute journalist announced decision to run for D\u0026aacuteil seat in Wicklow after pension row eruptedBoat refused to get out of shipping lane and delayed cruiseliner\u0026rsquos approach, court toldElection campaign launch: Howlin says his party will \u0026lsquoend the waste of public money\u0026rsquoVaradkar says he will make the case for Irish agriculture in any future EU trade dealsAny failure to properly provide for Eithne Ryan \u0026lsquolies squarely\u0026rsquo with her son, says judgeHousing manifesto includes rent freezes and 20,000 new homes a yearFifteen properties searched by police as part of investigation into \u0026pound215m laundering scamMan fails in attempt to be released from custody on bailMan tells WRC that comments at work made him feel under threat and humiliated"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4146756.1579619019!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"taoiseach claims sinn f%C3%A9in not a normal political party","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTánaiste Simon Coveney and  Taoiseach Leo Varadkar are pictured in Cork where  Fine Gael set out its agriculture policy on Tuesday. Photograph: Áine McMahonPA Wire.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has again insisted that Fine Gael will not go into coalition with Sinn Féin after the general election.Mr Varadkar said Sinn Féin’s suitability to govern should not be determined by its performance in opinion polls. He said he did not believe it was “a normal political party”.“We are not ruling out Sinn Féin as a potential government partner because of where they stand in the polls. That is not what it is about at all. It is a principled position that we are taking,” he told reporters in Fermoy, Co Cork.“It is our view Sinn Féin is not a normal party. Their decision making process involves consulting with an ard chomhairle and we have seen that in Northern Ireland where key decisions are not necessarily made by elected politicians.”He added: “Secondly, and at a time of serious concerns about crime, Sinn Féin is a party that has consistently opposed the Special Criminal Court, a court that we use to lock up some really bad guys, dissident Republicans and people who are involved in organised crime.”Sinn Féin recently said it would support a review of the non-jury court if it was in government as opposed to it being abolished outright, but Mr Varadkar said this was “not a U-turn”.“We will have another poll in another couple of days’ time and we don’t know what that is going to say. But the situation as far as I can see it is that this election is close. Fine Gael is coming from behind,” he said, adding that “it is close and it is all to play for”.The Ipsos MRBI poll showed Mr Varadkar’s approval rating has fallen to 35 per cent from 51 per cent in October. The Taoiseach rejected suggestions that he was unpopular and possibly damaging the Fine Gael brand.“Not at all. What the polls show is that all the three main party leaders are neck and neck. I am slightly ahead of the other two,” said Mr Varadkar, noting that the poll put the rating of Fianna Fáil’s Micheál Martin at 33 per cent and Sinn Féin’s Mary Lou McDonald at 34 per cent. “It is all to play for. Fine Gael can emerge as the largest party after the election.”TV debatesAsked if he believed Ms McDonald should be allowed to participate in televised leaders’ debates given her party’s strong showing in the polls, Mr Varadkar said it was a matter for the broadcasters.“I don’t have a difficulty debating Micheál Martin head to head. I think it is right that we do that because we are the two people vying for the taoiseach’s office. But equally I have no difficulty doing a debate involving the leaders of the three major parties.”Mr Varadkar said Fine Gael, unlike Fianna Fáil, had a good history of forming coalition governments that worked. It was in coalition with Labour from 2011-2016 and the last Fine Gael-Independent minority administration was propped up by Fianna Fáil through the confidence and supply deal.“If we are in the situation, and I believe it will be the situation after the election, that we are the largest party, then we will want to talk to other parties except Sinn Féin about forming a government,” he said.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4147195.1579642125!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"election 2020 fact check have consultant waiting lists increased by three stadiums full","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tHave waiting lists to see a consultant increased by the equivalent figure it would take to feel Croke Park, Thomond Park and Parc Ui Caoimh together? File photograph: Ray McManus  SportsfileQuestion: Have waiting lists to see a consultant increased by the equivalent figure it would take to fill Croke Park, Thomond Park and Parc Ui Caoimh together?Who is making the claim?During the launch of the party’s health policy on Monday and on the Claire Byrne show that evening, Fianna Fáil’s health spokesman Stephen Donnelly made a series of claims about how waiting lists have performed under Minister for Health Simon Harris. Most eye-catching was the suggestion that “an extra 140,000 men, women and children are waiting to see a consultant”. He made a number of associated claims throughout the course of the day, namely: that there has been a 20-fold increase in the number of children waiting more than 18 months for a consultant’s appointment, an eightfold increase in the number of adults waiting the same time period to see a consultant, and that waiting lists “are going up, and up, and up”. Upon what is he basing his claims?Donnelly has said that he is basing his claims on outpatient waiting lists, which are published by the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF). Unlike other waiting lists common across the health sector, such as trolley counts, these aren’t disputed by different stakeholders in the health system. Specifically, he is using total numbers assembled by the NTPF for each grouphospital. For claims specific to children, he is using the figures provided under this heading for Children’s Health Ireland. The analysis:Like a lot to do with the health system, waiting lists are extremely complicated. There are issues around the double counting of people, the difference between waiting to be seen by a consultant and waiting for treatment, and whether you’re counting inpatients or outpatients.However, the core claim - that 140,000 people more people are waiting to see a consultant - is easily enough measured for outpatients. When you take the outpatient waiting list total for the end of May 2016, when Simon Harris was appointed, it comes to 415,584. At the end of December, the figure was 553,434, a difference of 137,850. Allowing for a bit of rounding, that central claim seems to be accurate. However, as a spokeswoman for Minister Harris points out, there are other ways to measure other waiting lists which show a decrease. Patients waiting for a consultation, which is what Donnelly has measured, are not classified as waiting for a treatment. The figure for those waiting on a treatment has fallen from 74,968 in May 2016 to 66,653 in December 2019. When it comes to the claim on the number of children waiting having increased 20-fold, again the data is based on outpatient waiting lists. These show some 9,977 are waiting at the end of December for more than 18 months, up from 505 when Harris took office. This is a shade under a 20-fold increase (19.75 times, to be precise). Overall, for all time periods, the increase has been less dramatic, from 31,600 to 44,085.The claim that the number of adults waiting to see a consultant has gone up eight-fold is less easy to justify. The total number of people waiting more than 18 months has increased to 102,924, from 13,095 - that’s an increase of 7.85 times the 2016 level. With a little bit of generous rounding, you can get to 8x, but Donnelly specifically claimed it was for adults only. When the numbers for the Children’s Hospital Group are split out, the total is 7.38 times the figure waiting in 2016. For adults, this is likely to be a little lower, as there is an indeterminate (but small) number of children receiving treatment in the other hospital groups. Our verdict:Hospital waiting lists are very complicated it is possible to selectively use different sets of figures to tell a different story depending on your narrative. Therefore, relying on them for headlines or simple claims can be tricky. However, based on the figures he has used, Deputy Donnelly’s claims are largely accurate, notwithstanding some issues around the claim of uninterrupted increases in waiting lists, and the level of increase among adults awaiting treatment. The combined capacity of the three stadiums he cites, according to Google, is 152,900. If you let him off the fact that he is still 15,050 patients short on filling his combined super-stadium, his claims are mostly true.

Photograph: Getty ImagesA new advocacy group launched on Wednesday will put pressure on politicians to commit to a referendum on inserting the right to a home into the Constitution.Home for Good, which is being fronted by former Barnardos chief executive Fergus Finlay, is calling for the protection of the right to property to be “balanced” by the insertion of a new provision declaring that the right of citizens to a “decent, affordable and safe home is fundamental to the common good”.It is being launched on Wednesday morning to coincide with the general election campaign in the hope that commitments will be made by political leaders to include the referendum in a programme for government.Mr Finlay told The  that the constitutional protection of property rights had been used to thwart at least 12 pieces of legislation in the last few years, including proposed new laws on rent controls and greater use of compulsory purchase orders.“Whether you’re talking radical or moderate, Government Ministers have argued again and again that the legal advice is such that we can’t proceed any further,” Mr Finlay said.The Home for Good steering group includes the Simon Community, Focus Ireland, Respond and Threshold, as well as trade union Forsa. Senator Colette Kelleher and Cork-based barrister Anne FitzGerald are also part of the steering group.Defining issueMr Finlay said housing was “going to be the defining issue of this election, and everyone is in the mood for solutions. A change to the Constitution is not a solution but it is a step on the way towards a solution.”The Constitution outlines that the right to property is mitigated by the common good, but there is no definition or explanation of what is meant by the common good. The group will ask that this right to property not be deleted from the Constitution, but that the common good be defined.Mr Finlay said it was important to note the group’s objective was not that people without a home could demand one based on a new constitutional right. “It’s not a situation where everyone gets everything free, that’s not what we’re after,” he said.The Social Democrats and Sinn Féin have committed to holding a referendum if they are in government, and Mr Finlay said he expected the Labour Party would do likewise. However, he said, “the issue is whether Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael will if they do, and there’s a commitment in the programme for government, we can have a decent conversation about what it should entail”.He said the Government had spent almost a year meeting with lawyers and constitutional law experts, many of whom said a judge would be likely to adjudicate in favour of the common good if a test was brought in the courts. However, he said the blocking of legislation based on advice from the attorney general’s office meant a test case had not been progressed.Focus groupsHe said testing of the proposal in focus groups had found “significant support” for what he described as the “right approach”, which would not eliminate the property rights already contained in the Constitution.The aim of the campaign, he said, was “to encourage the political system to accept the principle and work out the exact answer”.“We will never make the progress we need to as long as the more or less unqualified right to property trumps everything.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4147182.1579641444!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord greens take to the beach as signs emerge of a rising tide","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGreen Party leader Eamon Ryan, Dublin Bay North candidate David Healy and Dublin North-West candidate Caroline Conroy at Bull Island to launch the party’s Bioersity and Pollution Policy Paper. Photograph: Nick Bradshaw for The Eamon Ryan is on Bull Island.Aren’t they all these days? There’s an election on.No. The Green Party leader is really there – strolling along Dollymount beach in the famous nature reserve having just launched his party’s policy on bioersity. When he says the island and its wildlife is under pressure from plastic pollution, sewage outflow, habitat loss and rising sea levels caused by climate breakdown, he isn’t talking bull.The Greens chose this tiny corner of Dublin because its problems point up the dangerous pressures on our living planet today. According to scientists (and the preamble to this policy document) the “sixth mass extinction event, labelled the ‘Anthropocene extinction’, is currently under way”, with experts estimating that global wildlife populations have declined by 40 per cent in the past 40 years.Ryan and his team, including general election candidates Cllr David Healy (Dublin Bay North) and Cllr Caroline Conroy (Dublin North-West), arrive at the dunes in a hired minivan and head down to the sea.It is a bracing January morning. The rain is misty and the glorious sky a luminous grey. Apart from some specks on the horizon, they have the beckoning strand to themselves.The tide is in. Eamon walks alone towards the water’s edge. “It’s like the start of Reginald Perrin,” he muses, staring out at the white-topped waves.Ah here. Reggie Perrin was a 1970s sitcom character who faked his own death by leaving his clothes and personal effects behind on a beach and disappearing.Fake disappearance dipEven allowing for understandable worries over the Anthropocene extinction, vanishing curlews and plastic particles in the food chain, Eamon is due to hand in his nomination papers on Wednesday, so a fake disappearance dip off Dollymount – no matter how tempting – was out of the question.That aside, he seemed remarkably chipper under the circumstances.This was probably down to Tuesday’s  poll which had the party at 8 per cent nationally and 15 per cent in Dublin. “Cautiously optimistic” was the feeling just under three weeks from polling day.“We were pleased because we are doing well and we can feel it. It’s a cliche, I know, but I was around the country yesterday, in Kildare, Kilkenny and Waterford, and it’s the same story in each of those constituencies and around Dublin. We are getting a really good response.”Pleased with the campaign, taking nothing for granted, much to live up to and a lot of work ahead of them before the big day. All the usual stuff.Back to the beach. The issue of bioersity and climate change – “the two really go together” – must be tackled, say the Greens. This is their mission. The party has come up with a range of practical measures to stop and reverse the destruction of Ireland’s plant and animal population. Coalition suitors will have to consider them.Crisis is realIt’s an “ambitious” list because the crisis is real, stressed the former minister for communications and natural resources. “The fact that we’ve lost half of all wildlife in the last 15 years, that so many of our bird species are threatened – same with our bees, same with all our insects, our very soil, the health of our soil is at risk – means decisive action must be taken.”But hang on a minute here, Eamon Ryan. Your election posters aren’t even eco-friendly. How do you plead?“Eh, they aren’t.”However, he has been reusing them – three election outings so far for what’s left of the old crop. Think Dorian Gray, without the attic or opium habit. After the election, in the spirit of recycling, Eamon is hoping to become a bucket. Or maybe a collapsible table. Where his posters are concerned, he tries to reduce and reuse.“They are all recycled afterwards and I think they turn most of them into garden furniture.”During a general election, the downside of campaigning on a deserted beach is the lack of voters to canvass. Although he met a lady called Beatrice and a large gentleman called Bear, who were so very pleased and excited to meet the leader of the Greens they had to sniff him all over. It’s a terrible pity dogs can’t vote.Their owner, Dr David Quish, can, though. A geographer, he taught for many years in Santa Sabina girls’ school in nearby Sutton. David and Eamon, Bear and Beatrice all agree that the Bull Island is a wonderful resource. “A fascinating example of the sequence of land formation,” said David.Up in the beakAnd what about the crows? Isn’t it great the way they fly high in the air with a mussel and then drop it down on the ground to open it? That’s what they do on the southside in Sandymount anyway, marvelled Eamon. Up in the beak and down until the shell cracks.Well, said David, the crows in Dollymount “have a sense of tidiness”. He has observed how they have little areas, almost as if “this is our rubbish place and we don’t drop them everywhere. So they have places which are sort of disposal spots for them.”If only people could be as conscientious.Would he vote Green?“Certainly I would.”He said he read a report on how large areas of the natural world are rapidly disappearing and it “shocked me into reality”.The challenges posed by climate change are vast and complex. The Green leader and his candidates are very knowledgeable on the subject and can, and do, hold forth at length on it. In this era of bite-sized information and an election of brief doorstep encounters, it might help if the main message is easily imparted.“‘Want Green? Vote Green’ is our election slogan because if you want all these measures that we are talking about, then you have to vote Green,” says Eamon. He has been using his favourite slogan for ages but thinks it is as relevant now as when first he said it: “Think Globally, Act Locally.”Age profileFor the party to do well on election day, it is generally believed that younger people have to turn out, although the recent poll suggests a broader support base in terms of age profile.For Eamon Ryan, “the critical thing is will they turn up to vote.” He reckons it will be a very good day if young people realise they can vote for what future they want. “If we don’t address this crisis they will be living in a planet where it’s not possible to manage . . . Once nature goes beyond a certain point, you can’t bring it back.”If the slide isn’t reversed those young people “may grow up in a world where nature is denuded, where they will never experience what we’ve been fortunate to grow up with, living with a landscape that’s really rich and alive. And that is why they should go out and vote.”Not for the first time, and, we suspect, not for the last time, Eamon mentioned one of the shining lights in the global battle to arrest bioersity loss.“Let’s do this in honour of David Attenborough.”He’ll have Greta out on the canvass next.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Sixth death in China where wider outbreak feared as hundreds of millions begin travelling for lunar new yearHealth commission confirms that coronavirus can spread from person to personCricket ball-sized hail stones smash windows and see residents sledding through streetsOver 60 cases of novel coronavirus identified in Wuhan amid fears it could spread furtherXi Jinping\u0026rsquos name appeared as \u0026ldquoMr S**thole when translated into EnglishAuthorities still battling nearly 100 fires despite heavy rain in eastern parts of countryUS to screen passengers at three major airports arriving on flights from WuhanRescuers save 30 trekkers following incident on Annapurna circuitFacial hair of diplomat, who has Japanese heritage, reminds Koreans of colonisationMany young couples reluctant to have children due to costs orce rates hit recordMelbourne braces for another wave of unhealthy air over weekend\u0026lsquoThese pines outlived the dinosaurs \u0026ndash we had to do everything we could to save them\u0026rsquoBushfires dampened in New South Wales as thunderstorms cause flooding in MelbourneIndustry that has long supported India\u0026rsquos PM and pro-Hindu agenda begins risky rebellionForeign minister pushes back after re-election of pro-independence Tsai Ing-WenThai health minister says it is first confirmed case of virus found outside ChinaAuthorities warn \u0026lsquohazardous eruption\u0026rsquo is possible \u0026lsquowithin hours or days\u0026rsquoVillagers evacuated near Taal volcano south of ManilaAuthorities struggling to clear road after heavy snowfall, rains and flash floodsFavourable conditions allow firefighters to switch from \u0026lsquodefence to offence\u0026rsquo against blaze"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4146456.1579634234!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"first us case of coronavirus confirmed as chinese officials race to stem spread","story":"Scientists at the University of Hong have determined that at least 1,300 iniduals in Wuhan are statistically likely to have been infected with a novel coronavirus between January 1st and 17th.

Photograph: Nicolas AsfouriAFPGetty Images.A person in Washington state has been infected with the Wuhan coronavirus, the first confirmed case in the United States of a mysterious respiratory infection that has killed at least six people and infected more than 300 in China. The patient, who was hospitalised with pneumonia last week, recently had traveled to Wuhan, China, where the outbreak appears to have originated, federal officials have found. Investigators tested samples from the patient for the presence of the virus positive results were received over the weekend. Officials declined to identify the patient, who was said to be quite ill.There were fears of a wider spread intensifying as hundreds of millions of people in China prepare to travel this week to mark the lunar new year holiday. The jump in cases comes days after authorities said the coronavirus can spread from one human to another, having previously said that they believed it could only jump from animals to humans.In addition to the confirmed cases, hundreds of suspected sufferers were under observation, according to officials in Wuhan, capital of Hubei province, where a seafood and animal market is considered ground zero for the epidemic. As China races to try to stem the outbreak, temperature checks have been set up to vet anyone coming into or out of Wuhan, a central Chinese city of 11 million people. Airlines and booking platforms said they would allow travellers who have been quarantined or diagnosed with the virus to cancel or reschedule their travel arrangements for free, and they also offered free cancellations on any bookings made for Wuhan.The Wuhan local government issued a notice on Tuesday to all its civil servants and employees of state-owned companies not to leave the city, and banned tour groups departing over the upcoming spring festival holiday, which starts on Saturday.The annual holiday typically sees hundreds of millions of Chinese people on the move, returning to their home towns or travelling to holiday destinations to ring in the lunar new year. Confirmed casesCases of the coronavirus have been confirmed domestically in Hubei province, Beijing, Guangdong, Zhejiang, Tianjin and Shanghai, while suspected cases have been reported in Sichuan, Yunnan, Shandong and Guangxi. Thailand, South Korea, Singapore, Japan and Taiwan have also confirmed cases. Thermal screening measures have been set up in several international airports with direct flights to high-risk areas in China.Officials confirmed this week that 15 medical staff in Wuhan were infected by the same patient, prompting fears “super-spreaders” of the virus could emerge.The virus, known as 2019-nCov, is a coronavirus – one that infects the nose, throat and sinuses – and presents pneumonia-like symptoms. This pathogen is thought to be a new strain that has not previously been identified.The World Health Organisation will hold a meeting on Wednesday to decide on recommendations to make with regard to the spread of the virus and whether to declare a public health emergency “of international concern”, as they have done in the past for emergencies such as swine flu and the Ebola epidemic.The coronavirus has genetic similarities to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars), which also originated in China in 2002-2003, and resulted in 774 reported deaths in 37 countries. In that case Chinese officials initially tried to conceal the extent of the epidemic, but the cover-up was exposed by a whistleblowing senior doctor. Higher talliesResearchers at the University of Hong Kong and at Imperial College in London have issued separate reports this week that both estimate the true number of coronavirus cases to be significantly higher than the official tally.In his first public comments on the crisis, Chinese president Xi Jinping ordered resolute efforts to curb the spread of the virus, and called for the timely release of information and the deepening of international co-operation.While transparency has been officially encouraged, anyone considered to be rumour-mongering faces criminal charges. Wuhan police announced earlier this month that eight people had been arrested in the city and charged for posting comments about the viral outbreak online, saying they had “spread rumours . . . and caused adverse social impact” and were subsequently “handled according to the law”.The public security bureau message warned the public: “Do not create rumours, believe rumours or spread rumours. Build a harmonious and clear cyberspace.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4145269.1579516519!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit eu citizens want physical card to prove right to stay in uk","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA report found nine out of 10 EU citizens in the UK would prefer a card over digital evidence  of their rights. File photograph: Will OlivierEPAThe British government is facing fresh calls to issue EU citizens with a physical document to prove they have the right to stay in the country after Brexit.A report found nine out of 10 EU citizens in the UK would prefer a card over the digital evidence they have now to demonstrate their rights in future to employers, banks or landlords.Fears over discrimination, loss of identity and a continuing lack of trust in the government’s willingness to deliver guaranteed lifetime rights emerged as serious concerns in the research – the biggest survey of EU, European Economic Area (EEA) and Swiss citizens in the UK to date.Tanja Bueltmann, a professor at Northumbria University who designed and conducted the poll along with the campaign group the3million, said: “The survey documents, without question, we have an ‘unsettling status’.“This extends beyond the application process, revealing an erosion of trust an erosion of wellbeing and an erosion of the sense of belonging among survey respondents.“The government has a duty to finally give EUEEA and Swiss citizens certainty. Hollow words are not enough.”The findings came just days after the government gave the European parliament’s Brexit co-ordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, reassurances that EU citizens would not be automatically deported if they failed to apply for the settled status scheme.The survey, published on Monday, found that nine in 10 of those polled were unhappy about the lack of a physical document to demonstrate their right to remain in the country after they had been granted settled status or pre-settled status.As many as 11 per cent said they had already been asked for settled status proof, even though this is not legally required.This echoes a warning by private landlords that tenants could face discrimination because of the lack of a physical document.On the plus side, many of those surveyed reported a positive experience of the settled status app, with a majority of respondents saying the application process worked well.As many as 97.1 per cent of the 3,171 valid responses to the survey said they had received the status decision they expected.However, the emotional response to having to apply and the consequences of being labelled as someone with “settled status” was largely adverse. The words most frequently used by respondents to describe their feelings were “angry”, “anxious” and “unwanted”.Even those who had already been granted settled status felt worse off, with 80 per cent either strongly agreeing or agreeing that they felt anxious.Eight out of 10 said the process made them stressed and many thought citizenship was far more secure.Maike Bohn, co-founder of the3million, said the report underlined the lack of trust after three years of mixed messages.“Are we the much-quoted ‘neighbours, colleagues, friends’ or are we the ‘queue jumpers, benefits scroungers, unwelcome guests, draining the NHS’?“The government needs to step up local outreach and support, both to EUEEA and Swiss citizens but also to employers, landlords and others who will be forced to check the immigration status of these citizens in order to avoid huge fines.”The British Home Office said the scheme was working and a digital solution was better than a physical document. “This digital status future-proofs their rights and is linked to their passport or ID card, replacing physical documents which can get lost, stolen, damaged, tampered with and expire,” it said.–Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Lindsey WassonReutersBoeing Co said its grounded 737 Max won’t be cleared to fly until the middle of this year, at least six months later than previously anticipated, adding to the company’s financial burden.The US planemaker is resetting expectations as it addresses two recent setbacks for the embattled Max: a software flaw that will require more work than expected and an audit that found some wiring on the aircraft needs to be shifted. The final determination on when the Max will fly again remains in the hands of US regulators, Boeing said in a statement on Tuesday.The worsening timeline deepens the challenge for Boeing as new chief executive officer David Calhoun tries to repair frayed relationships with customers, suppliers and regulators. His predecessor, Dennis Muilenburg, was ousted in December as it became apparent that the company would miss its goal of recertifying the Max in 2019. The jet was grounded in March after the second of two deadly accidents that killed a total of 346 people.The new delay will “reduce deliveries and increase Boeing’s reimbursements to airlines, which we believe will easily top $10 billion,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst George Ferguson said in a report. “Boeing will have to pay airlines for lost profit and the increased cost of training if simulator work is needed, as the airframer recommends.”Slower recovery Every month the grounding drags on means a slower recovery for Boeing, which has halted production of the Max. More delays also signify growing costs to store about 800 of the single-aisle workhorses. Boeing has borrowed $21.5bn (€19.4bn) since the first Max fell from the sky in October 2018, and is seeking to add another $10 billion in new loans.The shares dropped 3.3 per cent to $313.37 at the close in New York, the biggest decline on the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the lowest closing price in more than a year.The latest estimate “is subject to our ongoing attempts to address known schedule risks and further developments that may arise in connection with the certification process,” Boeing said. “Returning the Max safely to service is our number one priority, and we are confident that will happen.”The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said it has not set a time frame for completing work on the Max, which was expected to be Boeing’s largest source of profit when it debuted in 2017.“We continue to work with other safety regulators to review Boeing’s work as the company conducts the required safety assessments and addresses all issues that arise during testing,” the FAA said in a statement.If the Max does indeed return in the middle of 2020, Boeing’s best-selling jet will miss some or all of the busy summer travel season for the second straight year, compounding the pain for airlines. The three largest US Max operators have already taken the aircraft out of their schedules through June.“We will continue to assess any future schedule revisions on a rolling 30-day basis and make any potential adjustments accordingly,” said Brandy King, a spokeswoman for Southwest Airlines Co. The carrier, the biggest Max operator, has pulled the model from its schedules until June 6th, resulting in as many as 330 weekday flight cancellations. Calhoun, a former senior executive at General Electric Co. and Blackstone Group Inc., stepped into the top job at Boeing on January 13th, emphasizing transparency and streamlined decision-making. His plans for turning around the company will be in the spotlight when Boeing reports fourth-quarter earnings on January 29th. – Bloomberg"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons january 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178.Social media giants will finally be held responsible for children like Molly RussellOlympic gold medalist spared jail over Extinction Rebellion protest as judge  commends his commitment to causeEarly release for serious violent and sex offenders to be ended by April, Government pledgesSocial media giants to be bound by code of conduct to protect children from online harmsMagistrates to crackdown on motorists who claim \u0026#39extreme hardship\u0026#39 to avoid driving bansPolice service asks fellow force to review its handling of 42-year-old gang rape case after victim appeals to rugby players who saw attackSaudi crown prince \u0026#39hacked Jeff Bezos\u0026#39s phone with WhatsApp message\u0026#39Comment: Beating illegal wildlife trade tests our resolve to save the EarthDuchess of Cambridge to launch landmark survey on early childhoodChris Packham: 7.7 Billion People and Counting, review - this eco polemic had a severe lack of focus EU preparing to give UK worse trade deal terms than Canada or JapanForeign trophy hunters preying on rare UK wildlife, campaigners warnBBC boss \u0026#39blindsided\u0026#39 government with secret plot to quitComment: If it’s a choice between Trump and Greta, I’m with the teenage zealotAsk council to plant a tree on your street to fight pollution, says Royal Horticultural SocietyDriverless \u0026#39pods\u0026#39 tested with public for first time Advert for summer job on remote Irish island attracts 24,000 applicationsCabinet minister warns against fallout with America if UK grants Huawei access to 5GOxford college accused of closing down free speech over transgender event rulesTitanic explorers accused of \u0026#39piracy\u0026#39 as row deepens over plan to seize hidden treasures from wreckWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"titanic watery grave 1500 people should left peace","story":"It would be criminal if the Titanic’s story was allowed to slip beneath the waves for good. But it won’tChildren can be morbid, can’t they? I speak for myself, of course, and my youthful fascination with the Titanic.It was among the real-life “mysteries” in a book bought by my mother. The Loch Ness Monster and Turin Shroud were gripping, sure – but it was the mystery of how this “unsinkable” liner had sunk that hooked me. I devoured accounts of that awful night on April 15, 1912, when 1,500 people died, and lay in bed trying to imagine the terror of the final moments, before they went to their watery graves.So it was with a heavy heart that I read about a plan to disturb that watery grave and extract the ship’s Marconi wireless system, on which its final distress signals were sent. The would-be salvagers are RMS Titanic Inc, a US company backed by private equity. For three decades, they’ve had a monopoly on raising thousands of items from the ship’s debris field – hats, handbags and jewellery.Now, they insist that the secrets hidden inside the Titanic itself must be uncovered before they are lost in the crumbling wreck forever. Or was it that the secrets inside the ship must be uncovered from the crumbling wreck before RMS Titanic Inc is lost forever? I forget...The company – which has faced financial difficulties – argues that the wireless would be a teaching tool. “Surely we owe it to the future to protect and preserve these items,” said president Bretton Hunchak, who seems happy to flout a new UK-US treaty designed to protect the wreck from scavengers.He has a point. It would be criminal if the Titanic’s story was allowed to slip beneath the waves for good. But it won’t. You only have to visit the magnificent Titanic Experience in Belfast, which overlooks the shipyard where she was built, to understand that it’s far from lost – and can be told without disturbing the dead.Ever since the wreck was found in 1985, it has become a vehicle for profit. Even those who seek to protect it are not immune: director James Cameron has opposed any tampering with the disintegrating ship – but given that his Hollywoodisation of the story grossed over $2 billion, he can well afford to be magnanimous. His romanticised version has a lot to answer for in turning our heads away from the true tragedy of it all – and I say that as someone who had a Leonardo di Caprio poster on her bedroom wall.Simply, we have forgotten that 4,000m below the Atlantic lies a grave site, not a cash cow. Don’t believe me? In 1996, RMS Titanic Inc offered people the chance to watch a piece of the wreck being recovered – for $5,000 a head. It failed when the rope snapped and the piece plunged back to the sea bed. And if the firm succeeds in recovering the wireless, it will likely be displayed in the Luxor casino in Las Vegas – just another opportunity for gawping tourists to take selfies.There have been accusations of grave-robbing and little wonder. Titanic survivors and their families have long made a small but important distinction between artefacts recovered from the debris bed and inside the wreck itself. “When I think of all the people down there, one of them my father, I want them to rest in peace,” said Millvina Dean, who died in 2009 aged 97.She was the last survivor. Now it is up to the rest of us to ensure those 1,500 lost souls are allowed to do just that.Olympic gold medalist spared jail over Extinction Rebellion protest as judge  commends his commitment to causeEarly release for serious violent and sex offenders to be ended by April, Government pledgesSocial media giants to be bound by code of conduct to protect children from online harmsMagistrates to crackdown on motorists who claim \u0026#39extreme hardship\u0026#39 to avoid driving bansPolice service asks fellow force to review its handling of 42-year-old gang rape case after victim appeals to rugby players who saw attackSaudi crown prince \u0026#39hacked Jeff Bezos\u0026#39s phone with WhatsApp message\u0026#39Comment: Beating illegal wildlife trade tests our resolve to save the EarthDuchess of Cambridge to launch landmark survey on early childhoodChris Packham: 7.7 Billion People and Counting, review - this eco polemic had a severe lack of focus Foreign trophy hunters preying on rare UK wildlife, campaigners warnEU preparing to give UK worse trade deal terms than Canada or JapanBBC boss \u0026#39blindsided\u0026#39 government with secret plot to quitComment: If it’s a choice between Trump and Greta, I’m with the teenage zealotAsk council to plant a tree on your street to fight pollution, says Royal Horticultural SocietyDriverless \u0026#39pods\u0026#39 tested with public for first time Advert for summer job on remote Irish island attracts 24,000 applicationsCabinet minister warns against fallout with America if UK grants Huawei access to 5GOxford college accused of closing down free speech over transgender event rulesTitanic explorers accused of \u0026#39piracy\u0026#39 as row deepens over plan to seize hidden treasures from wreckLebanon announces new government after months of uncertainty and protestsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/01/15/16/love-island-sr6-ep1-23.jpg","title":"love island fast fashion 20 pledges environment","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.I’ve decided to give up fast fashion for 2020.

His celebrity crush is Lily James.Meanwhile, the show has been sponsored by fast fashion brands (Missguided and then I Saw it First) for the last three years, giving viewers the opportunity to shop the female Islanders’ looks directly. Personally, I’ve always thought that Love Island contestants dress terribly: it’s Benidorm beaches meets Kardashian kitsch. But with prices starting at £5, the clothes are devastatingly cheap. Far cheaper than the designer garb we see on most TV stars. So I can understand the appeal. But I also know that every time someone buys one of those bikinis, or sparkly bodycon dresses, they’re adding fuel to fast fashion’s ever-blazing fire.But perhaps the onus is not on the consumer, or even the Love Island star. Lauren Bravo, author of How to Break Up with Fast Fashion, explains that the brands are the ones who should really be shouldering responsibility here. “These days we’re so used to instant gratification, and the idea that anyone can aspire to celebrity, that it seems reasonable for TV stars to sell us clothes and vice versa,” she tells me. “And it’s really hard, because I know what it’s like to love fashion and crave the clothes you’re seeing on people you admire, not to mention the huge social pressures on young people to keep that endless parade of new looks rolling over on their Instagram grid, so telling people who can’t necessarily afford to spend any more that their shopping habits are destroying the planet can feel snobbish and unfair.”Why I\u0027m giving up fast fashion #20PledgesBut, Bravo adds, the fact remains that those clothes simply cannot be made as cheaply as they’re sold. Somewhere down the line, someone is paying the price, whether it’s a garment worker barely surviving on poverty wages or a community grappling with industrial pollution.That’s not to say you can’t “get the Islander look” in a sustainable and eco-friendly way. Bravo suggests heading to secondhand shopping apps, like Depop, where you’ll find plenty of pre-loved items not dissimilar from the ones you see on the show. Some of them will be from fast fashion brands, but if you’re buying it there, you’re keeping that item in circulation as opposed to letting it wind up in landfill.\u0026nbspOr, you could take a closer look at some of the trends championed by Love Islanders, both past and present, and see that many (cycling shorts, mesh, high-waisted jeans and leopard print) hark back to another era, like, say, the 1990s. And what better way to shop Nineties fashion than by heading to your local Beyond Retro or Rokit, which will be jam-packed with original clothing from the decade that is not only more sustainable, but a hell of a lot cooler, too.How to Break Up with Fast Fashion by Lauren Bravo (£12.99, Headline Home) is out nowOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Minding the GapOne of the year’s biggest cinematic curveballs occurs at the midway point of this stirring documentary. Billed as a film about small-town US skate culture, Bing Liu’s Minding the Gap grows into a haunting depiction of class and masculinity, and how once inseparable groups of friends tend to untangle and erge as they come of age. Few of 2019’s films cast quite as long a shadow. Adam WhiteThe Farewell rips your heart out of your chest. Then it hands it back to you, wrapped gently in cotton wool. Director Lulu Wang loosely adapts a chapter in her own life, as we follow a young woman (Awkwafina) travelling back to China to say goodbye to her terminally ill grandmother. Delving into all the intricacies of immigrant identity and family politics, it’s a comedy of warmth and bracing honesty. Clarisse LoughreyAn opportunity for Jordan Peele to cement his status as one of horror’s modern maestros, Us reels us in with old-fashioned thrills. Then it leaves us with the terrible dread of realising we’ve been looking into a mirror this whole time. Lupita Nyong\u0027o delivers two of this year’s best performances in one film, both as our hero and as her sinister doppelgänger – one of an army of “Tethereds” that emerge from underground seeking vengeance. Clarisse LoughreyAll of Pedro Almodovar’s films feel autobiographical in one way or another, but Pain \u0026amp Glory couldn’t be more lived-in if he stepped out in front of the camera to introduce every scene. A lushly romantic ode to cinema, shared history and cruelly interrupted love, it features a career-best performance from Antonio Banderas – Zorro at his most tender and vulnerable. Adam WhiteVox Lux is 2019’s most damning filmic portrait of American culture. We begin with a teenage girl (Raffey Cassidy), who survives a school shooting and ends up a pop star. As an adult, she’s played by a breezy, vicious Natalie Portman. Her strut is one part Sia, two parts Lady Gaga. It’s an ugly, despairing film that comes gift-wrapped in sequins, presenting art as the cavernous pit we throw our traumas into. Clarisse Loughrey620 15. Under the Silver LakeA paranoid puzzle box of a mystery, Under the Silver Lake is far more interested in the directions down the rabbit hole than allowing star Andrew Garfield to crawl his way out of it. That’s also the most pleasurable aspect of David Robert Mitchell’s film, a sunny LA noir which is sinister, hilarious and (potentially ruinously) male. It’s probably 2019’s most polarising film, adored and reviled in equal measure, but undeniably a work of striking creative autonomy. Adam WhiteHigh Life has its silly sub-Barbarella moments (Juliette Binoche testing out the spaceship’s very own orgasmatron machine) and clearly wasn’t made on a Hollywood budget. Nonetheless, veteran French auteur Claire Denis’s first English language film is a typically provocative and subversive affair. Binoche plays Dr Dibs, a scientist on board a ship full of criminals and trying to harvest healthy foetuses. Geoffrey MacnabAd Astra is a space movie with an Oedipal undertow. Brad Pitt gives a fine, understated performance as the introspective astronaut trying to save the world and find his father at the same time. Writer-director James Gray throws in references to Heart of Darkness and Apocalypse Now. This is a slow-moving but beguiling film with an unexpected emotional kick. Geoffrey Macnab920 12. Happy as LazzaroA bee keeper’s daughter, Italian director Alice Rohrwacher is one of European cinema’s visionary young talents. Happy As Lazzaro, her best film yet, is a magical realist fable that combines hard-hitting social comment about the exploitation of rural workers with flights of astonishing lyricism. The film also has one of the best performances of the year from newcomer Adriano Tardiolo, an 18-year-old economics student who plays the holy innocent, Lazzaro, with an ingenuousness which rekindles memories of Peter Sellers in Being There. Geoffrey MacnabBased on a Haruki Murakami’s short story, Burning – from South Korean maestro Lee Chang-dong – is a meditation on dealing with isolation and the tricks being alone might play on your memory. Jong-su (Ah-in Yoo) is forced to play detective when Steven Yeun’s affluent bachelor rolls into town – an event that coincides with the disappearance of a schoolfriend. Burning is a searing drama whose central unanswered mystery unnerves long after the credits role. Jacob StolworthyNews coverage has hardly been short of harrowing, violent footage of the Syrian Civil War. But too often missing are the human moments inbetween the bombings and the bloodshed. In Waad Al-Kateab’s first person account of the uprising’s aftermath, her camera’s gaze never flinches from the horrors it sees – as she and her husband try to maintain a rebel hospital amid a reign of bombing from President al-Assad – but nor does it stop rolling while she falls in love, has a baby, and jokes around with her friends and neighbours. This is the story of ordinary people doing extraordinary things. It is an important, powerful, astonishing documentary. Alex PollardIt feels almost blasphemous to be glad of Julianne Moore stepping down from a role, but Lee Israel – the cantankerous, lonely literary forger who found herself the target of an FBI investigation in the Nineties – feels like a part Melissa McCarthy was born to play. Nimbly directed by Marielle Heller (who was shunned by the Oscars in the Best Director category), Can You Ever Forgive Me? is a sharp, funny and deeply compassionate examination of loneliness and self-destruction. Richard E Grant and Dolly Wells give wonderful supporting performances, too. Alex PollardAs deeply indebted to the teen movie genre as it is formally and narratively rebellious, Booksmart grounds its traditional night-before-graduation plot (teenagers eager to crash a party) in touching character-driven drama. Beanie Feldstein and Kaitlyn Dever, both instant stars, convey the ever-shifting dynamics and heightened dramas of adolescent best-friendship perfectly. Behind the camera, meanwhile, actor-turned-director Olivia Wilde demonstrates a staggering amount of emotional empathy and technical mastery for someone so green. Adam WhiteComparisons to Martin Scorsese’s previous films (Goodfellas, Casino) are unfounded considering The Irishman is unlike any other gangster film you’ll see. With his three-hour-30-minute-long opus, Scorsese places the harsh spotlight on mortality. Instead of tracking the rise of Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro) from regular family man to seasoned hitman with glitzy panache, we see him shamefully confess his crimes as an elderly man ruminating on his past in a nursing home. The result is an unsettlingly moving character study unafraid to ask the big questions.​Jacob Stolworthy1520 6. Once Upon a Time in HollywoodWith his ninth feature, Quentin Tarantino took a breath and crafted an unhurried, oddly heartwarming fable, one that came with a career-best performance from Brad Pitt. Its release rolled around with the usual smattering of discourse-steering controversy but, for all the complaints about the director’s depiction of his film star subjects, including the scant usage of Margot Robbie as Sharon Tate, the fact remains that Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is one of the filmmaker’s most accomplished films – a free’n’easy sun-soaked delve into Sixties Hollywood, whose much-discussed final 20 minutes provided topics of conversation all summer long. Jacob StolworthyFor too many years the internet was exclusively evil in movies, something for tech boffins to hack, or used to steal Sandra Bullock’s identity. Bo Burnham’s Eighth Grade felt so comparatively real because it felt like the real internet, which has been as toxic and terrifying as it has been helpful to a generation of young people. Elsie Fisher, as a 13-year-old girl chronicling her confidence and anxieties in a vlog, is an adorable delight here, in a film that is devastatingly, heartbreakingly and endearingly human. Adam WhiteYorgos Lanthimos’s delightful, subversive vision has shaken the cobwebs out of costume drama. Set in the 18th century, it follows a trio of women – two cousins, Sarah (Rachel Weisz) and Abigail (Emma Stone), and the ruling Queen Anne (Olivia Colman) – as they vie for power over each other and England. Desire, savagery, and manipulative vulnerability all become weapons in the hands of those who have no choice but to fight dirty. But, then, Colman’s childless, gout-ridden Queen Anne tenderly reveals her shattered soul – it’s an Academy Award-winning performance that brings a slice of tragedy to an otherwise sublime farce. Clarisse LoughreyThe marriage of disparate talents united to ensure If Beale Street Could Talk is worthy of mention alongside Barry Jenkins’ previous film, Moonlight – The Independent’s film of the decade. With his film, Jenkins takes the words of James Baldwin and translates them into visual poetry. From Nicholas Britell’s mesmerising score to Regina King’s towering supporting performance (that Oscar was well deserved), the result is a creative tour de force. Jacob StolworthyHere is a love story about orce. Noah Baumbach writes and directs this aching, empathetic depiction of a couple whose marriage has fallen apart. As ruthless orce lawyers driving a wedge between two people already hanging by a thread, Ray Liotta and Laura Dern are magnificent, while Scarlett Johansson gives her best performance in years as a woman trying to do the right thing without knowing what that is. But the real star is Adam Driver, who – hulking as he is – makes himself seem small and fragile. For his rendition of Sondheim’s “Being Alive” alone, Marriage Story deserves all the awards coming its way. Alex PollardGreta Gerwig’s adaptation of Louisa May Alcott’s 1868 novel – the story of four Massachusetts sisters coming of age during the American Civil War – may be a period piece, but there is nothing staid or stuffy about it. The girls, played by Saoirse Ronan, Florence Pugh, Emma Watson and Eliza Scanlen, talk and clamber over one another, their hair messy, their dresses scorched, their ambitions unfettered. It is a lively, profound adaptation. Alexandre Desplat provides the exuberant score, and Yorick La Saux’s cinematography is lush and textured. “I didn’t want it to be beautiful at the expense of being real,” said Gerwig. “But I did want it to feel like you wish you can jump inside and live in there or eat it. I remember trying to explain that to the gaffer, who was like, ‘You want what?’ I was like, ‘I want them to want to eat it.’” And how delicious it is. Alex Pollard120 20. Minding the GapOne of the year’s biggest cinematic curveballs occurs at the midway point of this stirring documentary. Billed as a film about small-town US skate culture, Bing Liu’s Minding the Gap grows into a haunting depiction of class and masculinity, and how once inseparable groups of friends tend to untangle and erge as they come of age. Few of 2019’s films cast quite as long a shadow. Adam WhiteThe Farewell rips your heart out of your chest. Then it hands it back to you, wrapped gently in cotton wool. Director Lulu Wang loosely adapts a chapter in her own life, as we follow a young woman (Awkwafina) travelling back to China to say goodbye to her terminally ill grandmother. Delving into all the intricacies of immigrant identity and family politics, it’s a comedy of warmth and bracing honesty. Clarisse LoughreyAn opportunity for Jordan Peele to cement his status as one of horror’s modern maestros, Us reels us in with old-fashioned thrills. Then it leaves us with the terrible dread of realising we’ve been looking into a mirror this whole time. Lupita Nyong\u0027o delivers two of this year’s best performances in one film, both as our hero and as her sinister doppelgänger – one of an army of “Tethereds” that emerge from underground seeking vengeance. Clarisse LoughreyAll of Pedro Almodovar’s films feel autobiographical in one way or another, but Pain \u0026amp Glory couldn’t be more lived-in if he stepped out in front of the camera to introduce every scene. A lushly romantic ode to cinema, shared history and cruelly interrupted love, it features a career-best performance from Antonio Banderas – Zorro at his most tender and vulnerable. Adam WhiteVox Lux is 2019’s most damning filmic portrait of American culture. We begin with a teenage girl (Raffey Cassidy), who survives a school shooting and ends up a pop star. As an adult, she’s played by a breezy, vicious Natalie Portman. Her strut is one part Sia, two parts Lady Gaga. It’s an ugly, despairing film that comes gift-wrapped in sequins, presenting art as the cavernous pit we throw our traumas into. Clarisse Loughrey620 15. Under the Silver LakeA paranoid puzzle box of a mystery, Under the Silver Lake is far more interested in the directions down the rabbit hole than allowing star Andrew Garfield to crawl his way out of it. That’s also the most pleasurable aspect of David Robert Mitchell’s film, a sunny LA noir which is sinister, hilarious and (potentially ruinously) male. It’s probably 2019’s most polarising film, adored and reviled in equal measure, but undeniably a work of striking creative autonomy. Adam WhiteHigh Life has its silly sub-Barbarella moments (Juliette Binoche testing out the spaceship’s very own orgasmatron machine) and clearly wasn’t made on a Hollywood budget.

It may have meant that users would encrypt their backups, lose their password and then get locked out of restoring their phone, for instance.But the move has come to light amid an ongoing fight between Apple and the US government, over whether the company should be forced to help break into its own phones.Something has happened to Apple\u0027s AirPods performance, users sayOfficials including Donald Trump and US\u0026nbspAttorney General William Barr have attacked Apple over their refusal to help investigators break into two iPhones\u0026nbspused by a Saudi Air Force officer who shot dead three Americans at a\u0026nbspPensacola, Florida naval base last month.Apple argues that doing so would require creating a version of the iOS software that would be inherently unsafe, and would weaken the protection on every phone. The government has suggested that would be a worthwhile compromise to provide information in investigations.Despite the criticism from US lawmakers, Apple has argued that it has provided help in the Pensacola case, rejecting the idea it has not provided substantive assistance.

When you consider that the overall market is thought to have shrunk by maybe 3 per cent, combined with the negative impact of the government’s Brexit brinkmanship and general mess making, that’s quite impressive.\u0026nbspAs well as those smart speakers, the company did well with supersize TVs, wearables (Airpods, Fitbits etc), and flashy hairdryers.

With interest rates near to historical lows, there is little to be gained from further rate cuts.

The fork of bitcoin\u0027s underlying blockchain technology spawned a new cryptocurrency: Bitcoin cashTowards the end of 2017, the price of bitcoin surged to almost $20,000.

Intu banked €237.7m (£202m) from the deal as a part owner.The amount Intu hopes to raise from shareholders remains unclear, although reports in the Sunday Times put the figure at up to £1bn.Intu shareholder and billionaire businessman John Whittaker, who has a 27 per cent stake, is said to be in favour of the plan, according to the newspaper.Commercial property owners, particularly in retail, have suffered in recent years as several big name brands either went into administration or pushed through an insolvency process known as a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) to reduce rents.In November last year, Intu already warned that rental income in 2019 is likely to fall by 9 per cent, with more than half the decline coming from Arcadia and Monsoon using CVAs.Bosses said rent in 2020 is also expected to drop, but at a slower rate than 2019, and added that the political and economic uncertainty is putting off current tenants from signing up to new lettings.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Minding the GapOne of the year’s biggest cinematic curveballs occurs at the midway point of this stirring documentary. Billed as a film about small-town US skate culture, Bing Liu’s Minding the Gap grows into a haunting depiction of class and masculinity, and how once inseparable groups of friends tend to untangle and erge as they come of age. Few of 2019’s films cast quite as long a shadow. Adam WhiteThe Farewell rips your heart out of your chest. Then it hands it back to you, wrapped gently in cotton wool. Director Lulu Wang loosely adapts a chapter in her own life, as we follow a young woman (Awkwafina) travelling back to China to say goodbye to her terminally ill grandmother. Delving into all the intricacies of immigrant identity and family politics, it’s a comedy of warmth and bracing honesty. Clarisse LoughreyAn opportunity for Jordan Peele to cement his status as one of horror’s modern maestros, Us reels us in with old-fashioned thrills. Then it leaves us with the terrible dread of realising we’ve been looking into a mirror this whole time. Lupita Nyong\u0027o delivers two of this year’s best performances in one film, both as our hero and as her sinister doppelgänger – one of an army of “Tethereds” that emerge from underground seeking vengeance. Clarisse LoughreyAll of Pedro Almodovar’s films feel autobiographical in one way or another, but Pain \u0026amp Glory couldn’t be more lived-in if he stepped out in front of the camera to introduce every scene. A lushly romantic ode to cinema, shared history and cruelly interrupted love, it features a career-best performance from Antonio Banderas – Zorro at his most tender and vulnerable. Adam WhiteVox Lux is 2019’s most damning filmic portrait of American culture. We begin with a teenage girl (Raffey Cassidy), who survives a school shooting and ends up a pop star. As an adult, she’s played by a breezy, vicious Natalie Portman. Her strut is one part Sia, two parts Lady Gaga. It’s an ugly, despairing film that comes gift-wrapped in sequins, presenting art as the cavernous pit we throw our traumas into. Clarisse Loughrey620 15. Under the Silver LakeA paranoid puzzle box of a mystery, Under the Silver Lake is far more interested in the directions down the rabbit hole than allowing star Andrew Garfield to crawl his way out of it. That’s also the most pleasurable aspect of David Robert Mitchell’s film, a sunny LA noir which is sinister, hilarious and (potentially ruinously) male. It’s probably 2019’s most polarising film, adored and reviled in equal measure, but undeniably a work of striking creative autonomy. Adam WhiteHigh Life has its silly sub-Barbarella moments (Juliette Binoche testing out the spaceship’s very own orgasmatron machine) and clearly wasn’t made on a Hollywood budget. Nonetheless, veteran French auteur Claire Denis’s first English language film is a typically provocative and subversive affair. Binoche plays Dr Dibs, a scientist on board a ship full of criminals and trying to harvest healthy foetuses. Geoffrey MacnabAd Astra is a space movie with an Oedipal undertow. Brad Pitt gives a fine, understated performance as the introspective astronaut trying to save the world and find his father at the same time. Writer-director James Gray throws in references to Heart of Darkness and Apocalypse Now. This is a slow-moving but beguiling film with an unexpected emotional kick. Geoffrey Macnab920 12. Happy as LazzaroA bee keeper’s daughter, Italian director Alice Rohrwacher is one of European cinema’s visionary young talents. Happy As Lazzaro, her best film yet, is a magical realist fable that combines hard-hitting social comment about the exploitation of rural workers with flights of astonishing lyricism. The film also has one of the best performances of the year from newcomer Adriano Tardiolo, an 18-year-old economics student who plays the holy innocent, Lazzaro, with an ingenuousness which rekindles memories of Peter Sellers in Being There. Geoffrey MacnabBased on a Haruki Murakami’s short story, Burning – from South Korean maestro Lee Chang-dong – is a meditation on dealing with isolation and the tricks being alone might play on your memory. Jong-su (Ah-in Yoo) is forced to play detective when Steven Yeun’s affluent bachelor rolls into town – an event that coincides with the disappearance of a schoolfriend. Burning is a searing drama whose central unanswered mystery unnerves long after the credits role. Jacob StolworthyNews coverage has hardly been short of harrowing, violent footage of the Syrian Civil War. But too often missing are the human moments inbetween the bombings and the bloodshed. In Waad Al-Kateab’s first person account of the uprising’s aftermath, her camera’s gaze never flinches from the horrors it sees – as she and her husband try to maintain a rebel hospital amid a reign of bombing from President al-Assad – but nor does it stop rolling while she falls in love, has a baby, and jokes around with her friends and neighbours. This is the story of ordinary people doing extraordinary things. It is an important, powerful, astonishing documentary. Alex PollardIt feels almost blasphemous to be glad of Julianne Moore stepping down from a role, but Lee Israel – the cantankerous, lonely literary forger who found herself the target of an FBI investigation in the Nineties – feels like a part Melissa McCarthy was born to play. Nimbly directed by Marielle Heller (who was shunned by the Oscars in the Best Director category), Can You Ever Forgive Me? is a sharp, funny and deeply compassionate examination of loneliness and self-destruction. Richard E Grant and Dolly Wells give wonderful supporting performances, too. Alex PollardAs deeply indebted to the teen movie genre as it is formally and narratively rebellious, Booksmart grounds its traditional night-before-graduation plot (teenagers eager to crash a party) in touching character-driven drama. Beanie Feldstein and Kaitlyn Dever, both instant stars, convey the ever-shifting dynamics and heightened dramas of adolescent best-friendship perfectly. Behind the camera, meanwhile, actor-turned-director Olivia Wilde demonstrates a staggering amount of emotional empathy and technical mastery for someone so green. Adam WhiteComparisons to Martin Scorsese’s previous films (Goodfellas, Casino) are unfounded considering The Irishman is unlike any other gangster film you’ll see. With his three-hour-30-minute-long opus, Scorsese places the harsh spotlight on mortality. Instead of tracking the rise of Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro) from regular family man to seasoned hitman with glitzy panache, we see him shamefully confess his crimes as an elderly man ruminating on his past in a nursing home. The result is an unsettlingly moving character study unafraid to ask the big questions.​Jacob Stolworthy1520 6. Once Upon a Time in HollywoodWith his ninth feature, Quentin Tarantino took a breath and crafted an unhurried, oddly heartwarming fable, one that came with a career-best performance from Brad Pitt. Its release rolled around with the usual smattering of discourse-steering controversy but, for all the complaints about the director’s depiction of his film star subjects, including the scant usage of Margot Robbie as Sharon Tate, the fact remains that Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is one of the filmmaker’s most accomplished films – a free’n’easy sun-soaked delve into Sixties Hollywood, whose much-discussed final 20 minutes provided topics of conversation all summer long. Jacob StolworthyFor too many years the internet was exclusively evil in movies, something for tech boffins to hack, or used to steal Sandra Bullock’s identity. Bo Burnham’s Eighth Grade felt so comparatively real because it felt like the real internet, which has been as toxic and terrifying as it has been helpful to a generation of young people. Elsie Fisher, as a 13-year-old girl chronicling her confidence and anxieties in a vlog, is an adorable delight here, in a film that is devastatingly, heartbreakingly and endearingly human. Adam WhiteYorgos Lanthimos’s delightful, subversive vision has shaken the cobwebs out of costume drama. Set in the 18th century, it follows a trio of women – two cousins, Sarah (Rachel Weisz) and Abigail (Emma Stone), and the ruling Queen Anne (Olivia Colman) – as they vie for power over each other and England. Desire, savagery, and manipulative vulnerability all become weapons in the hands of those who have no choice but to fight dirty. But, then, Colman’s childless, gout-ridden Queen Anne tenderly reveals her shattered soul – it’s an Academy Award-winning performance that brings a slice of tragedy to an otherwise sublime farce. Clarisse LoughreyThe marriage of disparate talents united to ensure If Beale Street Could Talk is worthy of mention alongside Barry Jenkins’ previous film, Moonlight – The Independent’s film of the decade. With his film, Jenkins takes the words of James Baldwin and translates them into visual poetry. From Nicholas Britell’s mesmerising score to Regina King’s towering supporting performance (that Oscar was well deserved), the result is a creative tour de force. Jacob StolworthyHere is a love story about orce. Noah Baumbach writes and directs this aching, empathetic depiction of a couple whose marriage has fallen apart. As ruthless orce lawyers driving a wedge between two people already hanging by a thread, Ray Liotta and Laura Dern are magnificent, while Scarlett Johansson gives her best performance in years as a woman trying to do the right thing without knowing what that is. But the real star is Adam Driver, who – hulking as he is – makes himself seem small and fragile. For his rendition of Sondheim’s “Being Alive” alone, Marriage Story deserves all the awards coming its way. Alex PollardGreta Gerwig’s adaptation of Louisa May Alcott’s 1868 novel – the story of four Massachusetts sisters coming of age during the American Civil War – may be a period piece, but there is nothing staid or stuffy about it. The girls, played by Saoirse Ronan, Florence Pugh, Emma Watson and Eliza Scanlen, talk and clamber over one another, their hair messy, their dresses scorched, their ambitions unfettered. It is a lively, profound adaptation. Alexandre Desplat provides the exuberant score, and Yorick La Saux’s cinematography is lush and textured. “I didn’t want it to be beautiful at the expense of being real,” said Gerwig. “But I did want it to feel like you wish you can jump inside and live in there or eat it. I remember trying to explain that to the gaffer, who was like, ‘You want what?’ I was like, ‘I want them to want to eat it.’” And how delicious it is. Alex Pollard120 20.

With his film, Jenkins takes the words of James Baldwin and translates them into visual poetry. From Nicholas Britell’s mesmerising score to Regina King’s towering supporting performance (that Oscar was well deserved), the result is a creative tour de force. Jacob StolworthyHere is a love story about orce. Noah Baumbach writes and directs this aching, empathetic depiction of a couple whose marriage has fallen apart. As ruthless orce lawyers driving a wedge between two people already hanging by a thread, Ray Liotta and Laura Dern are magnificent, while Scarlett Johansson gives her best performance in years as a woman trying to do the right thing without knowing what that is. But the real star is Adam Driver, who – hulking as he is – makes himself seem small and fragile. For his rendition of Sondheim’s “Being Alive” alone, Marriage Story deserves all the awards coming its way. Alex PollardGreta Gerwig’s adaptation of Louisa May Alcott’s 1868 novel – the story of four Massachusetts sisters coming of age during the American Civil War – may be a period piece, but there is nothing staid or stuffy about it. The girls, played by Saoirse Ronan, Florence Pugh, Emma Watson and Eliza Scanlen, talk and clamber over one another, their hair messy, their dresses scorched, their ambitions unfettered. It is a lively, profound adaptation. Alexandre Desplat provides the exuberant score, and Yorick La Saux’s cinematography is lush and textured. “I didn’t want it to be beautiful at the expense of being real,” said Gerwig. “But I did want it to feel like you wish you can jump inside and live in there or eat it. I remember trying to explain that to the gaffer, who was like, ‘You want what?’ I was like, ‘I want them to want to eat it.’” And how delicious it is.

But the impact craters they would have come out of could not be identified.Now scientists say they have precisely dated the\u0026nbspYarrabubba crater, giving a specific age for the impact structure long regarded as one of the world\u0027s oldest.The meteorite hit the Earth 2.229 billion years ago, give or take five million years, the researchers said.Crater from one of the largest meteorites to hit Earth ‘discovered\u0027At that time, in the same region, glaciers would have been forming and the Earth was largely covered in ice. Simulations suggest that if the meteorite that formed the crater hit a continental ice sheet, it would have thrown as much as\u0026nbsp5,000 trillion kilograms of water vapour up into the atmosphereThat could have fundamentally changed the Earth\u0027s climate, the scientists note. It might even have created a greenhouse effect that brought an end to the period known as Snowball Earth that covered our planet when the meteorite arrived.“Yarrabubba, which sits between Sandstone and Meekatharra in central WA, had been recognised as an impact structure for many years, but its age wasn’t well determined,” said\u0026nbspCurtin University\u0027s Chris Kirkland, one of the authors of the study.“Now we know the Yarrabubba crater was made right at the end of what’s commonly referred to as the early Snowball Earth – a time when the atmosphere and oceans were evolving and becoming more oxygenated and when rocks deposited on many continents recorded glacial conditions”.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Last year, TikTok overtook Instagram to become the fourth most-downloaded app – beaten only by Facebook, Messenger and WhatsApp.Since it launched in 2016, TikTok has been downloaded more than 1.5 billion times through Google Play and Apple’s App Store, according to figures from app analytics firm Sensor Tower.Instagram has recently made attempts to be less focussed on status, such as hiding the amount of likes a post receives.It also launched a new tool called Reels that borrows some of TikTok\u0027s most popular features​, including the ability to create 15-second music videos. The feature is currently only available in Brazil but will roll out more widely if it proves to be popular.Mark Zuckerberg’s secret plan to crush TikTokFacebook\u0027s concern about the rising popularity of TikTok was outlined in a recently leaked staff meeting, during which CEO Mark Zuckerberg outlined his plan of attack for taking on its new rival.“I think we have time to learn and understand and get ahead of the trend,” he said. “The space is still fairly nascent, and there’s time for us to kind of figure out what we want to do here.”Facebook and Instagram have\u0026nbspconsistently been accused of borrowing features from rival apps, including self-destructing messages that were made famous by Snapchat.Mr Spiegel addressed these claims in 2018, saying that the social media giant should also consider copying Snapchat\u0027s stance on user privacy.He said: We would really appreciate it if they copied our data protection practices also.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Meanwhile, employment far outstripped expectations, hitting an all-time high of 76.3 per cent.The news has thrown uncertainty into the works, as the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), which sets the rates, is due to meet next week.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIt had been widely expected to cut the interest rate, but the new data could give members pause for thought, experts said.“The continued resilience of the labour market increases the chances that the MPC will take a rain check next week, instead of cutting bank rate immediately,” said Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.Created with Sketch.

With interest rates near to historical lows, there is little to be gained from further rate cuts. Instead the focus should be on using the upcoming Budget to support firms looking to recruit and grow their business,” said Mr Thiru.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Even allowing for employment being a lagging indicator and the data being helped by a weak August performance dropping out of the calculation, a jump of 208,000 in the number employed looks remarkable,” he said.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

What’s more, Mr Biden is 77. It is time for him to pass the torch to a new generation of political leaders,” the editorial board wrote.The former vice president has led national polls for almost the entirety of the Democratic primary campaign so far and holds a lead of eight percentage points over his nearest rival, senator Bernie Sanders, according to analysis by RealClearPolitics.Mr Biden is currently battling to win the influential Iowa caucus on 3 February —\u0026nbspthe first major contest of the Democratic primary.Current polling averages in the state put him ahead in a tight race, in which Mr Sanders, Ms Warren and South Bend, Indiana mayor Pete Buttigieg are all in contention.However, Mr Biden will have Iowa almost completely to himself for campaigning in the coming days as several of his top rivals have been forced to go to Washington to participate in the impeachment trial of Donald Trump.Mr Sanders, Ms Warren and Ms Klobuchar will all take part in the Senate trial, which will judge whether Mr Trump should be removed from office over charges stemming from his alleged efforts to pressure Ukraine into declaring a public investigation into Mr Biden and his son Hunter.The president’s alleged efforts are based on discredited claims of corruption against Mr Biden’s son during his time working for a Ukrainian energy company.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The varied landscapes and lives of residents wedged in these borderlands speak of two different systems that have coexisted on one another’s doorstep.Far from the marches and salvos of tear gas and petrol bombs over the past half-year of anti-government protests that have convulsed Hong Kong, the residents in this border realm have borne witness to both rapid urbanisation, as China booms, and the preservation of a slower pace of life.About 20 miles\u0026nbsplong, this boundary meanders between fish ponds, farmland, sleepy traditional villages and grassy hills on the Hong Kong side, with the gleaming skyscrapers of China’s high-tech city of Shenzhen on the other. Shenzhen, once itself the bucolic backwater, has risen into China’s giddy vision of a digital, high-tech future.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHong Kong is world’s most visited city in 2019We may have won the elections battle, but the war is ongoingHong Kong police ‘hack into more than 3,700 mobile phones’Mr\u0026nbspLam, now in his eighties, lives in a house without mobile phone reception, where he farms and catches crabs. A narrow sliver of water separates him from mainland China. He recalls living in a wooden cabin along the Shenzhen River\u0026nbspwith his family 70 years ago. There were only “old and broken” sheds on the far shore back then, he says, gazing into the distance. “Of course, the mainland is much more advanced than before. Everything is good, even the streets are beautiful.”Over past decades of political upheaval in communist China, waves of mainlanders flooded across the border into Hong Kong, seeking peace and a better life. Lam still remembers the flashlights of the British-run police piercing the dark as they chased illegal immigrants making a dash for freedom.Andrew Kwok, an old fish farmer living in the area, recalls those who drowned making the perilous crossing. “There were a lot of them, hundreds of dead bodies in the river,” he says.The flickering, lonely torches have now been replaced by a vibrant mega-city with a million flashing lights. The living quality for people on both sides may have converged, but a gulf remains. For these two peoples, it remains a struggle to reconcile shifting eras, values and dreams.Merrin Ke, 23, grew up in Shenzhen but got her masters degree from Hong Kong’s Polytechnic University. She had flitted easily between both sides, up until recently, when she moved to Shanghai. “I think the situation in Hong Kong is quite sensitive now, which is easy for people to have conflicts due to different political stands,” she says. “That’s why I’ve decided to leave Hong Kong to work and get away from the intense environment.”Even though the protests in Hong Kong show no sign of abating, Ke remains optimistic unity will overcome ision. She says: “Hong Kong people used to come to have fun in Shenzhen and people from mainland China also liked to visit Hong Kong. But now such things are becoming less and less. I still hope everyone can put differences aside, and it’s not enough for just one side to do this. It requires the joint efforts of both sides.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

For the Walloon government, it is no!” Mr Di Rupo, a centre-left social democrat told Belgian broadcaster RTBF.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWallonia, which under the Belgian constitution gets to sign off any trade deals the national government does, notoriously rejected and held up the EU-Canada trade deal CETA after its parliament voted against it, only later relenting when concessions were made.Mr Di Rupo said Wallonia, which is Belgium’s largely French-speaking region, would not accept the EU-Merosur deal unless South American producers were made to sign up to EU rules – as the bloc is asking Britain to do.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch. Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.“We are for international trade but not under any conditions. We want environmental, social\u0026nbspand health compliance criteria, valid at European level and in Belgium, to apply also to these countries,” he said.The regional leader in particular raised objections to regulations on the meat imports. Britain hopes to secure a simultaneous trade deal with the US while it negotiates with the EU, and food exports are one of the main asks of American trade negotiators. The issue is likely to become a sticking point in UK-EU talks if Britain wishes to keep its markets open to American beef.“There will be chemicals and antibiotics, while our European rules are strict. We ask that the rules, in the Mercosur countries, be the same as the European rules,” Mr Di\u0026nbspRupo said. “We have our objectives, our realities, and we want to defend Walloon beef.”In the case of the Canada agreement, Wallonia only agreed to the deal after stronger safeguards on labour, environmental and consumer standards were offered.Full Brexit trade deal by end of year ‘just not possible’, EU saysBoris Johnson’s Brexit trade deal will end frictionless trade, EU saysEU trade deals that cover policy areas not solely reserved to Brussels have to be voted on by national parliaments, and sometimes regional parliaments, depending on the constitution of each member state.\u0026nbspThese “mixed” deals can be a political minefield because each country and region has its own producer interests to think of before signing.\u0026nbspThe more substantial a trade deal is, the more likely it is to cross beyond EU competencies and require signatures by inidual member states. Deals that involve cross-border trade in services – as the UK has said it wants – are very likely to be mixed agreements and therefore subject to national parliaments’ votes.Boris Johnson has vowed to secure a trade deal with the EU by the end of 2020\u0026nbspand said he will not extend the Brexit transition period beyond 31 December this year. If no deal is secured by the end of the transition the UK will face major trade barriers and have to trade on WTO rules with the EU.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

She later supported fellow Manchester MP Andy Burnham in the  Labour leadership race - a contest eventually won by Jeremy Corbyn.Under Mr Corbyn, Ms Nandy initially stayed in the shadow cabinet as an energy spokeswoman, but in the wake of the EU referendum she became one of a large group of shadow cabinet ministers to resign in protest at his leadership.Explaining her decision she said Mr Corbyn was unable to form a broad, inclusive shadow cabinet that draws on the best of our movements left and right traditions.Emily Thornberry is one of Jeremy Corbyns closest parliamentary allies and is not running to replace him as the Labour leader.The shadow foreign secretary and MP for Islington South and Finsbury is a frequent critic of the Governments Brexit strategy and is married to a High Court judge.Her political career began in  when she was elected with a small majority of .She was ed as MP with an increased majority in  and was promptly promoted to the Shadow Cabinet.However she resigned from Ed Milibands team in  amid accusations of snobbery.The -year-old made ato the front bench in September  after Jeremy Corbyn appointed her shadow employment minister.One of Corbyns closest allies in Parliament, Thornberry has since covered foreign affairs and defence.On December , Thornberry became the first candidate to confirm they want to replace Jeremy Corbyn.Jess Phillips was in the running to become the next Labour leader but has now dropped out of the contest.The MP said in a statement she was dropping out because she cannot unite a party.She said: In order to do that, The Labour party will need to select a candidate who can unite all parts of our movement, the union movement, members and elected representatives.And I have to also be honest with myself, as I said I always would be throughout this campaign.At this time, that person is not me.In order to win the country, we are going to have to find a candidate, in this race, who can do all of that, and then take that message out to the country.A message of hope and change, that things can be better.Applications have opened for the public to become registered supporters of Labour and thereby eligible to vote in the party’s leadership elections.The -hour window for registering as a supporter closes on the th of January.The ballot will open on  February, with the next Labour leader set to come into office by March.Jeremy Corbyn said he would stay in place while the party decides who will take the crown.There is no deputy leader to fill the position after Tom Watson stood down as MP earlier this year.The stakes are high for the party after Corbyns failure to secure dozens of safe seats across the country and the alienation and disillusionment of many voters.A new leader will aim to claw back Labours losses following the  December election.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But not necessarily £.million.So Harry is doing the right and ­honourable thing.The title HRH is an automatic one for someone with Royal blood.Even when Edward VIII abdicated he dropped from being His Majesty The King to HRH the Duke of Windsor.Diana, Princess of Wales and Sarah Ferguson lost theirs because their courtesy titles were obtained through marriage. They were not born royal. But what is also notable is that it won’t stop the Americans using the titlethey wish to.When Edward married Wallis ­Simpson she didn’t get an HRH yet she was still sometimes referred to in America as HRH.I’m not saying it will happen on this occasion but it is possible as it sits quite nicely with Duke and Duchess.Harry is not using his HRH  because it would be a conflict of interest should he decide to embark on ­commercial enterprises.Harry knows full well that it is wrong to trade on your name.I don’t think not using it will have an impact. It didn’t affect Diana’s global appeal one bit. And Fergie had less of a profile but still made money.The Queen is pragmatic. She will be sad, too. She is very sensitive to Harry and his needs. She was there for him and William when their mother was killed in the car crash.She understands and she wants the best for her grandson, his we and her great-grandson.She has come to an accord that works for both sides and that is what is important to her.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If anything, our scoop simply sped up the process.Royal commentators trumpeting Saturday night’s declaration as a total victory for the Queen are somewhat missing the point – Harry and Meghan are DELIGHTED with this result too.With a few marked concessionsthey’ve got exactly what they wanted: The ability to make millions and millions without royal oversight, to spend as much time as they want in Hollywood and to avoid any duty in the UK.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She should have asked herselfshe was willing and able to behave in accordance with the expectations.Her Majesty’s words show great diplomacy but Meghan’s behaviour has so far not been diplomatic. A diplomat wouldn’t fall out with her own family.Her friends leaked negative comments about the “toxic” Royal Family. She also allowed damage to be done against our family via friends and PR advisers.She watched the media taunt and torture my dad, never springing to his defence like a true humanitarian would.Thomas was an incredible dad. He paid every penny of her education and cared greatly for her.He is now frail, with a heart condition. He doesn’t have a PR team to spin him a good story.The Queen, at , shouldn’t have had to face the stress of seeing her family torn apart.Meghan hasn’t stepped forward to minimise the damage.She knows how Harry leaving has affected them, but she hasn’t spoken up in their defence.Yet in her statement, the Queen says she is “particularly proud of how Meghan has so quickly become one of the family”.Her Majesty is building bridges there. It would be goodMeghan could do the same.She could have expressed her thanks for the kindness of the Queen and Prince Charles.She could have expressed gratitude to her own father or her first husband, Trevor, who gave her career opportunities.My sister has become a totally dferent person, choosing wealth and fortune over family.Her decision to leave is nothing to do with the behaviour of the royals, or race.Her marriage to Prince Harry was so symbolic of ethnic unity.The preacher and choir were all of African heritage. It was a lovely joining together.The royals embraced that. They welcomed Meghan into their lives, into the culture, and allowed her to promote people of all races. I have never heard anything racist coming out of the Windsors about my sister.Supporters who claim a racist element forced Meghan out are frustrated their hoped-for fairytale princess didn’t work out.These social equality-obsessed people had pinned their hopes on Meghan. They hoped for an equality of race right at the higher echelons of society.At least Harry and Meghan were right to decide tothe £.million they received to renovate Frogmore Cottage and not take any more public funds.In the Queen’s statement, she hopes Meghan and Harry can “start building a happy and peaceful le”. We have to hope for the sake of my sister and for the Royal Family that this agreement achieves that aim.My fear is Meghan’s decision isn’t about moving to Canada for a quiet le as a young mother.Nothing about their actions so far suggest they truly desire a private le out the limelight.They have paraded themselves on the red carpet, tried to make deals with Disney, and become pals with the Clooneys and other A-list stars.Smooching up to Vogue magazine, to fashion and to the film industry is not consistent with taking a step back.Their objective is fame and fortune — to be Hollywood.Meghan’s goals are not consistent with those of the Royal Family. Personally, I don’t believe she ever expected to fit in with the strict structures and traditions of the Windsor household.Even after marrying she kept her lawyer and publicity adviser, suggesting she wasn’t willing to sever her ties with her old le.Perhaps she always had the idea toto her le as an actress and lestyle influencer.In the statement from Buckingham Palace, it says “the Sussexes have made clear everything they do will continue to uphold the values of Her Majesty”.My concern is that this is a face-saving statement, which won’t work in reality. The Royal Family has always been opposed to merchandising and corporate endeavours outside of them.If Meghan and Harry want to honour the Queen, they will consult her before doing deals.She thinks she can be at the top of the world, but using the royals to get that international notoriety is tacky.Meghan was a cable TV actress before marrying Harry and would not be on the front of every newspaper and magazine without him.In the US, the Press is still positive, praising her attempts to modernise the British monarchy and saying how cool she is.The media in Calornia and New York are likely to remain in her corner but I don’t think Meghan and Harry will ever be able to overshadow Prince William and his we Catherine.They are exemplary they are iconic. There is no comparison.It is clear Meghan cares for Archie, but I do worry about his future. There doesn’t seem to have been a lot of consideration given to his cousins George, Charlotte and Louis and how often he will see them. Harry has put Meghan above his brother, father and grandmother. A house ided cannot stand.I am worried that Meghan and Harry will never find true ­happiness. They could not find contentment with the Royal Family, will they be able to find it away from them Maybe they will meet up with counsellors who can help them to heal the wounds.Perhaps they will make amends by apologising.We need sincerity and dignity from Meghan in order to find peace. Then, perhaps, she will have the peace she needs to go forward.I loved my sister, but I do not like the person she has become.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We like — we love — our Queen here in Britain.But we are not prepared to pay the way for her multi-millionaire grandson — £million inheritance from his mum and £million from the Queen Mum —he no longer wishes to be a full-time royal.There is no royal halfway house — no one foot in, one foot out — as Her Majesty has rightly agreed.So yes, we want back the £.million we spent on the renovations of a “cottage” which he will seldom live in. So far, so good.But there are problems with this deal, some of which may well come back to bite Buckingham ­Palace and its push for a “hard Megxit”.Harry, a -year-old married father, is still taking money from his dad’s Duchy of Cornwall estate, despite his stated desire to live a financially independent le. This turbo-charged pocket money amounts to over £million a year at present.Traditionally, the sons of the heirs to the throne rely on the Duchy to fund their lives while they go about their royal duties, but without those duties Harry no longer needs to rely on the Bank of Dad.If the Prince of Wales chooses to fund his son and Meghan, it is his choice. But he will only do it in an attempt to maintain some necessary control over their expenditure. This is problematic for free-spirited Harry — and Charles, who will almost certainly not approve of everything this money is spent on.Sure, Harry and Meghan can make millions of dollars by lending their names to commercial ventures. But the Buckingham Palace statement says: “The Sussexes have made clear everything they do will continue to uphold the values of Her Majesty.” What an alarmingly vague and woolly line.We can take a stab at what these values are — ask any good Christian. But how do they relate to commercial deals with huge American corporations For example, Harry has been touting Meghan for voiceover work with Disney.But which characters are brand-safe  Presumably Cruella de Vil is off limits And what about interviews  A big- money sit-down with a US network — their pal Oprah Winfrey would surely be first in line — would net a huge fee. But what can they say and still uphold the Queen’s values The world is interested in Meghan and Harry’s touchy-feely philanthropic endeavours, but what they really want is the juice. What’s it really like in the Royal Family  How they approach this is crucial.Arguably, they should never discuss the “family” on TV — the Queen does not. If they write books, it should not be about their personal experiences within the “family”. And any products from their brand should be unrelated to the Royal Family.If their money-making ventures are focused on the charities they support, they will be fine. Their new foundation could make them millions but while doing so make millions for their charities, too. This is how they could get away with it. But will this be enough for the ambitious Meghan  I somehow doubt it.However nice Her Majesty appears to be, she has given up her le and much of her personal happiness to do her duty and it is a new world for her to see her grandson no longer feels capable of doing the same — albeit in a much smaller way — himself.While incredibly astute, the deal is not what the Queen wanted. She would have preferred to keep them within the royal fold, but she does not want another Diana disaster. Diana knew the system was not hers to change, and it is not Harry and Meghan’s either. It belongs to the Queen.She tried to accommodate Diana within it. What the Queen could not do was to restructure the monarchy to suit her daughter-in-law. As she now can’t reconstruct the monarchy for her grandson and his we. So, she has asked them to step away.The last thing the Queen wanted was for it to look asthe Duke and Duchess of Sussex had been thrown out of the royal fold. Archie Mountbatten Windsor is her and Prince Philip’s eighth great-grandchild. His future is important to them as it might also embody a small part of the future of a modern monarchy. But how much of a royal this soon-to-be largely Canadian-bred lad will ever be remains to be seen. Not much, is the best bet.The Sussexes have what they want. They don’t want to be criticised for taking monies from the British taxpayer. They don’t want to be seen as taking advantage of the Queen’s kindness. And whatever other members of the Royal Family might think of them, and be disappointed by them, Harry is the son of the future King.So Her Majesty has accommodated them. It is now up to them to show their loyalty to her.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He warned the Left’s obsession is providing a cloak for crime.The Sussexes’ decision to quit was “not racism”, he told a cheering crowd. “We’re the most tolerant, lovely country in Europe.”Signicantly, the applause came not from the far Right but from right-on BBC Question Time — an audience carefully chosen, stressed presenter Fiona Bruce, to reflect Britain by age, sex and politics.Fox — famous as DS James Hathaway in TV’s Lewis — was instantly denounced as a “privileged white male” and therefore with no right to an opinion.“Oh, God!” he cried. “I can’t help what I am, I was born like this. It’s an immutable characteristic, so to call me a white privileged male is to be racist.”His landmark moment went viral.Ricky Gervais spoke for the silent majority when he told the Golden Globes nominees “who know nothing about the real world” to tear up their political speeches.But it took the furore over Megxit — and Fox’s unanswerable case for the defence — to trigger Britain’s own fightback.Fox has given a voice to ordinary, decent citizens who are incensed by finger-wagging know-alls smearing them as racists, Nazis and fascists.These ugly insults were hurled at millions who backed Brexit and the overwhelming majority who voted for Boris Johnson.Until now we’ve been too polite to fight back, gagged by Thought Police who bark: “You can’t say that.”So we put up with politically correct sniping from such “identity” obsessives as rapper Stormzy, MP Clive Lewis and the entire Labour Party, who smell racism under every rock.Good Morning Britain host Piers Morgan sparked uproar when he challenged black and Asian commentators to produce a “shred of evidence” of Press racism. They failed.Fox’s one-man mission is more than a poke at the PC brigade. It is about free speech — and hypocrisy.Scattergun charges of racism offer an alibi to serious crime, he says, citing the Pakistani sex gangs who systematically raped and trafficked white victims across Britain — with police blessing.“It’s one of the dangerous things about throwing racism around,” the actor told Question Time.“People become so conscious of it that things like the Manchester grooming scandal get ignored.”He spoke as police finally confessed to deliberately turning a blind eye to decades-long vile abuse of vulnerable, underage white girls.A police report confirms a -year reign of sex abuse went unchecked after an unnamed chief inspector ruled: “With it being Asians, we can’t afford for this to be coming out.”Fear of the race card also partly explains why police failed to halt the slaughter of mostly black victims by mostly black kne gangs.The same “cultural cringe” stops prison staff tackling dangerous Islamist gangs who have seized control in Britain’s terror jails.It’s why forced marriage and honour killings go unchecked.Now, at last, black and Asian voices are bravely confronting the race zealots.Leading commentator and ex-Equality Commissioner Trevor Phillips, son of poor immigrants, condemns “feel- good” racism detectorists.“It might make ‘right-on’ white liberals feel better,” he says. “But the price of their smugness is an ongoing bloody massacre of black children.”Home Secretary Priti Patel, daughter of Uganda-Indian migrants, has declared war on the race industry.The BBC strenuously denies “institutional bias”, despite abundant evidence from within the Beeb itself – including from former Director-General Mark Thompson.Now Boris Johnson is in power and the bloated corporation’s £BILLION subsidy is at risk.Perhaps that’s why Question Time is now apparently balanced, Andrew Marr is being polite to Tory guests and on Radio ’s Today, Nick Robinson has gone almost silent.“We live in a great country, a land of opportunity for all,” she said. “Institutionalised, corrosive behaviour that disregards victims has to end.“Tackling this abuse is a priority for the Home Office. There will be no no-go areas.”At last, perhaps, we have a senior politician of colour who is prepared to follow Laurence Fox’s advice and “speak truth to nonsense”.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

No Sussex titles to trademark. And no funding of their police guards.If those terms of abdication are proposed and accepted, then we, along with most reasonable British people, will wish Harry and Meghan Wales every happiness in beginning their new lives.A PEERAGE for any one of John Bercow, Karie Murphy or Tom Watson — let alone all three — would be a grotesque insult to the British people.Brexit-blocking former Speaker Bercow stands accused of bullying Commons staff.Murphy, Jeremy Corbyn’s bag-carrier, is being investigated by the Equality and Human Rights Commission for allowing anti-Semitism to fester in the Labour Party.And Jezza’s slippery ex-deputy Watson egged on the bungled VIP paedo ring investigation that ruined innocent people’s lives — and cost the taxpayer upwards of £million.The Lords was meant to be a crucial chamber where the wisest in the land could check and amend legislation.But it has mortally damaged its reputation by spending three years trying to thwart Brexit, the biggest democratic mandate in our history.If it now adds any of this trio of scandal-drenched Corbyn nominees to its already bloated ranks, then frankly, it is done for.Boris Johnson is said to be considering moving the House of Lords up to York.If Bercow, Murphy or Watson are to be anywhere near it, we’d rather relocate it to outer Siberia. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

On the contrary, it is an abdication that has sadly plunged him into turmoil.He is a man pulled in opposite directions, torn between patriotic duty and his deep love for his we, between his loyalty to the monarchy and his desire for a new, less constrained role.That explains why, throughout the recent crisis that he and Meghan inflicted on the House of Windsor, his stance has been so confused and contradictory.He speaks of his devotion to Britain but seeks a fresh start in Canada.He expresses his desire to serve but gives up the commitments that go with his position.He trumpets his yearning for privacy, yet he and his we appear keen to set themselves up as a millionaire celebrity couple - hardly the way to avoid attention.He continually wails about media intrusion, yet he resigns as Captain-General of the Royal Marines so he can spend more time on his social media accounts.He and the Duchess endlessly talk about their need for emotional support, yet they have shown little concern for the needs of their own families.Those inconsistencies were graphically exposed in the speech he made on Sunday night at a charity dinner in London to try and justy his recent conduct.His address was given in the immediate aftermath of the deal reached at Sandringham, where he and Meghan agreed to the loss of public funding and the use of their titles infor their independence.It was clear that the saga had exacted a heavy toll on him. In a voice often cracking with emotion, he told his audience that they would “hear the truth from me”.But what they actually heard was a catalogue of embittered anguish.As often, he moaned about the press, which he painted as a sinister, powerful force which needs to be curtailed.Unfortunately, despite all his professed love of Britain, Harry appears to have no understanding that a free, open media is essential to our democracy.He has proved unable to handle any criticism at all – even when it is justied, as in the hypocrisy of his green campaigning while indulging in the use of private jets.It is ashe thinks the media should be filled with fawning sycophants who never scrutinise but just lavish him with praise.That is the kind of regime that belongs to a totalitarian dictatorship, not traditionally liberal Britain.Much of Harry’s hostility to journalists stems from their relationship with his mother. But, however understandable, this is another myth.Princess Diana was not naïve when it came to the press. She was a shrewd, sometimes ruthless operator, who was quite willing to exploit the newspapers when it suited her.With some indignation, he complained that the Sandringham deal was not what he wanted. But it was foolish of him to believe that he and Meghan could have semi-detached Royal status, enjoying its privileges without its obligations.The Queen could never have tolerated that, especially because any commercial deals reached by the Sussexes could have badly compromised her family, just as their cherished fashionable causes could have undermined the Crown.Royalty cannot be a vehicle for self-enrichment or political posturing.The Duke’s inner agony was at its most obvious when he spoke of his regrets for the le he is leaving.Having revealed that he and Meghan were excited to “fly the flag and carry out our roles for this country with pride”, he referred to his “great sadness” at the step they have taken.Yet he claimed that they had “really no other option”. It was another moment of self-deceit, for there were certainly other courses open to them.They could have either stuck to their Royal positions without creating such a psycho drama about themselves, or,they really wanted freedom without scrutiny, they could have retired to live quietly as ordinary citizens, as some other members of the Royal family have done in the past.But such modesty would not have fulfilled their ambitions to be globe-trotting celebrities.It is this craving for fame that highlights the emptiness of Harry’s language about his devotion to service. “I will continue to be the same man who holds his country dear and dedicates his le to supporting the causes, charities and military communities so important to me,” he declared at the charity dinner.Yet this is the same man who was revealed to have touted his we’s voiceover skills to Disney bosses at the London premiere of the Lion King last summer.In the eyes of their critics, the real dedication that Harry and Meghan will probably soon show is to TV deals, book advances, and brand partnerships.In a further attempt to justy their actions, Harry implied that they had been suffering for a long time through the crushing restrictions of Royal le.The final move had been made, he explained, “after so many months of talks and so many years of challenges.”He and Meghan have only been married for  months. A true model of stoical determination, the Queen has been on the throne for almost  years without any public complaint.That just illustrates Harry’s lack of perspective. Insulated by privilege, he has little understanding of the lives of ordinary British citizens, many of whom have endured far greater struggles than anything he has ever experienced.After the Queen had been so publicly generous about him and Meghan in her statement from Sandringham at the weekend, saying that “they will always be much loved members of my family,” it was bad manners of Harry to complain about the deal he had just accepted.He should have responded to his grandmother’s generosity in the same spirit.But what’s done is done. Our monarchy has survived its latest crisis. The moment for recriminations has passed now that a new chapter is about to begin.As he settles in Canada, Prince Harry is bound to miss aspects of his old le in Britain, which even now he describes as “my home and the place I love.And the British public will miss him. At his best, he brought a lovable humour, spontaneity and lack of convention to the Royal Family.We can only hope that now, after taking this drastic decision, he finds the peace that he and Meghan crave.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Which makes Hall’s defence of the licence fee even more ridiculous.In an era of multiple-choice subscription TV it is absurd for one broadcaster to be funded by a tax enforceable by criminal penalty.It is even more laughable to claim it “ensures independence­ . . . obliges us to serve everyone and reflect every part of the UK”.Hall’s BBC spent his entire tenure turning a deaf ear to half the UK. Hence its shock at last month’s Tory triumph.Hall’s decision to rob over-s of the free licences he agreed to in  was equally outrageous.The idea that the £million cost will harm vital BBC services, when so much of its content amounts to needless competition with commercial rivals, is fatally flawed.His successor must run a smaller Beeb, more in touch with the public, less in the grip of suffocating “wokeness”, focused not on gratuitous expansion but the high-quality shows it does best.This new chief should accept that non-payment of the licence must be decriminalised and the levy finally replaced with a voluntary subscription.Only then will the BBC join the st Century.THE problem with Harry saying he and Meghan had no option but to move abroad to avoid our “powerful media” is that not a word of it is true.It is sheer paranoia to say the Press has done anything but legitimately scrutinise a publicly-funded couple.And the reality is they do not want to avoid media. They want to avoid criticism.Indeed they crave media attentionit meekly writes their PR puff pieces. Corbyn’s Labour is the same.As for having no choice, what drivel.They could have grown up, developed a thicker skin and done their royal duty as they first promised.To pretend that dark forces made them seek a vast fortune as A-list celebs in the LA sunshine is self-serving cobblers.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is a matter of urgency to work this out.Speaking on LBC today, leading virologist Professor John Oxford, from Queen Mary College, said he was quaking in my shoes at the potential for spread over the holidays.He said: None of us have faced a new virus with so many people in a community travelling around.Thats whats going to happen in China at the end of the week.Once they are close together in taxis or small rooms, then there may be a problem.The only way to stop it is physical cleaning and social distance - keeping away from people.The WHO announced it will hold an Emergency Committee meeting in Geneva tomorrow, to determinethe outbreak should be classed as a global crisis.While Chinese authorities have confirmed more than  cases, another  people are suspected ill with the new strain and around , more are under observation.Fteen healthcare professionals are among those infected.However, experts at Imperial College London predict the true number of cases could be far greater - with estimates closer to ,.WHOs regional director for the western Pacic, Takeshi Kasai, said: Information about newly reported infections suggest there may now be sustained human-to-human transmission.The mayor of Wuhan confirmed the latest deaths today, an -year-old man from the city, which is home to more than  million people.A -year-old man, known only as Li, and a woman, , known as Yin were also confirmed to have died from multiple organ failure.In Taiwan today, an epidemic response command centre has been set up with more than , beds prepared in isolation wards in case the virus spreads further.There, health officials confirmed a woman, thought to be in her s, had caught the new strain.She is currently in hospital and receiving treatment, according to local media reports.So far, the WHO has not advised travel or trade restrictions but could put such measures in place at tomorrows emergency meeting.WHO chiefs are set to considerthis outbreak should be declared a global emergency like the  Ebola outbreak in West Africa, the current outbreak in Congo and the Zika outbreak in Central America in .While NHS chiefs have urged doctors in the UK to be alert to signs of the killer virus, they said today the threat to Brits is low.The origin of the virus is not get known, but experts say the most likely source is an animal.Chinese officials have linked the outbreak last month to a seafood market in the city of Wuhan - where more than  cases have been confirmed.The new strain belongs to a large family of viruses that cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndromeand Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome .The common early signs of infection include fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing dficulties, according to WHO.In more severe cases, it can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.In Australia, border forces have been ordered to ensure all sick passengers are assessed by a trained Biosecurity officer on arrival.Chief health officer Brendan Murphy said the risk was low but added the three daily flights from Wuhan will be met by medics in response to the rapidly emerging situation.State health officials in New South Wales are distributing pamphlets in English and Chinese to all passengers arriving from Wuhan describing the symptoms.The crackdown comes as it was revealed the virus was feared to have reached Australia after a man was tested for the killer mystery bug.The man, from Brisbane, was displaying symptoms of the fatal coronavirus after ing from a family holiday and has been placed in quarantine.The US has also started screening passengers on flights from Wuhan arriving at John F. Kennedy International Airport, San Francisco International Airport and Los Angeles International airport.Other international airports are also screening passengers for the mysterious SARS-like disease after it was revealed it had jumped China’s borders.A video has been shared widely on Twitter showing people on a domestic flight out of the central Chinese city of Wuhan having their temperature taken one-by-one by people in protective suits.A Brit on holiday in Thailand is feared to be the first western victim of the illness.Ash Shorley, , was rushed to hospital after the bug infected both lungs while he was on Koh Phi Phi island in Thailand.The outbreak has caused alarm because of its connection to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome , which killed nearly  people across mainland China and Hong Kong in -.The virus attacks the respiratory system, causing lung lesions.Symptoms include a runny nose, headache, cough and fever, shortness of breath, chills and body aches.It is incredibly contagious and is spread through contact with anything the virus is on as well as infected breath, coughs or sneezes.Symptoms include a runny nose, headache, cough and fever, shortness of breath, chills and body aches.In most cases, you wont know whether you have a coronavirus or a dferent cold-causing virus, such as rhinovirus.Buta coronavirus infection spreads to the lower respiratory tract , it can cause pneumonia, especially in older people, people with heart disease or people with weakened immune systems.There is no vaccine for coronavirus.In  an outbreak of a similar virus, SARS, infected more than , people in  countries before it was brought under control, killing  of those worldwide.Coronaviruses cause diseases ranging from the common cold to more severe ones such as SARS.The Chinese government initially tried to conceal the severity of that epidemic but its cover-up was exposed by a high-ranking physician.Initial symptoms of the novel coronavirus include fever, cough, tightness of the chest and shortness of breath, and those seriously ill developed pneumonia.At least half a dozen Asian countries and three US airports have started screening incoming airline passengers from central China.Chinese President Xi Jinping said it was “extremely crucial” to take every possible measure to combat the disease that has infected at least  people in the country.He said: The recent outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan and other places must be taken seriously“Party committees, governments and relevant departments at all levels should put people’s lives and health first.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That’s why I have been campaigning for a statue to be erected in his honour.But shockingly, I’ve faced strong opposition to a Merrick memorial. I’ve had abuse over social media, with cruel protesters mocking his disability by saying: “Leicester’s ugly enough.”I’ve even been called a “vampire showman” — a reference to freak show bosses who people mistakenly believe made his le a misery.Behind this stereotype, the true story of the Elephant Man is a tale of empowerment and inspiration. He was nothing like the film suggests, but rather an independent disabled man who was ahead of his time.In , aged  and impoverished, he checked himself into the Leicester workhouse, a dire institution where the destitute were given food, shelter and work.Despite his disability, for four years Merrick would have probably been put to work grinding stone or crushing bones.He was faced with a decision — whether to stay there and die or go out and live his le. He decided he would try to make his name and fortune by appearing in a novelty show.Victorians loved the weird and dferent and would pay to see a bearded lady or a tattooed man at one of these shows. But importantly, it was a way for people who were dferent to earn good money and avoid the workhouse.So Merrick wrote to music hall manager Sam Torr, asking him to be his agent, just like in the  film The Greatest Showman.Torr then arranged Merrick’s release from the workhouse and he was soon touring around clubs in the East Midlands.Then when he ran out of local audiences he moved to London, where he met his next agent, Tom Norman — a distant cousin of mine.They set up the Elephant Man show on Whitechapel Road, and for the two weeks they worked together and were more like business partners than owner and slave.In the  film, Tom Norman is portrayed as Mr Bytes, an old drunk who beats Merrick. Norman was actually young, and a member of the Temperance movement, which campaigned against drunkenness, so certainly not a boozy old man.For a fee, Norman would tell crowds a myth of how, at his birth, Merrick’s mother was stamped on by an elephant, resulting in a half-man, half- elephant creature.He would pull back a curtain to reveal Merrick, leaving audiences gawping in amazement. Enterprising Merrick wrote a short pamplet of his le story, which was sold at the show, and he would keep these earnings for himself.In the film we see Merrick’s mother Mary Jane screaming in terror while being trampled by elephants. But according to Merrick himself, his disability did not begin to show until he was five.He lived a normal childhood, going to school and learning to read and write. Mary Jane, a Sunday school teacher, died from unknown causes when he was just , and his father — also Joseph — soon remarried.By then young Joseph was keen to go out and start earning a living. He initially worked in a cigar factory before getting a peddler’s licence to hawk bobbins and gloves around Leicester.He later saidhe didn’t make enough money, his father and stepmother would not feed him. While this sounds like child abuse to us, the Victorians firmly believed in “spare the rod and spoil the child” so this would have been seen as normal.The cause of Merrick’s disability is still open to debate but the most popular diagnosis is proteus syndrome, a rare condition characterised by overgrowth of the bones and skin.A doctor has even suggested that his condition is unique — and should be named Merrick’s syndrome after its lone sufferer.It is impossible to test Merrick’s DNA to identy the illness, as when he died, his flesh was stripped from his bones, which were bleached twice, while hairs taken from his clothes have failed to produce any DNA results.In his day he was a medical curiosity and doctors did try to study him. A surgeon, Frederick Treves, sought out Merrick and asked him to come to the London Hospital to be studied by doctors.At first Merrick agreed, yet after three or four visits he refused to go back, saying he felt like he was in a cattle market.Treves was furious and a week later police shut down Merrick and Norman’s show as a public nuisance. Whether Treves had a hand in it is impossible to say.Undeterred and wealthy from his show with Norman, Merrick then spent three months with a travelling circus in Northamptonshire.While travelling, he began to wear a hood and cape so he could walk the streets without getting jeered or followed. His real ambition was to entertain audiences in Europe, so he advertised in the papers for a new manager who could take him to the Continent.Details of what happened abroad are vague but Merrick seems to have been robbed and abandoned by his new management, leaving him in Brussels without a penny to his name.He somehow travelled back to London, where he found Dr Treves, who agreed to let him stay at the London Hospital.His care would be funded by wealthy benefactors — but there would have been an expectation that Merrick would let doctors examine him.One, Dr Wilfred Granville, wrote in his memoirs that Merrick would look at specimens in the hospital and ponder what his body parts would look like in a bottle. It was clear he knew his fate.But there is no reason to believe Merrick was unhappy in the hospital, in fact he seems to have enjoyed himself.While the Queen’s great-grandmother Princess Alexandra was opening a nurses’ wing in the hospital, she visited Merrick and shook his hand.They became firm friends and she would often visit and write him letters. In turn, Merrick made her a cardboard model of a German cathedral. Her husband Prince Edward, the future King, even sent food and drink packages to Merrick.As a result of this friendship it became fashionable for the upper classes to visit Merrick and give him signed pictures and trinkets.Aristocrat Lady Louisa Knightley invited him to holiday at the grand Fawsley Hall in Northamptonshire, where he stayed three times, enjoying walking freely in the estate’s grounds without fear of being ridiculed.But he never forgot Tom Norman. A porter once overheard Merrick asking when he could visit his old friend. But when Tom visited the hospital he was refused entry and the pair never saw each other again.Many people believe Merrick died by taking his own le. He was unable to sleep on his back as the sheer weight of his head could dislocate his neck, so instead he was forced to sleep with his head against his knees.In the film a desperate Merrick — played by Oscar-nominated John Hurt — is shown removing the cushions which helped him to sit up straight while sleeping, insinuating that he killed himself.But while he did die tragically young at , the evidence points to his death being accidental. He was found in the afternoon — not at night — lying across his bed ashe had slipped and was trying to get up.His inquest found he had died from a dislocated neck but we can’t trust the science of the time. Merrick’s death could have been caused by a stroke or seizure, but it is a mystery we will never solve.While his skeleton is kept at the Royal London Hospital, last May I found the unmarked grave of some of his flesh in the City of London Cemetery and Crematorium in Ilford.It made worldwide news and I was astounded by the reaction to my discovery. So many people were interested in his story.This is what led me to my quest to get Merrick recognised for the great man he was, with a statue in Leicester city centre.I want people to take off their blinkers, see what he really did with his le and realise he was not just the freak show casualty who was portrayed in the Elephant Man film.And to those who complain his statue would be “ugly” — take a lesson from Merrick’s le to see what’s on the inside, not just the outside.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Former Chief of the Defence Staff, Admiral Lord Boyce, and ex-head of the Navy, Lord West, delivered scathing verdicts on the Senior Service during a House of Lords debate. The UK has just six destroyers and  frigates - with more than a third stuck in dock at any one time. The former naval top brass issued the latest warnings about the Type , Daring-class destroyers, which cost £billion each and have been plagued by engine trouble.  They also voiced fears about the rate at which ageing Type , Duke-class frigates are being replaced by Type , City-class global combat ships. Speaking at Westminster, Lord Boyce said: “Our number of frigates and destroyers are anorexic, and this has been exacerbated by the Type  problem. “We embarked upon an eight-ship, Type  frigate building programme in , but the first ship, Glasgow, won’t be commissioned until . “Thereafter, a ship appears after every two years.”  The timetable was “completely unacceptable and is a black mark against the Government and our shipbuilding industry”, he stormed. Pressing the Government on the engine problems faced by the Type  vessels, Lord West hit out at “an appalling state of affairs”. He told peers: “We have six anti-air warfare ships, we knew eight years ago that they had a problem - that sometimes there would be a total lack of power, which would suddenly happen unexpectedly.

Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham said: “I believe that it will be transformational. “I think in a generation from now when my grandchildren have children they will be astonished to think that we ever didn’t protect kids online. “I think it will be as ordinary as keeping children safe by putting on a seat belt.” The ICO hopes the code will come into force by autumn .

Critics point to suicide pictures, gambling websites and inappropriate content on everyday pages as risks to those underage. Everything from apps to connected toys, social media s to online games, and even educational websites and streaming services, will be expected to make data protection of young people a priority from the design phase. Privacy settings should be set to high by default and nudge techniques should not be used to encourage children to weaken their settings, the code states. Location settings that allow the world to see where a child is should also be switched off automatically. Data collection and sharing should be minimised and profiling that can allow children to be served up targeted content should be switched off by default too.

More than  cases haves far been reported in China, mostly in Wuhan, a provincial capital and transportation hub, where the virus may have originated at a sea food market. But it has also been spreading around other parts of China, including five cases in the national capital Beijing, and overseas to Thailand where two cases have been confirmed. South Korea has also confirmed a case of the virus, along with Japan and Taiwan which have confirmed one case each. Fteen medical personnel are among those infected. Masked workers were spraying disinfectant at Incheon international airport, west of Seoul, today. While in Malaysia health officials were checking passengers in thermal scanner at Kuala Lumpur International Airport. And nervous travellers were wearing protective face masks outside a railway station in Yichang in central China’s Hubei province, as the outbreak revives memories of the SARS pandemic, which killed .  It comes after footage filmed on a flight from Wuhan to Macau last week showed a medic - dressed in protective sterile clothing - screening passengers. The World Health Organisation is holding an emergency committee meeting on Wednesday to consider declaring a global health emergency. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome . They usually are usually transmitted from animals to people.  However the new strain is thought to spread from person to person through coughing and sneezing. Dr Nathalie MacDermott, National Institute for Health Research academic clinical lecturer, King’s College London, said: “While data is still limited it appears likely that the Wuhan Coronavirus is spread through contact with an infected person’s secretions and respiratory droplet infection - this is contact with small particles in the air that occur when an infected person coughs or sneezes.” However WHO is not currently recommending restriction of travel or trade.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailThe Duchess of Cambridge is today launching a landmark survey on early childhood which she hopes will trigger “lasting change for generations to come”. Mum-of-three Kate has embarked on a -hour tour of the country, visiting Birmingham, Cardf and Surrey to raise awareness of the poll, Five Big Questions on the Under Fives, thought to be the largest of its kind in the UK. She has been quietly working on the theme since her marriage eight years ago, dedicating the vast majority of her public and private engagements to early years provision. And this afternoon, she showed off her maternal side as she played with young children at a child-sized mini-city at a museum in Birmingham. Heartwarming photos show the -year-old engaging with the youngsters in play as she beams with happiness. She has determined that many of the hardest social challenges facing society can often be traced back to experiences in early childhood and has successfully made the subject her niche. Royal sources said Kate views this as a lelong project with which she hopes to make a tangible dference. Kate said: The Early Years are more crucial for future health and happiness than any other moment in our letime. I want to hear the key issues affecting our families and communities so I can focus my work on where it is needed most. The research was commissioned by the Royal Foundation, which hopes it will spark the biggest ever conversation on early childhood. The Duchess began her whistlestop tour with a visit to MiniBrum, an interactive, child-sized mini-city at Thinktank, Birmingham’s science museum. The Duchess said: What we experience between the ages of  and five shapes the developing brain. They help us avoid adversity, or certainly build resilience to adversity in later le, prevent challenges with mental health later down the line. As a mother, it’s given me a dferent perspective. There’s so much pressure on parents to feel the responsibility is just down to them but actually it’s important to work together as a community. The poll will be online for a month and is designed to recognise that everyone has a role in building the foundations of childhood that have a lelong effect. The results will be revealed in March and will determine the Duchess’s next steps. Kensington Palace said the launch of the survey followed eight years of work by the duchess who firmly believes that experiences in the earliest years – from in the womb to the age of five – are instrumental in shaping future lives. The five questions were compiled after meeting with families across the country and hearing about the issues they deal with day-to-day, reflecting the results of those conversations as well as those with academics, experts, organisations and practitioners. The Duchess will join parents at London Early Years Foundationnursery in Southwark, central London, for the nursery drop off tomorrow, before helping nursery workers serve breakfast to the children, highlighting the importance of nutritious food to a child’s development.

They say the incidents near US military bases all resulted in either signicant injuries or death. The majority featured US servicemen, servicewomen or their families driving on the wrong side of the road. Last year, the Mirror told how mum Judy Chard, , was lucky to escape with her le when a US soldier ploughed into her just miles from the base where Harry died. The -year-old’s stepfather Bruce Charles has told BBC Breakfast that the list of incidents dates back  years. He said: “I just think it’s shocking that this has been happening for so many years. “Nearly every single one of these cases involves a serviceman driving on the wrong side of the road. “It’s definitely a pattern.”  Bruce, married to Harry’s mum Charlotte, added: “A lot of it doesn’t get reported because there isn’t any dashcam footage of it, so things are mentioned and you hear about them but until you’ve actually seen it on film, you realise it’s happening quite often. “It has to stop. These bases have to realise they have issues with servicemen leaving the bases. “At the moment the bases don’t seem to really want to interact with us and engage with us, so it’s very hard but it is something we’re going to fight and fight for all the way, until we get results.”Motorcyclist Harry died last August after he was involved in a collision with diplomat’s we Anne Sacoolas, . The mum-of-three was allegedly driving on the wrong side of the road near the US intel base RAF Croughton, Northants. She fled Britain claiming diplomatic immunity but is now the subject of extradition proceedings on a death by dangerous driving charge.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA married HSBC boss dubbed aposWeinsteinapos had an affair with a colleague and romped with another woman in the toilet at work, an employment tribunal heard. Robert Clegg, global head of staff digitisation, had an affair with Madeleine Luckham, head of delivery for the department. He told her it was not his first fling and that he did not love his we, she claims. When they split she said Mr Clegg would leer at her chest, touch her uninvited in public and make her feel professionally and personally worthless. She told the tribunal how he flirted with other women in front of her after they separated, getting aposvery handsyapos at work with another woman and whispering in her ear aposweaposd have great sexapos. Ms Luckham, , from Teddington in south west London, also accused Mr Clegg of rubbing against her in meetings.  After confronting him about cheating on her with another woman she was left feeling like a aposcheap fill-inapos as he said their relationship had been just aposcasual drunken sexapos, the hearing was told. Ms Luckham, who earned £ a day as a contractor, said she was promised a permanent job with a £, salary. That never materialised after they broke up and he turned against her, she claims. She is now suing both HSBC and Mr Clegg for sex discrimination, which both deny. Ms Luckham told Stratford Employment Tribunal that they split up in April . She had had her first doubts the previous Christmas after a trip to New York when she realised she would aposbreak the heartsapos of his four young children. But Mr Clegg, , from Newbury in Berkshire, told the tribunal he ended the affair in January  during a joint work trip to Hong Kong where Ms Luckham had made snide comments about him in a bid to embarrass him. He said he had told her aposweaposre doneapos and had started seeing a counsellor with his we to try and save their marriage, according to his witness statement.  She said the affair had started in October  at HSBCaposs fintech hub in Southwark when they had dinner together at Hicksteraposs after team drinks at Jackaposs bar, the tribunal heard. The pair shared a consensual kiss and ed to Mr Cleggaposs Mercure Hotel, opposite, where he invited Ms Luckham to spend the night and later asked her for WhatsApp sex after she refused, it was said. She said: We met the next day and discussed what had happened the night before as well as his marriage. He told me that his marriage was over and that it was a matter of financially getting to the position where he could orce. He said that he and his we were no longer intimate, he didnapost love her anymore, that they led separate lives and that they were only together for their children. He also told me I wasnapost his first affair. Three days later, Mr Clegg invited Ms Luckham for dinner and they later had sex at his hotel. The pair would send complimentary messages to one another at work, with Mr Clegg texting her you look good enough to eat today, the tribunal heard. She said they would kiss, hold hands and play footsie under the table at work. Mr Clegg had told her he loved her, Ms Luckham said.  But on April  she said Mr Clegg became extremely flirtatious with a woman from SOMO, an external contractor, in front of her eyes. She said she was heartbroken hearing rumours of him being very handsy with someone at a work social event around the same time. Ms Luckham said: He had walked behind her, placed his hands around her, resting at the top of her legs and said in her ear aposweaposd have great sex.apos I was heartbroken and decided to speak to Rob about it directly. In her witness statement, she said: Kai Karteland I discussed Rob, the way he looked at women like they were prey and the fact that he had even earned himself a nickname back at the SOMO offices, aposWeinsteinapos. Ms Luckham said Mr Clegg found the conversation about his flirting with other women very distressing, apologised and blamed it on their relationship not going well. She said: He then blamed it on his situation at home, the way his we was treating him and said that he did not feel like himself. He asked for another chance and I stupidly agreed. However in the blink of an eye on April , I discovered that he was sleeping with someone  in the office. Ms Luckham said the pair met the following day when she believes she ended the relationship.  She said: However Rob was quite dismissive of me and my feelings and started to belittle our relationship. He intimated that it was true he was sleeping with one of our colleagues. He minimised our relationship calling it casual drunken sex that he wasnapost getting at home, as though I was a cheap fill-in for him and that was that. During the conversation, he repeated that he aposcouldnapost afford to leave HSBCapos the clear inference being that I should leave instead. In the immediate aftermath of their breakup, Ms Luckham said things changed in the office and Mr Clegg told her out of the blue he was not entirely happy with her work and that he touched her in a meeting. She said: In one meeting we were in together he walked the long way round behind me and placed both hands on my hips as he slid by, rubbing himself behind me. I felt my body tense and recoil. This was just one of numerous examples of unwanted touching and sexual harassment over the next few months. On May , Ms Luckham discovered the permanent role she had accepted in writing with a £k base salary, was no longer available, she claims. But the tribunal was also told Ms Luckham was given until May  to apply for the role but did not do so. Ms Luckham said Mr Clegg would talk to her like dirt behind closed doors and blame her for everything that had gone wrong, only to switch the second they left the room. She said he would rub his leg against hers in meetings and stare at her chest while talking to her, which she found totally unacceptable.  She said: I felt violated. It was torture. Ms Luckham also recalled seeing Mr Clegg go into a staff toilet where she claimed he had sex with another woman after allegedly trying to prevent her from moving into the new role. She said: As I walked past, through the outer door, I saw her knock on one of the cubicle doors and it opened. Rob was already inside. Rob had just moments ago destroyed my career and was now having sex in the office toilet. Roughly ten minute later Rob ed from the toilets looking all sweaty and dishevelled and gave me the most sinister smile Iaposve ever seen in my le. I felt physically sick. By the end of June, Ms Luckham said she was very affected by stress and anxiety and had dropped more than a dress size. She claimed the treatment by the bank and Mr Clegg that almost drove her to suicide and left her with possible PTSD. But Mr Clegg denied most of the accusations and said he felt like his personality was under constant violent attack by Ms Luckham. In his witness statement, Mr Clegg said: On advice from HR, I eventually took the decision not to renew the claimantaposs contract which ended in August  because of behavioural issues which had ruined the previously positive working culture in my team and become impossible to manage.

Speaking from her home in Leeds, West Yorkshire, today, Dianne said: They put him in a bed nappy and gave him a drug which is only given to psychotic patients. I couldnapost believe it. I was worried he might have a bleed in his brain but scans said he was all clear abut he was going to be put on observation. I thought it would be a day but I was shocked to find him in a dark room strapped to his bed. Heaposs an ex soldier, it was disgusting.  Dianne, who has a son with John, spent the following  days in taxis from Medplaya Hotel Flamingo Oasis in Benidorm. She amassed huge bills on transport and their £, holiday was ruined. She added: His speech was slurred but that was because of the fall. How degrading was this for him  Dianne had to spoon-fed John, who has previously had a heart bypass, and her nightmare only ended when their son Craig Waite flew over. My son Craig is a hero. He flew over from Leeds to save us. I am so grateful, Dianne said.  John, who spent five years in Germany with the British Army, was flown back to Leeds where he was rushed into Leeds General Infirmary before being moved to St James Hospital. He is now recovering at home but is reluctant toto Spain. Iaposm feeling better now that Iaposm home, the dad said. I was out cold for the  days - I was hallucinating that I was back in Germany.

Married dad-of-four Robert Clegg, global head of HSBC staff digitisation, was aposon a mission to destroyapos Madeleine Luckham after she ended their extra-marital romance, it was said. Ms Luckham, , a high-flying woman in tech, told the tribunal she suspected her line manager was sleeping with another colleague and that he had sex in the office toilet. But she claimed just before they split in April  she saw Mr Clegg, , get handsy with a SOMO contractor and whispered in her ear weaposd have great sex. Today she was accused of making the derogatory remark.  Jane McCafferty, QC, for the bank and Mr Clegg said: You referred to the woman from SOMO as p***ybait. Madeleine said: No I did not. She confronted him over the remark and they broke up with her telling him please just keep the sleaze out of the office from now on and please keep it away from me, Stratford Employment tribunal heard. She added: It validated everything I felt, not just the rumours, I have seen it with my own eyes. In the context of the rumours, it was not ogling, it was like she was prey.

She told the tribunal: I did not go into a relationship with a married man thinking I would be the only woman in his le. It was more the darker side of things.

Clegg was given the nickname aposWeinsteinapos at the SOMO offices, the tribunal had earlier heard. And she said she felt like a weight had lted after she ended their romance at the Hilton Hotel on April . She told the tribunal: Having just ended the relationship, I felt like a weight had lted. I felt like I could breathe and I was looking forward to moving forward. We were both holding hands and crying during the conversation. It was a break up. But she said everything changed at work following the break up and that Mr Clegg had intimated he was sleeping with somebody  at the office, the tribunal heard. She told the tribunal she suspected this was the woman she had seen him with in the office toilet. She said: I think at this point I was waking up to the person Mr Clegg was. It was a rude awakening, it was a hard awakening. But at the same time, I was flip flopping and feeling sorry for him because of those rumours [the other woman]. I am traumatised.

While the end of the bitterly cold spell is on the horizon, a Public Health England cold weather alert is still in place until am tomorrow, warning that the elderly, very young and people with medical conditions risk getting ill. And the Met Office is warning tonight could see temperatures fall to as low as -C overnight, before things improve tomorrow. This comes after Britain was blanketed in thick freezing fog and frost this morning, which saw cars overturn on icy roads and police issue ice warnings as driving conditions became treacherous. Visibility was as low as under ftand the UK was colder than Reykjavik in Iceland, which reached a low of C today. The lowest temperature recorded overnight was -.C in Oxfordshire. And tonight heading into tomorrow will see aof the below-freezing conditions, with the south and South West of England baring the brunt. Cloud will cover most regions of the UK as the skies turn even greyer than today. The south will be especially misty and murky tomorrow. Cloud in the far west and northwest will be thick enough for spots of patchy rain. Meanwhile there is a north-south ide, with Scotland and the North East look set to enjoy the best of the weather, with the possibility of temperatures hitting C tomorrow. Helen Roberts, a meteorologist with the Met Office , told : There was widespread frost this morning. There will certainly be some frost tonight, but not as much. There will be some fog in the far south of England, with freezing fog confined to south. It will be mostly freezing fog. The minimum temperature last night was -.C in Oxfordshire.Tonight we could see a low temperature -C, across the South West of England. It will be quite a grey start across large parts of the UK tomorrow morning, particularly in England and Wales, with low cloud and hill fog. It wonapost really brighten up for many throughout much of the day. It will feel cold under the cloud cover. But itaposs not all bad news, as the meteorologist said there will be a little brightness around for some. The best chance of brightness will be in the north east of England and eastern Scotland, she said.The maximum temperature we can expect in the far south tomorrow will be C or C, and C or C for much of the west of England. We could get as high as as C or C in the north east. Things are expected to get milder after the PHE cold weather alert expires around am tomorrow. But the meteorologist warns there could still be some slippery surfaces around, mainly caused by frost and especially in the south and South West, so motorists and pedestrians still need to take care.  Dr Ishani Kar-Purkayastha, Consultant in Public Health at Public Health England, said: People with heart and lung conditions, older people and the very young are at risk of becoming unwell during cold weather. At this time, it’s really important to keep a look out for friends and family who might be affected.

Their former royal highnesses have put the wheels in motion with the powerful agents, business managers and lawyers Meghan secretly retained throughout her time in the British Royal Family. The team features Nick Collins of The Gersh Agency, whose clients include Tobey Maguire and Jamie Foxx – he is handling lucrative film, TV and philanthropic offers. Meghan’s Beverly Hills business manager Andrew Meyer is working behind the scenes too, with Hollywood lawyer Rick Genow also heavily involved. The gurus were brought together to help Harry, , and Meghan, , become “financially independent” despite still receiving a supply of cash from Harry’s dad Prince Charles for the next  months. Already one of Netflix ’s most senior bosses, chief content officer Ted Sarandos, has said the online streaming company would welcome a deal with the royals. The couple will also discuss how to promote causes close to their hearts, including the environment and the fight against HIV and AIDS.The terms of separation from the monarchy were harsher than both Harry and Meghan had lobbied for when they announced Megxit. Harry yesterday grinned as he arrived in Canada, having cast a solemn figure as he left the gruelling nine-hour British Airways flight from Heathrow to Vancouver. But after a transfer flight to Vancouver Island, Harry’s demeanour had changed and he smiled broadly.  One passenger on board the plane said they suspected Meghan was waiting inside a Toyota SUV that pulled up nearby. The couple had been separated for  days while the Prince finished his final engagement as a senior royal in Britain.Hours before leaving London on Monday, the Prince raced through an official engagement with Prime Minister Boris Johnson and African leaders.He had been so eager to see Meghan and Archie, he even ducked out of a Buckingham Palace ­reception he was supposed to be co-hosting. Harry was driven from the airport to the £.million waterfront home the couple have lived in since November, loaned to the couple by a mystery benefactor.

His numb expression brought to le with flesh tones, the filthy blue and white fabric of his degrading striped unorm now painfully tangible, she couldn’t fail to. This is her late father Eugene Spiegel, aged just , and six years before she was born, caught on camera in a desperate moment when he must have lost all hope of a future, let alone fatherhood.Anita, , movingly describes the unexpected moment last week when she came face to face with her dad in this image, standing within Hitler’s most notorious death camp, Auschwitz , in one of a selection of newly colourised black and white photographs taken there in May, .The shots, taken by SS guards, have been tinted for use in a new documentary, Auschwitz Untold: In Colour, to be shown on More on Sunday and Monday, to coincide with the th anniversary of the liberation, by Soviet forces, of the camp where .million were murdered. Their new treatment is intended to make real the horrors of the holocaust for a young, modern audience. But Anita, from London, only too well aware of what both her parents suffered there, is also sharply reminded with vivid new veracity of Eugene’s experience of hell on earth. Not least because, within the delicate profile of this scared young man, standing on Auschwitz’s railway ramp amid hordes of disorientated new arrivals, she could see a mirror image of her own -year-old son.  She says: “We were completely and utterly and totally overcome. The whole thing was very, very moving and brought it all back home. “It has been so long, we have heard so much, but still when you see the person in the unorm that represents such evil, it’s a shock over and over again. “To see him in that unorm is awful. My daughter-in-law can’t bear to look at the picture because it looks so much like her husband.” Somehow, Eugene survived Auschwitz, as did his we, Margaret – although the pair lost each other for over a year after liberation, assuming each other dead before they were miraculously reunited.  But both found it too painful to speak fully of the horrors they faced, so this image sheds new light on what they must have experienced. Anita has seen it once before, but only in black and white, and only the detail showing the men in striped garb. Seeing it in colour, within the context of the wider scene, has been “overwhelming”. Taken around a month after Eugene and Margaret first arrived in Auschwitz, her father stands within the confused crowds who have been forced out of the stinking cattle trucks that have transported them.  The line of waiting arrivals before him is made up of women, some elderly, and children. A lady carrying a baby is being directed by guards to her fate. It was the frail, especially the middle-aged and old, and the very young, who were generally selected on arrival to go straight to the gas chambers, rather than being set to slave labour. Eugene, after a month in the camp, would have known what faced them, but been unable to warn them. Anita remembers he told her he narrowly avoided it himself.  “My father was always a frail looking man,” she says. “And when he arrived, he arrived with a brother, and my father was placed in one line and his brother in the other. I presume my father was placed in the line that was going to be gassed. “He insisted he wanted to be with his brother, and for some reason they didn’t shoot him on the spot, they said OK, and they let him move lines. It would have saved his le.” This collection of colourised photographs were all taken on Auschwitz’s infamous arrivals ramp, and form part of what is now named The Auschwitz Album, the only surviving visual evidence of the process leading to the mass murder at Auschwitz-Birkenau. The original purpose of the SS images is not known, although the guards thought to have taken them, Ernst Hofmann or Bernhard Walte, were also tasked with taking ID photos and fingerprints of the inmates.  The photos all show the arrival of Hungarian Jews, many from the Berehovo Ghetto. They demonstrate the sheer scale of the transports, and the confusion and fear of those who arrived via an inhumane journey, their coats decorated with humiliating yellow stars. It is believed to be the first time images inside concentration camps have been colourised, although some colour film was taken at the time. “We hope the series will help remove a barrier that separates contemporary audiences from the realty of the Holocaust so that we will never forget the atrocities of the past,” explained development producer Sheldon Lazarus, who had the idea when he saw his own daughter struggle to grasp the truth of the event at school. Eugene and Margaret arrived at Auschwitz from a small town called Ung, now in Ukraine, in April .  “That is why in this picture he is still looking fairly well - after a few months he wouldn’t have looked like this,” says Anita. Eugene had worked for his family’s banking firm, Margaret for her family’s women’s clothing shop. Both their sets of parents were gassed immediately they arrived Eugene also lost a brother and sister, and Margaret a young brother. The couple was separated in the camp. While Margaret was liberated there on January , , Eugene was sent on a death march with his surviving brother to the camp of Buchenwald, which wasn’t liberated until May. One of very few recollections he did tell his family was that his brother saved his le a second time. Anita says: “On the death march my father was already very ill and just wanted to give up, but his brother just carried him on his back, he wouldn’t let him.”  Eugene had TB, and was taken to an American hospital in Germany after liberation. Meanwhile, Margaret had ed to Ung, and finding no surviving family, moved to Budapest to work in a bleak attempt to support herself. There, by miraculous chance, she met someone who had seen the name Spiegel on a survivors’ list. It was Eugene, and she travelled to find him in hospital. “This must have been at least a year after liberation,” says Anita. “She thought he had gone - and he must have thought she had.” It took two years in a sanatorium for Eugene to recover, and then the couple moved to South America to begin a new le.

bar introduces drink covers to tackle spiking1","story":"An Aberdeen bar is providing special coasters to customers in a bid to tackle drink-spiking.Siberia Bar and Hotel, on Belmont Street, began supplying the beer mats last week after reports of alleged drink-spiking in the city surfaced on social media.It is thought the bar is one of the first in Aberdeen to provide the coasters, which can be placed on top of drinks and features a hole for a straw.They are the brainchild of campaign group Girls Against Spiking, an organisation which was set up in September  with the aim of giving information and advice about keeping safe.Now, Stuart McPhee, general manager of Siberia, is rolling out the device to customers.Mr McPhee said: “I became aware of the covers through social media and recently there has been a lot of reports in the area of people being spiked.“I picked them up at a licensing conference last week because I thought it was better to have some measures in place.“They’re nondescript and there for everyone to use.”The move comes after a woman was taken to hospital earlier this month amid claims her drink was spiked in a bar on Belmont Street.Stuart added: “I think it’s certainly a misconception that it’s only girls who get spiked.“Boys get spiked too and some people simply do it for a misguided laugh.“I think the best deterrent is to never leave your drink unattended, but we thought we should do our bit to help.”A statement from Girls Against Spiking said: “We wanted to do something to help tackle Scotland’s mental health crisis so it features Samaritans contact details as well as others which can help with a host of issues.“We have thousands of these coasters which have been distributed to every police ision in Scotland, who will then further distribute them in their local area to licensed premises.”Elaine Hindal, CEO of Drinkaware, said: “If somebody you know starts to feel strange or more drunk than expected, or you suspect their drink has been spiked, it is important to get medical help straight away.“Drink covers are just one of a number of ways that may help reduce the likelihood of your drink being spiked – for example, not accepting a drink from someone you don’t know and never leaving your drink.“Our advice is to stay vigilant – don’t drink too much in the first place, stick with your friends and have a safe plan for getting home.“Many venues adopt alcohol awareness training schemes for their staff and these usually cover how to recognise drink-spiking.”Nicola Johnston, Aberdeen Inspired economy manager, said: “Aberdeen Inspired is supportive of any initiative that encourages safety in the night-time economy.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2020/01/EE-CJS-080120-1-12-789x564.jpg ","title":"refurbished statue is back in rightful place in north east town

","title":"keeper shares his euro vision for dons ahead of motherwell showdown","story":"Captain Joe Lewis today challenged Aberdeen to lay down a European marker by defeating rivals Motherwell tomorrow.The Steelmen hold the Premiership’s third spot, which brings automatic Europa League qualication for next season.Victory over ‘Well at Pittodrie tomorrow would push Aberdeen into third – where Lewis aims to finish the campaign.Last season the Dons faced a nervous sweat on a sixth straight Euro qualication after finishing fourth and had to wait on Celtic winning the Scottish Cup.This time Lewis wants European action secured automatically by finishing third and realises overcoming Motherwell is pivotal.Lewis said: “Motherwell is a huge game as they have been very consistent and have been winning game after game.“They are a strong side but it is a match we are certainly looking to win. The last time we played Motherwell we won - and scored three brilliant goals.“That was one of our best performances along with our - win over Kilmarnock. We will need to something close to that level to get the job done again.“It was away from home against dficult opposition and we did really well with a lot of players playing out of position.“We will be looking to replicate that, but we know Motherwell will be better than they were that day.”Aberdeen ed from the Premiership winter shutdown with a - Scottish Cup fourth round defeat of League One Dumbarton at Pittodrie.In the aftermath of that narrow victory over the part-timers, Dons boss Derek McInnes confirmed he aims to sign a player with a creative spark in the January transfer window. He has already made an attempt to sign St Johnstone winger Matty Kennedy this month to bring creativity.Kennedy had agreed a pre- contract for the summer, but the Dons want him in now.If a deal to secure Kennedy this month cannot be thrashed out McInnes will move on to other signing targets.However, Lewis reckons in signing Dylan McGeouch from Sunderland, they have already landed a player who can turn games with his skill.Lewis said: “Dylan is a fantastic signing for us. He is very good on the ball, positive and energetic and is a big addition to the squad.“Hopefully he can affect the way we are playing and can be an integral part going forward.“We have competition in the squad now and that will be important going forward.”Aberdeen had  shots against Dumbarton but it took a late penalty from Sam Cosgrove to beat the part-timers and prevent an unwanted replay.Their reward is a home clash against Premiership Kilmarnock on the weekend of February .Lewis said: “The important thing about any cup game is getting through to the next round.“It was a quiet game for me as the back four did their jobs.“The two centre-halves completely nullied everything that came into our half.“Attacking-wise against Dumbarton, on another day we could have had four or five goals.“As long as it is - you always run the risk of them popping up with something, but we dealt with everything and there were no dramas.“After having the break, for the Premiership teams it is important to get back to winning ways – which we did.“Obviously, it wasn’t the emphatic goal scoring victory we wanted but it was a win. We kept putting the ball in the box and kept trying to do the right things.“Eventually it wasn’t luck or a fluke but persistence with Sam getting in the right areas.“The lad brought him down and it was a clear penalty which Sam put away – as he usually does.”For the Scottish Cup tie the Dons transformed the Merkland Stand into an “active area” for fans who want to stand and sing in support of Aberdeen.Lewis hopes the “Red Shed” can be incorporated at every home game for next season.He said: “The initiative from the club with the Red Shed is a brilliant idea.“The club has to be commended for it and the fans for buying into it.“Everyone wants a better atmosphere here and hopefully that can be the start of things.“Certainly against Dumbarton at home when most people would have come here expecting us to win and quite often the fans are waiting for something from the pitch.“We could hear the supporters and no disrespect to Dumbarton, but in the bigger games they can make a dference.“A good atmosphere at Pittodrie can be points on the board for us.”"},{"url":null,"title":"a mid argyll rugby blast from the past","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowTayvallich reader Donald Carmichael handed in this black and white photograph of a Mid Argyll Rugby Club team of many decades ago.But can our readers name the players  And what background can you give us about this photograph and Mid Argyll Rugby club at the time Contact the Argyllshire Advertiser by email: editor@argyllshireadvertiser with any information."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column december 27 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLooking back over the last  months, no single story has dominated the headlines in these pages, but there have been important themes.There are the negative trends, of course.

Three events all within a stones throw of Mid Argyll.Jamie Miller was the only local to enter this event, starting his Scottish Tarmac Rally Championshipcampaign for the year in the rapid  Citroen CR. Paul Hunter, swapping his pacenotes for spanners, was on hand to assist Jamie throughout the season. Conditions were said to have been tricky as Knockhill has its own micro-climate, which consists purely of rain, wind, snow, ice, wind and wind. Sadly it wasn#t to be at Knockhill for the team with mechanical failure ending their day after stage two.The first closed road event to take place in England, after the approval of closed road rallying for the UK, was the first event for the famousGTi. Unfortunately for Kirsty Mochrie her licence can only be upgraded to stage events from single venue use when she turns , so it was theof the pairing of Innes Mochrie and Paul Hunter to represent Mid Argyll south of the border. The pair, finding the conditions tricky in the narrow lanes after the top seed cars had been pulling mud from verges and ditches, managed to bounce the wee metro over the first loop of four stages until the gearbox had enough on the fth test.Following the cancelling of Inverness# Snowman Rally earlier in the year, this was now first round of the Scottish Rally Championshipfor Dougie Watt and Ian Parker, and it was interesting to say the least. A glance outside in the morning to see about four inches of snow lying on the roof of the MK Escort was a surprise for a start. A very wet and muddy day saw the pair make it to the finish in one piece which is more than can be said for the clutch cable that snapped about one mile into the final stage, however clinching their first class win of the season was the best start to the championship.With Kirsty #Wee Mo# Mochrie in the co-drivers seat in the rapid Corsa of Steven Hay , a fair pace was set by the pair throughout the day sitting as high as th until they unfortunately had to take a split early to save damaging the car. Back out the next stage and still setting a blistering top  pace in the Corsa, including some hang time on both the jumps.Jamie, back out in the fit C, had bad luck once again. This time an overshoot on a square right and a struggle to get the car started again after a stall sadly earned him a stage max on stage two. Still setting top  times on the day he ended nd which was a fair effort when you include a stage maximum time.Ian was out this time with Fraser #Flat oot Fraz# Smithafter winning an entry to the rally at the STRC Awards in January. Flying out the gates and onto their second lap on the first stage then pop, driveshaft burst. Towed in and sorted, both covered in CV Grease, they made it back out for a skid around and on a mission to tear up some old tarmac tyres.The Granite Stages, now held at RAF Leuchars would see Eoghan Anderson make ato the passenger seat for a hurl in the immaculate MK Escort of Martin Murray. Smiling ear to ear all day, with Bill eagerly awaiting histo the service area for the stage report, they finished th overall.Ian was out with Greg Inglisin his fluorescent Orange Lotus Exige and it was eyes on the prize for STRC points for Greg. A clean day saw Greg really getting to grips with the car on some surprisingly fast stages including a tickle of the limiter in fth saw the pair finish third overall.Back together and with the small repairs from the Speyside done it was time for the Furnace MK toto the woods. A steady run over the opening two stages, Dougie and Ian found their feet after the #off# at the Speyside sent them into service lying th. From seeing their overall position they knew they had to get back into it on the next stage, however on the road section to start stage three there was issues selecting gear and the pair decided to call it a day # damage limitation was the right call, as the input shaft was on its last legs.Jamie was back on the pace for this one, setting a th fastest stage time on the opening test. Sitting th overall heading into stage five was impressive given the competition on the day. Bad luck unfortunately, however, was to .Eoghan was again out with Martin in the MK for a blast. Sadly it was an early bath, retired after stage two but again, as always, enjoying every minute while it lasted.The Argyll rally had been known to have rough and challenging stages the previous two years. Not this time. Ian and Dougie couldn#t believe how good the stages were in comparison to previous years, an absolute joy of an event with the Escort not missing a beat all day on its #shakedown# for the big one. Valuable class points added to the scorecard too, with them ending the event nd overall. The rally had struggled with entries this year and will now run in  as a closed road rally, run by Mull Car Club.Team Mochrie were back together for this one in the Mightyagain and Innes was cutting some questionable shapes in the garage, performing his annual Mach rain dance. Taking chunks of time from his first passes of the stages would see them ring the #s neck and clinch th.Jamie#s luck had finally turned, the C singing all weekend and netting him a topper of th overall and th fastest over the final stage too.Duncan Maclean was back in the driving seat with Ian alongside, giving himself and the car a shakedown before Mull. The freshly rebuilt #blue bullet# was looking superb and managed to finish looking just as sweet. A couple of small teething problems were sorted on the day and the new main focus was to have power steering fitted before Mull # poor Dochy lost about a stone over two days with the effort needed to swing the wee pug around the #s and chicanes.In August Dougie and Ian competed on the Vetomies Rally. A national grade event run alongside the WRC Rally Finland event. Three other crews from Scotland also headed over to sample #the fastest rally in the world#. The stages were unbelievable. Fast, cresty, wide, flowing with a brilliantly smooth surface. The whole event was just surreal. The duo finished the event th overall and more importantly the fastest Scottish crew.Once the car had ed from Finland it was quickly jacked up, checked and loaded onto the trailer the same day for the journey north. Due to two DNFson the Speyside and Scottish, Dougie and Ian had to make the trip to be in with any chance of regaining their class lead in the SRC. Ending the day first in the class meant they were heading into the final round with the lead.Jamie was back out for another counting round of the STRC. Enjoying his day and pushing the wee C on in the blistering heat netted Jamie and co-driver Ian Mccullochrd overall. He must have been relaxed in the heat as in between stages he was off with the overalls and on with the baby lotion, topping up the tan.Ian was back out with Greg in the Lotus. Another fantastic drive from Greg, finishing ninth with the championship title race firmly the primary goal.The final round for the MK and an important one # a DNF here could see Dougie and Ian losing the class lead in the championship. A battle with their rival who they had been chasing all season, Paddy Munro, would come down to the last stage, as the pair were six seconds down on Paddy heading into the final test. Probably one of the duo#s best stages all year, the final push to claim the class honours came down to the finish of the last stage on the last rally of the year. One second! They had taken the class win and the championship.The first event this year for Craig Callander and son Ross would see them prepare Craig#s gravel spec Subaru Impreza at the last minute to take on their favourite event. The #Japanese Tractor# was a fair handful, a light steering alignment issue and a boost problem gave the pair some trouble although finishing th overall made up for the hassle. A fair result given Craig#s absence from tarmac for four years.Returning from the shed with his freshly painted Sunbeam was Alister Macarthur, this time with Claire Tilleyalongside. The freshly fettled #beam was looking and sounding good # crossing the finish th overall after two years out of the seat.Dochy and Ian were back out in the #blue bullet.# All was going well until they had a spin coming over a crest into a square left, losing the bumper and damaging the gear linkage. They managed to get the car back to the end of the Saturday afternoon leg to repair the gear linkage and almost stole the yellow bumper from the recce car until some legends appeared with the duo#s bumper in the back of their Land Rover. Back out onto the  mile #long one# on Saturday night and they had an issue # after a heavy landing over a crest the rear shocker bolt broke, making the car a handful to keep in a straight line. They had to finish another two stages before they could make it back to service, so a finish was all they wanted at this point # th overall and Dochys fourth finish in a row on Mull.Without doubt the driver to watch was Innes and his newly acquired co-driver Lewis Grfiths . The Mightywas spotted airborne at any chance, with the hydro can suspension screaming for a break at each service halt. It was almost all over as the nearside cv joint sheared and the car took a wild turn to the left # both Innes and Lewis thought they would end up IN the Belachroy pub. They managed to make it over the Lochs to the end of the final stage, claiming st overall.Eoghan was back out with Martin to settle the score from the DNF at the summer stages. Sadly a stage maximum time on stage two scuppered their chances of the overall result they were hoping for, however they did set some impressive times, clocking a th fastest time on the final stage.Jamie, back out for the final round of the STRC, was looking to continue his good run from the Pendragon and set a seventh fastest time on stage three in the extremely wet and tricky conditions. Trying to get his money#s worth from his entry fee Jamie, however, decided to take an extra couple of miles on the penultimate stage. Still, the C ran well all day and the conditions suited the car perfectly.Ian was back out with Greg and this time he was aiming to become the Scottish Tarmac Rally Champion for . They set off with five cars in the same class and they had to win the class to get Greg the honours. Setting the pace early they were leading throughout the event. Finishing the event first in their class and third overall meant the job was done # Greg claimed the championship win.The last event of the year saw Kirsty back in the co-drivers seat, gaining even more experience on her path to upgrading her licence. Some typical Knockhill weather was in store as Kirsty had her first taste of RWD rallying in the Mazda MX of Paul Sheard. Kirsty guided Paul around the very wet stages to claim th overall and some valuable points on the board for Paul#s Motorsport News Championship campaign.Special thanks to Alasdair MacConnell who has travelled many miles to don an orange bib and stand in the rain, wind and heat, all to show his support and play a vital part in any event.

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation. So on the day of the swap four operations took place and two needy people received le-giving new organs.Although not presently being considered in the UK, with the ethical issues sorted, this multi-swap procedure opens the way for extended chains of donors and many more lives saved.*Torres et al Am J transplant. :-."},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert club on target for 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe first competition of the new year at Tarbert Gun Club also served as the January leg of the club#s winter league.A full house of  teams turned out on Sunday January , and the early shooters had to put up eith windy conditions which made the clays dance.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community. More of the same meritorious awards for the ordinary people of Scotland please.Credit to all editors and staff for their outstanding journalism given over the years in all of Scotlands progressive, thriving local papers.Stephen Jones, Oban"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 3 2020 2","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThis week#s photograph whas been submitted by Tom Cullen of Ardfern.The serene scene was taken overlooking the Crinan estuary at about .am on Friday January ."},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead bowls into 2020","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Bowling Club launched into the new year with the first of its indoor singles competitions.Some  members played for the Argyll Arms Ardrishaig trophy on Saturday January  and after some great matches throughout the afternoon it was Alan Guy and Neil Ward that progressed to the final.In a closely fought final, Neil Ward edged the victory in the last end, winning -."},{"url":null,"title":"storm brendan the movie","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowA compilation of clips from ious points on the Mid Argyll coastline showing the impact of Storm Brendan on Monday January , .Even with less-than-Hollywood editing it#s pretty dramatic stuff."},{"url":null,"title":"tarberts senior citizens party the night away","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWet and windy weather failed to dampen the spirits of Tarbert’s seniors as they gathered in the village hall for the senior citizens# Christmas dinner.A large number of willing volunteers had organised a sumptuous meal and decked the hall with multi-coloured fairy lights and balloons to provide a warm welcome for their guests.The familiar venue quickly came alive with smiles, hugs and the happy chatter of friends gathering for this much-loved annual event which has been going for more than  years.Elma McGougan and Jean Johnston, who had served on the original organising committee, reminisced about their experiences, explaining they ran fund-raising events and that many in the village donated money and goods so the dinner could be provided free of charge.The event, held this year on Friday January , is still organised by a committee and continues to be generously supported by businesses and iniduals in the village and surrounding area.Elma said: #In the s, the women on the committee made soup and brought it along.

fire that destroyed a large part of the building last year.The replacement secondary, though, will take at least three years to build.But according to Scottish Borders Councilrsquos Chief Executive Tracey Logan, it is the only way forward for Peebles High.Although it is yet to be officially endorsed by the local authority, Ms Logan says her view is that apart from the Sports Complex and Millennium Wing, the entire school will be demolished and rebuilt.And that Peebles High will jump to the head of the queue in the rebuilding programme of schools - ahead of Galashiels, Hawick and Selkirk.But the Chief Executive told the towns Community Council she thinks Peebles should now be first on the priority list for a new school.Ms Logan explained: ldquoAt the moment my view is, and this is only my view, this has not even endorsed by the Council as yet, is that given the constraints that we have around what will be available financially, the Scottish Government have been really helpful in that they are offering their full support and we will make a bid late spring for funding through the schools programme.ldquoThere will obviously be a financial settlement from the insurance.\"But we need to find the best way forward, so my expectation is that we will retain the Sports Complex because it is undamaged and pretty new, we will also retain the Millennium Wing because again itrsquos not that old and is entirely usable.ldquoI would imagine that we will probably end up taking away everything  and replace it with something new.\"What that will look like, I have no idea. But what it will be is something that is modular that we can add ontowe need to for capacity and we will want to talk to the community about what  we might want to put into that site.A consultation will take place asking for local feedback on community space and the possible provision of health and social care.She added: ldquoSome people have said to me that they want to knock all of the school down including the fairly new bits, realistically that wonrsquot happen and itrsquos not the right thing to do. I think itrsquos important that we make sure people understand the parameters within which we are working so we can have some sensible conversations and that we try and accommodate as much as we can in there.Meanwhile, a major operation is underway to get the students back to their classrooms at the beginning of February.The Chief Executive said: ldquoWe put in arrangements for  plus pupils to be accommodated at locations in Peebles, Galashiels Academy and the Langlee complex.ldquoThat has been generally very successfully and the feedback from that has been positive. I absolutely acknowledge that itrsquos not perfect but it has done the job we needed it do to.Senior students are currently sitting prelim exams in the Sports Complex and this will continue until the end of January.Temporary classroom units are being erected within the school grounds and pupils are to be accommodated in unaffected areas of the building.ldquoThere are still huge amounts of work going on and we will go right up to the wire but Irsquom confident we will achieve it, added Ms Logan.The Council has decided on a phased approach with S to S students starting on Monday, February  and S to S working from home and ing the following day.Ms Logan said that there has been ldquocompromises in the education offer over the last few weeks but is assuring parents that from the beginning of February it will be ldquobusiness as usual.Demolition work on the damaged building has been completed and restricted access has been implemented.The council boss has assured parents that children will only be able to access safe routes throughout the school building.Ms Logan added: ldquoOne of the things we did lose in the fire was the vast majority of pupil toilets so what wersquove now got on site is the long term temporary arrangements supplemented over the course of January.To ensure pupil safety, traffic will enter the site from a new access via Craigerne Road located at the back of the school.Ms Logan is meeting with insurers this week to discuss a settlement figure which will help form the direction of the future of Peebles High School.She added: ldquoAll of what we are doing is going to be sustainable for whatever we do in terms of the proper rebuild.\"What Irsquom trying to reassure you is that wersquore not doing things that are very temporary, whatever we do, we will be looking to the future.Community councillor Graham Mackie commended the local authority on doing a ldquoremarkable job and said any criticism of the Council during this trying time was unnecessary.He said: ldquoIt has been thought for several years that we needed a completely new high school but possibly therersquos a silver lining here in that we can end up with a high school that will meet the needs of the current population.\"But the council chief told members that ldquoessentially this is the replacement.She explained: ldquoWhen it comes to looking at high schools and replacement we would always look to retain what is still workable.\"In the case of the bits we are talking about in terms of Peebles High site they are really not that old. The Millennium Wing meets the standards that would be required in a new building. There would be very little point in wasting money knocking down something that works really well.

say.Red dwarfs ndashthe most common type of stars in our Galaxy ndash are small stars, % to % the size of the Sun.Despite this, they are found to host giant planets up to  times bigger than the largest planet in the Solar System ndash Jupiter.The formation mechanism of these big planets remains a mystery.Giant planets around stars are thought to have formed by the gradual build up of dust particles to progressively bigger bodies.However, red dwarfs are tiny when compared to the Sun, and they do not seem to have enough material around them to form such big planets.But research from the University of Central Lancashirepublished in the Astronomy and Astrophysics Journal suggests giant planets could form around small stars much faster than previously thought.Dr Anthony Mercer and Dr Dimitris Stamatellos used the UK Distributed Research using Advanced Computingsupercomputing facility to simulate the evolution of protoplanetary discs around red dwarf stars.Protoplanetary discs are rotating structures of dense gas and dust found around all newly-born stars.Researchers found thatthese young discs are big enough, they can break up and form gas giant planets.This theory predicts the formation of giant planets happening within a few thousand years, a timescale which is extremely fast in astrophysical terms.Dr Mercer, who led the research, said: ldquoThe fact that planets may be able to form on such short timescale around tiny stars is incredibly exciting.ldquoOur work shows that planet formation is particularly robust: other worlds can form even around small stars in a iety of ways, and therefore planets may be more erse than we previously thought.According to the study, these planets are extremely hot when they form, with core temperatures reaching thousands of degrees.Planets that are so hot would be relatively easy to observe when they are still young.Without an internal energy source they become fainter with time, and the window of opportunity to directly observe them is very small.Nevertheless, they can still be indirectly observed by their effect on their host star.Co-author of the research Dr Stamatellos, astrophysicist in UCLanrsquos Jeremiah Horrocks Institute, added: ldquoThis was the first time that we were able not only to see planets forming in computer simulations but also to determine their initial properties with great detail.ldquoIt was fascinating to find that these planets are of the lsquofast and furiousrsquo kind ndash they form quickly and they are unexpectedly hot.Future observations of planets around very young red dwarf stars will test the predictions of this new theory.The research was funded by a PhD studentship from the Science and Technologies Facilities Council ..push,i[r].l*new

comes to nectar, sweeter is not necessarily better.Too much sugar slows down bees, taking up more of their energy, new research suggests.Bumblebees drink nectar from flowers, then offload it in their nest ndash by vomiting ndashfor use by other bees in the colony.Sugar in the nectar makes it appealing, and the more sugar within the nectar, the more energy it contains.However, nectar also gets thicker and stickier as the sugar content increases.This makes it more dficult for bees to drink and regurgitate ndash taking more time and energy, scientists say.The study published in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface, looked at the mechanics of both nectar drinking and regurgitation in one of the most common bumblebees in the UK ndash Bombus terrestris, or the buff-tailed bumblebee.Bees find nectar that is low in sugar easier to drink, and very easy to vomit back up.--vw,vw,px, px\"A bumblebee on a Dusky Cranesbill geranium plant --But as it gets more sugary, it gradually takes bees longer to drink, but swtly becomes much more dficult to vomit.Dr Jonathan Pattrick, formerly a PhD student based jointly at the University of Cambridgersquos departments of plant sciences and zoology, is the first author of the study.Now a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Oxfordrsquos Department of Zoology, he said: ldquoBumblebees must strike a balance between choosing a nectar that is energy-rich, but isnrsquot too time-consuming to drink and offload.ldquoNectar sugar concentration affects the speed of the beesrsquo foraging trips, so it influences their foraging decisions.The scientists say that while it has long been known that nectar with a higher sugar concentration takes bees longer to drink, its effect on nectar regurgitation has not previously received much attention.They hope the new insights will help researchers make better predictions about which types of nectar bumblebees and other pollinators should like best, and consequently the kinds of flowers and plants they are most likely to visit.This will inform crop breeders in producing the most appealing flowers for better crop pollination and higher yields.For the research, bees were allowed to forage on sugar solutions of three dferent concentrations in the Department of Plant Sciencersquos Bee Lab.While doing this, they were also timed and weighed.When the flying insects ed to their ldquonest, the researchers timed how long it took for them to vomit up the nectar they had collected.ldquoFor low strength nectar, bees had a quick vomit that only lasted a few seconds, then were back out and foraging again, said Dr Pattrick.He added: ldquoBut for really thick nectar they took ages to vomit, sometimes straining for nearly a minute.For any given nectar concentration, bees regurgitate the nectar quicker than they initially drink it.Dr Pattrick said: ldquoItrsquos hard to drink a thick, sticky liquid, but imagine trying to spit it out again through a straw ndash that would be even harder.ldquoAt a certain sugar concentration, the energy gain versus energy loss is optimised for nectar feeders.Scientists say the perfect nectar sugar concentration for the highest energy intake depends on the species drinking it, because dferent species feed in dferent ways.The research was funded by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council..push,i[r].l*new

This is a fascinating and picturesque structure from the th century, which lies semi-hidden amongst the trees that cling onto the steep sides of the slope.Dunglass is such a beautul area, and the ancient Dunglass Collegiate Church, dating from the th century, is one of its architectural jewels. Itrsquos open to the elements now, but well preserved and a popular place for weddings.The castle that once stood nearby is long gone. A more modern house sits on the spot where a mansion once stood, and before that the castle. Being on the main route south, the castle inevitably saw action during the ious times of war with England, being burned and damaged on a number of occasions in the s.But in August , the castle was effectively blown up in a huge explosion, and a version of events emerged which placed the blame on a vengeful servant called Edward Paris.It was a time of war and religious rage. Thomas the nd Earl of Haddington was leading a Covenanting force charged with defending this important route from the south, as the Covenanting army had entered England a few days earlier. He had established his force at Dunglass Castle, an obvious strategic location, to defend the armyrsquos rear.On that fateful day, August , , he was said to be in conversation with some fellow nobles when a huge explosion erupted from the vaults, instantly demolishing the central part of the castle which became little more than a pile of debris.Thomas and many others were killed, their bodies pulled from the rubble. They had been crushed by the collapse of the walls in the explosion.History has repeatedly recorded the names of the nobles killed on that day, but there were many others, as the castle was busy and full of people. Fty-four unnamed lsquocommon servantsrsquo were killed, and more than  other people badly injured, some later dying of their injuries.Edward Paris was Thomasrsquos servant and he has been blamed for this tragedy. The th-century writer Andrew Stevenson claimed Edward had the keys to the vault in which huge amounts of gunpowder had been stored, and he had been ldquoseduced by the enemies of the covenant to commit this act. He was an Englishman and another account says he was incensed at derogatory remarks made by Thomas about his countrymen.Irsquove always thought this explanation never really had the ring of truth. It was initially deemed an accident, and the story of Edwardrsquos role emerged later, instigated by a writer called William Lithgow, a man who had certain axes to grind. In one account, Edward is said to have thrust a hot poker into the gunpowder or set fire to it. The detail of this is suspect in itself, for who survived as a witness to this act  I suspect that a dreadful accident, possibly caused by incompetence and carelessness, was turned into a deliberate act of vengeance as it made a more useful explanation.Of course, it is very possible that Edward was offended or annoyed at things said by his master, and perhaps he mentioned this at some stage, later to be used as evidence of his guilt. But in truth, most servants will have seen or heard things which will have offended them, it was a part of their job.Imagineservants had been able to write and publish the things they had overheard and seen, what dferent historical narratives we would have!Motives for wanting to interpret the cause of the explosion in this way can be guessed at. It was a time of atrocity and massacre, with religious, political and national hatreds. Who was responsible for the dangerous stockpiling of the gunpowder in such a manner  It seems just too easy to blame a disgruntled servant. Even later, when writing up this period, religious and political loyalties influenced interpretation.If Edward Paris really did venture down to the vaults of Dunglass Castle on that fateful day, with the intention of committing suicide in order to kill his master, along with dozens of others, then he must have been infected with a deep hatred, as well as a total disregard for the lives of his fellow servants and his own.The truth is we will never know what really happened. But Edward Paris is a servant whose name we know. Countless numbers of so-called lsquocommon servantsrsquo whose lives and fates are deemed unimportant by history remain unrecorded just as the things they witnessed remain absent from our history books.Irsquove often thought it would be fascinating to meet Edwardrsquos ghost and ask him what really happened on that day.Silly idea, of course, but you never know."},{"url":null,"title":"public-exhibition-held-plans-revive-dunbars-east-beach","story":"Dunbarrsquos East Beach, which hosts the townrsquos annual Loony Dook, was once a magnet for tourists but the disappearance of its golden sands over the years due to coastal erosion has led to fewer visitors.East Lothian Council has already been given permission for the first phase of work on the beach, which it is hoped will help sandwhile also protecting the shore.A public exhibition detailing plans for a second phase of work ndash and the project overall ndash takes place in Dunbarrsquos Bleachingfield Centre on Monday afternoon.Pippa Swan, chairwoman of the townrsquos community council, explained the desire to see the beach restored to how it was previously.She said: ldquoIt has been a long-held ambition.ldquoPeople reminisce about how wonderful the beach was and there has been a lot of disappointment that it has been so rocky for so long.Dave Northcott, East Lothian Council structural engineer and project leader, visited the community council shortly before Christmas to outline the plans.Consent is already in place for the construction of a breakwater at the southern end of East Beach.Refurbishment of the existing groyne at the same end of the beach has also been approved, alongside the placement of rock armour at the toe of the seawall.

He was said to have been martyred at sea with an anchor round his neck and was therefore regarded as the patron saint of sailors. The cult of Clement spread to Scandinavia in about the th century and then to Britain.ldquoSt Clements Wells were probably named by Scandinavians living in the Tranent area.ldquoWe know they were here because of the presence of a powerful landholder of likely Scandinavian descent, Thor of Tranent, son of Swain, who is mentioned in many th-century charters. He held extensive lands in the area and granted the church of Tranent to Holyrood Abbey.Mr Hadden said: ldquoI am sure the new stone sculptures will add another piece of culture to our area when in place to the east and west sides of Wallyford alongside those we have already.ldquoThese include the mining memorial stone and coal hutches located at St Clements Housing estate just off Salters Road, the  mining stones at the Wallyford Bing, a community woodland depicting dferent mining scenes, and also the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh memorial at the west side of Wallyford.The shapes and patterns proposed relate to the themes of the wells, water, ripples, distilling, agriculture and the sense of space and open skies of the site as it is now. The overall idea is that the artwork reflects past, present and future heritages of the area.There will also be two St Clements Wells name  per entrance in stone, either hand carved or sandblasted.The idea for a stone village sign for Wallyford is also being explored in a design reflecting the ideas of crossing a river or burn by a ford.A spokesman for East Lothian Developments said: ldquoEast Lothian Developments are delighted to be working with Susheila and James to deliver ious artworks at St Clements Wells.ldquoThey have shown real enthusiasm and creativity with the ideas they have brought forward to capture something of the history of St Clements Wells and design pieces which we hope will do justice to the entrances of the development, and spark interest from all those who will pass them.ldquoWe were very grateful to the community council for their comments and input to the designs.Elaine Di Troia was appointed vice-chairman at the AGM, Sharon Jamieson secretary and Beryl Stevenson treasurer.

Christmas time had been dficult because it was the first Christmas without her granny, who had died earlier in the year. But now she was back at school and into the routine with her friends.Her parents had hoped this would help, but her sense of loss was still overwhelming for her. Perhaps at her age she didnrsquot understand exactly what was going on inside, but all she knew was that her granny shersquod loved was gone and she missed her.Then one evening during a bedtime story, Jessica started to cry and told her dad that her granny was melting like a snowman. At first he wasnrsquot sure what she meant, but then he understood.Jessicarsquos memory of her granny was fading. This was a second loss for her. The first loss was of her grannyrsquos physical presence, her actual hugs, her voice and care and love, even the smell of her perfume. Now Jessica was losing her memory of all this and she knew it. So she felt that something inside her was melting too, something that had been so much of her was vanishing.And this made Jessica fear that others in her le could disappear and then melt away as well, even her dad or mum. It was a terrying thought and it made her not just sad but scared and insecure inside.Her dad tried to reassure her that he or her mum werenrsquot going to die, but despite being only six years old, Jessica now knew that such promises couldnrsquot be kept forever.ldquoNana didnrsquot want to die either, but she did. And now shersquos melting.The next day at school was another dficult one for Jessica, and home time often didnrsquot make it better because in the past it had usually been her granny whorsquod picked her up.Her dad was waiting for her.ldquoWe are not going straight home today, he told her.ldquoWhere are we going ldquoTo Nanarsquos seat.A cloud suddenly came over Jessica. She didnrsquot say anything and just looked at the ground. This was a seat that overlooked the sea, where her gran had often taken her. They would sit together and look out to the Firth, spotting boats and looking for whales, while eating sweeties.Her dad had realised that Jessica hadnrsquot been there since the death of her grandmother.ldquoOnlyyou want to, he said.Jessica was silent and looked at the ground. Inside, her emotions were spinning. Then she looked up.ldquoI donrsquot want to, it will just make me sad, she said to her dad. So they didnrsquot go.But later that day, Jessica began to talk about Nanarsquos seat. ldquoShe always gave me sweeties and wersquod look for whales and pirates. She told me a story about how a pirate once landed here at Prestonpans, but he didnrsquot leave treasure, he just built the town.ldquoGreat story, said her dad.The next day, Jessica agreed to go to her nanarsquos seat. When they arrived, she hesitated to sit and had a wave of emotion.ldquoI miss Nana, she saidldquoSo do I. Shall we sit on her seat and miss her together.ldquoBut we have to eat sweeties.ldquoJust so happens Irsquove got some in my pocket, said the dad with a smile. His daughter smiled back and sat on the seat. Her dad joined her.ldquoNo, dad, that was Nanarsquos place, you sit this side instead.And so they sat, missing Nana together, being sad together, but also remembering her together.ldquoCan you tell me the story about the pirate  asked the dad.ldquoDonrsquot want to.ldquoOK, maybe next time.The next day, they ed to Nanarsquos seat. This time, Jessica told a bit of the pirate story. The dad remembered it from his childhood and realised that his own grief in losing his mother had closed him down to talking about her. It had felt too painful.He began to sit on lsquoNanarsquos seatrsquo by himself when Jessica was at school, even though he had never done it with his mother when she was alive he had always been lsquotoo busy to watch the sea with her.

At home, they made a special box with drawings and photos of memories, and things that reminded Jessica of her gran. Theyrsquod take them out and tell stories and share memories. Her dad even began to tell funny stories about his mum from when before Jessica was born, when he was a boy.lsquoNanarsquos boxrsquo was put in a safe place, but where Jessica could take itshe wanted to. As time passed, she opened it less, but it was always in her room. Sometimes she would put things in it, such as shells from the beach, because her granny had loved beautul shells.The loss of a loved one can never be completely moved on from, so there were always going to be times of sadness.

But Boris Johnson now has an -seat majority, so therersquos not a cat in hellrsquos chance that Westminster would agree to Scotland seceding from the Union. Which raises the question of what to do next.Alex Neil, the former Scottish minister, says Sturgeon should press ahead anyway. So whatWestminster ignores the referendum result, he says. It would stand as a measure of the Scottish peoplersquos will. ldquoThe political argument would be, he said on BBC radio, ldquowersquove won.It is going to be very dficult for the First Minister to disagree. But that is probably what shersquoll do. Her argument has anyway changed recently. She is not actually arguing for an immediate referendum any more, but for Holyrood to be given the power to call a referendum in future.That is harder for Boris Johnson to reject, but reject it he has. No referendum for now or in the foreseeable future. Do your worst. Itrsquos not going to happen.If Sturgeon takes the OrsquoNeill advice and holds a consultative referendum, the UK Government will reject it as invalid. The non-nationalist parties will advise unionists to boycott it, as unionists did in the  Catalonian referendum. This would fatally undermine its legitimacy.Nationalists might say: a result is a result. Why bother about people who wonrsquot vote  What about the force of democratic opinion  But it is naiumlve to believe that Westminster parties will respond positively to any unauthorised referendum.Earlier this week, Lisa Nandy, one of the leading Labour leadership contenders, told The Andrew Neil Show that the UK should look to Catalonia for lessons on how to beat ldquoisive nationalism.We are assured that Nandy did not mean that riot policy should be used against peaceful demonstrators or that elected Scottish politicians should be locked up. But it was still an astonishing remark.:Alistair Grant: Scotlands endless Indyref Groundhog Day is going nowhere fastPost-Brexit, metropolitan attitudes have hardened markedly against independence and ldquoisive nationalism. Nicola Sturgeon will eventually have to recognise that the Westminster route to independence is barred for the foreseeable future.The precedent of the  Edinburgh Agreement will not necessarily be recognised following Brexit. Britainrsquos departure from the EU has changed the game.In , no-one thought the UK would be leaving the EU. Scotland and England would be remaining in the European Single Market and the Customs Union even after independence. Not any more. There would now be the question of a hard border at Gretna.But more importantly, the Global Britain project would be fatally damagedthe UK were to lose one-third of its landmass, most of its hydrocarbons and all its nuclear weapons. Itrsquos just not gonna happen. We are in a dferent era.The UK state can no longer afford to endorse Scotlandrsquos departure from the Union. Even Labour is now locking the door. This means there is not going to be a legal indyref, possibly for a very long time. Not after , probably not after .Brexit Britain will not let Scotland go, unless there is overwhelming support for independence, which frankly there isnrsquot. Nicola Sturgeon may insist that the will of the people will triumph in the end. That there is no point in holding referendums that donrsquot mean anything.But she canrsquot in all honestly keep telling her troops that indyref is round the corner.

Thompson was on The Andrew Marr Show yesterday. He was deemed such a VIP the producers showed footage of him arriving at New Broadcasting House in London, an honour usually reserved for visiting Prime Ministers and the like. Not that you would confuse Mr Thompson with a politician: the Starbucks coffee cup marked him out as an easy like Sunday morning meeja type.: Unionist boycott should not invalidate voteMarr began by flattering his former boss. When Thompson arrived at the NYT it was an old fashioned news empire in pretty ropey shape, he said, ldquoa classic case of the inevitable decline of the mainstream media. But Thompson had turned things around, doubling revenue and attracting five million subscribers. How Three things, said Thompson. First, they took on  more journalists to boost content. ldquoIf you can be dferent, and this in a way is the Netflix tactic, pour money into content, make great content, then yoursquoll get customers. Next, more hiring: this time of software engineers. Third, the running of the main print paper was given over to a handful of people.With the Sunday papers full of Harry and Meghan leaving the UK to spend most of their time in North America, Thompson was askedthe couple could expect a quieter time from the media there. ldquoMuch of the American press is much more high-minded than the British press, he said, showing he has not lost the ability, common in BBC director generals, of getting right up the noses of the red tops.Thompson was visiting just as the BBC is living through another period of interesting times. There were murmurings from the Conservatives during the General Election about decriminalising non-payment of the licence fee and forcing the BBC not to scrap free TV licences for the over-s. Now the party has a large majority it is in a position to make its threats real.: Question Time row rumbles onDecriminalising would cost the BBC pound-pound million, Thompson estimated. Something  was going on, he feared. ldquoI worry that decriminalisation is a de facto beginning of the abolition of the licence fee but without the courage to say that, and put it out to the public to say whether or not they want a properly funded BBC or not.As for scrapping free licences for the over-s, Thompson recalled the same idea being put to him by the Coalition Government. ldquoThey came with a drop dead, wersquore going to do this, back in .Thompson walked out of the meeting and got on the train home to Oxford. On the way he started to mentally compose his resignation letter.The phone went: it was Jeremy Hunt, then Culture Secretary, asking him toand continue talking.Years later, when the Conservatives won a majority on their own, the Chancellor behind the first proposal, George Osborne, came calling again. This time he got his way. By then, Thompson was in New York.Back to the present day and talk of the future. The BBC, like all ldquolegacy media had to attract a younger audience, said Thompson. ldquoIf we donrsquot radically change and start thinking about the audience of the future the risk is we age out with a given generation of people and we all are beaten by companies like Netflix.Commercial media in the UK, like in most European countries, was in ldquoreal trouble, said Thompson, with local journalism in danger of disappearing. If you were waiting to hear him tackled on the BBCrsquos part in commercial mediarsquos woes, hard luck.: How local is your MPThompsonrsquos time at the head of the BBC coincided not just with introducing ratings giants such as Strictly Come Dancing and Sherlock, and presiding over successes such as the iPlayer. Under his watch the BBC used public money, the licence fee, to fund a massive expansion into digital, taking readers and advertisers from local papers. Yet there was no reference to this, which was disappointing from Marr, who started out in Scottish papers.Nor was there specic mention of Scotland. Instead, Thompson mused about how the BBC could help the government. ldquoWhen I listen to the new prime minister talking about his plans to really get serious about investing in the Midlands and the north, and to start projecting this countryrsquos talent, ideas, its potential to the entire world, I think of the BBC and Channel  as potentially great allies in that.Doubtless Channel , whose flagship news show, like the Today programme, is being frozen out by Downing Street, will have something to say about that."},{"url":null,"title":"Marianne Taylor  Megxit - the scary post-Brexit home truths","story":"Clearly, Harry and Meghan arenrsquot so much stepping back from royal le as checking out completely, with a flick of the Vs that could be taken to signy peace, victory or what those of us fluent in Parliamo Glasgow would recognise as ldquoget it up ye.:Harry and Meghan will not use HRH titles or get royal funds - palaceSafe to say I wonrsquot be spending too much time fretting over the future happiness of this super-rich celebrity couple.

And it ainrsquot pretty. In fact, itrsquos getting downright scary, especially as every week the narrative seems to sht closer to the isive and damaging - but also very deliberate - culture wars being waged in Trumprsquos America.We witnessed this first hand over the last couple of weeks with the grim spectacle of groups of well-spoken middle class white men, mostly of a certain age, being rounded up and brought into television studios to sit on sofas next to black women and explain to them not only what racism is and is not, but also why theirlived experiences of it are worthless. And, when the women speakers pointed out the irony and injustice of this set-up  Calm down dear, yoursquore getting hysterical.Question Time provided perhaps the most eye-watering example of this when actor Lawrence Fox - who had been invited to sit in the ldquovoice of the people chair - unleashed a shocking but very revealing attack on a mixed-race member of the audience who suggested Meghan Marklersquos treatment by the media and others had been racist.:The curse of the House of Windsor: how love has torn apart the royal familyMr Fox, a Harrow-educated member of an established acting dynasty known for his role in the detective series Lewis, tore into the woman - who it turns out is an academic researcher in race and ethnicity - talking over her, aggressively calling the suggestion of racism ldquoboring, adding imperiously: ldquoWersquore the mostly tolerant, lovely country in the world.\" The actor compounded matters by using the tired and predictable ldquoyoursquore the racist defence when quite reasonably questioned on how a spfing white chap like him could be so sure about what racism is and is not.:Netflix chief confirms interest in deal with Harry and MeghanI donrsquot doubt that from Mr Foxrsquos privileged perch, Britain is indeed tolerant and lovely. It is certainly still tolerant of and shockingly reverent towards posh types like him who ignorantly and arrogantly skip through le with a wealthy family to pick them upthings donrsquot go their way. Laughably, most of the similar types Irsquove met in le honestly believe they earn their opportunities on merit.The ennui of privilege, eh  They tend to be bored with uppity totty of all races, of course. Theyrsquore probably terribly fed up with feckless poor people banging on about foodbanks, and moany, chippy Jocks, too.Itrsquos the soaring confidence of such attacks and pronouncements that really concerns me, however, the increasingly loud and proud tone of them, the whf of US right-wing s like Fox News, Breitbart and One American News Network.Indeed, rather than apologising or stepping back from his embarrassingly outburst on Question Time, Mr Fox, who has been roundly criticised by his profession, saw fit to launch a defence of his actions, including a barrage of mocking, wince-inducing tweets packed with right-wing US tropes around ldquoliberals and ldquowokeness. Whatrsquos going on  We simply wouldnrsquot have tolerated such behaviour in public  years ago.But with Boris Johnson in Number , a man who defends his writings about ldquopiccaninnies with ldquowater melon smiles, ldquobum boys ldquogirly swats and how voting Tory will ldquogive your we bigger breasts, I suppose such behaviour has both permission and a champion.Make no mistake, the faction of the Tory party that has taken over Britain in the wake of Brexit will revel in and stoke culture wars of this kind. It feels threatened by attacks on pale, male stale dominance, of course. But such isiveness also works as the ultimate distraction technique, stealing our focus away from the deliberate running down of public services, the re-writing of the social contract.And so far itrsquos working a treat."},{"url":null,"title":"lifetime-bans-gobby-cinema-theatre-goers","story":"\"Youve just had a McDonalds.\"\"Im hungry now.

Hate to break it to you, chum, but its been going for the past  minutes.\"When will they stop dancing \" Oh pal, did no one tell you  Buckle in, because theyre not stopping.The woman next to us very politely turns round and shushes them. It does no good. They are out for the afternoon, they are going to make a loud and long fuss over a Capri Sun and they are going to keep talking about their hunger levels for the entire performance.Its not long before another woman brings her mobile phone out and starts taking photographs of the stage.A trip to the cinema long ago became an interesting gamble to see, notsomeone would talk all the way through the film, but how many people would talk all the way through the film.There should be a points system devised to at least make a fun game out of what is a rotten situation. Only one point for talking as its hardly worth mentioning now. Two points for checking the time on their brightly lit mobile phone. Three points for checking Facebook or searching a website.Four points for taking a phone call during the movie. And five points for taking a selfie with the flash on.I earned  points at a screening of Its a Wonderful Le a few days before Christmas. I believe people have, generally, become more inconsiderate as going out to the cinema has become cheaper. Cinema loyalty cards are a brilliant idea but, when youre not physically handing over cash for a ticket, it feels less important an experience. Folk behave as though theyre in their living rooms.\"Do you want some of this flask of tea \" called one of a family of six along the row behind us at Its A Wonderful Le. There was lots of chat in reply about said flask. The two youngest members of the family talked incessantly about nothing. Two older women with them were similarly having a right old chinwag. My friend asked the two younger ones to please be quiet. They ignored the request and kept going.\"Shut up!\" shouted someone from along the row. I cracked towards the end of the film and askedthey could please, please be quiet for just five minutes. \"Well try two and see how we get on,\" said the older woman, sarcastically, as the young adults sniggered. \"So rude,\" snapped the other older woman, to me. Its meant to be a nicer crowd at the Glasgow Film Theatre but standards have clearly slipped.The two women spent the last minutes of the film having a bellowing sing-a-long. It was bonkers but bog standard cinema behaviour.Back to the theatre though, and I was gutted at the ballet being utterly ruined.Ballet is not an art form thats for everyone. But even with bored children - and I do sympathise - its a good le lesson to learn to sit politely and be aware of your impact on other people. Its brilliant to get children interested and involved in the theatre but its one thing to be talking about the performance and another to just chat away like youre in your house.Its time to take a stand rather than just moaning about it after the fact. Complain, complain, complain to venues as the inconsiderate behaviour is happening.Venues: Can we have ushers, please  If people cant behave then they need babysat. And take a one strike approach. One complaint and youre out.Theatre and the cinema are secular churches, places where we gather together socially to think about about society, culture, experiences other than our own.

But where does that get us, in the end, other than to the point where certain people are effectively prohibited from talking about certain issues in polite society I confess that I thought twice about choosing this topic for this column for precisely that reason. It will give me nothing but trouble. Irsquoll get tweets and emails which wonrsquot be nice to read, and for which a thick skin will be required.:Queen lsquosupportiversquo of lsquonew lersquo for Harry and MeghanHowever, I canrsquot accept that here in Britain, which has spread freedom of speech all over the world, we should be fearful of practising it ourselves.In truth, I donrsquot knowBritain is a racist country. I instinctively recognise Britain as a global leader in tolerance and integration, but self-criticism is integral to ensuring that it doesnrsquot become complacent.I suppose it depends on onersquos definition. Are there racists  Of course, but that would make every country in the world racist by definition, and there is a good argument to be made that the digital loudspeaker of social media has brought into public the behaviour that was always taking place amongst a small minority in private.But those people are the lowest of our society, and Irsquom not sure we can label our country according to their behaviour. So is there, then, racist-enabling behaviour by people who should know better  Yes, and of course the oft-quoted example is Boris Johnsonrsquos ldquoletter-boxes description of Muslim women wearing the Niqab. I do not think that the Prime Minister is racist, but I do think that people in a lofty position need to understand the effect that their language could have on the way others behave.What we are insinuating in the case of the Duchess, though, is altogether dferent. We are saying that Britain is an institutionally racist country. With that I confess, I have some trouble.In deconstructing her media coverage, there are elements of no doubt and elements of doubt.It is of no doubt that her coverage has, since her wedding, been diametrically opposed to that of her sister-in-law the Duchess of Cambridge. Thatrsquos perfectly obvious, and those who hold up a mirror to the sympathetic ndash some might say sycophantic ndash coverage Kate received when she ldquolovingly cradled her baby bump, comparing it to the ldquowhy canrsquot Meghan stop touching her bump  headlines are correct. There is no shortage of other examples.That the coverage is dferent is in no doubt. But, surely, we are capable of having a deeper and calmer conversation about why the coverage is dferent. Because we have jumped a step here. We have said the headlines are dferent , ergo the British press is racist . We have not analysed why the coverage is dferent .Now, it is imperative that as part of our considerations of step two we include race. Becausethe Duchess of Sussexrsquos media coverage is dferent to that of the Duchess of Cambridge because of her race, then that is a matter of national seriousness which would require a seismic response.:From crowns to contracts...what lies ahead for Harry and Meghan Butit is not because of that ndashit is for entirely unrelated reasons ndash then it is dangerous for us to blindly accept that it is.What other reasons might there be Well, let us remember that when the relationship began her media coverage was excellent indeed it was seen universally as being a welcome development that Harry was in a relationship with a person of mixed race.But the press then began to believe that Meghan Markle is not a royalist. Right or wrong, they now see someone who doesnrsquot love or respect the traditions of the Royal Family, who doesnrsquot enjoy her role within it, who doesnrsquot relish being an understudy to the more senior members of it, and who acts out the ldquoDuchess Dficult persona in reality.For the record, I am not a Royalist either. Although Irsquom not hugely exercised by the existence of the Royals or their role in our constitution, I am a republican. Butthere is one thing around which the British press unites it is its Royalism. So perhaps it is little wonder it takes a dimmer view of the Duchess of Sussex than it does of the Duchess of Cambridge.And herersquos the critical point. If that is why the press treats her badly, then that may be unfair, but it is not racist because it has nothing to do with her race. When the Duchess of Cornwall, for instance, endured years, decades, of negative coverage, self-evidently nobody suspected the press had a race issue.I know the press Irsquove worked with them for the best part of two decades. I need to be persuaded that journalists and headline writers have Meghan Marklersquos skin colour in their minds when they are writing about her.ButI am wrong, then letrsquos hear it.

The first CABs in  were in Glasgow, Aberdeen, Stirling and Dundee.Post-war period: Against expectations, the end of the war brought an increased demand. CABs dealt with more enquiries than at the height of the blitz. Housing problems and family breakdowns increased. To meet this demand, the number of CABs began to prolerate.The advent of Legal Aid and the NHS led to a surge in enquiries.s: Housing problems continued to grow as people struggled with the housing shortage, overcrowding, and the end of rent controls.Hire purchase promised le on the ‘never-never.’ For many this led to mounting debts.s: Rents were rocketing, yet many people were still living in slum conditions and homelessness was rising. By  housing problems accounted for a quarter of the . million problems dealt with by CABs across the UK.Divorce reform too led to a surge in enquiries, with family problems representing  per cent of the CAB workload.s: Family, housing and benefit problems remained the top priority, but the consumer boom saw personal debt soar too.

I think I finally wore him out!”Sharon was tasked with cleaning out cages, the floors and vans.“They gave me all the dirty jobs to try put me off, but it didn’t work,” she said.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.stornowaygazette webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Heros welcome...family and friends met Mark Calder at the Forth Bridges to celebrate his achievement, on the final leg of his mammoth Running Home  challenge.\"  Scottish charity worker surpasses his £, Running Home target viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"STOR | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"STOR | Article Teaser\"A year later, she worked at the centre every weekend and during the school holidays, earning her first wage of £ per fortnight in February .She has remained with the SSPCA ever since, albeit moving up the ranks!But Sharon never ever wanted to become an inspector for her the job was all about working with the animals in their care.She said: “I’ve always had a love and passion for animals but didn’t just want to have a pet I wanted to work with and help look after them.“Originally, I thought of becoming a vet but when you start having boyfriends, that goes out the window!“I already had a job with the SSPCA which I loved anyway so I just decided to work there instead.“I never wanted to be an inspector, though, because to me the best bit of the job is helping animals that come in to us and then seeing them rehomed. “That to me has always been more fulfilling than dealing with what the inspectors have to tackle.“They don’t have much contact with the animals once they take them to the centres so that was never going to be my job.”After leaving school, Sharon became a kennel maid at the Rosebank Centre.In , she became the manager and three years later she oversaw the move to bigger premises at Petterden where she remained at the helm until .She then moved to the SSPCA’s HQ in Dunfermline as the superintendent.She now oversees all the centres across Scotland which, while involving a lot of paperwork and staffing issues, still enables her to build relationships with the animals in their care.For it is a love of animals that has led Sharonto devote the last  years to the SSPCA – and she plans to continue for a few years yet.She joked: “I’ve told my husband David that I’m going to retire in three years’ time, once I’ve worked with the SSPCA for  years. If I get to  that will be it. “ButI still have my health, I might just carry on for another few years...”It’s clear that leaving the SSPCA would be a huge wrench for Sharon so I wouldn’t put bets on her leaving in three years!During her time with the society, Sharon and David have had two boys, Ronnieand Greg . They also have a grandson, Ronnie jnr who is now .But Sharon also brought her work home with her and the couple are now also “mum and dad” to three dogs, two of which Sharon hand-reared, and three cats.“There’s always one or two that pull at your heart-strings,” she said, by way of explanation for their very own menagerie!However, there’s one dog which she didn’t adopt which also brings a tear to her eye.“A wee puppy came in with PAVO virus whom we called Paddy,” she recalled.“He was a wee black and white lurcher type who was at death’s door.“I stayed in the kennels with him for three or four nights and, at one point, he did actually die.“We resuscitated him though and after about eight weeks we got him back on his feet and rehomed.“Seven years later, I was doing my shopping in Dundee when I heard this commotion.“This dog squeezed itself out of a passenger window, ran across the road and jumped right into my arms.“It was Paddy the police officer who rehomed him was on the opposite side of the street from me but the dog saw me, remembered me and was determined to come and say hello.“It was amazing that he remembered me after all that time – they don’t forget the kindness you show them.“A lot of the animals we care for are more than happy to come back for visits with us. They realise its a sanctuary for them so they are more than happy to come back and say hello.“I’ll always remember that day with Paddy though in . He’s now long gone but I’ll never forget him.”Sharon has witnessed many changes over the years and longs for the day when people finally stop being cruel to their animals.However, she knows that, until that day, the SSPCA will be there to help them.She added: “Behind every animal, there’s a human story too.“The biggest problem, other than cruelty cases, that we see is people with mental health issues.“They love their animals but maybe start with a pregnant cat, keep all the kittens and then end up with  or  in their home.“They can’t bear to be parted with them and end up in a dficult situation.“It’s heart-breaking to hear some of those human stories but, at the end of the day, we are here to look after the animals.“Over the years, I’ve seen thousands and thousands of animals who have been nursed back to good health and rehomed.“I’m really, really lucky. Not many people can say they’ve worked in their dream job for  years but I still wake up every day and feel blessed.”SSPCA could not operate without generosity of the publicToday, the SSPCA has nine animal rescue and rehoming centres and a world-leading wildle rescue centre at Fishcross in Clackmannanshire.The charity receives no government funding and relies on donations and grants to continue its work. The public funds the SSPCA’s £ million budget annually.That covers the cost of  employees, including  inspectors,  ambulance drivers and the -strong team at its centres across Scotland and its wildle sanctuary. The SSPCA is the only animal charity in the UK able to report animal cruelty cases to the Crown, with reports sent to the Procurator Fiscal Service.In , it found homes for  rescued animals, helped more than  wildle casualties and spoke to more than , children through its educational programmes.For every pound it receives, p is spent on animal welfare, p on fundraising and promotion and p on administration.So you can rest assured that the bulk of any donation you make will make a huge dference to the animals in the SSPCA’s care.Last year, its animal helpline received almost a quarter of a million calls, the inspectorate attended more than , incidents and more than , animals were cared for across its nine rescue and rehoming centres and at the national wildle rescue centre.To find out more or donate, visit www.scottishspca.org."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish charity worker surpasses his 50 000 running home target","story":"Even Mark Calder wasn#t surehe#d be able to pull off his mammoth  challenge. In January last year, we featured his incredible aim to run  ultramarathons along some of Scotland’s ancient pilgrim routes.The Running Home  challenge combined his two passions – running and his work with charity Embrace the Middle East, for which he is regional manager for Scotland and the north of England.He hoped to raise £, to rebuild war-torn areas of Iraq while covering the  miles, gathering support and funds along the way.While there were times when Mark didn’t think he’d see the finish line, he successfully completed the challenge.He also surpassed his fundraising tally – with £, currently banked.And he’s hopeful that even more funds will be amassed before he travels to Iraq this spring to see it put to good use.Marksaid: “There were occasions when I wanted to go home.“I knew,I was to quit, I was going home to a nice, comfortable house. The people I was running for don’t have that option.“That was a monumental reason to keep going.”Mark had extraordinary support along the way, not least from his crew – Gareth Brocklebank and Andrew Clarke – who followed him in a camper van, which also acted as shelter in areas where overnight BB stays were not an option.Mark’s we Karen and his two daughters also cheered him every step of the way as did many strangers.“People welcomed me into their churches and communities and generously donated large sums of money,” he said.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.fetoday webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Zimeng with piano teacher Sister Avril and trustee Maggie Picken.\"  Fe charity marks  years helping blind people viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"FFPL | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"FFPL | Article Teaser\"“I was invited to speak in venues I would never have been able to reach in my day job, Iona Abbey being one.“It was a fantastic way to spread the word about Embrace the Middle East.“I look back on it not with a sense of pride, but rather relief – and gratitude for the people and places I encountered along the way.”Divine inspiration also came from a meeting with Father Emanuel Youkhana, a Christian minister who works in Dohuk in Iraq to bring Christians, Muslims and Yazidis together.Mark said: “To see his energy and enthusiasm for what we were doing was a massive inspiration.“That was at the end of Run , the St Ninian run, when I was at my most tired.“To have that intervention made a really big dference.”That particular run had loomed large in Mark’s mind it was the equivalent of running three marathons each day for seven days.Remarkably, though, he only lost one day to ill-health throughout the year.“I’ve learned that your body can adapt to whatever is thrown at it,” said Mark.“I wasn’t sureI’d be able to make it to the end of that run but when I hobbled over the finish line, that’s when I knew I could do it.”The darkest day of the challenge was undoubtedly in June during the St Columba run from Inchcolm Abbey to Iona Abbey.“It was one of the most interesting runs in terms of scenery, with just about every landscape Scotland has to offer,” he said.“There was a long, unsupported section just north of Oban. I was feeling great but, within ten minutes, a niggle turned into barely being able to walk.“I had to find a couple of sticks from the woods to use as shin splints.”However, it was an earlier, shorter run – St Cuthbert’s in March – which cost Mark a full day and also taught him a very valuable lesson.“I wanted to run from Melrose to Lindisfarne, where I planned to stay overnight, but I had to be there for a certain time due to the tide restrictions.“I got lost early on and was chasing my tail for the rest of the day. I started pushing really hard and ended up lost in the hills for  minutes, with no water, torchlight or phone charge.“I rushed checkpoints and didn’t take the time to check my kit properly.“I was dehydrated, didn’t stay on Lindisfarne and lost a whole day because of it.“It taught me a very good lesson – that I couldn’t do it alone and that these runs were pilgrimages, not races.“I had my tail between my legs the next couple of days but the reception at Durham Cathedral reminded me of what I was doing and why.”Mark enjoyed a similar reception at the Forth Bridges, where supporters and family joined forces to cheer him on before he reached the finish line in St Andrews on November .The following day, he addressed parishioners in St Leonard’s Church.It was the perfect place to end Running Home as St Andrews was once such a centre of pilgrimage.Mark took a breather to enjoy Christmas and New Year but has a busy  planned.He added: “I’m heading to Iraq in the spring to see how the money is being spent.“I also plan to revisit some of the places and people I met this year, by car though!“I passed through a lot of villages that were torched in the Highland Clearances.“People were forced out of their homes, and in some cases country, so there’s a sense of solidarity there with today’s refugees.“I was conscious of not being able to spend much time in places where I got a great deal of support.“So I’m hoping to revisit some of those communities, combining storytelling and traditional folk music to consolidate the friendships I made this year.”Karen is not keen for Mark to pull his running shoes back on too soon, but he will be taking on the York Marathon in October.

Currently, it supports communities in northern Iraq, Israel, Palestine, Lebanon, Egypt and Syria. Mark said: “Our focus is enabling people to rebuild their livelihoods. We do that by offering skills training in everything from computer skills to bee keeping. That one struck me as odd but it turns out everyone loves honey!“Embrace the Middle East also supports intercommunal peace building. The charity is led by local partners and shows how changes, big and small, can make a dference.”While many Iraqi citizens have chosen not toto their homeland, Embrace is there to help those who do.Mark added: “Their homes and agricultural land have been damaged. Our focus is future-proofing their ability to stay in their communities.“We’re not an NGO which is there for a short-term fix – we are there for the long term.”As well as working for Embrace the Middle East three days a week, Mark is an honorary fellow at Aberdeen University and has also taught social sciences at Stirling and Durham Universities."},{"url":null,"title":"these are the 20 most popular baby girl and boy names in the world","story":"Your name forms part of your identity for the rest of your le, so choosing a moniker for your newborn can be a tough decision.title\"Share on Facebook\"class\"article-sharetool__facebook\" id\"sharetool_facebook\"href\"https:www.facebook sharer sharer.php uhttps%A%F%Fwww.inverurieherald%Fnews%Fpeople%Fthese-are-the--most-popular-baby-girl-and-boy-names-in-the-world--\"target\"_blank\"data-provider\"facebook\"data-base-share-url\"https:www.facebook sharer sharer.php u\"data-window-\"\"data-window-width\"\"data-url-to-share\"https:www.inverurieherald news people these-are-the--most-popular-baby-girl-and-boy-names-in-the-world--\"xml:space\"preserve\" xmlns\"http:www.w.org  svg\" xmlns:xlink\"http:www.w.org  xlink\"l.-.c-.,.-.,.-.h.V.h-.c-.,-.,.-.,.v.h-.v.h.V.z M,C.,,,.,,C,.,.,,,s,.,,C,.,.,,,z\" style\"fill-rule:evenoddclip-rule:evenoddfill:#AB\"  width\"\" \"\" viewBox\"  . .\" style\"enable-background:new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c-.,.-.,.-.l.-.V.C.,.,.,,.,C.,,.,.,.,.v.H.v.h.v.H.z\"  title\"Share on Twitter\"class\"article-sharetool__twitter\"id\"sharetool_twitter\"href\"https:twitter intent tweet textThese+are+the++most+popular+baby+girl+and+boy+names+in+the+worldurlhttps%A%F%Fwww.inverurieherald%Fnews%Fpeople%Fthese-are-the--most-popular-baby-girl-and-boy-names-in-the-world--\"target\"_blank\"data-provider\"twitter\"data-base-share-url\"https:twitter intent tweet text\"data-window-\"\"data-window-width\"\"data-tweet-text\"These are the  most popular baby girl and boy names in the world\"data-share-link\"https:www.inverurieherald news people these-are-the--most-popular-baby-girl-and-boy-names-in-the-world--\" xmlns:xlink\"http:www.w.org  xlink\"l.,.l-.-.c-.-.-.-.-.-.l-.-.l-.,.c-.,.-.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.-.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,.,.l.,.l-.,.c-.,-.,.-.,.c.,.,.,.,.,.l.,.l-.,.c-.,.-.,.-.,.C.,.,,.,,.c,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,.-.c.-.,.-,.-.c.-.,.-.,.-.c-.,.-.,.-.c.-.,.-.,.-.c.-.,.-.-.-.c-.,.-.,.-.-.c.-.,.-.,.-.c-.-.,.-.,.c-.,.-.,.-.,.l-.,.l-.-.c-.-.-.-.-.-.C.,.,.,.,.,.z M,C.,,,.,,C,.,.,,,s,.,,C,.,.,,,z\"  width\"\" \"\" viewBox\"   \" style\"enable-background:new    \" xml:space\"preserve\"c-.,.-.,.-.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.,-.,.-.,.c,.,.,.,.,.C.,.,.,.,.,.c-.,.-.,.-.,.c,.,.,.,.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.v.c,.,.,.,.,.c-.,.-.,.-.,.c-.,-.-.-.-.c.,.,.,.,.,.c-.,.-.,.-.,.c-.,-.-.-.-.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,,.-.,.-.l-.-.C.,.,.,.,,.z\" title\"Share via email\"class\"article-sharetool__email\"id\"sharetool_email\"href\"mailto: subjectThese are the  most popular baby girl and boy names in the worldbodyhttps:www.inverurieherald news people these-are-the--most-popular-baby-girl-and-boy-names-in-the-world--\"data-provider\"email\"data-base-share-url\"mailto: \"data-email-subject\"These are the  most popular baby girl and boy names in the world\"data-email-body\"https:www.inverurieherald news people these-are-the--most-popular-baby-girl-and-boy-names-in-the-world--\"viewBox\"   \" s xml:space\"preserve\"M.,.C.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,.-.c,,,,-.C.,.,.,.,.,.z M.,c.,,.,,.,c-.-.-.-.-.-c,,,.-.,.c-.,.-.,.-.,.c-.,.-.,.-.,c-.-.-.-.-.-.c,,,-.-.C.,.,.,.,.,z M.,c,.,,.,,c.-.,.-.,.-C.,.,.,.,.,z M.,c.,.,.,.,.,c-.,-.,-.C.,.,.,.,.,z\" width\"\" \"\" viewBox\"   \" style\"enable-background:new    \" xml:space\"preserve\"l-l-c.-,.-.,.-.s.-.-.-s--.--.HHz\" L,L,z\" window.onload  .sharetool \"m.\" index  .indexOf \"ContentId\" pointIndex  .indexOf articleID  .substring.article-sharetool.article-sharetool--mobile display: noneTuesday  January  :Claire SchofieldIf you are feeling overwhelmed by choice and need some inspiration, Nameberry has revealed the top baby names that have worldwide appeal.

While the Government continues to dither, local people will feel the impact as we move from being rule makers to rule takers.“Last week I spoke in the house about the risks that new tarfs and trade barriers could have for businesses in the Northern Isles. Food and drink production are a staple part of the isles economy. The impact that continued and intensied tarfs could have on rural communities is signicant and organisations such as the SWA are understandably concerned.“This could be just a taste of what is to come as we leave the EU and our economic clout is reduced. If there were any doubt about the limits of our leverage in future trade negotiations with the US, this is a reminder of the precarious position that the Government is putting us in.“I will be writing to the Secretary of State for International Trade to explain what efforts they are making on these tarfs as a matter of urgency. With the UK losing our seat at the table in these trade talks at the end of this month, the next two weeks are crucial. We must give a voice to our local producers in these trade talks while we still can.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

While HIAL has gone through the motions of consulting, having clearly failed to take on board any of the concerns raised, it is dficult to see what purpose this has served.“Since the announcement last week, I have been in discussions with local ATC staff who feel badly let down by HIAL.  Nobody disputes the need for modernisation, but even HIAL’s own consultants concluded that the remote tower model was the most costly and risky option. Alternatives were identied that could have delivered the improvements needed at a fraction of the cost.“While I welcome that HIAL is to carry out an island impact assessment, given its approach to consultation so far, there have to be questions over how robust or independent this assessment will be.#In the meantime, ministers must wake up to the scale of opposition and dissatisfaction amongst HIAL’s ATC staff. They should also recognise the clear threat this poses to delivery of leline air services in Orkney and across the Highlands  Islandsstaff choose to vote with their feet. That alone should give Ministers pause for thought and allow more time for alternative options to be explored”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Dr Anthony Mercer and Dr Dimitris Stamatellos used the UK Distributed Research using Advanced Computingsupercomputing facility to simulate the evolution of protoplanetary discs around red dwarf stars.Protoplanetary discs are rotating structures of dense gas and dust found around all newly-born stars.Researchers found thatthese young discs are big enough, they can break up and form gas giant planets.This theory predicts the formation of giant planets happening within a few thousand years, a timescale which is extremely fast in astrophysical terms.Dr Mercer, who led the research, said: ldquoThe fact that planets may be able to form on such short timescale around tiny stars is incredibly exciting.ldquoOur work shows that planet formation is particularly robust: other worlds can form even around small stars in a iety of ways, and therefore planets may be more erse than we previously thought.According to the study, these planets are extremely hot when they form, with core temperatures reaching thousands of degrees.Planets that are so hot would be relatively easy to observe when they are still young.Without an internal energy source they become fainter with time, and the window of opportunity to directly observe them is very small.Nevertheless, they can still be indirectly observed by their effect on their host star.Co-author of the research Dr Stamatellos, astrophysicist in UCLanrsquos Jeremiah Horrocks Institute, added: ldquoThis was the first time that we were able not only to see planets forming in computer simulations but also to determine their initial properties with great detail.ldquoIt was fascinating to find that these planets are of the lsquofast and furiousrsquo kind ndash they form quickly and they are unexpectedly hot.Future observations of planets around very young red dwarf stars will test the predictions of this new theory.The research was funded by a PhD studentship from the Science and Technologies Facilities Council .copy -.

While doing this, they were also timed and weighed.When the flying insects ed to their ldquonest, the researchers timed how long it took for them to vomit up the nectar they had collected.ldquoFor low strength nectar, bees had a quick vomit that only lasted a few seconds, then were back out and foraging again, said Dr Pattrick.He added: ldquoBut for really thick nectar they took ages to vomit, sometimes straining for nearly a minute.For any given nectar concentration, bees regurgitate the nectar quicker than they initially drink it.Dr Pattrick said: ldquoItrsquos hard to drink a thick, sticky liquid, but imagine trying to spit it out again through a straw ndash that would be even harder.ldquoAt a certain sugar concentration, the energy gain versus energy loss is optimised for nectar feeders.Scientists say the perfect nectar sugar concentration for the highest energy intake depends on the species drinking it, because dferent species feed in dferent ways.The research was funded by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council.copy -.

This presidential race will have run for nearly two years before culminating in the election on  November, . Before then, America will hold five months of primaries or caucuses in every state of the Union, Washington DC and US territories to select presidential candidates for the November contest. The Republican nomination is a foregone conclusion. The Democratic nomination is not.Iowa, the ‘Hawkeye state’, which few people in the UK have heard of and even fewer have ever visited, lies between Nebraska, Missouri, Illinois and Wisconsin. The state’s caucus attracts a huge amount of media coverage, creates a vast amount of polling data and political debate and,precedent is anything to go by, provides a reasonable insight into who will eventually win the presidential race.: Donald Trump’s resort hosts just  weddings in seven years: Why Donald Trump should read Robert Burns’ poem To a Louse – Henry McLeishAt this time of year when the US election machine is rapidly cranking up, why does Iowa figure so prominently in the minds of pundits, pollsters and politicians  Iowa was the first state to hold a caucus in . Despite the efforts of the two main parties to persuade  states to give up caucuses and move to primaries, which are better organised, more democratic and less archaic, Iowa continues to defy this advice. MomentumThe Iowa caucus takes place on  February and will be the first time in this marathon election campaign that voters have a say: this probably explains the importance of Iowa, it is the first real votes being cast, it is the first state in the Union to offer a view on the condition of America – so it is not an opinion poll.The controversy over so much importance being given to Iowa as the first state to have a real poll has not diminished the interest or enthusiasm on the part of Democratic candidates, desperate to secure that first endorsement or a decent showing, and secure a positive impact on the rest of their campaign.But the stakes are high. The outcome may confirm or rebut early polling results. For Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg, who are leading the polls for the Democratic nomination, victory in Iowa would create momentum, a sense of legitimacy and electability, and provide a considerable psychological boost eventhere is no doubt that Iowa is not a microcosm of America.For those doing less well, Iowa could force them to rethink their campaign or quit the race.There is a body of opinion that the importance of Iowa as the first test of public opinion can be overblown and that the primary in New Hampshire on  February will provide a better picture.The more serious criticisms of Iowa are aimed at the very idea of a caucus-driven assessment of voting intentions and the cultural and political identity of the state.Iowa is a small rural state with a population of . million. The caucus comprises , precincts who meet in churches, libraries, community halls, schools and houses. Citizens vote by show of hands or breaking into groups after representatives make the case for each of the candidates. There is no secret ballot. If a candidate doesn’t get  per cent support, they are eliminated.Church-going valuesThe purpose of the exercise is to vote for candidates but also to appoint  pledged delegates who will vote at the state convention. Eight super delegates, who are not pledged to a particular candidate, will be added to the delegation. The idea of super delegates created such bitterness in the Sanders-Clinton battle in . The state’s delegates will then attend the Democratic Convention in Milwaukee in July, when the presidential candidate will be confirmed.This seems like an exhaustive grassroots process, but it is an archaic and often chaotic procedure where the caucus can take hours and can be “rowdy” and “raucous”, sounding more like an energised public meeting than a well-organised polling station. While the caucus process has obvious weaknesses, it is the nature of Iowa itself that make this an unlikely bellwether state.Dismissed by critics as a “flyover state”, Iowa is known for some of the world’s most fertile soil and is first in the country for “the production of corn, oats, soya beans and cattle”. Criticisms of how representative it is, revolve around its  per cent white population, its church-going values, limited urban population, and having an older population: more white, more Christian and more conservative. One critic said: “Iowa [the caucus] is a crime against democracy and ought to be done away with.”A humorous piece in the Washington Post asked whether cows are better represented in the Senate than people, a reference to states like Iowa which has four million sheep, but only . million people.Jimmy Carter’s victoryIn defence of Iowa, results in the state have been within a one per cent deviation from the national electorate since  and it has been a reasonably accurate bellwether for the past two decades. Iowa, in terms of state turnout, ranks among the top five with  per cent as against the US figure of  per cent. Iowa has also voted for the winning presidential candidate in all but three elections since . Donald Trump won the  presidential election in Iowa with . per cent of the vote. Hillary Clinton received . per cent. Trump carried Iowa by the largest margin of any Republican candidate since Ronald Reagan in .The jury is out on whether Iowa is representative of the US and as such there is pressure not to overstate its signicance for the y debate that lies ahead involving another ten months of expensive and enthusiastic campaigning. What is clear is that a good performance by a candidate in Iowa creates momentum and, in a campaign that will cost billions of dollars, a sound way of keeping campaign finance heading your way.Jimmy Carter certainly appreciated the Iowa experience. He stood for the presidency in . Folklore suggests he hung around Iowa for nearly a year, working the state to death in support of his candidature in the belief that a victory would help him in his struggle to get to the White House. For what had been, up to then, a disappointing campaign, barely registering any support in opinion polls, he won the Iowa caucus and then became President in November. Obama also won Iowa.So Iowa does seem to matter.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"nicola sturgeon to issue update on scottish independence plans within days","story":"Nicola Sturgeon will issue an update on her next steps for independence within days after the Prime Ministers refusal to allow a second referendum.A spokesman for the First Minister confirmed she will set out the Scottish Governments plans next week.The SNP leader wrote to Boris Johnson days after his victory in last months general election, claiming there was a \"democratic case\" for a fresh vote on the constitution.But her call for the powers to hold such a vote to be transferred to Holyrood was flatly rejected by Mr Johnson, who claimed in a letter last week that a second ballot on independence would lead to continued \"political stagnation\" in Scotland. - Scotland has one of the biggest falls in \"well-being\" index among developed countries Ms Sturgeon, who has previously refused to rule out legal action in a bid to force a second independence vote, said then that the Scottish Government would set out the next steps it will take before the end of January.The SNP leader has previously said she wants to hold a referendum on Scotlands place in the UK in the latter part of .Some figures in the SNP have expressed doubts a ballot will take place this year, with former Scottish justice secretary and East Lothian MP Kenny MacAskilll saying the likelihood of this in the short-termis \"slim\" and \"more likely nil\".A spokesman for Ms Sturgeon said: \"The FM will seek to update before the end of the month, as she indicated.\"He said ministers were still \"committed\" to holding a referendum this year, saying this position had been \"endorsed\" by voters in the  general election, when the SNP won  of the  seats up for grabs in Scotland. - Brexit Day to be marked with a pro-Scottish independence rally The spokesman confirmed: \"It will be an update following the Prime Ministers reply to the First Minister, which was delivered this time last week.\"It will be an update from our side on how we intend to move things forward in light of that reply.\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"council to carry out churchyard safety check ","story":"Unsafe memorial sign.Surely a #This memorial has FAILED# # notice should be red  Bairns who may not be of reading age, but who know about traffic lights, and those who left their specs at home, will very likely think a green notice means the structure is sound.Unless they#re colour blind.

It also accounts for the rigorous scrutiny that regulatory authorities are rightly applying at every step of their review” of the plane’s flight controls and pilot-training requirements.The latest timetable is based on work remaining to be done before the Federal Aviation Administrationwill allow the Max back in the sky, according to two people familiar with the matter.Shortly after the first Max crash in October  in Indonesia, Boeing began updating software that investigators say was triggered by a faulty sensor and pushed the plane’s nose down.Then in March , another Max crashed in Ethiopia. In all,  people died.Boeing has made the software less powerful and tied it to two sensors instead of one.That work was done months ago, but the company is still working on changes to flight-control computers and pilot-training requirements.Another software issue was discovered last week, although one of the people familiar with the situation said it would not cause more delay in the plane’s .News of the latest delay in Boeing’s timing was first reported by CNBC.The FAA said in a statement that it is conducting “a thorough, deliberate process” to make sure that Boeing’s changes to the Max meet certication standards.The agency said, as it has for months, that it has no timetable for completing its review."},{"url":null,"title":"us senate leader abruptly eases impeachment trial limits","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthsundayleEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Democrats objected loudly to Mr McConnell’s initially proposed rules, and some Republicans made their concerns known in private.Without comment, the Republican leader quietly submitted an amended proposal for the record, after meeting behind closed doors with senators as the trial opened.The handwritten changes would add an extra day for each side’s opening arguments and stipulate that evidence from the Democratic House’s impeachment hearings be included in the record.There is still deep disagreement about calling additional witnesses.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  White House counsel Pat Cipollone during the impeachment trial in the Senate “It’s time to start with this trial,” said White House counsel Pat Cipollone, the president’s lead lawyer as the proceedings opened in public.Chief Justice John Roberts gavelled open the session, senators having taken an oath last week to do “impartial justice” as jurors.House prosecutors were on one side, Mr Trump’s team on the other, in the well of the Senate, as senators sat silent at their desks, no mobile phones or other electronics allowed.Senators were stunned by Mr McConnell’s sht, which came during the private lunch and briefly delayed the start of the historic session.A spokeswoman for Republican Senator Susan Collins said that she and others had raised concerns. The Maine senator sees the changes as signicant improvements, said spokeswoman Annie Clark.READ THE TRANSCRIPTS!— Donald J. TrumpJanuary , Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer was to offer the first amendment to the rules — a proposal to issue a subpoena to the White House for “all documents, communications and other records” relating to the Ukraine matter.It seeks records about Mr Trump’s orders to hold off military aid to Ukraine, along with White House communications about any investigations it wanted about the Democratic rival Joe Biden and his son.In a vote later, it was likely to be rejected by Republicans.Democrats had warned that the rules package from Mr Trump’s ally, the Senate Republican leader, could force midnight sessions that would keep most Americans in the dark and create a sham proceeding.“This is not a process for a fair trial, this is the process for a rigged trial” Representative Adam Schf, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee leading the prosecution, told reporters. He called it a “cover-up”.Mr Schf opened his arguments before the Senate playing a video of Mr Trump calling for more witnesses to testy. Mr Schf noted the sudden change in proposed rules, made moments before he spoke.“The facts will come out in the end,” Mr Schf said. “The question is, will it come out in time ”Mr McConnell said, “The president’s lawyers will finally receive a level playing field,” contrasting it with the House impeachment inquiry.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Donald Trump after attemding session at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland The rare impeachment trial, unfolding in an election year, is testing whether Mr Trump’s actions toward Ukraine warrant removal at the same time that voters are forming their own verdict his White House.Mr Trump himself, in Davos, Switzerland, for an economic conference, denounced the proceedings as “a total hoax”, and said, “I’m sure it’s going to work out fine.”With Mr Trump’s presidency on the line, and the nation deeply ided just weeks before the first Democratic primary contests, four senators who are also presidential candidates will be off the campaign trail, seated as jurors.“My focus is going to be on impeachment,” Senator Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent running for the Democratic nomination, told reporters.

The transfer of these courses which include physiotherapy, medicines management, sport and exercise medicine, podiatry and occupational therapy, amongst others, would attract in excess of , students, and are deemed vital to Magee expansion. In January  UU confirmed that the relocation of allied health and health sciences provision from Jordanstown to Coleraine would be paused to enable further consideration of all options. It was expected that a decision would be taken before the UCAS deadline for NI students on January . However, it has now been pushed back to March with all campuses still under consideration. googletag.cmd.push An Ulster University spokesperson said: “We take seriously the role that we play in providing the skilled health professionals so urgently required to meet the needs of the healthcare workforce and patients. “Over recent months we have undertaken a wide-ranging stakeholder engagement exercise on the future location of these courses. We have appreciated the constructive and valuable input to this process from a range of stakeholders, including our health sciences staff. “Further robust analysis and business cases are required for the options under review, in order that a fully informed decision can be made on the way forward. Our Coleraine, Magee and Belfast campuses are all potential locations to be carefully assessed in this review. googletag.cmd.push “Concluding this review is a priority for the University, and a fully informed decision will be made no later than the second week in March.” ‘Decision time’ SDLP MLA Sinead McLaughlin, who recently replaced party leader Colum Eastwood following his election as Foyle MP, has been vocal about the need for Ulster University to demonstrate its long-term commitment to Derry by transferring other healthcare courses to the Magee Campus without delay. In her previous role as a Derry City  Strabane District Councillor she insisted that health sciences “should be aligned with this city and region.” Speaking to the Derry News at the weekend, Mrs McLaughlin said: “It is my understanding that the decision making process for the relocation of the Allied Health and Health Sciences courses is due to take place in weeks rather than months. “These courses are moving out of Jordanstown and the SDLP have been strongly advocating that these courses would be best placed in the Magee Campus. “The poundm financial package ring fenced for the Graduate Entry Medical School together with financial support for the Magee Expansion from the Irish Government, in my opinion, requires a reciprocal announcement by Ulster University to relocate all Allied Health to Magee in time for the next UCAS listing.” She continued: “This decision by UU would demonstrate their commitment to the City Region and the University would be well on its way to become an academic medical hub with an attractive offering for both students and leading academics. “If Ulster University fail to support the growth of Magee in the coming weeks, it will be decision time for all City Stakeholders on what direction we need to follow in order to achieve a full sized Higher Education provision in Northern Ireland’s second City.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

John Dallats introduction to politics came quite by chance.An invitation to join a new branch of the SDLP was sent to his brother, but John went instead and almost got selected to run for council.He declined, pleading that he was living and teaching in Donegal.Four years later, after ing to Kilrea to take up a teaching post at St Paul’s College, he was chosen to run and so began a letime of council work which culminated in John becoming the first ever nationalist mayor in Coleraine.This period also represented his involvement in rejuvenating the local Credit Union which was in danger of closingA new Conference of Saint Vincent de Paulwas also being set up in Kilrea which would do amazing things for people.Around the same time, the man who was about to become one of Ulsters most hated sectarian killers, was placed by the Probation Service in the very town John lived, and worked in.Just before committing the Castlerock and Greysteel atrocities, UFF murdererTorrens Knight was placed on a local community employment scheme in Kilrea.He left without completing the year of work he was ordered to do by the courts.“The rest is, of course history,” said John. “He and his cronies murdered my friend Gerry Dalrymple, who was in my house the night before the Castlerock murder of four workmen.“His last advice to me was to pull my curtains.“The following morning, he was dead and so too were three of his workmates.“These were dark and dangerous times with armed cops sitting outside the council chamber.“In the beginning I thought they were protecting unionists but when I complained that they could be better used other places I was told by the Divisional Commander it was me they were looking after because I had no control over my mouth!“Yes, Ulster Resistance had brought in guns which were ided among the UDA and UVF and in the future innocent people would die at Castlerock, Greysteel and where.“Among those in the security forces to die was Bertie Gilmore who lived in the same lane as me.“We played together, grew up together and Bertie joined the UDR and I the SDLP. googletag.cmd.push  John Dallat ready for the road in his beloved Morris Minor car. Photo: Mary K Burke “He had retired three years and was recovering from a severe heart attack when he and his we were riddled with gunfire beside the retirement site he was going to build.“Today his daughter is among those who have helped me in challenging times.”Johnwas born and bred in Rasharkin, Co Antrim.“On reflectionI was asked to be born into a dferent house in a dferent place I would turn it down.“I was happy growing up by a Tilley Lamp, carrying water from the well and waking up in the morning with ice on the inside of the windows.“Later on I loved the ‘put-put’ of our ‘Start-o-matic’ generator and Peeke my pet pigeon was never from my side.“She had fallen out of the nest and my mother nursed her back to le while she grew the most beautul brown and white feathers.“An amazing creature of God. I knew why we couldn’t get a council house and I know it was more than just because we were Catholics. “Poor Protestants didn’t get council houses either because they might also be unable to pay the council rent.“Anyway, we kept a goat for the milk which was good for my wee brother Gerard who was special needs both physically and mentally.“He died when he was  and part of my mother and father died too.”John said that being the “underdog” was second nature to him growing up.And it was something he carried with him into his politics career.“It just seemed right and at times didn’t go down well, especially when I sided with the travellers when they came to town but the travellers were good people and attitudes changed,” he said.“When a young girl from a dferent part of the world suffered horric le-changing injuries after losing her job and was left homeless, it seemed right to have her for Christmas in our home and it was one of our best and happiest times ever.“Today she and her family are our best friends and we love them to bits.“When an African student was going to be deported because her visa ran out and her sponsor died suddenly it seemed only right to bring her home and set about stopping her going back to a country where she had only a blind grandmother and no one .“Luck had it I met the head of the Border Agency in Stormont on the corridor and he extended her stay for two years.“In the meantime, she met an amazing husband, married and is among our best friends.“Brian Kennedy played at the wedding and we dressed up in African traditional dress!There is one battle, not yet won, which has had the most impact on John in his role as a public representative.He said: “Perhaps the one story which doesn’t have a good ending just yet is the dreadful murder of Inga-Maria Hauser whose mutilated body was found in Ballypatrick Forest  days after her neck was broken in an attempted rape.“Early next year I will meet her only sister Frederika at a special conference in Queen’s University.“That will be an amazing occasion and hopefully the prelude to her murderer being brought before the courts for one of the most brutal killings I have ever read about.”At the heart of it all has been one thing, John’s family.“Politics had its mixed blessings. I got to see places in the world that I could never have been but it also brought its problems – searching under the car for booby traps, bullet-proof windows and doors and a gun that I know I would never have used.“But politics also gave me the most incredible family.“My poor we Anne was parachuted into the north at the height of the Troubles to a small town which was bombed from one end to the other.“Our daughter, Helena, now a councillor, became the youngest detainee when we were arrested by the British army in Derry shortly after crossing the border.“She was ten days old and our mission was simply showing her off to her Donegal grandparents.“Sixteen years later as a member of the Foyle Harp School she played for President Bill Clinton when he first made that history-making appearance in Mackey’s Foundry.“Later, she would entertain other leaders including President Robinson and McAleese as well as John Major and member of the Royal Family.“I felt honoured when she was invited to play in the Russian Embassy in Washington on Saint Patrick’s Day.“Today the same harp is never out of sight but not played in public anymore.”John added: “Our two sons, Ronan and Diarmuid have been amazing and in one dficult and dangerous year we were on the Aran Islands three times for our safety.“For  years Inishmore, the largest of the three Aran Islands has been our refuge, our safety valve and our friend.“Two weeks ago when I was in hospital after breaking my arm while canvassing, Vincent Mc Carron, one of our friends, left the island during a storm, drove to Kilrea to collect Anne, go to Derry to collect me from hospital and bring me home. He stayed for several days helping with my recovery.”In , one week after his mother sadly passed away, John became Deputy Speaker, a post he held for ten years.“I found it a strange place and certainly not reflecting my background where the term ’Mister’ was hardly order of the day.“In time I persuaded the doorkeepers and others to call me by my first name and I felt comfortable about that.“I felt I was dismantling a bit of the old Stormont that was in danger of being rejuvenated!“All these people were my friends by simply showing them a bit of respect, nothing more and I have missed them dearly over the last three years when I see little of them anymore.”Reflecting on challenges and achievements in his political career, Mr Dallat spoke about stopping the closure or the Belfast-Derry railway north of Ballymena.”The twenty-year project nearly went off the rails several times,” he said.“The Civil Service had a plan to save money by closing the railway north of Ballymena and use the savings to make a start on the A roadway though Toome.“Today the Belfast-Derry railway carries many more passengers than the Belfast-Dublin Enterprise service, but still needs connected to the Irish Rail network and that is a priority for me.John added: “Stopping the closure of the Irish Coastguard Radio Station at Malin Head, announced by Leo Varadkar when he was Minister for Transport.“I gave evidence to a Dail committee with two of my councillors and told the TD’s this was one of the best examples of cross-border bodies, seamless, transcending partition and two world wars, costing very little and actually working! Varadkar had to back down.”As vice-chair of the Public Accounts Committee I exposed wanton waste of public money and brought about important changes which the civil service didn’t like.“Effort to cover up who was responsible for bad mistakes and neglect were strenuously resisted.“Later I was invited to Georgia and Armenia to share my experiences and I felt so honoured and privileged.“I just couldn’t believe that a boy that grew up in a house with no electricity, no running water could be involved in helping democracy grow in two of Russia’s former territories.”With the Assembly back up and running, John says he has great hope for the future.“I have been through the best and the worst of times and see an amazing future for this part of Ireland.“I see wonderful people all around me in both communities and I want to be part of that community for the sake of future generations that will create a new Ireland and one we can all celebrate.“I would encourage every young person to do likewise.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Business properties valued higher may now exceed the current threshold for rates relief. Addressing a recent council meeting, David Ross, Director of Valuation at Land and Property Services, said that across NI there are , non domestic properties with a total net annual value of pound,m providing poundm per annum in rates revenue.A property tax system requires regular and frequent revaluations to be fair and to minimise excessive adjustments.In Northern Ireland they have been revaluated in , , ,  and now . “Revaluations are about redistributing the rate burden,” he said.Non-domestic property in Northern Ireland is assessed on the basis of its rental value known as the Net Annual Value . The NAV of a business property will determine the amount of rates owners have to pay.Since  NI has experienced overall NAV growth from pound,m to pound,m in  which represents a .% increase. Derry City  Strabane District Council has grown by .% from pound.m to pound.m.The main sectors in this are retail, offices, industrial and warehouses with offices bringing about the largest growth in Derry.The Small Business Rate Reliefscheme was introduced in  to support small businesses at a time of economic recession. Since then , SBRR awards have been made to non-domestic ratepayers at a total cost of pound.m. Annually, some , properties receive relief under the scheme at a cost of around poundm.In the absence of an NI government, a decision was taken in  to put it out to consultation in order to identy a more effective replacement scheme. SDLP councillor Sinead McLaughlin, who has since become an MLA, asked Mr Ross about the small business rate relief scheme and the possibility of future-proofing it. In response, he said there would be no change to the existing system, just the values.Some ratepayers sitting at pound, will move up to pound, and lose out on relief, he said, while others will get small business rates relief for the first time as there is movement between bands.Cllr McLaughlin said that while there was some good news, losing rates relief would be “very signicant” for the city centre, particularly for “struggling” small sized retailers.“The rates system needs to be overhauled to reflect a new way of working,” she added.The Council was said to have submitted a comprehensive response to the consultation. In summary, the council said: “A blanket approach with regard to the SBRR scheme would be preferable whilst making changes to the percentage relief available in order to increase the threshold. “If this is not possible the scheme needs to be targeted and specic which is sympathetic to the needs of small businesses.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The project was part funded under Priority of the Northern Ireland Rural Development Programme - by the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs and the European Union’.City of Derry Equestrian Centre has not only doubled sales in one year, thanks to the support for tourism marketing activities from the Rural Business Investment Scheme, but it has also been able to ersy into new lines of business such as equine therapy. Owner Pauline Lusby said she had established a successful family business focusing on weekend pony club activities for children learning to ride, but has now expanded the tourism side of the business due to the Rural Development Programme funding, creating three full-time jobs.Ms Lusby set up City of Derry Equestrian Centre at the family farm at Ardmore  years ago after noticing the lack of opportunities in the area for children learning to ride.The business focuses on fun, friendship and horsemanship for the young riders, allowing them to achieve qualications and avail of the opportunity to become junior instructors once they reach a certain level.“Its a great way of allowing young people to use the stables as a springboard for their future development,” Pauline said.However, she noticed the potential to tap into a growing tourism market, as visitors to the North West from the USA and Canada seek out trail riding opportunities, particularly in areas such as the Faughan Valley that can offer spectacular countryside and a rich historical backdrop.The funding from the Rural Business Investment Scheme has allowed the Centre to target its tourism marketing more effectively by creating high-quality marketing collateral such as leaflets and flyers, a state-of-the-art professionally designed website and effective digital marketing. “When you’re trying to target tourists, who are coming to the North West, you need that professional interface,“ Pauline said. I was aware that we hadn’t tapped into that really huge tourism potential. I had been involved in a project with the city council called Slow Adventure which focused on attracting people into the countryside and that made me realise that there was a lot of tourism potential in the Faughan Valley with its rolling hills and stunning countryside. “The money that we have been able to invest in tourism marketing has provided me with a professional  and we have been getting quite a few enquiries from visitors from the USA and Canada who are staying in Derry and want to go horse riding. “Some of our visitors want to go on a trail ride and canter or gallop, while others are keen to learn more about the local area and its history. My grandparents have been here since the early s so we are able to share that history and tell our visitors about the local characters who have lived around here.”Ms Lusby said the new marketing materials had also helped to highlight what the equestrian centre could offer and in turn that has allowed them to develop new lines of business. Equine therapy is a treatment that uses interactions between humans and horses to help patients to develop needed attributes and to address emotional and behavioural challenges. City of Derry Equestrian Centre is now working with Start  and Ascert to offer this form of therapy to young people. “We’ve found that in the cases of young people where traditional counselling hasn’t worked, they are able to engage better in an equine setting, and after this therapy they are able to open up much more.”  googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Foyle MLA said: “I am pleased to see works finally underway, at what has become a notorious hazard area at the bottom of Duncreggan Road.“The issue of flooding and the poor conditions of footpaths in this area has been on DfI Roads’ radar since March when I initially reported it. Unsurprisingly, the perennial issue of funding had been credited for the delay in addressing this problem. It is regrettable that it took a serious injury before action was taken on this matter. However, given the Department’s current budge- tary pressures, I am grateful that DfI Roads have kept their promise of responding to the issue as soon as possible following the Christmas break.”Mr Durkan con- cluded:”Hopefully, these repairs will finally resolve this persistent problem.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The announcement was made at an event held to thank the local community, business partners and stakeholders who have supported the successful delivery of the project. Representing an investment of over pound million, the “Gas to the West” project is being delivered in partnership between SGN Natural Gas and Mutual Energy and has the potential to meet the energy needs of up to , homes and businesses across Counties Derry, Fermanagh and Tyrone.The final piece of the new network was commissioned in December last year with natural gas now available to Artigarvan, Coalisland, Cooks-town, Derrylin, Dun- gannon, Enniskillen, Magherafelt, Omagh and Strabane.Approximately  jobs were created during the construction phase which was applauded for its technical innovation including traversing almost  river crossings and signicant roads including the M motorway. The recent delivery of the network to the gateways of all the target towns is a major milestone for what is widely regarded as one of the most signicant energy infra- structure projects across the province in a generation. It is anticipated that when fully completed, almost  kilometres of pipeline will be in the ground in the wider network area.Leading Northern Ireland manufacturing companies who have already converted their production lines to natural gas across the newly extended network area, include LacPatrick Dairies, Encirc, Dale Farm, Moy Park and Linergy.Economy Minister. Diane Dodds, has welcomed provision of the new gas infrastructure. She said: “I would like to congratulate Mutual Energy and SGN Natural Gas, and their contractors, on their success in delivering this signicant energy project. The project has been supported with grant funding up to pound. million administered by the Department for the Economy.”“I look forward to the continued roll-out of new gas distribution networks in each of the eight towns in the West, eventually providing some , business and domestic consumers with additional fuel choice and increasing the potential for businesses, the public sector and households to use a cleaner, more efficient fuel.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The survey to date has provided the RSPB with nearly nine million hours of monitoring garden birds - counting  million of them.People are asked to spend just one hour watching and recording the birds in their garden or local green space and then submit their results to the RSPB. The results give an astonishing amount of insight into how our wildle is faring.Last year, house sparrows were the leaders in Derry, while starlings were the most-spotted birds in Armagh and Tyrone. Some of the less common birds to be spotted across the North included great spotted wood peckers, yellowhammers, sparrow- hawks, goldcrests and fieldfares. There was one new entry in the top  in Northern Ireland last year, with coal tits replacing collared doves at no..For four decades, Big Garden Birdwatch has highlighted the winners and losers in the garden bird world. It was one of the first surveys to alert the RSPB to the decline in the number of song thrushes in gardens. This species was a firm fixture in the top  in  but  years later its numbers were less than half those recorded in . By last year, numbers of song thrushes seen in gardens have declined by %, coming in at number .Anne-Marie McDevitt, RSPB NI head of species, said: “The popularity of Big Garden Birdwatch shows just how passionate people are about their wildle. Everyone has a role to play in saving nature and protecting our wildle. it’s great to have a reason to sit back and relax and just enjoy birds and wildle for one hour, knowing that you’re contributing to the world’s largest wildle survey. It gives people a perfect opportunity to connect with nature. Often you can be amazed at the types of birds you’ll find in your garden. If you’re not sure about the birds you’re seeing, pick up binocularsyou have them and you might get a pleasant surprise and realise you have a goldcrest or redpoll or bullfinch or some other lovely bird that you might not realise visits your garden. You’ll be able to identy them using your Big Garden Birdwatch pack or the RSPB website.“The Big Garden Birdwatch allows us to monitor trends and helps us understand how birds are doing. If people can spare an hour and help us with this ‘citizen science,’ it lets us create a valuable snapshot of bird numbers across the UK.”To take part in the Big Garden Birdwatch , watch the birds in your garden or local park for one hour at some point over the three days. Only count the birds that land, not those flying over. Tell the RSPB the highest number of each bird species you see at any one time – not the total you see in the hour.The parallel event, RSPB Big Schools’ Birdwatch, takes place between now and  February. Almost , children took part in  schools across Northern Ireland last year.

She was keen to help those in need and to get people involved.Making time for others, she had a listening ear and often offered advice in compassionate ways. She liked being at the heart of things, and she was the le and soul of the party.Helena, from the Crocknamohil Road close to Draperstown, went missing on November .She was last seen near the Foyle Bridge in Derry city.Her remains were discovered last Tuesday evening by search teams on the River Foyle, who had been scouring the area every day since her disappearance. Her family, including husband Declan and four children - Kayla, Ben, Kaeden andNiah-Rose - all aged from one to  years-old, had held out hope she wouldhome.On Monday morning they gathered with hundreds of others in a final farewell to the much loved daughter, sister, mum and we.Special recognition was given during the funeral mass from the McElhennon and McGlone families for the tireless, daily efforts by family, friends and strangers in looking for Helena.Passing on their thanks, Fr McGirr said: Over these past number of weeks Helena has been on the minds and in the prayers of countless people across our erse, good-hearted and generous community. Helena’s people also deeply appreciate the supportive messages from people conveyed across dferent s expressing their compassion and kindest thoughts.People were keen to help and pray for Helena. They have been opening their hearts and sharing their moments with a neighbour and people they’re feeling for. “They and the generosity of local businesses donating food for volunteers and family members also helped to draw Helena gently home.As sincere people and as a community of faith gathered here at St Patrick’s, we share our sympathy with everyone among Helena’s family and friends grieving her passing today. We also reach out to God to help and console us in our sorrow, and we pray to him for the happy repose of Helena’s soul in the le to come, because we would like her to have that peace very much.”Yesterday, messages of support continued to be posted on a Facebook page set up in the search for Helena.As well as offers of thoughts and prayers, messages lent support for her family and expressed relief that their agonising search had finally come to an end. Last week after news that Helenas body had been foud, her family thanked those who had left comforting messages. “Helena was a beautul person and earth angel. She’s now an angel in heaven reunited with our Daddy, goddaughter and other family members,” a Facebook post read. Helena is survived by her husband Declan and four children, her mother Mary and her siblings Rosaleen, Teresa, Michael and Sean.For emotional support you can call the Samaritans -hour helpline on  , email jo@samaritans.org, visit a Samaritans branch in person or go to the Samaritans website. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It’s the second piece of good news for the school in recent months. In October funding of over pound, was approved to provide two double prefabricated classrooms as replacement accommodation for a double temporary classroom and two singular modular units.SDLP MLA for Mid Ulster, Patsy McGlone said he has pressed the new Minister for Education on the inclusion of St Patrick’s College in the SEP.“I have been in regular contact with St Patrick’s College, Maghera on the need for improvements to the school estate over recent years. I have had visits with Department officials, the school principal, the chair of the board of governors and Cllr Martin Kearney on site to see the school facilities.“Further enhancement to the school facilities on site will be required and the school enhancement programme for   provides an opportunity to deliver these improvements for St Patrick’s College.Mid Ulster Sinn Feacutein MLA Emma Sheerin welcomed the announcement that St Patrick’s College has been included on the programme.“The announcement of funding for the capital work is indeed very welcome and St Patrick’s College is a worthy recipient. A number of issues with leaking and damp forced them to make applications for upgrades to several buildings around the school, and they have previously been told that a replacement building for the technology department, to which this project relates, is not an option, and so this is a good interim measure. St Pats’ have an excellent reputation across South Derry and indeed have a huge catchment area, and it is dficult to expect any teaching body to carry out their work to a high standard when their facilities do not match up. “I have written to the minister to request further detail about the scale of the investment and I will continue to work with my local Council colleagues, as well as the school, to ensure that the matter progresses at the earliest opportunity.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It’s the second piece of good news for the school in recent months. In October funding of over pound, was approved to provide two double prefabricated classrooms as replacement accommodation for a double temporary classroom and two singular modular units.SDLP MLA for Mid Ulster, Patsy McGlone said he has pressed the new Minister for Education on the inclusion of St Patrick’s College in the SEP.“I have been in regular contact with St Patrick’s College, Maghera on the need for improvements to the school estate over recent years. I have had visits with Department officials, the school principal, the chair of the board of governors and Cllr Martin Kearney on site to see the school facilities.“Further enhancement to the school facilities on site will be required and the school enhancement programme for   provides an opportunity to deliver these improvements for St Patrick’s College.Mid Ulster Sinn Feacutein MLA Emma Sheerin welcomed the announcement that St Patrick’s College has been included on the programme.“The announcement of funding for the capital work is indeed very welcome and St Patrick’s College is a worthy recipient. A number of issues with leaking and damp forced them to make applications for upgrades to several buildings around the school, and they have previously been told that a replacement building for the technology department, to which this project relates, is not an option, and so this is a good interim measure. St Pats’ have an excellent reputation across South Derry and indeed have a huge catchment area, and it is dficult to expect any teaching body to carry out their work to a high standard when their facilities do not match up. “I have written to the minister to request further detail about the scale of the investment and I will continue to work with my local Council colleagues, as well as the school, to ensure that the matter progresses at the earliest opportunity.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Rice Bowlclosed for a month so the owner could get married. But rather than put up a standard “closed” sign, a giant photo of a customer entering the takeaway was placed over the shopfront. The owner – known only as Mr Chang – came up with the hilarious idea after an elderly neighbour said she didn’t feel safe without his customers about.

Both of the goals were a bit unfortunate in a sense. For the first,Ryan Morrow doesn’t fall in the build-up I don’t think they’d score and then for the second the free kick has bounced just before the keeper and they reacted quicker,” Connor told the Derry News. “For them to be sitting top of the table and for us to be where we are, the gulf wasn’t massive. “If we can perform like that against the teams in and around us, then we’ll be fine. Sometimes when we play the teams around us we don’t perform like that, so we just need to keep our cool.”Connor also admitted that the timing of the second goal just before half-time really knocked the wind out of his side’s sails.“At - it’s a dficult game. Their game management was very good in the second half,” he said. “We huffed and puffed without really creating as much as we did in the first half when we had two or three really good chances. The dference was that when they got their chances, they were clinical.” googletag.cmd.push CHANGESGlentoran, with former Finn Harps captain Cowan amongst three debutants, made the brighter start to the game, with Marcus Kane trying his luck from  yards after three minutes, but it blazed high and wide of Rory Brown’s goal.Mick McDermott’s men were playing some slick stuff, and Kane played a crossfield pass to Hrvoje Plum that the Croatian fizzed across the face, but Aidan McCauley got a boot to it to clear.A foul on Alex Pomeroy by Kane earned the home side their first opportunity on ten minutes, but Evan Tweed’s delivery was taken off the head of a free Graham Crown by Caolan Marron.It was ‘Stute who had the first real chance on  minutes when Tweed slid a lovely ball in behind for Gareth Brown who beat Marron before squaring it for McCauley who was completely free at the back post, but on the stretch his left footed effort was blocked by Marijan Antolovic for a corner that came to nothing.It wasn’t long before they were punished for that miss as Glentoran took the lead on  minutes. An unfortunate slip from Ryan Morrow allowed Elvio Van Overbeek to latch on to Robbie McDaid’s pass, and after his floated cross was missed by Andy Mitchell, Navid Nasseri picked it up, jinked inside and finished to the bottom corner.‘Stute enjoyed a spell on top midway through the first half, and on  minutes Tweed and McCready linked up before the latter picked out McCauley in acres of space. He was allowed to run at the Glens defence before unleashing a drive from  yards, but it went wide of Antolovic’s left post.Nasseri’s free role and movement was causing the home defence problems, and on the half hour mark he drew a save out of Brown with a rasping shot into the former Wolves man’s chest.Antolovic then collected a weak header from Alex Pomeroy after Tweed’s free kick was nodded on by Dean Curry before a quick counter from the visitors ended with Christopher Gallagher slicing one over the top.Glentoran had regained control, and on  minutes debutant Marron swung a pinpoint ball deep to the back post where McDaid got his head on it, but the angle was too tight and Brown got behind it.The Belfast men made it - on  minutes when Tweed fouled Plum from behind. He tried to catch ‘Stute out by going for goal, and after Brown scrambled across to make the initial save, Keith Cowan was the man alert to finish to an empty net. googletag.cmd.push Half-timeInstitute Glentoran The visitors started the second half on the front foot, and inside two minutes Andy Mitchell whipped a ball into the box for McDaid, but he couldn’t make a proper connection as it bounced wide.The same pair linked up on  minutes, with McDaid controlling well on his chest ten yards out, but he volleyed over the top, with Nasseri also off target with a long distance attempt five minutes later.‘Stute had the ball in the net on  minutes as Aidan McCauley’s free from midfield sailed over the crowd to the net, but Alex Pomeroy was adjudged to have fouled Antolovic in his attempt to claim it.Sean Connor then made his first substitution, with Ahu Obhakhan replacing McCready, and he could have made an instant impact on the hour mark when McCauley picked out Pomeroy who held off Garrett before squaring for his strike partner at the back post, but it was just too far ahead of him to get a strong foot on it.On  minutes a long throw from Crown made it through to Tweed, but shot was blocked by Marron while moments later Morrow put in a strong tackle on Van Overbeek to win back possession and set up Brown – but his right footed strike floated over the bar.To their credit, ‘Stute kept pressing for a goal and on  minutes Cormac Burke played a long ball for Pomeroy to chase. He did well to turn on to his left but his shot sailed wide of the left upright.The Glens were pressing too, however, and Robbie McDaid tested Brown in the final minute of normal time with a well-placed header from a Kane cross, but the shot stopper held on well.

The Bangor attacker played in Kurtis Bell, who slotted the ball into the inside side-netting after Saintfield were dispossessed at the edge of their own box.Saintfield raised it a few gears and struck three times in the  minutes before half-time.The first came from Andrew Clarke after James Sofley was played down the line. After beating two defenders, James played in Andrew, who passed the ball into the bottom right-hand corner past the lsquokeeper.It took less than five minutes for left back Oliver Duff to score Saintfieldrsquos third. A long ball found Adam Childs on the left wing.He played it back to the edge of the box for Duff. He took one touch to set himself before striking a powerful left-footed shot into the bottom right corner.The Saints scored one more goal before the break with Andrew Clarke playing the ball across the face of goal for Tony Liken to finish at the back post. Saintfield went into half-time in the driving seat and - up.The second half started much like the first ended with Saintfield scoring an early goal.Ryan Sofley was the supplier of an own goal after bombing into the box and fizzing a cross into the near post which ricocheted off the Bangor defender into the net.At - up, the Saints took their foot off the gas and conceded just over five minutes after scoring.Bangor gained possession from a loose ball in midfield and played it into Matty Hall, who turned well to beat the Saintfield defender before striking the ball low and hard into the bottom corner.The Saints were again quick to respond with Andrew Clarke getting his hat-trick with half an hour still to go.Clarke started the move in midfield and finished it expertly after James Sofleyrsquos effort was parried by the lsquokeeper.Saintfield had a penalty and rebound saved less than two minutes later after James Sofley was brought down in the box.However, the Saints werenrsquot finished yet and Clarke had one more goal left in them with  minutes left to go. Possibly the best goal of the game, as he showed real determination and skill to score his fourth. Another counter-attacking goal from the Saints as they broke fast from a Bangor corner.Clarke received the ball just inside the Bangor half and stood tall after several attempts to bring him down. He beat three defenders before slotting home a cool finish into the bottom corner.This goal also signalled the end of the goalkeeperrsquos game after he strongly disagreed with the refereersquos decision to allow the goal to stand. Bangor had one more chance before the end of the game when they were also awarded a penalty, but David Harper kept the Saintsrsquo five-goal lead intact and made it a penalty saved for both teams.A great performance for Saintfield who progress to the next round of the cup and a fantastic performance from  year-old Andrew Clarke who relished his role as an attacking midfielder.Saintfield United Bangor Young Men CLARENCE CUP ND ROUND.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th January 2020 Call.jpg","title":"Call to begin work on Ballynahinch bypass  ","story":"THE re-establishment of the Stormont Executive has led to fresh calls for work to start on Ballynahinchrsquos proposed multi-million pound bypass.Newly appointed Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon is being urged to signal the start of construction work on the scheme which is estimated to cost in excess of poundm.South Down MP Chris Hazzard mdash a former roads minister in a previous Executive who signed off the eagerly-awaited bypass in December  mdash has written to Ms Mallon seeking an assurance that the Ballynahinch scheme remains a priority for her department and that construction work will start as soon as possible.In addition, Rowallane councillor Billy Walker is tabling a notice of motion at the February meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Council seeking across-the-board political support to seek an urgent meeting with Ms Mallon discuss the next step in the construction of the bypass.He also confirmed that Strangford MP, Jim Shannon, has written to Ms Mallon on the issue and is seeking a meeting with her to discuss the issue.There has been major progress on work on the near two-mile scheme to link the Newcastle and Saintfield roads, with work already completed on a major archaeological investigation along parts of the route.Work was due to complete on the schemersquos economic appraisal before the end of last year, with roads engineers confirming recently that in order to advance the bypass schemersquos state of readiness, preparatory work on contract documents was ongoing to ldquominimise the time required to initiate a procurement competition, should funding become available for construction.The by-pass, which would be the single biggest road scheme ever constructed in the district, is expected to take in excess of  months to build, with roads officials insisting that it will greatly benefit both strategic and local road users by reducing journey times and improving road safety.They are also confident that the schemersquos economic assessment demonstrates the by-pass would provide a good economic .The scheme is designed to alleviate chronic town centre congestion in Ballynahinch and along the main approach roads to the town.Major new roundabouts are proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road, with a new bridge constructed over the Moss Road.It is also proposed that a section of the bypass will pass under part of the Crossgar Road with a  metre long bridge constructed to take traffic over Ballynahinch River.Overtaking lanes stretching almost  metres are proposed at either end of the bypass where major new roundabouts are to be constructed, with the scheme also including a shared footpath and cycle lane.Mr Hazzard said that following his decision to formally sign off the scheme at the end of , the government department had been working through ious legal stages to ensure the scheme could commence as soon as possible.ldquoA programme of geotechnical investigation works on lands along theof the scheme was completed in  with advanced archeological investigation works completed last year, he confirmed.ldquoThis allowed the Department to move ahead with the final stage of preparing contract documentation in readiness of funding becoming available to construct the scheme.Mr Hazzard added: ldquoWith an Infrastructure Minister now in place following the restoration of Stormont this week, funding should now be signed off and construction allowed to commence as soon as possible.Cllr Walker said it was the view of many, including senior roads engineers, that the multi-million pound scheme was vital to the survival of Ballynahinch town centre and will play a signicant role in helping boost the wider South Down economy.He said given that the project is shovel ready, it is essential that the cash is earmarked to allow construction work to start this year is forthcoming.ldquoMoving forward what is now required is the finance to build this scheme, continued Cllr Walker.ldquoIt is clear to me that when you look at other parts of Northern Ireland that Down District has consistently missed out on major roads funding. That must change and the cash needed to build Ballynahinchrsquos new bypass must be made available.The Rowallane councillor said that the bypass can help kick-start the economic regeneration of Ballynahinch town centre and act as a catalyst to encourage new investment.Cllr Walker added: ldquoThe eagerly-awaited scheme can address town centre gridlock and along the main approach roads.

Lidl, which currently employs  staff, claims its proposal will create  new jobs.In late November, the local council confirmed that outline permission granted in March for the multi-million pound development was to be quashed as a result of a judicial review brought by developer Don Holdings Ltd.However, days later, the agenda for the December meeting of the Planning Committee included a plannersrsquo recommendation to approve the new store proposal. The recommendation was subsequently withdrawn, but features on the agenda for todayrsquos meeting with a recommendation to approve.The Newcastle development proposal includes plans for almost  parking spaces, eight of which are reserved for mountain rescue team members.A new pedestrian crossing at the Bryansford Road junction with Shimna Road forms part of the proposal, with planners receiving  objections. Five five letters in support of the new rescue team base proposal have also been lodged.Lidl has consistently argued that its current base at Railway Street in Newcastle is too small to allow the store to carry the companyrsquos full range of goods, highlighting issues with narrow aisles and inadequate parking provision.It says the Railway Street base was only supposed to be a temporary home until a larger unit could be found.Lidl says it has been looking for an alternative town centre site for over decade without success until the Shanslieve Drive site became available, with the planned mountain rescue team centre providing the volunteers with a permanent base.Objectors to the new store proposal claim that there are ldquoserious errors in the transport assessment submitted in conjunction with the planning application, inaccurate land ownership information, unachievable visibility spays and out-of-season traffic surveys.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokeswoman confirmed yesterday that the Lidl planning application was deferred to allow further consideration of a number of submissions received by the local authority.She added: ldquoThe Council is endeavouring to bring this application back to the Planning Committee in Februarypossible..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th January 2020 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C January 15%2C 1980  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH mdash Police believe that a professional gang were behind the drugs raid on a Ballynahinch chemist shop at the weekend.The thieves smashed their way into Hannawinrsquos Medical Hall in Main Street through a skylight and forced open a door to get to the shop. They used a crowbar to prise the steel cabinet containing a store of dangerous drugs out of the wall. The cabinet was later found along the side of the Carrickmannon Road, near Ballygowan.The drugs taken included heroin and cocaine, both of which are dangerous even in small doses. They are types of hard drug in big demand on the black market. Additives like glucose are used by drug pushers to multiply the volume and increase profits. Other drugs, including morphine and strychnine, were also taken.The raid was the latest in a spate across the province and police fear that the addiction problem could be more serious than previously realised.Police chiefs have backed chemists pressing for an urgent review of the Home Office regulations about the keeping of prescribed drugs in steel cabinets.The present procedure is making things too easy for the thieves. It has meant that the hard drugs are all kept in the same place and the professional thief knows that.Before  regulations, chemists had better safeguards, evenit meant hiding the hard drugs on the general drugs shelves. It meant that thieves could not go straight to the security cabinet and other break it open or take it with them.The head of the RUCrsquos drugs squad, Chief Inspective George McBride, said he agreed that there was an urgent need to re-examine safety procedures for storage of dangerous drugs.DOWNPATRICK mdash Compensation for the destruction of St Patrickrsquos Hall in Downpatrick has been agreed mdash almost six years after it was destroyed by fire.The trustees of St Patrickrsquos Parish were awarded pound, at Downpatrick Crown Court last Friday after a two-hour hearing.The award was made in four parts, the bulkbeing attributable to physical damage and the remainder split between loss of profits , contentsand site value pound,.The claim had been before the court for over a year and was held up after the Northern Ireland Office disputed the amount of the parishrsquos claim for loss of profits.On Friday counsel for the Northern Ireland Office argued that the hall trustees had not made a big enough effort to reduce lost profits. But this was strongly refuted by counsel for the hall trustees.In a -minute summing up, the judge looked at the ious points of the case. He said he felt the church had not acted unreasonably and that the trustees had done everything required of them under law.STRANGFORD mdash A Strangford schoolboy will pack his bags later this year to take up a scholarship at a new college at Cambridge mdash with the long term prospects of becoming a Cambridge don.He is  year-old Andrew McDowell, who is an A Level student at Down High School, and he learned this week that he was won an open exhibition to the famed university.In academic terms he has won the equivalent of a junior scholarship and he will be among the first major intake at the new Robinson College.Andrew already has nine O Levels and he sat the examination in November along with several thousand others.In October he will pack his bags to concentrate on Mathematics at the college, with the scholarship being renewable after two years. His success is all the more remarkable because he is a year younger than most other candidates.Andrew is studying A Level Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry at Down High.

The Ballynahinch venture was unique in having a large amount of surviving documentation.Mr Reid says it is clear from these papers that the scheme organised by the First Presbyterian Church was sophisticated, comprehensive, self-funded, and cradle-to-grave in scope. It included widowsrsquo and old age pensions, end of le and burial grants, and support for orphans.Finance allocated to the project was known as lsquoThe Poorrsquos Moneyrsquo. The scheme operated late in the reign of William III and was continued into the time of Queen Anne, George I and George II.Nowadays benefit claimants unable to work through illness or injury, are paid Employment Support Allowance, .In  a similar scheme was obviously operating in Ballynahinch. The church carpenter at that time was John Gough, and that year he suffered a signicant injury, perhaps a broken arm or leg. He was unable to work or to earn a living for over a year.John had been married six years earlier in , in his home congregation by Rev James McAlpine. His we was Elizabeth, neacutee Ferguson. Their children soon followed mdash Christine, who was five in  Rebecca, who was four, and their twin boys, George and James, who were just one year and one month.With four young children and no income, John and Elizabeth were soon struggling financially. But in April the church stepped in immediately, with payments for an initial three-month period, at six shillings per instalment. In August John tried to resume work, but couldnrsquot. The church continued payments, but now at a reduced rate of d. Another attempt at work in October  failed again, and again payments resumed.John eventually recovered and ed to work permanently in August , having received a total of  support payments from First Presbyterian. He resumed his valuable role in maintenance of the fabric, receiving church contracts in ,  and .The problem of unwed mothers and absent fathers is one that troubles every age and every generation. Back in the early s, the Ballynahinch Session took a stern approach to fire-and-forget fatherhood.Their starting point was an interview with the expectant mother to ascertain the identity of her co-responsible male partner. If she proved uncompliant, exclusion from church attendance was then threatened. Faced with resultant near-total social ostracism, the mother-to-be soon cooperated.The next stage involved the errant couple appearing some Sunday morning before the entire congregation, kneeling on the Stool of Repentance and confessing their extramarital transgression. After that they were received back into the congregation. Their child was baptised and recognised as a church member.In a -year period the Ballynahinch Session dealt with  such cases. In six, they identied both parents. In six other cases only the mother was identied in seven, only the father. In one case the origins and surname of a lsquofoundlingrsquo child were known, but neither parent actually came forward.By st century standards, these church procedures sound draconian. But they had the purpose of protecting the rights of the child and of offering an opportunity to the parents for their reputations to be salvaged,possible.The alternatives were a lot worse. It was common in the s for the sexton at Magheradroll Parish Church to discover live newborns abandoned overnight on his church doorstep, ordead through neglect or infanticide, to find their bodies surreptitiously concealed in adjacent graves.In Ireland such surviving infants were sent in large numbers to the Foundling Hospital in Dublin, which who received between ,-, orphans annually. The hospitalrsquos mortality rate was some %.In Ballynahinch, under Presbyterian auspices, some such infants were spared this grisly fate. The lives of a number of potential orphans were actively protected by the church in their home town.Under the Welfare Reform Act of , Disabled Living Allowance was controversially replaced with Personal Independence Payment. DLA payments were made to claimants who often had long term medical conditions. The amount of the award ied according to the degree of disability.Interestingly, in Ballynahinch in the early s, First Presbyterian made a number of long-term DLA-type awards to some lsquosupplicantsrsquo.Ms Grissel Foreman was on such a benefit from -. Some financial records of the Poorrsquos Money still exist. But all its other documentation is lost, so we donrsquot know what Grisselrsquos ailment actually was. It was obviously slow and progressive, perhaps something like tuberculosis, or multiple sclerosis, or Parkinsonrsquos.As her condition deteriorated, the church increased its amount of financial support. In  she received seven payments totalling s d. By  this had escalated to  payments totalling pound s d.She died in  and was buried at church expense. Over  years, amounts paid to her totalled pound s d. This was an enormous sum, considering the church ministerrsquos annual stipend at the time was pound.These and many other such stories will be outlined on Monday night at Down Museum.

We must go out there and grab them by selling what the district has to offer.Cllr Curran said given that the Newry, Mourne and Down area is the third largest of the provincersquos  district councils, it should be an ldquoattractive proposition for potential investors.ldquoThe focus moving forward must be on new job creation in both the public and private sector. It is important that we sell what the area has to offer.In relation to public sector job opportunities, Cllr Curran said available space at the Downshire Civic Centre could be utilised by a number of government departments keen to decentralise their operations from the greater Belfast area.He continued: ldquoNew investment will not happen out of the blue. We all have a duty to work together to secure it. I believe we need new hotels and there is a need for such a facility in the Downpatrick area and hope see progress on this issue in the near future.Cllr Curran is particularly keen to see the proposed commercial development at the site of the former Irish Street police station in Downpatrick and a number of adjacent derelict buildings progressed this year.ldquoThis exciting proposal has the potential to restore Downpatrickrsquos economic heart, create jobs and, most importantly, provide a boost for existing businesses via increased footfall, he said.Cllr Curran also warned that while attracting new investment is crucial, cracking Downpatrickrsquos traffic congestion problem is also essential.ldquoGridlock continues to stle town centre investment and we need to act quickly. While expensive schemes have been proposed in the past, nothing has happened. We must see progress in  and ensure roads officials deliver.ldquoWork was completed recently on a major upgrade of the Collinsrsquo Corner junction and while welcome, I and others remain to be convinced that it will address congestion problems in the heart of the town.Cllr Curran said roads officials also deserve praise for the improvement scheme in Fountain Street and hopes that in  efforts will be made by the Department for Infrastructure to improve Edward Street.He added: ldquoThis is a real problem area which has not been addressed. The presence of a busy primary school should ensure that roads officials redouble their efforts to improve driver and pedestrian safety.

Rail chiefs, who had been hoping for investment after the railways had proved so crucial to the war effort a few years earlier and that the buses would be barred from competing with the trains and instead provide a feeder service to stations, were devastated at the outcome.ldquoThe recommendation, accepted by Stormont, was that the entire Belfast and County Down Railway main line from Belfast to Newcastle, including the branches to Donaghadee, Ballynahinch and Ardglass, should be closed.The only route to be saved was the Belfast to Bangor connection, which continues operating successfully to this day.Mr Gardiner continued: ldquoThe attitude of Stormont was that it would be cheaper to move everything to the roads than to invest in railways that had been run down during the Second World War. People would use the buses instead. They developed huge road building schemes mdash most were never completed mdash but closed the railways first before these were even started. It seems incredible today.ldquoThe most puzzling element of the decision was the axing of the Belfast to Newtownards line, which served the east of the city mdash Dundonald, Knock and Comber areas in which the suburbs were developing and likely to provide increased commuter traffic had they been spared.ldquoIndeed, there were more than enough new diesel trains ordered to operate both the Bangor and Newtownards lines mdash and evidence suggests that the Transport Tribunal expected Stormont to spare the Comber line as a compromise option and as late as , before the tracks were lted, they were calling on the minister responsible to reverse the decision and trial these new diesel trains on this section of track mdash a call that fell on deaf ears.The  closures were the first steps in a plan which was to see the reduction of the Northern Irelandrsquos railway network from  miles to  miles mdash a decrease of  per cent.A decade later, the Great Northern Railway was ided between the UTA and its counterpart in the Republic, CIE, and further closures to lines to Armagh, Dungannon, Omagh and Strabane occurred.Willie Watterson and James Magill, who were porters and ticket clerks at Newcastle and Tullymurry stations, recalled their memories of the last train in an interview recorded for the BBC documentary lsquoRaising Steamrsquo in ldquoThe last train was a Sunday night. It was a cold winter night, January , , said Willie. There was twelve coaches, and two engines and two guards. She was packed. Packed to the doors. So I lit all the lamps, and put detonators on the line to give her a send-off.James added: ldquoI think every station did the same thing, so when the train came in there was a salute of bangs. I felt terrible about it, terribly terribly sad. I still felt it couldnrsquot happen. Still felt theyrsquoll come back, theyrsquoll run again. I couldnrsquot believe therersquod be no more railways, after working on them so hard.Adam Hamilton, who was a fireman mdash the person who stoked the fire on the steam locomotives mdash said: ldquoIt broke my heart, because the railways were in my blood. I still hear the sound of the steam still running on a clear night puffing away.Today, the Downpatrick and County Down Railway keeps the memory alive through its reconstruction of two miles of the former main line, as well as restored carriages rescued from their fate as hen houses.As part of its commemorations of the BCDRrsquos demise, it is keen to make contact with anyone who had any connection with the network, including former employees or their families, or people in possession of railway memorabilia such as photographs, tickets, timetables or even carriages.Mr Gardiner added: ldquoOne thing we would love for the museum is a BCDR unorm or tunic. So far we have been unable to track one down. Perhaps you have something in your loft And what of the future of the line  In November  the section of the BCDRrsquos former main line from Holywood Arches to Comber was opened as the Comber Greenway, whilst other sections have been used for roads as well as the section around Downpatrick being used by the DCDR.In the early s Northern Ireland Railways prepared a feasibility study into reopening the line to Newtownards, but this was not taken further by the Direct Rule administration.In May , the Department for Regional Development published its Railway Investment Prioritisation Strategy, which promised feasibility studies into the reopening of closed railway routes to Armagh, Dungannon and Castledawson by , but not including the Comber Newtownards route.However, maybe  years after the first railway closure in Northern Ireland, the new Minister for Infrastructure in the restored Stormont Government might see the first of those historic mistakes rectied.The Downpatrick Railway Museum can be contacted via email at info@downrail or message at www.facebook downrail..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th January 2020 Mickey.jpg","title":"Mickey ‘magic’ to help Magpies lift cup  ","story":"KILCOOrsquoS tearaways may hold the key to success in Sundayrsquos All-Ireland Club SFC final at Croke Park.The ability of their six forwards to win dirty ball and turnovers could dismantle the perceived invincibility of Corofinrsquos much-vaunted defensive system.Corofin, described in many quarters as the best club team ever, have an enviable set of defenders who squeeze the le out of the opposition.However, they have never encountered a team like Kilcoo before that has  attackers and  defenders.Conor Laverty, the three Johnston brothers mdash Ryan, Jerome and Shealan mdash Paul Devlin and Ryan McEvoy fight tooth and nail for every ball.They are the clubrsquos first line of defence and are not afraid to go where angels fear to tread, but can then turn into a snatch squad with the blink of an eye.Kilcoo will have to be at their bestthey are to cause an upset as the Galway and Connacht champions are sizzling hot favourites at   to win the Andy Merrigan Cup for an unprecedented third year in a row and the fourth time in six years.Certainly, Kilcoo have it all to do, but they fear no side.Manager Mickey Moran has twice taken Slaughtneil to All-Ireland finals day and few would begrudge the Derry man a first title with Kilcoo.He has transformed the Magpies into a ruthless, disciplined machine in a quiet, unobtrusive way and has won many admirers for his style of play.He started out in management in  when he took over the reins at Derry, the first of three separate spells in charge of the county team.

While pay parity and safe services are key issues for us, the key thing is that there are enough recurrent resources in place to deliver this now and in the future.Irene said the RCN is about putting patients first, describing the scale of the hospital waiting list issue as ldquounacceptable.She added: ldquoEmploying more nurses can help bring waiting lists down. This is not a new phenomena. It is tough to work as a nurse and it is not an easy job. But we currently have a situation where some nurses are taking on extra shts to earn more money, but that is just an unacceptable way to live.Alison Megarry said patients are nursesrsquo primary concern and at the heart of what they do, highlighting the need to keep staff working in Northern Ireland to ensure they donrsquot go across the water and donrsquot come back.She revealed that she was talking to a nursing sister last week who was working on international recruitment for nurses in Mumbai to work in Northern Ireland.ldquoThe nurses in India said why would they come here when the pay is less than it is in England, Scotland and Wales. I believe thatwe can keep our nurses here, it will help to tackle the waiting list issue, she said. ldquoThe big issue we have is that the population is ageing and people are living longer which therefore impacts on waiting lists.Nurse Sonia McCoubrey said that while pay parity is one issue, additional nurses are also required. She said many newly qualied nurses are choosing to go to England, Scotland or Wales because the money is better.She also said she worries about the safety of newly qualied nurses managing dficult situations and the patients they are caring for.ldquoYou have trolley waits and people lying in corridors. There is no privacy, no dignity and the situation is appalling. You go home at night after a sht burnt out and worried about what you have seen, the nurse added.Nurse Donna Boyd also expressed concern about waiting lists and said she fears that the situation is going to get worse, forcing many people to go private.ldquoIf more money is put into the system nurses are quite happy to do even more to help reduce waiting lists. All nurses go and above what is required of them when they are working, often staying after their scheduled quitting time which is unpaid work, she said.ldquoWith more people going private because of y waiting lists, a lot of the doctors and consultants are taking on private lists which then impacts on the NHS list. I have friends who were nurses who have left the profession to work in supermarkets because they have burnt themselves out.

Across the resort,  street lights are not working.The figures are available on the NI Direct website under the reporting fault problems menu with other districthot-spots including Ballynahinch where  street lights are currently out of order.Elsewhere,  faults have been reported in Killyleagh, with  brought to the government departmentrsquos attention in Castlewellan and Crossgar. In Saintfield,  faults have been reported.In Ballygowan,  street lights are currently out of order with  and  faults reported in Ardglass and Killough respectively.Sixteen street lights are out of order in Dundrum with  faults reported in Drumaness. The figures for the Spa and Clough are  and nine respectively.Last month, the Department for Infrastructure confirmed that its current budget for street lighting repairs was approximately poundm, explaining that the figure was much lower than the pound.m needed to provide a full street lighting repair service.It also revealed that repairs are now generally limited to those that can be carried out by the departmentrsquos internal street lighting workforce which only consists of five full and three part time electricians.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran described the number of reported street light faults across large parts of East Down as ldquoalarming and hopes that the money to expedite much-needed repairs will be earmarked by the new Stormont Executive.He said broken street lights in many areas represent a health and safety issue, explaining that an examination of every town and village across the district will reveal a signicant number of faults.Cllr Curran described faulty street lights as a ldquohot topic with politicians being contacted about the issue on all almost daily basis. He said the legacy of underfunding the roads department has experienced is now clear for all to see.The politician said many will be concerned that the Department for Infrastructure does not have the money it requires to carry out much-needed repairs.ldquoWhile I understand the decision to prioritise emergency repairs, there is no doubt that the alarming figure of almost  faulty street lights across East Down is simply going to increase. Clearly the issue is going to get a lot worse before it gets better, he said.ldquoStreet lights which are not working in areas where elderly people and indeed young families live poses a major problem. A fully working street lighting system provides residents with a sense of security and helps deter would-be criminals.Cllr Curran said that while the new Stormont Executive will inevitably face calls for investment in many key areas including health and education, the Department of Infrastructure also required an injection of funding.He added: ldquoWhile the focus for some will be on major new roads schemes which is understandable, it is clear that the creaking infrastructure the government department is responsible for, including street lighting, requires major cash injection.ldquoThe street lighting issues requires immediate attention. We are still in the grip of winter and several months away from the clearer evenings. Now that we have a local minister in place, I hope to meet her on this issue and other matters of local importance.A spokeswoman for the Department for Infrastructure said that in common with many other parts of the public service, the Department continued to face budget challenges and resources were currently not available to provide for a full street lighting repair service.She added: ldquoDue to this restricted service, outages are taking longer than usual to be repaired. However, priority will be given to hazardous electrical defects and group outages..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th January 2020 Tributes.jpg","title":"Tributes to lawyer who was ‘a real gentleman’  ","story":"TRIBUTES have been paid to a lawyer who died last week.Mr Paul McAlinden, who was a barrister, died peacefully in Belfast City Hospital last Wednesday.

We support the independence of this process.”The comments were echoed by Sinn Fein. “MLA’s pay is set by an independent body, not by MLAs,” a spokesman said. “MLAs had no input into this decision, nor did they seek it.” But Harry Fone, grassroots campaign manager at the TaxPayers’ Alliance said most people could not dream of such a pay rise.“Many taxpayers will rightly askthis is the best use of their hard-earned cash,” he said. “In the current economic climate most people can only dream of such a generous pay rise. Assembly members must demonstrate to their constituents they are worth their salaries.”Alan McQuillan, a member of Independent Financial Review Panel until , said they approved an annual pay rise of £ for MLAsinflation rose above % in any year. As inflation had been around % for the past three years, the £ is “fair enough” he said. In fact the £ was sub-inflationary, so the MLAs’ salaries have actually been losing spending power as the  only estimated inflation reaching around !% per year, he added.Robin Swann: Suicide prevention will be a top priority Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingPassengers were sobbing and making calls to loved ones - Aer Lingus pilot hailed miraculous after landing plane during Storm BrendanPSNI confirm route slow moving ambulance will take - motorists urged to remain patientNI Snow Alert: Experts predict snowfall this weekend and next week - subzero temperatures expected across NIWill it snow in February   Northern Ireland long-range weather forecast as heavy rain and strong winds set to hitThis time its tears of happiness - Cate Conway shares hilarious Stephen Clements prank video involving leopard print leggings        v.. -  applyImgSrcs\" i sb  for   sb* sb u  o.dataset.srcu  u.replaceo.setAttributeo.setAttributedocumentwindowapplyImgSrcs JP  JP  JP  \"NA-BELFNEWS-\"JP  \"Politics\"      Follow Us On       Explore News Sport Irish League Football Whats On Lestyle   Farming Le   More from the Belfast News Letter  Announcements Buy a Photo  Directory Jobs Homes Cars Local Guide  Public Notices  Reader Shop Must Read Read This Events   Useful Links Contact Us   Place your Ad Advertise a Job Subscribe  Readers Charter        ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"sdlp calls for ni audit office action at council  ","story":" getRequiredClientIdforjpiconsole.log requiredClientIdcatch]EV.Core.updateUserProfile]EV.Core.updateUserProfile....... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast News Letter and agreeing to JPIMedia Publishing Ltd#s standard Terms and Conditions.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is events like this in the very heart of Penarth which demonstrate how lucky we are to have such a ying and vibrant collection of businesses, which are so accessible.It was great to witness how the streets opened up to more traditional businesses of selling hand-crafted Christmas gts and roasted chestnuts, adding to the selection of businesses we already have on offer.Many of you will be aware of Small Business Saturday, which this year falls on December . The campaign aims to encourage people to ldquoshop local and to support small businesses in their communities.For me, one of the highlights of living in Penarth is access to a vibrant High Street. The street, and town as a whole, provides such a iety there really isnrsquot any need to go anywhere .I regularly make use of shops on the High Street, particularly the greengrocers and butchers, while my we, Michelle, makes use of others. Shopping locally you are almost always guaranteed to receive a first-class service with a smile, and it is that welcome, as well as the quality of the product or service, that keeps customers coming back ndash these are the reasons I always make thattrip.Thatrsquos why Irsquove got behind our local shops for this yearrsquos Small Business Saturday. In the run up to Small Business Saturday I have been visiting businesses across the constituency to talk to local business owners about them, their staff, what they enjoy about running their own business and the challenges that they face.On Friday December  I will be visiting businesses across Penarth. If you would like me to visit your business then please get in touch with my office on    or by emailing vaughan.gething@assembly.wales.Irsquod like to take this opportunity to thank the town council, as well as all its partners in organising the lights switch-on this year.

While policy decisions have yet to be made, heat pumps are the indicated preference.ldquoOver % of oil heated homes in Great Britain fall into EPC bands D to G ndash meaning they are poorly insulated and so unsuited for heat pumps without costly insulation work.ldquoFinancial support to help the poorest families switch heating systems would most likely be made available but many households will be expected to fund the work themselves. The vast majority just wonrsquot be able to do this.ldquoIntroducing policy which isnrsquot fit for purpose could have severe consequences.

This year, she will celebrate her ninety second birthday and she discusses a letime of activism across Europe.Veganuary is an annual event which encourages people to go vegan for a month. In last yearrsquos campaign, a quarter of a million people pledged to try a vegan diet.More NewsVale school pals brave the shave for animal charityPenarth father of four is recognised in New Year Honour list for services to cricketHouse prices increased in the Vale of Glamorgan, latest figures showOnce a fringe movement, veganism is quickly gaining a vast appeal, especially amongst the young, as the environmental benefits of a plant-based diet become clearer.According to a study by the Vegan Society, , people in the UK were vegan in  ndash  and a half times higher than in . Almost half of these were people aged below .Veganism has brought with it a lucrative trade in plant-based produce as businesses move to accommodate the concerns of their customers and promote ethical alternatives to meat.Long before veganism became a dietary and commercial trendsetter, however, June Holder, a -year-old woman from Penarth, had her eyes opened to the costly effects of meat consumption. After eating a vegan breakfast at a local cafeacute, she settled down to tell me her story.ldquoIrsquove been vegan for  years, she said. ldquoMy daughter had a stall at Camden Market, and she used to collect masses of money for animal rights there. It was her who first introduced me to the cause.ldquoLater on, I organized a charity coffee morning and sent the money I raised to Compassion in World Farming. In , they sent me a magazine which showed what happened to the animals. Well, I sat down that morning and read what theyrsquod sent me ndash and I was vegan!Whilst the public has become more receptive to veganism, June still encounters hostility: ldquoPeoplersquos reactions y when I tell them Irsquom vegan. They become hostile because theyrsquore guilty, I suppose.ldquoI remember that a vegan group had a stall in the market a few years ago. They were advertising parts of Alsatians to eat. People were horried. So, when they were angry, I had a chance to talk to them. lsquoYou accept that any animal can be treated like this except when it comes to your dogsrsquo, I told them. Well, they had to accept it. How could they not Originally from Penarth, June moved to Dinas Powys from Barry after her husband, Derrick, passed away  years ago.Derrick was the owner of Holders Menswear, a menrsquos fashion store which was once renowned throughout the Vale of Glamorgan and beyond.Junersquos decision to become vegan sparked  years of dedication to activism. She joined the Animal Welfare Party, and, in her sixties and seventies, she travelled across the UK and Europe to campaign for animal rights.ldquoI demonstrated in many places. I went to Brussels twice to protest against the exportation of live animals. The International Fund for Animal Welfare took us in a coach.ldquoI was in the front row of the crowd, up against these spikes and razor wire. If they had started to push from the back, I dread to think what would have happened.ldquoThe night before the protest I had this thought: lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo. I wrote it on a little board.ldquoPeople kept tapping me on the shoulder and passing the board around the crowd and eventually it made its way back to me.What does the message mean ldquoIt means that it is more dangerous not to protest against these injustices that are happening.June still has a copy of the placard. Later, at her home, she retrieved it from a trove of scattered paraphernalia accumulated after years of protest.She has written prolically throughout her le about events which have provoked and enthused her. One poem describes the day of protest in Brussels. It reflects Junersquos unceasing dedication to animal welfare but also her frustration at the pace of change:ldquoThe writer of these verses was, quite some time ago, in Brussels with a poster which now rings yet more true. lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo is what the message said.ldquoThen round it went to young and old for everyone to read. From countries all round Europe, but the farmers paid no heed. Live transport, a huge issue then, continues just the same.Another poem read:ldquoChristmas is a time to spend, but why not save instead  In sheds around the country to sate the publicrsquos lust for something huge to set their feast. The turkeys just exist.ldquoTen million in this country at Christmas time alone. Is this the way to talk of peace and teach our children love Veganuary runs throughout January.

The UKrsquos withdrawal from the EU will begin later this month and we have a Conservative Government in Westminster until at least .Regardless of the numbers in the Commons, the Labour Party still has to stand up for those we represent. I am confident that my colleague, Stephen Doughty MP will continue to do that.The Labour Party will now move to elect a new Leader and Deputy Leader, a chance to reunite the Party and hold the Prime Minister to account for his actions.I am truly glad to see that several MPs from across the Party have put their names forward to stand for both positions. This offers the membership and the country a broader choice.I am yet to decide who I will back in the forthcoming election but I know that I want to see a vision from each of the candidates. For me, that vision needs to be a realistic reflection of our last decade out of government in Westminster, but also a strategy for reconnecting with our voters and securing a Labour government which can deliver for those who need us most.Finally, I want to thank the staff across the NHS and wider public services for their hard work under increasing pressures, particularly during the winter period.Our public services work hard all year round and many take the sacrice of working over the Christmas and New Year period for which I, and many others, are extremely grateful.As everyou would like to speak with me, you can call my office on    or write to me at Vaughan.Gething@assembly.wales or Office of Vaughan Gething AM, Room C, National Assembly for Wales, CF NA. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

They each received weekly book vouchers, provided by Egmont, to spend at Grfin Books, and coffee shop vouchers donated by local businesses.In , the families committed to reading with their children for  minutes per day.The bookshoprsquos owner, Mel Grfin, said:\"We were delighted to be selected to participate in this exciting project. The idea was to encourage children to experience the joy of reading for pleasure, rather than seeing it as just something they have to do for school\"Research shows that being able to choose their own books, as well as sitting down regularly to read with a parent, makes a real dference to childrens enjoyment of reading. This in turn benefits their schoolwork across the whole curriculum, not just in literacy.\"We are also grateful to the local businesses who generously donated the coffee shop vouchers to help make this happen.ldquoThe contributions of local businesses show once again what great community spirit we have here in Penarth!\"In total,  local businesses donated coffee shop vouchers.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Dr Anthony Mercer and Dr Dimitris Stamatellos used the UK Distributed Research using Advanced Computingsupercomputing facility to simulate the evolution of protoplanetary discs around red dwarf stars.Protoplanetary discs are rotating structures of dense gas and dust found around all newly-born stars.Researchers found thatthese young discs are big enough, they can break up and form gas giant planets.This theory predicts the formation of giant planets happening within a few thousand years, a timescale which is extremely fast in astrophysical terms.Dr Mercer, who led the research, said: ldquoThe fact that planets may be able to form on such short timescale around tiny stars is incredibly exciting.ldquoOur work shows that planet formation is particularly robust: other worlds can form even around small stars in a iety of ways, and therefore planets may be more erse than we previously thought.According to the study, these planets are extremely hot when they form, with core temperatures reaching thousands of degrees.Planets that are so hot would be relatively easy to observe when they are still young.Without an internal energy source they become fainter with time, and the window of opportunity to directly observe them is very small.Nevertheless, they can still be indirectly observed by their effect on their host star.Co-author of the research Dr Stamatellos, astrophysicist in UCLanrsquos Jeremiah Horrocks Institute, added: ldquoThis was the first time that we were able not only to see planets forming in computer simulations but also to determine their initial properties with great detail.ldquoIt was fascinating to find that these planets are of the lsquofast and furiousrsquo kind ndash they form quickly and they are unexpectedly hot.Future observations of planets around very young red dwarf stars will test the predictions of this new theory.The research was funded by a PhD studentship from the Science and Technologies Facilities Council ..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Giant planets  ucould form around small stars faster than thought u article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

While doing this, they were also timed and weighed.When the flying insects ed to their ldquonest, the researchers timed how long it took for them to vomit up the nectar they had collected.ldquoFor low strength nectar, bees had a quick vomit that only lasted a few seconds, then were back out and foraging again, said Dr Pattrick.He added: ldquoBut for really thick nectar they took ages to vomit, sometimes straining for nearly a minute.For any given nectar concentration, bees regurgitate the nectar quicker than they initially drink it.Dr Pattrick said: ldquoItrsquos hard to drink a thick, sticky liquid, but imagine trying to spit it out again through a straw ndash that would be even harder.ldquoAt a certain sugar concentration, the energy gain versus energy loss is optimised for nectar feeders.Scientists say the perfect nectar sugar concentration for the highest energy intake depends on the species drinking it, because dferent species feed in dferent ways.The research was funded by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title:  uToo much sugar in nectar slows down bees u article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Diverging substantiallywill bring in the requirement for inspections at the border for customs. “That hasn’t been agreed formally. That is quite a lot for UK and NI operators to deal with – haulage and freight movers, to get to grips with that. There are major operational challenges.“Northern Ireland also leave the customs union with GB, but there will be a customs border will between GB and NI to continue to essentially allow freight and good to travel.”Since Boris Johnson’s deal was floated, it’s understood the shipping industry is now drawing up plans for EU border checks in Britain for trade bound for Northern Ireland.According to the BBC, freight could be erted through ports with space for inspections at areas such as Liverpool and Stranraer.Richard says checks are likely to be carried out at the ports. The issue  He says backlogs, queues and congestion. “ to queueing back on to ferries and ships, which may miss or mess up timetables,” he says. He says while “many wouldn’t welcome new formalities”, a lot of cargo – such as dry bulk, fuel, aggregates and containerised products –  will find it reasonably easy to deal with. The main concern is around ‘roll on, roll off’, where the containers or lorries are driven on board a ship.“Those modes are where it could be the most problematic, as it’s based on a fluid process,” he says.“I think there is a definite concern from ports and shipping industries that businesses may be impacted negatively, and may reassess business operations.“I wouldn’t say it’s a doomsday scenario but it’s a real challenge for the sector to overcome. Politicians will have to make sure that with any kind of arrangements, there will be a good solution. This is a new proposal, so we are unsure what the details will be.”Brexit aside, Richard says the industry as a whole is that while the largely commercial and independent ports aren’t in need of ‘hand outs’ from the public sector, areas such as connectivity, roads and planning are key to their success.“It’s about making sure the planning system works, and is swt, and responsive,” he said. “They can be agile, for example, building a new shed, terminal or quay, or new developments in the water.“Where there are environmental sensitivities it can sometimes slow down the planning regimes so we are keen to see them not slow down. We welcome environmental policies but we want a scheme that will work and doesn’t have unintended consequences.“Shipping, although not perfect, is one of the most clean and efficient methods of transport. It’s a balance between environmental protection, but enabling ports and regions to grow.“If there are schemes, ports can find there are investors willing to come in, but they do rely on government – local or national – to finance road and rail connectivity.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/year1.jpg","title":"yearbook a look back at ","story":"Posted on Thursday January  by Ulster Business It was another year shaped by political turmoil and the loss of some giants of industry, but it was also a period which saw great opportunity and growth.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/234234343334.jpg","title":"stormont deal business back new assembly","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by John Mulgrew Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Julian Smith and Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney. Pic Kelvin Boyes Northern Ireland’s business community has given its support for a deal which has seen the Assembly up-and-running after a three year stasis. The Northern Ireland Assembly couldon Fridaypolitical parties back a deal tabled by the UK and Irish Governments. DUP leader Arlene Foster has indicated that her party will back the deal, while Sinn Fein said its leadership will meet to discuss it on Friday. The UUP has said they will consider the deal, but are willing to attend the Assemblyit sits. In a joint statement urging politicians to accept the ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal, NI Chamber president John Healy, vice president Ian Henry, and chief executive Ann McGregor, said: “After three years of paralysis, we now have a workable deal that will allow an Executive to start addressing the problems within our health service and education system. They will also be able to take action to grow our economy and support the community and voluntary sector. “We therefore encourage the five main political parties to progress it urgently. Business, health and education cannot wait any longer - failure is not an option. “Now is the time for our politicians to show mature leadership and help navigate a path to the future by accepting this deal.” Secretary of State Julian Smith and Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney published the New Decade, New Approach deal on Thursday evening and urged parties to back it andto Stormont on Friday. Reacting to the news, Trade NI – the alliance of Retail NI, Manufacturing NI and Hospitality Ulster – said: “We welcome the draft deal published by the British and Irish Governments in the final round of talks to restore devolution. We strongly encourage all the main parties of Northern Ireland to sign the deal today and get the Assembly back up and running.” “As our three organisations represent the majority of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland, we are cautiously hopeful that the deal and aof the Assembly will see the development of policies and legislation at devolved level and the kick start that our economy desperately needs. The clear prioritisation of the Northern Ireland economy highlights the many challenges that businesses have faced over the past three years and our message to the parties is that we support you in your endeavours to secure this deal.” “While this is a good start, improvements are still needed to drive the economy forward and support the growth of business across Northern Ireland. As stated in our Vision  document, Northern Ireland’s potential is signicant but reform and growth is needed to create the modern economy we are capable of and deserve.” FSB NI policy chair, Tina McKenzie, said: “Businesses will welcome the agreement published last night as a step forward towards restoring devolved government, something for which FSB has been calling since the collapse of the institutions three years ago. “The draft agreement contains some positive commitments to bolster the local economy, on issues like skills, infrastructure and Brexit. However, theof devolution is by no means a panacea it just means that at long last we have elected representatives in place to tackle a very dficult task. “The next Executive must move quickly to deliver on the myriad issues which have been left unaddressed for far too long. While the health service will be high on the agenda, we must not lose sight of the need to bolster our SME economy, which is the absolute bedrock on which the first-class public services to which we all aspire are built. “Ministers must move swtly to support our economy at one of the most turbulent times for many decades, starting by lowering the rates burden on small businesses, whilst also moving forward rapidly with key infrastructure projects which have stalled and ensuring that our schools, colleges, and universities are providing students with the skills they need for the jobs of the future. “In order to begin to address these issues, the parties must put pragmatism first and get back round the Executive table.” Colin Neill, chief executive, Hospitality Ulster, said: “We encourage all parties to seize this opportunity and sign up to the deal published late last night to get the Assembly and Executive back as quickly as possible.” “This is the best chance to bring the devolved government back to le. Our message to the party leaders is clear, we support you in your endeavours and encourage you to get the New Decade, New Approach agreement over the line today. Redmond McFadden, president of the Londonderry Chamber of Commerce said: “The Londonderry Chamber as well as other representatives of business, education, health, trade unions and civic organisations, held a meeting with the five main political parties at Stormont last night. “At that meeting we pressed the urgent need for the parties to agree the draft deal which was published by the British and Irish Governments. Three years without Ministers making local decisions has had an enormous impact on our economy and wider society. A lack of effective and meaningful representation here is curtailing investment in our region, stling job creation and driving our young people away. Simon Hamilton, chief executive of Belfast Chamber, said: “Belfast Chamber welcomes progress towards the restoration of the Northern Ireland Executive and encourages the local political parties to reach agreement. For the last three years, our members have seen how an absence of decision making has stunted growth and stled investment. The proposed priorities for the Executive contain some issues which Belfast Chamber has been supportive of for some time. “Other policies which could boost our economy are noticeably missing but we look forward to joining with our colleagues across the business community to ensure that the new Executive pursues an agenda that grows jobs and boosts our economy.” Northern Ireland Local Government Association chief executive, Derek McCallan said: “I am very pleased that the British and Irish governments have tabled a draft deal on restoring the NI Executive. I hope that an agreement can be reached quickly to get the Stormont institutions back up and running immediately. For three years, our eleven local councils have been the only ing form of democratically elected government in Northern Ireland. Local government has been a vital democratic anchor during this period and ensured the provision of crucial public services for local citizens. “It’s time to bridge the democratic deficit and unlock the potential of local government in Northern Ireland by investing in our local councils. An Executive commitment to a devolution bill and greater financial powers and resources will drive a transformation in Northern Ireland’s democratic governance and help create a more sustainable democracy, environment and economy for Northern Ireland.” Kirsty McManus, national director, IoD NI, said: “The ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal is to be welcomed, filled with ambition that,fulfilled, can deliver real improvements for the people and businesses of Northern Ireland. “We would therefore urge all parties to get behind the deal to enable the speedy restoration of the Executive. “Commitments from the British and Irish governments for some crucial pieces of infrastructure such as the York Street Interchange, upgrades to the A and A road and Northern Ireland’s wastewater network are particularly pleasing. “The expansion of university provision at the Magee campus in Derry meanwhile will go some way to rebalancing the regional economy. “Plans for multi-year budgets and increased civic engagement will also improve overall governance. “From a business perspective however, we would have liked to have seen more around a new skills agenda, which urgently require focus alongside a renewed look at the Apprenticeship Levy which is not included in this deal. “On behalf of our members, we will also monitor closely commitments to bring forward legislation that will allow unfettered access to the Great Britain market for local business following Brexit.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_Abacus-Grand-Central-1--1-.jpg","title":"belfastforlife expo bringing together ni diaspora","story":"Posted on Monday  January  by Ulster Business A new event will bring together the Northern Ireland diaspora and business community in a bid to promote and develop the region.

The firm is marking two decades leading the way in the industry, and according to founder Terry Moore, the firm is well on its way to doubling its size and embracing the latest technology for its clients Outsource Solutions is a firm which is ahead of the curve when it comes to emerging technologies and a company which embeds itself in a client’s business to ensure total integration – ultimately helping to boost it and help it grow.“Our approach is to embed ourselves into the customer’s business, and take IT out of the boardroom,” Terry says. “What we do is try to get ahead of some of the problems, understand the business and recognise that the technology is there to benefit the company.“We are there to make sure that business is possible – enriching lives, making things easier and safer. An important part of this is the relationships that we have.”Terry formed Outsource Solutions  years ago, around the time of the so-called ‘millennium bug’ when he says some firms were using scare tactics to get businesses to spend hundreds of thousands of pounds, often unnecessarily. “For me, one of the things I felt was missing was understanding a business and factoring that refresh into it over a few years – letting them get on with what they do.”The company – which now has five locations, including Belfast – is a full service IT firm which manages every element of a business’s infrastructure, including security, enterprise wi-fi, telecoms and networking.“We now have just over  staff and are we are on a five-year plan to double in size again. There has been considerable growth in areas such as enterprise wi-fi, converged networks and telecoms,” Terry says.Client retention is also something which Terry and the business prides itself on. “Every customer that we signed up with in , we still work with,” he says. “We will give a recommendation as to how we think a network should be built. If they accept that, then we take it on as a risk.“Technology is just a toolbox for us to allow us to deliver IT – technology to allow them to really access and control their data.”Outsource is a business which has been at the forefront of emerging developments in technology, including cyber-security. Terry says, even just a few years ago, it wasn’t being taken seriously by many businesses. That has now changed signicantly.“In the last couple of years, cyber has completely exploded – but we were ahead of our time,” he says. “My experience of last  years and the last five in particular is that there has been a massive job to do in educating businesses and their users about the cyber threat.“We have reached the tipping point and the human firewall is becoming much stronger – people and users are more sensitive to what it means, making it all a far better place. But there are still businesses which are happy to cut fast and loose, and take risks.”While the company’s client base started off in professional services businesses – such as law and accounting – it’s grown into a host of sectors, including transport, logistics, manufacturing and engineering.“We have carved out a niche in hospitality as well – particularly in areas such as enterprise wi-fi, converged networks and communication, generally.”Terry says Outsource is seeing business growth among many of Northern Ireland’s medium-sized businesses, with more than  staff.“Our job is to enhance, improve and optimise the performance for as many users as we can. Our aim over the next four years is to be able to deliver those services outside Northern Ireland, across the rest of the UK and into the Republic of Ireland.“For us, the constant is that we are always there at that point of where technology is consumed. The role we play is being integrated and a trusted advisor. That’s how we will continue to be successful.”As for the next  years, with a rise in automation and articial intelligence – something Terry says has to become a little more intelligent and a little less articial – the next major leap will be the advent of quantum computing. It’s something which remains in its infancy.“While it’s still early, we are on the verge of the most aggressive technological change that any of us have ever seen,” he says.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
