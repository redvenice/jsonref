Norton‑Taylor shrugged. A few days later, he found himself arriving at a grand building in Carlton Gardens.It was the headquarters of MI6. Upstairs a figure with a military bearing in a pin-stripe suit greeted Norton-Taylor. The person said: “Don’t tell anyone you have come here.” Another interview followed. It featured questions on the policy of Harold Wilson’s Labour government towards Southern Rhodesia.Norton-Taylor decided that a career in spying wasn’t for him. What the world of espionage lost, journalism gained. The two professions are not so different: both involve gathering secrets, with the reporter’s job to “reveal them”, Norton-Taylor writes, in his penetrating memoir, The State of Secrecy.Over the next 50 years, Norton-Taylor reported for the  on Whitehall and the intelligence and security agencies. I was a colleague. He argues that a culture of excessive secrecy down the ages is responsible for many of Britain’s current ills. There is, he says, a peculiar British willingness to put up with official secrecy, not seen in the US or in Europe.The “fetish” for keeping the public in ignorance is absurd and counterproductive, he argues. It led to disastrous wars (Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya) and to egregious acts by the spooks (MI6’s collusion with the US in the abduction and torture of terror suspects, denied for years). Secrecy doesn’t enhance national security. It radically undermines it, he thinks.Norton-Taylor is especially scathing about the “sclerotic” and “secretive” ministry of defence. It has wasted billions on “ill-conceived” weapons irrelevant to modern conflict. He’s critical, too, of the foreign office, which won’t release files on colonial-era abuses. They include the torture of Mau Mau insurgents in Kenya and the murder of Malayan villagers in 1948.Why do we accept this? The answer, the memoir suggests, is a naive belief that the UK state is a force for good. That, and a love of arcane ritual. Peers and MPs make up parliament’s intelligence and security committee. It oversees the secret agencies. A precondition of sitting on it is to swear a privy council oath. Members promise “to keep secret all matters… revealed unto you”.It is this mystical culture that possibly explains why the committee didn’t leak its own recent report into Russian meddling ahead of last year’s election. Boris Johnson cynically sat on it. You would have thought at least one MP would put the public interest above medieval vows. And yet none did. Voters are still in the dark.There is a tradition of journalists willing to suck up to British intelligence and publish spook-friendly stories – sometimes wildly inaccurate ones. Norton-Taylor was too independent and clear-thinking for that. He maintained good contacts in this crepuscular world, though. Often MI5 and MI6 officers told him to keep digging. His long relationship with the spies was “cat and mouse”, he writes.Along the way there was fun to be had. Norton-Taylor’s first  job was in Brussels in the 1970s, a congenial and gossipy city where everyone spied on everyone else. In 1986, he spent six weeks in Australia covering the trial of Peter Wright, the former MI5 officer whose memoir, Spycatcher, Margaret Thatcher tried to ban.The cabinet secretary, Sir Robert Armstrong, defended himself against charges of lying by saying he had merely been “economical with the truth”. For Norton-Taylor and other reporters sitting on the Sydney press bench, there were lunches of freshly caught fish washed down with good chardonnay. Best of all, Thatcher and the establishment lost.As the Soviet Union wobbled, Norton-Taylor flew to Moscow in 1990 to interview George Blake, the MI6 spy turned KGB agent. He travelled with Pat Pottle, a peace campaigner who had helped Blake escape from Wormwood Scrubs prison. Blake’s flat was filled with works by Lenin, 55 volumes, as well as books by Trollope and a life of Gladstone.Blake said he had got on well with the Cambridge spy Donald Maclean. He was less keen on the “alcohol-fuelled” Kim Philby, Norton-Taylor recalls. Double agents – traitors and defectors – could be useful to both sides, he says. Oleg Gordievsky, the most celebrated KGB defector, told British intelligence the Politburo was convinced the US and UK were about to launch a preemptive nuclear strike.The State of Secrecy is good on Blair-era misconduct. It takes aim at Sir Richard Dearlove, the MI6 director at the time of the Iraq invasion who gave Tony Blair wrong intelligence about weapons of mass destruction. Norton-Taylor isn’t universally critical of spy chiefs. He praises Eliza Manningham-Buller, the former head of MI5, whose openness and honesty he grew to respect.The State of Secrecy is an entertaining and timely book, written by a fine reporter who has made a habit of speaking unwelcome truth to power.• The State of Secrecy: Spies and the Media in Britain by Richard Norton-Taylor is published by Bloomsbury (£25).

Houchen wants to decontaminate and redevelop the site into a low-CO2 manufacturing hub, creating 20,000 jobs in the next 20 years.The site has stood rusting on the North Sea coast for more than four years amid squabbles over how much it is worth. An independent valuation estimated the contested 352 hectares at just under £20m, but the banks – which lent SSI £800m in the year before it went into liquidation – claim it is worth “tens of millions of pounds more”, according to Houchen.It currently costs UK taxpayers £20m a year just to keep the mothballed site safe, by Houchen’s calculation. About 300 people still work there as engineers, technicians and security guards.Demolishing and decontaminating the site would cost about £190m, said Houchen. He leads a new body, the South Tees Development Corporation (STDC), that wants to redevelop the whole site, which is – as Houchen likes to point out – “three times the size of Gibraltar, six times the size of the City of London and 1.5 times the footprint of Heathrow.”STDC has already acquired 575 hectares of land on the site but a 12-day public inquiry begins on Tuesday to decide whether the government can grant the STDC a compulsory purchase order (CPO) on the SSI land.Redcar voted in its first Conservative MP in December, and in January the government committed £71m to pay for the CPO and future decontamination work.After his surprise election as mayor in May 2017, Houchen began negotiations to secure the former SSI land with the three banks in Thailand who hold a charge over the SSI UK’s assets – Tisco, the Siam Commercial Bank and the state-owned Krung Thai bank.In May 2018 Houchen flew to Thailand to try to persuade the banks to sell up. He returned home with what he thought was an agreement, only for the Thai bankers, led by Krung Thai, to change their minds over what the site was worth and play what he calls “a load of silly games”.He said: “It is an absolute travesty that the UK taxpayer has to pay a penny for any of this, all because there was a bad business deal done by SSI UK, which went bust, and three Thai banks who can’t get their money back.“There absolutely needs to be a review of what mechanism is in place for large industrial complexes and businesses if a company goes bust.” Houchen noted that Teesside was also home to the largest chemical works in western Europe. He said: “God forbid any of that goes bust because we will be in the same position.”The banks all object to the CPO, saying “a gross lack of transparency exists due to STDC’s near total failure to publish its relevant meeting agendas, reports and minutes”. They also accuse the Tees Valley combined authority, led by Houchen, of hiding behind confidentiality clauses to avoid handing over “key documentation”.Houchen said the Thai banks did not understand the importance of the site for Teesside, which produced steel for landmarks like the Sydney Harbour Bridge, Canary Wharf in London and the new World Trade Center in New York.He said: “I met the Thai ambassador to the UK in London to impress on him the importance of it, and he seemed completely disengaged. He said he would follow up with me on a number of points and I never heard from him again.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/290436b4193f3bdad66187e51a1d27c974dc3fe2/18_192_2959_1775/master/2959.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=128f19b8c5e31535abe22b9cb76ddd36","title":"rise in number of uk companies entering administration","story":"Construction and retail badly hit as 1,400 firms went into administration last yearBrexit uncertainty and economic turmoil created a particularly tough year for the building and construction industry, while the real estate and property sector also suffered, it found. The demise and ongoing restructuring of a large number of high street retailers has had a “profound” impact on commercial property income and values.KPMG’s study of official insolvency notices posted in the London Gazette reveals that a total of 1,403 companies went into administration during 2019, up from 1,341 the previous year. It does not include high-profile corporate collapses such as that of Thomas Cook, which went straight into liquidation.There was a particular increase in insolvencies in the third quarter of the year, during which 420 firms went into administration including the fashion brands Jack Wills and Karen Millen and the travel firms Late Rooms and York-based Super Break.Firms deemed to be in financial distress may go into administration in an attempt to salvage themselves as a going concern or to recoup more money for creditors.The official annual total compiled by the government’s Insolvency Service is due to be published shortly. Its 2018 data published last April showed the highest level of company administrations in five years.Insolvencies fell back to more typical quarterly levels in the final quarter of last year, with 311 administrations between October and December. High-profile cases included the greetings card retailer Clintons, Toto Energy, and the women’s fashion retailer Bonmarché.In the building and construction industry there were 254 administrations, compared with 216 in 2018, including the Cheshire construction group Pochin’s. It was also a challenging year for companies in the real estate sector, with 69 administrations, up from 53 in 2018, including Bolton-based Harewood Associates.Blair Nimmo, the head of restructuring at KPMG UK, said: “2019 was a year characterised by profound political and economic uncertainty, with consumer confidence remaining fragile and companies continuing to bear the brunt of rising overheads and increased costs. While many battened down the financial hatches, adopting a prudent and cautious strategy, for some, the challenging trading conditions proved to be a bridge too far.”Nimmo said the general election result had created a positive mood which appeared to have slowed down the level of corporate collapses. “It’s certainly not apparent that we are about to see an influx of insolvencies over the months ahead,” he said. “December’s election result brought with it a degree of certainty, and business confidence seems to have responded positively.”Only last week, however, KPMG was appointed as administrator to the department store chain Beales, threatening 1,300 jobs in the latest blow to the UK high street.﻿"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71531c696638d8eb84fad99fe6d3dd361f401ff8/0_67_2016_1210/master/2016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=994ac1a6da34304edb00e7311e6cf410","title":"teenagers are the hardest part of parenting but thats only half the story","story":"When my two daughters were small, I thought that was as bad as it could getThere’s a scene in the latest season of Sex Education where Jean (Gillian Anderson) sits across from her son Otis (Asa Butterfield). They’re fighting because he’s awful. He whines at her, the way kids like him do, about why she won’t just forgive him. It’s so unfair! Anderson takes a long, tearful look at her terrible son and says: “Because as the primary carer in your life, I always get your worst. And I’m tired of it.”For a show about kids figuring out love and sex, it was a beautiful piece about the hardest part of parenting: teenagers.I was a pretty typical teenager. I had a boyfriend my parents hated. I dropped a knotted sheet over the balcony to sneak out at night and came home reeking of cigarettes and cheap beer. My parents were always yelling at me. I was mean, or angry, or self-centred. Mum would threaten: one day I would have teenagers and they would do the same to me.No, I thought. My teenagers will be different. They will be thoughtful, dutiful young adults who do everything right. They will respect me and talk openly and act kindly. We will be best friends always!My first daughter was born when I was 20, almost a teenager myself. When they were small, I thought that was the worst it could be. Waking up five times a night? Done it. Hiding during a supermarket tantrum? Yep. Scraping explosive poo out of the DVD player? Twice. I remember the exquisite relief of deciding, at 3am, a bottle that I’d picked off the floor was probably sterile enough. I was so tired I thought I would die.As they got older, parenting did get easier. They went to school. They tied their own shoelaces. They made themselves breakfast. I could have real conversations with them and I realised they were smart and funny, kind and interesting.Then they turned 13.It was about the same time we stopped watching Frozen on repeat. One week we had it on every day, and the next my children had grown into Jim Henson creations that shouted all the time.I watched in horror as my sweet, spirited tweens turned into rancid, angry teenagers. My Facebook statuses switched from photos at ice-cream parlours to desperate pleas for conversations with more than one syllable. They stopped reading books in favour of dank Tumblr feeds they started wearing eyeliner and listening to music I didn’t “get”. Suddenly they picked up on the double entendre at the dinner table and they did not like it.Where I had once had gentle, quietly worried toddlers I now have aggressively panicked giants. When the little one grew taller than me, I started to feel like I was in trouble all the time. Other people’s parents let them go to the city on Saturday night! Other people’s parents don’t talk about periods! Other people’s parents don’t have hundreds of empty chocolate wrappers in their cars!Now they answer back in voices I don’t recognise. Sassing me. Ignoring me. Slamming doors. I buy the wrong food, the uncool sneakers, the off-brand snacks. I don’t know who BTS are, or how to do cosplay. I’m somehow both too much and not enough like Amy Poehler in Mean Girls.I’ve started shutting myself in the bathroom just to wonder how I got it all wrong. I’m realising, with horror, that Mum was right.You know when you’re young and you shout at your parents “YOU WOULDN’T UNDERSTAND” and they tell you they were young once too? And you think, impossible, you were always a crone with a mortgage.They were right about that, too. It turns out the only way to parent teenagers is to try to understand.Babies’ needs are simple. When they cry, there are four options: hungry, tired, dirty, gassy. Now when my teenagers cry I have to unpack a lifetime of trying to understand the world. Their problems aren’t: “I want new Littlest Pet Shops.” Instead they ask: “How do I know if I’m getting things right?” or “Why does everyone hate me?” They have abstract ideas but don’t know how to fix them. They are worried about things I can’t solve.My daughters are 16 and 14 now and they know how to look after themselves. I’ve taught them everything they could need to be independent, capable adults. They can cook from recipes and ask girls on dates and catch a train and pretend not to see texts they don’t like. I was so smug teaching them those things.But those lessons were easy. Showing them how to function is part of what makes the rest of this so hard. All they need from me now are the impossible things.At the end of last year, our beloved family cat died. He had cancer, and one Sunday afternoon we had to rush him to the vet for his last breaths. My little daughter had known him her whole life. The others left the room when the drugs were administered but she and I stayed there together. Her face was flushed and determined.At home, the rooms were quiet. We watched some TV together on the couch. When night finally came, my independent, headstrong, furious daughter said: “Could you sleep in my bed?” And I did, for two days. Every few hours she reached her soft hand across to me and I held it.JeanGillian Anderson was only half-right when she said that parenting a teenager means always getting their worst. My daughters are tough and stubborn. But they are also determined and courageous, bringing big energy to causes they support. They can be snarky and flippant, but they’re sharp and clever. They care deeply, argue loudly and are ruled by their hearts.At their worst, we fight and cry and misunderstand each other. But their best is amazing, and I know that’s what will last.• Anna Spargo-Ryan, from Melbourne, is the author of The Gulf and The Paper House, and winner of the 2016 Horne prize"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/230991959691554728c46278e8bbd4684402103e/0_0_7952_4771/master/7952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c6729dd661e0866c9b392a9765d49696","title":"committees blind hiring and flexible work how to build a diverse workforce","story":"By limiting yourself in the recruitment process you may miss out on someone who’s right for the job. These simple steps will help to cultivate an inclusive organisationBut ersity isn’t limited to a candidate’s race, gender, or age – it includes their education, socioeconomic background, sexuality, religion, mental and physical health and many more facets. When we create environments that encourage different opinions and contain a multitude of backgrounds and experiences, we broaden our communities, which in turn benefits both the work and the culture of the organisation.Here’s how to get started with building an inclusive and erse business:Look outside of the obvious education channelsThis may come as a surprise, but where someone studied - for their qualifications – doesn’t necessarily correlate to their qualities as a candidate. It’s important to be intentional about recruitment, and if you are only accepting candidates who have a certain level of education, or attended a certain type of university, you may be missing out on someone just right for the job. Go further afield when you attend university job fairs and remember to think digitally. With an increasing number of courses being offered online, make sure you connect with those graduates as well. The Open University has been offering qualifications through distance learning for 50 years. It has an excellent resource – the OU’s OpportunityHub, which connects prospective employers with graduates and alumni around the country for work and internships. The OU also regularly runs OU Online TalentConnect, a digital careers fair where employers can chat and interact with its uniquely erse body of graduates and undergraduates all over the UK and internationally.“The OU provides a unique supply of candidates, as a majority study alongside full-time employment – it shows a true commitment and a willingness to go that extra mile,” says the HMRC’s Memunatu Bangura.Create a ersity, equity, and inclusion committeeHave a specific committee to oversee ersity, equity, and inclusion at your organisation, to ensure that not only the roles you are hiring, but the work that you do appeals to a broad group of people. Of course, ersity isn’t just about hiring – but it’s probably a good idea to ensure that the team responsible for hiring are erse themselves.Could the role be remote? Or part-time?For many candidates, especially those with disabilities, knowing that a job can be done remotely, or part-time, is deeply attractive. You can also sign up to be a part of the Disability Confident programme, which signals to jobseekers with disabilities that your organisation supports and encourages a talent pool that is inclusive. When pulling together your job description, think seriously about whether it would be possible to offer remote work, or a job share – many parents benefit from flexible schedules.Consider mature studentsNot everyone attends university. Many candidates from lower-income backgrounds, or BAME candidates, may not have been given the same access to opportunity as others, and many people choose to attend university later in life, if at all. Mature students are defined as being undergraduates over the age of 21, and they account for almost 300,000 people a year. According to Ucas, the majority of mature students are women who live at home, undertaking degrees in vocational subjects. These are candidates who will have learned to juggle work, or parenting, alongside their studies.“We want to work with OU students and graduates because we know they are highly motivated and talented iniduals who have the potential to make an enormous contribution to Mencap as either staff or volunteers. We work across England, Wales and Northern Ireland and we know that OU students are spread across the whole of the UK too,” says Jen Stoneman, volunteer services coordinator at Mencap.Be realistic about your goalsWhile it would be amazing to cultivate a erse work environment, it won’t happen overnight.

Pitt saw off strong competition from Al Pacino and Joe Pesci for The Irishman, Tom Hanks for A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood and Anthony Hopkins for The Two Popes.In the 1960s-set Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, directed by Quentin Tarantino, Pitt’s Booth is the easygoing stunt double for fading star Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) Booth also encounters the notorious Manson “family” who are living outside Los Angeles at the Spahn Ranch, a former filming location.Pitt, 56, began his acceptance speech with a reference to the impeachment trial of Donald Trump and its blocking of John Bolton’s testimony. “They told me I only have 45 seconds up here,” said Pitt, “… which is 45 seconds more than the senate gave John Bolton this week.”The actor dedicated his award to “my kids, who colour everything I do – I adore you” before paying tribute to Tarantino, whom he described as “an original … one of a kind. The film industry would be a much drier place without you.” He also gave a shout-out to his parents, to stunt people, and to his co-star DiCaprio, on whose coattails he said he was “happy to ride … the view’s fantastic”.Pitt has already won a string of prizes for the role, including best supporting actor at the Baftas, Golden Globes and Screen Actors Guild. This is his first Oscar for acting, having previously been nominated for best supporting actor for 12 Monkeys and best actor for The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and Moneyball. However, his work as a producer has seen him win a best picture Oscar for 12 Years a Slave and earn best picture nominations for Moneyball and The Big Short."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f75decfa6b55f81976357092e260abadc8516f8/0_127_1903_1141/master/1903.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc19918803b01398c082259a96ac34fc","title":"joaquin phoenixs oscars speech in full","story":"The full text of Phoenix’s passionate acceptance speech, after winning the best actor Academy Award for JokerI’m full of so much gratitude now.

Parasite’s stunning best picture Oscar win – the very first for a film wholly not in the English tongue – has finally cracked wide open the ghetto of “foreign-language” cinema, that most patronising and LA-centric of designations.Past best picture winners The Last Emperor (1988) and Slumdog Millionaire (2009) both had large chunks of their dialogue in a foreign language, but they were also both to varying degrees products of the Hollywood system. The Artist (2012) was French but largely mute, and it swore firm allegiance to Tinseltown. Parasite – with which Bong Joon-ho returned to South Korea after two English-language films – is a pure outsider to the American studio cabal. It has run with easy confidence through awards season to snatch the biggest prize of all in a potentially paradigm-shifting win.Huge though this undoubtedly is for Bong, it could be even bigger for the Oscars. Fully embracing the widest possible definition of cinema could be a chance for the awards to reclaim the mainstream relevancy the awards have surrendered over the last 20 years. Bong hit the nail on the head when he said: “The Oscars are not an international film festival. They’re very local.” But becoming a ceremony for all cinema, and not just that in the English language, could restore the Oscars’ primacy. This would mean radical change, though: abolishing the international feature film category – as the foreign-language gong was renamed this year – and trying to increase the representation of non-US work in all other categories.Hollywood may still be top dog of global cinema, but the truth is that the Oscars no longer have the allure they once did. They have become disconnected from the American mainstream, dominated by specialty films that almost seem purpose-made for “awards consideration”. In the last 15 years, only five best picture winners have grossed more than $100m domestically (and then only just a bit over): Argo, The King’s Speech, Slumdog Millionaire, The Departed and Million Dollar Baby. And with the odd exception, such as Moonlight, an air of cultural irrelevancy has lingered about recent winners. The Oscars have become a millstone to host, and non-essential to watch.Ironically, Parasite would be the perfect film to usher in a new populist era. It is a classically structured picture, the most mainstream of Bong’s career to date (apart, perhaps, from The Host), spun around a tight premise: working-class clowns usurp a rich family’s lifestyle by posing as high-class tutors. This is the kind of high-concept sell, fuelled with contemporary resonance, on which the Hollywood studios used to rely on to hawk original ideas. That was before the industry sold its soul to IP and franchising the very thing that made the Oscars, and the kind of film garlanded there, marginal.American films would still dominate an internationalised Oscars, as they do the global box office. But surely the sense of excitement would be heightened if other players were more readily admitted to the top table. Bong’s underdog story has enlivened this year’s race – so imagine how opening up to the best of Bollywood, the rising Chinese industry, the local powerhouse Japanese and Turkish outfits, Nollywood and beyond, would adrenalise things further. Audiences in countries with Oscar runners would be so much more invested – aware that they are not merely passive “markets” for Hollywood product, but get to speak in the mainstream conversation too. Language should matter less in this day and age, as Bong pointed out with typical succinctness in his comment about the “one-inch high barrier of subtitles”. Only the Anglophone markets cling to this prejudice."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8217d2001f84c314d94bfe4721acb2103c2ad37/0_248_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6ac7d51b49a089acaa2be76f54e4b7a6","title":"parasite first foreign language film to win best picture oscar","story":"South Korean satire directed by Bong Joon-ho sweeps top prize after also winning best director, international film and original screenplay After an awards season marked by its predictability, the Oscars delivered a spectacular final-reel twist on Sunday evening, naming capitalist satire Parasite best picture.Bong Joon-ho’s comedy-drama about an impoverished family who infiltrate the household of a wealthier one is the first film not in the English language to take the top prize. It also took best director, best original screenplay and best international film.Sam Mendes’s 1917 had been tipped to rule triumphant at this year’s Academy Awards, following its key victories at the Baftas, Golden Globes and crucial bellwethers such as the Producers Guild Awards. In the event, the harrowing first world war drama took three awards: for Roger Deakins’ cinematography and for its visual effects and sound mixing.Bong’s film also defeated Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, Jojo Rabbit and The Irishman to best picture. It marks the first time in 65 years – since Marty in 1955 – that the winner of the Palme d’Or at Cannes has progressed to a best picture Oscar. Bong paid tribute to Scorsese in his best director speech, saying that, when he was young, he “carved deep into my heart” a quote by Scorsese: “The most personal is the most creative.”He also thanked Tarantino for championing his work: “Quentin, I love you.”When the film won best picture, Bong gave the microphone to the film’s producers Kwak Sin-ae and Miky Lee. Kwak said she felt “a very opportune moment in history is happening right now”, and Lee paid tribute to Bong, praising his “crazy hair, the way he talks, the way he walks … and especially the way he directs”.She then thanked the Korean cinemagoing public for “never hesitating to give us straightforward opinions that made us never about to be complacent, and to keep pushing the envelope.”Only 10 foreign-language films have previously been nominated for best picture – including Amour and Life Is Beautiful – but none of them won. Last year, many thought Alfonso Cuaron’s autobiographical drama Roma might take best picture as well as director, but it was pipped to the post by Green Book. That result was not well received, with many people feeling the Academy’s strenuous attempts to ersify were undermined by the celebration of a film whose approach to race relations seems more suited to its 60s setting than to 2019.Such fallout – coupled with the backlash to the fact only one person of colour (Harriet’s Cynthia Erivo) was nominated for an acting award – could help explain Parasite’s unprecedented win. Voters are eager to prove their inclusivity, and that they don’t fear what Bong called at the Golden Globes “the one-inch-tall barrier of subtitles”.Almost every person who took to the stage during the ceremony alluded to this year’s dominant controversy, with Janelle Monáe’s opening musical medley seeking to highlight ethnically erse films, and rapper Utkarsh Ambudkar giving an earnest midway recap of the evening’s inclusivity credentials. Opening presenter Chris Rock made blunt reference to what was missing from this year’s director nominees: “vaginas”.Lead actor Joaquin Phoenix followed a string of politically charged acceptance speeches – including his attack on the “systemic racism” of the film industry at last Sunday’s Baftas – with an impassioned call to arms, imploring people to stop fighting and to stop exploiting one another, the planet and the other species living on it.“I think we’ve become very disconnected from the natural world,” he said. “Many of us are guilty of an egocentric worldview, and we believe that we’re the centre of the universe. We go into the natural world and we plunder it for its resources. We feel entitled to artificially inseminate a cow and steal her baby, even though her cries of anguish are unmistakeable. Then we take her milk that’s intended for her calf and we put it in our coffee and our cereal.”He closed his emotional address by quoting a lyric written aged 17 by his late brother, River: “Run to the rescue with love and peace will follow.”Phoenix was a much-anticipated victor in the best actor category, for his role as a mentally ill aspirant comedian in Joker likewise Renée Zellweger being named best actress for her performance in the Judy Garland biopic raised few eyebrows.The supporting actor races also unfolded as expected, with Brad Pitt and Laura Dern winning for Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and Marriage Story, respectively. Both thanked their parents and their children, with Pitt straying into politics to mention that his 45-second speech was 45 seconds more than the time afforded to John Bolton by the senate in Donald Trump’s impeachment trial.Elsewhere, Taika Waititi proved a popular presence both on stage – where he dedicated his trophy for best adapted screenplay for Jojo Rabbit to “all the Indigenous kids all over the world” – and backstage.It was there he offered a commentary on contemporary far-right extremism, saying that, at the end of the second world war: “if you were at Nazi, you would go to jail. Now you’re a Nazi, feel free to have a rally down in the square with your mates.”• This article was amended on 10 February 2020 to correct the names of the producers of Parasite, Kwak Sin-ae and Miky Lee, who were misidentified as actors in the film and to remove an error about former national security advisor John Bolton, who was incorrectly described as a senator."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c25c7dc9c3f157695c7e08b1a7897f7273145ff/280_186_3547_2129/master/3547.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=24361014a5fea6a14ba3f2ed8d782d72","title":"oscars 2020 in pictures gallery","story":"From bashful Brad Pitt to James Corden and Rebel Wilson as cats, a selection of the best pictures from the 92nd Academy Awards"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9217e6a8c6d653b92ddc1c81d75252a5d8a1ef7f/0_0_3500_2313/master/3500.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ac9fe752d19d299e67a5ec1e6d1d4b11 720w","title":"oscars 2020 live latest red carpet ceremony winners aftermath","story":"An incredible night for Bong Joon-ho as Parasite wins best screenplay, best director and best pictureLet’s finish up with a clip of Parasite winning best picture, and how the crowd reacted when the lights were cut.

Barca were always going to win the game and we had to suffer this humiliation.”Barça are on course to end a five-year wait to be crowned Spanish champions as they hold a nine-point lead over nearest challengers Atlético after 18 games, of which they have won 16 and drawn two while scoring 68 goals.They reached the final of the Champions League for the first time in May, losing to Olympique Lyonnais, but bolstered their squad in the close season by signing Norway international Caroline Graham Hansen, who was also on target in the Supercopa final.The double-figure victory over Sociedad followed other big wins for Barca this season, including 9-1 and 6-0 wins over CD Tacón, the club that will be absorbed by Real Madrid next season.“Their budget is much bigger than everyone else’s,” said Arconada, “and the federation must decide if they want them to humiliate the other teams like this.”Barcelona coach Lluís Cortés responded by saying: “Each club invests in women’s football as much as they want to and the percentage in relation to the spending on the men’s team is very small. I wish we could always win 10-1, but I am sure this won’t happen when we meet next in the league.

On Saturday they started in a 4-1-4-1 with Davy Pröpper anchoring midfield behind Aaron Mooy and Pascal Gross. By the time the game ended there were two up top and two wide midfielders at full-back. In the end it worked, with one substitute, Alireza Jahanbakhsh, firing over the cross that Adrian Mariappa turned into his own net for Brighton’s equaliser. But it was a close-run thing. Brighton are still looking for an approach they can rely on. They will need to settle on one soon. Paul MacInnesSuch is Everton’s turnaround under Carlo Ancelotti that Europe now occupies their thoughts and not the relegation battle that loomed under Marco Silva. No one, least of all their new manager, is over-playinging the quality of recent performances or the calibre of their squad, however. Richarlison is the exception on both counts. The Brazil international produced the key moment of Saturday’s win over Palace – the superb second goal that made it 17 points from eight league games under Ancelotti – and another commanding display that brought rich praise from a manager who knows world-class potential when he sees it. “He has to improve,” said Ancelotti. “He has to play with more consistency but he shows fantastic quality at counterattack and as a striker. It depends on him but he can be a world-class player.” Andy HunterBournemouth returned from Bramall Lane empty-handed but the performance of Ryan Fraser should provide more than a crumb of comfort. The winger was revitalised against Sheffield United, influential in helping Bournemouth open the scoring through Callum Wilson before carving out a couple more openings. Fraser, out of contract in the summer, recently said he had taken his eye off the ball as a result of being distracted by transfer speculation – “I didn’t play for the team, I’m honest enough to admit that” – but in that same interview he said he would endeavour to put that right. Fraser was much improved in victories against Brighton and Aston Villa and was Bournemouth’s best player in defeat on Sunday. How Eddie Howe, whose side travel to Burnley after the winter break, could do with Fraser finding peak form between now and May. Ben FisherHanging on the side of Sheffield United’s Kop is a large banner featuring a picture of the Blades’ captain mid celebration and a to-the-point message: “Billy Sharp scores goals.” Which is true, or at least has been for the vast majority of his career, and has certainly been the case as United have climbed the isions in this his third spell at the club. The 34-year-old has not been prolific this season but then he has not had much game time, that is until recently. Having made one start before Christmas, Sharp has been in the first XI in United’s last three fixtures and, though his goal against Bournemouth was his first since the opening day, his all-round performances have been excellent. With David McGoldrick returning to fitness and Lys Mousset providing the assist for John Lundstram’s winner, Chris Wilder has a tricky – but welcome – selection problem heading his way. John AshdownAs Leeds sank to a fifth defeat in six games on Saturday the obvious response was to marvel at yet another late-season collapse from a Marcelo Bielsa side. But Bielsa gets enough attention: credit should instead go to the Nottingham Forest team who are currently everything Leeds are not: resolute, ruthless and gathering real momentum. Sabri Lamouchi may not preach the snazzy football of his more illustrious peers but he has put together a tireless outfit, who are nine points better off than at this stage last season, and his use of Joe Lolley as a high-pressing destroyer on Saturday was proof that he is no mug when it comes to tactics either. Crucially, though, his team do not let nerves get to them. Of their seven games against the rest of the current top six, Forest have won four, drawn two and lost just one – and that due to a freak Matt Phillips goal on the opening day. But now a pivotal week looms: on Tuesday Forest take on Charlton under the lights at the City Ground, where a win could take Lamouchi’s side to second, and after that, it’s away to the leaders. They’re not out of the woods yet. Alex HessAlexander Isak’s start at Real Sociedad was a slow one, scoring just twice in his first 16 appearances for the Basque club following his move from Borussia Dortmund. Since mid-December, however, he has netted 13 in 12 games including against Real Madrid in the Bernabéu to earn a Copa del Rey semi-final spot and winning the derby against Athletic Bilbao on Sunday. Still only 20, the Swedish striker is finally living up to the hype which earned him a move to the Bundesliga in 2017. Having failed to have an impact at Dortmund, he now seems even more determined to prove his worth. The Swede’s form has made helped Real Sociedad to sixth in the table, a cup semi-final and primed him to lead his country’s forward line in this summer’s Euros. Plenty of youngsters have drifted away after an ill-advised big-money move early in their career but Isak has used the warning to his advantage. Will UnwinInternazionale reminded Manchester United what they were lacking on Sunday night, as Alexis Sánchez and Romelu Lukaku both put in impressive displays to help turn the Milan derby on its head. The Chilean did brilliantly to assist Matías Vecino, getting in behind the Milan defence with an intelligent run and then setting up his teammate for the easier chance, despite having the opportunity to shoot himself. Lukaku was a constant danger for Inter, eventually getting his reward late on thanks to clever movement at the back post from where he carefully guided a Victor Moses cross into the corner. If United’s management had dealt with the duo better they could have been doing the same at Old Trafford but instead Ole Gunnar Solskjær is left to rely on inferior players.

Here she talks about shattering stereotypes and using fashion as a force for changeHalima Aden, then aged 19, became the first contestant in the Miss USA 2016 beauty pageant to wear a hijab and burkini, attracting the attention of French fashion legend Carine Roitfeld. The following year she became the first hijab-wearing model to sign with a global modelling agency, IMG, and then the first to walk at New York fashion week, for Yeezy, the Kanye West brand. She later became the first hijab-wearing model to make the cover of Vogue – twice (first Vogue Arabia, then British Vogue) – and soon afterwards a Sports Illustrated swimsuit shoot followed. By that point she’d already become a Unicef ambassador, and a go-to voice on ersity in the fashion industry. In 2017 she gave the first TED talk at a refugee camp in Kakuma, Kenya. Teen Vogue went with her.When we meet, at a hotel near King’s Cross, I ask if it ever gets tiring, being the first in so many different ways, shouldering the burden of representation. “Somebody needs to,” Aden says. “I want my sister, my little nieces, even my nephews to see representations of somebody who wears a hijab in modern ways, in such a way that they can relate to.” We’re sitting side by side on a window seat, Aden holding court before a little audience of PRs, management and her best friend, Lizeth, who has travelled with her from the US. Though she looks very much the high-fashion figure, all in black – sequins and brocade lace, knee-high stiletto boots – she seems younger than her 22 years, gabbing away in the stream-of-conscious slang and asides of a teenager still starstruck by the turns her life has taken.But on the topics of ersity, representation and sustainability, she speaks with passion and conviction. She has said in the past that, growing up in the US: “The only times I saw somebody dressed like me was on CNN – and they weren’t doing anything I approve of.”“I feel like we all deserve representation and I didn’t have that,” Aden says now. “I never got to flip through a magazine and see somebody who looks like me.” Lizeth digs out the latest issue of Essence magazine, Aden proud in pink on the cover. Aden takes it from her, somewhat wonderingly. “Sometimes it’s so wild for me,” she says. “I still catch myself… When my friend went and got that from the newsstand, I was like: ‘Oh my God.’”The fact she has been able to have a global career in fashion at all is proof that the industry is increasingly open to ersity. Aden is 5ft 5in, petite for a model, and a resident of Minnesota, far from the industry capitals of New York, London, Paris or Milan. “And the fact that I’m able to do runway, the fact that I have graced these magazine covers and wear a hijab on top of that, be who I am, have my identity, wear it proudly… I think fashion is doing a beautiful job.”She does have certain requirements, such as a pop-up tent in which to change backstage at shows, but she says she’s never been uncomfortably set apart, or made to feel othered. She remembers her experience of walking for Yeezy at New York fashion week in 2017, her breakout year, as a watershed moment. The first outfit she was presented with “was just not going to work,” she says, gesturing above her knee – too short. “Even then I knew: walking away when something doesn’t fit is always better than feeling you need to force something.”She returned to her hotel, disappointed but resolute. “And then, without having to say anything, they called back: ‘We have a second option.’ I tried it on and it was perfect. I just knew it was a pivotal moment in my life. The people who you want to work with, they’re willing to work with you just the way you are.”That same year, Aden remembers walking for MaxMara at Milan fashion week in a look that had been designed with her in mind. When she posted it on Instagram, a woman commented: “He keeps you in mind, he keeps us in mind. Now this Muslim shopper will keep MaxMara in mind.” Aden shared it with the brand. “I was like – wink-wink-wink!”It led to an exclusive capsule collection in the Middle East, for which Aden was the face. “It’s a win for designers when they’re erse it’s a win for the brand, it’s a win for everybody – we all want to see a little piece of ourselves reflecting back.” And it makes a difference, she says. The year after Aden became the first contestant to wear a hijab in Miss USA, there were seven others. Last year she was one of two hijabi models on the MaxMara catwalk in Milan, and one of three for her second Vogue Arabia cover.When Aden was seven, she used to pray for rain – the kind of torrential rain that would wash away her new home in the American Midwest. “I remember thinking: ‘Then our neighbours could come out and play,’” she says. Even the structure of her apartment building felt alienating. “I was like, ‘God, everybody is so isolated.’”Aden was born a refugee in the United Nations Kakuma camp in northwestern Kenya, where her mother had fled the Somali civil war in 1994. There their house was made of mud, scraps, sticks – anything her mother could find. “It would be normal for me to go to nursery school, come back and find it had washed away,” she says. But then the community would come together to rebuild it, “and then it’s the kids’ time to play around.”The model remembers her childhood in the camp as being joyful and supportive. “There’s no walls keeping you apart from your neighbour,” she says. In her new home in Missouri, where she was relocated with her family in 2004, before moving to Minnesota, where they live today, the barriers stood strong.As a child, Aden remembers thriving under the collective care of the community, which was two thirds women and children. She was bright – she spoke Somali and Swahili, sometimes translating for the grown-ups – and popular, roaming the camp with up to 30 playmates of mixed ages and ethnicities. (“If you could keep up, you were in the group.”)Aden is well aware that her happy stories of childhood challenge the stereotype of the “tragic refugee”, though she credits her mother with working hard to shield her young family from hardship. Aden never knew her father. He was lost during the Somali civil war, and assumed dead by her mother he made contact after they had moved to the US, but died before Aden could develop a relationship. “It was both the scars and the smiles,” she says. “It was a happy childhood and also, we lived in uncertainty.”Symbolic of this limbo was a noticeboard that was updated with the names and destinations of those lucky few bound for resettlement. Aden remembers it as larger than life, “like something out of The Hunger Games”: “It would control your entire future – it was literally the difference between life and death. For parents it meant a brand new life: ‘We’re starting over, we won the lottery.’ But for the kids it is: ‘I’m never seeing my friends again’.”Another common misconception of being a refugee, Aden says, “is that you get a say where you go”. Her family were relocated to a poverty-stricken, crime-rife neighbourhood in St Louis, Missouri, which – compared to the “nurturing” community of Kakuma – came as a shock. That was when she felt most isolated, when she wished for her house to wash away. It was the first time she’d heard gunshots. “But nonetheless, did I have the fear of malaria? No – so, in a way, it was like trading one obstacle for another.”The biggest hurdle was learning English: Aden’s school in St Louis did not have an English language programme. After two weeks of presenteeism, Aden recalls her mother asking her to read some written English aloud. “I literally started mouthing the words to Dilemma” – rapper Nelly and Kelly Rowland’s syrupy duet, which she knew from the radio. Aden mimics a haltering recital: “‘No matt-er. Whatido. All I think about. Is you’ – I just couldn’t stand the idea of disappointing her.”Eventually Aden’s mother decided to relocate the family to St Cloud, Minnesota, where they found a community like the one that they had left at the camp. At first they were heavily reliant on it, living on food stamps and even, for six months, in a women’s shelter. Aden remembers the kindness of neighbours, taking the family to the grocery store during the punishing winters, giving her mother lifts when she couldn’t drive. “It’s why I’m so loyal,” she says. “I love my state.” She lives in St Paul now, closer to the airport, but only 40 minutes from her mother, who’s still in St Cloud. Minnesota is known for high taxes, but Aden says she is happy to pay them. “I relied on welfare when I was little... I think of it as my way of paying back.”Before we meet, Aden’s team is adamant that I don’t ask her about Trump or US politics, so instead I ask her how superficial ersity in fashion tallies with a more fractious, ided world.“I don’t even really avoid politics,” she says, “but it’s not something that I’ve needed in order to connect with people. Once I share my story, there’s always some common ground. It doesn’t have to be: ‘I grew up in a refugee camp.’ I get just as many messages, believe it or not, from parents who are not Muslim, who are not black, who say, ‘Thank you for making modesty look cool and young’.”When she entered the Miss Minnesota USA pageant in 2016, as a freshman at St Cloud State University, Aden told local media that she wanted to represent Muslim women and counter the image that they were oppressed. “The hijab is a symbol we wear on our heads,” she said. “But I want people to know that it is my choice.” Today she says her motivations for entering were less lofty. “College tuition is expensive in the States, muuuuuucho expensive!” And the top 15 at the pageant were offered scholarships. Did Aden think she’d win? “No, God, no.” She laughs. “But top 15? I was like, ‘I think I could do that’.”Aden’s mother was strongly against her entering the pageant, arguing it would distract from her studies, and that the two-piece burkini was too skimpy. Though they have since been able to find common ground through her advocacy and work with Unicef, it can feel like they are from two different cultures sometimes. She didn’t tell her mum about the Sports Illustrated shoot “until it hit newsstands”.She was also criticised by members of the Muslim community who saw modelling as haram – forbidden by Islamic law. “It was scary to put myself out there, because I didn’t know if I would get backlash, or how bad it was going to be,” she says. Two days before the pageant, Aden almost pulled out. But as she told the newspaper at the time: “You don’t let being the first to do it stop you.”She ended up making the semi-finals, “braces and all. And then IMG came calling – like, ‘Well, well, well… maybe I don’t need school.’” She leans back, for a second jokily triumphant – then seems to feel a chill coming in from across the Atlantic. “I’m kidding. Sorry, Mom!”The global spotlight on Aden caught the eye of Carine Roitfeld, who flew her to New York to shoot the cover of CR Fashion Book with Gigi Hadid, Paris Jackson and legendary photographer Mario Sorrenti. Aden agonised about asking for a selfie with Gigi (“So cringy,” she says now). As for Sorrenti, though, she had to Google her later.His direction to her was, “Give me sexy”, she seems a little abashed to say. “I didn’t know fashion lingo, I didn’t know photographers. I’m a Minnesota girl – very small town.” Even after signing with IMG, she watched all of Tyra Banks’s outlandish reality series America’s Next Top Model “to practise”. Seven months into her modelling career, she was still working part-time as a housekeeper in St Cloud.But rather than asking Aden to change, fashion’s royalty has made room for her as she is. Last week she was back in Kenya for a shoot and “I was just thinking, how crazy is it that, in one lifetime, I’ve gotten to experience both extremes.” Aden says she does not feel angry about the inequality she has seen – partly because she does not find it to be productive. “It’s like when I say: ‘We don’t want your pity.’ Let’s talk about solutions, invite refugees to the table. They’re part of the conversation – no policies should be enacted without their say.”Though she rules out a career in politics (“for now”), in the future she hopes to return to Kakuma with Unicef to inspire hope within the camp for a new life beyond it. “I couldn’t tell you what that would have meant to me as a six or seven-year-old – like, ‘Wait, there’s a life outside these walls?’ Hopefully, it’s not going to be so rare to see kids from the camps grow up and become teachers, lawmakers, presidents and CEOs of Fortune 500 companies. There’s talent everywhere.”For now Aden is pursuing opportunities in “fashion activism”. This month she was announced as the new face of the British accessories brand Bottletop, which was ahead of its time in positioning itself as “sustainable luxury” in 2002. Its handbags and clutches, which are made from sustainable leather and upcycled metal ring pulls, help to alleviate poverty in Brazil, Nepal and Kenya. Aden is optimistic in general, but particularly about the potential for consumer choice to be a force for positive change: “I think we’re at a place where people want to support brands and organisations they know are giving back.” She is also an ambassador for Bottletop’s #Togetherband campaign, which is tasked with raising awareness of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals. Aden is probably one of the few celebrities who can “relate personally” to all 17 of them. She has been assigned the eighth goal: “Decent work and economic growth.” The fact that the Swiss multinational bank UBS is a founding partner seems to suggest which way the wind is blowing.“My career in fashion is not just, ‘I want to work with this brand, I want to get on that catwalk’ – we’re not sitting here talking about ‘Buy this heel, because this heel will make you feel sexy.’” She kicks up her stiletto boot, knee-high in black patent leather (admittedly very sexy). “I’m proud that I can say I combined fashion and activism. I can’t do one without the other.”Aden sees that her story, from refugee camp to the cover of Vogue, is an unusual one. But she has had to navigate it herself – down to mentioning, at her very first meeting with IMG as a teenager in New York, that she would like to work with Unicef. “I had to learn, in the beginning especially, that maybe I’d never find another model who I could relate to. But I’m making my own path, and it works perfectly for me.”Fashion editor Jo Jones photographer’s assistant Dan Ross fashion assistant Lena Young makeup by Dina at Frank Agency using Dior Forever and Dior Capture Totale C.E.L.L.

So,  Rebecca Nicholson decided to tryLike most people I know, my Weekly Screen Report is obscene. Every Sunday, when the notification pops up to tell me the hours I have wasted, mostly texting, I think about all the things I could have done. Finished Middlemarch. Started Middlemarch. But as I have my phone in my hand, I scroll through Instagram instead. I send an article or a joke to a friend, a picture of the dog to the family WhatsApp, catch up on someone else’s night out. Recently, I clocked up – and I’m ashamed as I write this – six hours and 29 minutes of phone usage in a single day. I have had days where I’ve barely been awake that long. Messages is my most used app. I am talking all the time.I know many will welcome this as a kind of freedom. The very idea of talking on the phone invokes horror among those who claim to loathe it. There are thousands of memes explaining the many ways that talking, not texting, is rude, basically criminal. Calling is not time-efficient, ill-suited to the attention economy, where all eyes must be on several screens at once. You can send messages when you’re doing something else – watching The Irishman, or having a bath, or even talking to another person in real life. My dad recently marvelled at me being able to text with two thumbs I marvel at teenagers being able to text while talking to you and not looking at the screen. Once technology gave us the ability to easily screen calls, we ran with it. We can ignore the relative who phones with a list of recent hometown tragedies, the work call we don’t feel like taking, our chattiest of friends who might not let us go for an hour. But what happens if you are that chatty friend?Smart phones are smart enough to tell you that you’re using them too much. The dumb phone is making a comeback. I wondered if it was possible to ride this wave of the digital detox and make a deliberate effort to call instead of text. I wanted to see if it would change my relationships, particularly the ones I had grown lazy about maintaining. The plan was to stay off text and DMs for a solid month. I was fed up of paddling in the shallows. I wanted to swim. If I needed to speak to someone, I’d have to call them.When the writer Elizabeth Wurtzel died in January, a piece she wrote in 2013, about her “one-night stand of a life”, began to circulate again, and it contained one paragraph that hit me particularly hard. “Look at how we live,” she wrote. “We communicate in text messages and emails even those of us old enough to have lived in a world where landline was not a word because it’s all there was have fallen into this lazy substitute for human contact. I have.”Who hasn’t? It should be easier than ever to talk. There are limitless outlets for publishing our thoughts, endless ways to begin a kind of conversation. Voice memos are popular, particularly among young people, but they’re a halfway house, still one-sided. We talk with one eye on efficiency, and it strangles what is so good about it – the spontaneity, the lack of ability to control what happens when two people are rambling on to each other.The psychologist Sherry Turkle has been studying the impact of computers on human psychology since the early 1980s, and in 2015 she published Reclaiming Conversation, in which she referred to “the edited life” that we live now. She spoke to teachers who observed that their students seemed to develop empathetic skills at a slower rate than they would be expected to. “Face-to-face conversation is the most human – and humanising – thing we do,” she wrote. “Fully present to one another, we learn to listen. It’s where we develop the capacity for empathy. It’s where we experience the joy of being heard, of being understood.”Are we losing that joy of being heard? Most offices are quieter places than they have ever been. The open-plan rooms I have worked in over the last decade or so are filled with people wearing headphones, silently tapping away on Gchat or Slack. Even workplaces that should invite conversation are making it easier to avoid talking at all. If you stay in a budget hotel, you can check yourself in and out. If you scan your onions on the supermarket’s self- service checkout, you don’t need to chat about what you’re planning to do with them. When it was common enough to be considered a problem, making a phone call on public transport used to be frowned upon. In the early 00s, Dom Joly built a TV career out of shouting “Hello!” into an oversized mobile in public places. Train carriages are now full of heads bowed, illuminated by blue light. A few years ago the Daily Mash ran a much-shared satirical news story: “A northern man has left a trail of terror across London by attempting to interact socially with everyone he meets.” And even in the north, screens have begun to dominate. Quiet carriages are becoming redundant. We are making ourselves quiet.In 2014, someone set up a family WhatsApp group. Before then, I spoke to my family on the phone all the time. Now, we spend more time in touch with each other than ever before, yet I miss them. It’s a noticeboard, more than a conversation. The person I still speak to most often, and for longest, is my nan, who is 83. She has a mobile, but doesn’t text. The other day I phoned to see how she was, and she told me a long story about how she was never supposed to have the name that she has, but there were 23 pubs in the village she was born in, and her father stopped in at most of them on the way to register her birth. By the time he got to the clerk, he’d forgotten what he’d been told to call her, so he named her after the clerk instead.Verbal conversations are unpredictable and unwieldy in a way that those written down are not, because when we type or tap, we are in control, of our side, at least. This ruthless chat efficiency has excised the flab but, I realise, I love the flab. It’s where the excitement happens. I wanted to revive those conversations with everyone. So in my month of no texts, the WhatsApp group would be the first thing to go. I went to delete the app, pressed my finger on the screen, let it wobble – and then I stopped. There was a video of my niece dancing in front of the TV that I wanted to show my partner and I thought, I can just look at the photos and videos, every now and then. Can’t I?Dr Scott Wark is a research associate at Warwick University who studies culture, technology and social media his PhD thesis was about memes. I called him to see if we are actually moving away from verbal communication. He was in Chile for work, and I couldn’t get through until I emailed to check he was there. But when we finally managed it, he was more optimistic than I had anticipated.He does believe that people are less willing to make calls. “It feels like more of an imposition. If I want to talk to my boss, we schedule a time to make a call. She doesn’t just call.” He points out that social media gives us far more control over a chat. “Even though there’s an idea that everyone’s addicted to social media and constantly checking updates, you can ignore a notification of a message. If I’m chatting to a friend in Australia, and I stop responding to her, I’ve probably just gone to sleep and I’ll pick it up the next day. It’s a continuous conversation that doesn’t interrupt anything and is parallel to whatever else we’re both doing.”Wark disputes the idea that we are becoming more disconnected he says it’s important to make a distinction between disconnection and distraction. If people are becoming more mindful about their phone usage, though, does he think calling might make a comeback?“What people are responding to, with the idea of a ‘digital detox’, is this overload of distractions. That is a huge problem, because there are all these demands on our cognitive capacity and that’s overwhelming, and exhausting. We’re spread thin.”It’s good to know we’re all at it. There is a running joke in my house that if the phone rings after 7pm, without a text to warn that a call is coming, one of us has to say, “Who’s dead now?” It’s not ha-ha funny, but it speaks volumes about what the once humble phone call has come to mean. I thought it was just us, that we’d developed gallows humour after a year of the kind of calls that drain the blood from the body, that in saying the worst out loud, it somehow would ward off more bad news.Wark said that he, too, thinks the worst if he has an unexpected missed call. When I talked to my friends about it, I realised that most people feel the same way. A phone call, out of the blue, is alarming. It’s a harbinger of doom, its ringtone a tiny scythe. The first thing I say when I answer the phone is usually, “What’s wrong?”On the first day of not texting for a month, a friend had some bad news about her health. I wanted to know how she was. But I thought calling would alarm her, because it has become alarming. So I texted, and we had a text chat, while the telly was on. Calling really would have felt like an imposition. I thought I’d call my girlfriend to see what she fancied for dinner, but she was on the tube, and the missed call made her worried that something had happened, so we ended up texting about that, too. My month of not texting was barely even a day old. I failed completely.I am wary of nostalgia. Nobody wants to hear another old person chirping that it was better in their day. When I spoke to Dr Wark, he sounded hopeful about the changing nature of communication. “I’m 31, and I’ve been chatting to people online since I was nine. Talking to people on text is totally naturalised,” he says. “Younger people are more willing to FaceTime one another now, and be watching TV, without really saying anything, just hanging out. There’s a different kind of presence involved.” There’s an argument that all this texting facilitates people meeting up in real life anyway, he says, and research to back that up. We may be more distracted than before, but we are more connected. I ask Wark if he’s a texter or a caller himself. It depends, he says, on the person, and his relationship to them. He calls his mum, he texts his partner. “But personally, I would prefer to meet my friends and just talk to them in a pub.”I could not stop texting, but in the search for a better connection, I did start to call more. I started to phone to cancel plans, and it proved a good litmus test: having to talk about it made me consider whether I genuinely wanted to cancel, or whether I was just being idle. I phoned a friend to say that, honestly, I couldn’t be bothered to travel for 45 minutes to see a film I wasn’t interested in and he said that, honestly, neither could he. We talked for half an hour. My girlfriend is often away for work and it’s become clear that talking on the phone once every couple of days is more substantial and infinitely nicer than constant texting about humdrum stuff.On the Failed Day of No Texts, it became horribly apparent just how compelled I was to share every little detail of what was happening to me. I dropped a plate, and went to tell someone about it, anyone. But to realise I might have to call someone to tell them I was clumsy, which they already knew, made it seem totally redundant. I felt free, somehow, from the obligation to transmit the boring bits of my life as rolling news. By texting less and calling more, I was reminded that people are almost always nicer on the phone than on text. Face to face, they’re even nicer than that. Arguments are resolved more quickly. It is much more difficult to be rude, and we could all use a bit of that.Talking on the phone scares people. Technology has created a new rigidity when it comes to conversation. Calling is usually planned, scheduled, and to call is to really mean it. I still text, all the time. I feel inordinately proud of myself if my screen time drops below three hours a day. But I am calling more, too. I am back in the habit, and for me, it is infinitely more satisfying to have a conversation that is two-sided and flexible and unpredictable. I just send a text to say I’m going to call first."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed0b6a2ceabf0db2aa651a09dc9e293084766255/0_49_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c58f4d48e38e33d2162d2c82fc625242","title":"militia strike gold to cast a shadow over sudans hopes of prosperity","story":"Supported by wealthy foreign backers, a feared paramilitary outfit controls Sudan’s most lucrative industry, complicating the country’s path to democracyOrnate, heavy necklaces gleam on stands above stacks of thick filigree bangles in the windows of Khartoum’s gold market. The gold is Sudanese, dug from the rich mines that  the country.Shop owner Bashir Abdulay hands over a palm-sized lump of pure gold with two small bore holes as he explains how the prized metal goes from mine deposit, through middlemen, to Khartoum.Abdulay describes the Jebel Amer gold mine in Darfur, one of several controlled by the Rapid Support Forces, the paramilitary group whose leader Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo is now a central figure in Sudan’s transition to democracy.“There are many people working there, some work on their own, others for the RSF. Everyone has his place, and the RSF have theirs,” he says, the metal twinkling in the bright shop lights. “The RSF have a big place producing gold, and selling it on their own.”The RSF seized control of the Jebel Amer gold mine in Darfur in 2017, immediately making Dagalo, known as Hemedti, one of Sudan’s richest men. The RSF and Hemedti also control at least three other goldmines in other parts of the country, such as South Kordofan, making them a key player in an industry that produces Sudan’s largest export.After the 2019 uprising that overthrew former dictator Omar al-Bashir, Hemedti became part of the transitional military council and the sovereignty council designed to shepherd Sudan to democracy before elections are held in 2022.Despite tentative government efforts to wrestle parts of the gold industry away from Sudan’s security services and back under state or private control, questions remain about whether Sudan can truly transition to democracy while the politically powerful RSF run a parallel economy all of their own.To buy gold from the RSF, where do you go? Abdulay answers without hesitation: “Al Gunade have an office upstairs on the second floor,” he said, gesturing at the ceiling, unapologetically connecting the two organisations.Al Gunade is a mining and trading corporation with deep ties to Hemedti and the RSF: Hemedti’s brother and reported RSF deputy Abdelrahim al-Bakri is one of three owners of Al Gunade, all family members. According to one of the documents obtained by the anti-corruption NGO Global Witness, Hemedti himself sits on the board of directors. After reviewing evidence of the activities of Al Gunade and the RSF, Global Witness concluded that “the RSF and a connected company have captured a swathe of the country’s gold industry and are likely using it to fund their operations”.The organisation obtained bank data and corporate documents that, they say, show the RSF maintains a bank account in their name at the National Bank of Abu Dhabi (now part of the First Abu Dhabi Bank) in the United Arab Emirates, providing “evidence of the financial autonomy of the RSF”.The relationship between Sudan’s gold, wealthy foreign backers and the RSF militia is concerning observers. Global Witness believes the RSF is “an organisation whose military power and financial independence poses a threat to a peaceful democratic transition in Sudan”.A former camel-trader, Hemedti gained his nickname from the words “my protector”. Before taking part in the coup that toppled him, he was the right-hand man of former dictator Bashir. Hemedti’s RSF grew out of the infamous Janjaweed militia active in Darfur, described as “men with no mercy” and accused of war crimes in a 2015 Human Rights Watch report. HRW found that during the RSF’s campaign in Darfur, the militia were responsible for “egregious abuses against civilians … torture, extrajudicial killings and mass rapes”, as well as “the forced displacement of entire communities the destruction of wells, food stores and other infrastructure necessary for sustaining life in a harsh desert environment”.Last June, the RSF were accused of attacking peaceful protesters to disperse a sit-in in Khartoum calling for a handover to civilian rule. Protestors and observers said the RSF brought the violent methods deployed in Blue Nile, South Kordofan and Darfur to the capital, shooting, stabbing, burning or crushing the skulls of at least 104 civilians, dumping bodies in the Nile, and raping at least 70 men and women.The RSF have consistently denied their involvement. An investigation is ongoing.“Hemedti himself, he understands the process of transition personally,” says Montaser Ibrahim, a former human rights defender who works with the RSF as an “unofficial consultant” on human rights. “This is one of the reasons that led me to deal with him.”His new role has led to criticism from some in human rights activism, but Ibrahim sees the RSF as champions of minority rights, and Hemedti as a challenge against political elites.“Hemedti is a revolutionary,” he says. He dismisses any notion of the RSF’s involvement in violence against protesters, branding accusations of war crimes against Hemedti and the Janjaweed as “propaganda”.Both of Al Gunade’s two offices above Khartoum’s gold market are accessed via a dank staircase where bare wires jostle for space on the filthy walls. Behind the tinted windows of Gunade’s offices, a kilogram gold bar sat on a lacquered wooden desk among office stationary, an ostentatious paperweight that may be the real thing. A man who repeatedly refused to give his name referred all questions about Al Gunade to the central bank, opening the office door to indicate that no further discussion would be accepted.An official from Sudan’s mining ministry, who cannot be named as they are not permitted to brief the media, said extra checks are made to screen out companies associated with the previous regime. The official said that the people behind a company mattered less than whether or not it followed the rules. “Now even if the head of the transitional military council came himself, he has to go with the regulations,” the official said.Mohammed Tabidi, a Khartoum gold trader, says the new gold trading laws are a world away from those under the previous government that forced traders to buy gold from Sudan’s security services, or face arrest. “It’s a free market now,” he says.He is hopeful about the possibilities of free trade amid a powerful black market and spiralling inflation that make daily life a struggle for many. Around the corner from the glistening mall where Tabidi works, men perch on bonnets in a car park, flicking fat wads of Sudanese pounds to signal their trade to drivers passing through. The official rate of 25 Sudanese pounds to the dollar is obsolete compared with the black market rate of 75, maybe even 80.Tabidi says that while gold companies associated with other security services were rendered obsolete by the overhaul, Al Gunade remained.“If export opens for traders, maybe Al Gunade won’t work,” he says. “But if they get a deal with the ministry of finance, they can.” “Hemedti now is vice-president,” he said. “There are some things I can’t talk about.”The RSF said in December that they would hand control of Jebel Amer to the government. Who will reap the profits remains very much in question, given the lack of transparency in Sudan’s gold industry and the difficulties in controlling a supply chain plagued by smuggling and remote sites controlled by militias. There are also few safeguards in place to prevent the RSF and Al Gunade operating illegally.Richard Kent of Global Witness is critical of the RSF’s claim: “We welcome the development because it is potentially very beneficial to the Sudanese people and gold industry, but it’s still unclear exactly what this means,” he says. “Does this mean giving up the Al Gunade concession, reinstating some kind of civil or traditional administration – and if so how would that work, would it be independently appointed by the civilian government?”Political transition offers the tools needed to transform Sudan’s most lucrative industry, cleaning up ministries and the supply chain. But there is a long road ahead before the Sudanese gold industry reaches the standards set by international observer bodies such as the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.Sipping tea outside a French cultural centre where he is taking classes, the RSF’s consultant Ibrahim, an avid reader of Paulo Coelho, says: “The RSF looks like a rebel force. But we need to use them to change the political situation in Sudan.”Ibrahim’s role illustrates the RSF’s hints of reform and change. While Ibrahim is very concerned about being misunderstood, he declines to say whether he is paid, what the job actually entails or whether he believes there are receptive RSF ears for his talk of human rights.“Hemedti believes in the revolution – I know you might be shocked by this,” he says.Ibrahim maintained that the only way forward for Sudan’s transition is for cooperation between civil society and the security sector. He believes he is part of the solution, not the problem. “The security sector in Sudan can’t be cut from the political process,” he says. “This doesn’t contradict the idea of democracy.”Formerly a “a political adviser” to the Sudan Liberation Army, Darfur-based militants, Ibrahim says he became a prisoners’ rights campaigner during Bashir’s regime and his latest role is the apex of a long journey in Sudanese politics. He has created an organisation within the RSF intended to provide training “for NGOs and civil society”. But not the RSF themselves? “No,” he answers dismissively.Members of the Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA), an umbrella trade union association that spearheaded the mass protests leading to Bashir’s overthrow, are confident that Sudan’s path towards democracy isn’t threatened by the RSF or their economic interests, says their spokesman Dr Mohanad Hamid.Hamid is confident that Hemedti and the RSF’s wealth won’t present a problem, provided their business profits are eventually funnelled back into state coffers. “It’s all of four months since the beginning of the transitional period – this process is years,” he says. “If we get all the money back into the ministry of finance at the end of the three years it will be great, but we’re still waiting.”Other SPA representatives, like Dr Batoul Altayeb, are unfazed by the RSF.After protesters staged a mass demonstration against the RSF and the military following the Khartoum massacre, the SPA believe people power can contain the force of the RSF."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70a24d09e4578593f4113997f6ad068af1a8f39e/0_374_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=722139c5cdcf82ac03b82d883419083b","title":"five ways to be a better partner","story":"Sarah Calvert, a relationship therapist in London, says: “Starting from a place of appreciation is always of benefit, and can help solve more difficult conversations. It’s easy to focus on what is lacking, so I invite people to think about what they appreciate about the other person on a daily basis. Find one thing each day and tell them.” This could be anything from something they do, or a quality that they have to the way they are looking. “Actively seeking out things to appreciate helps them feel valued,” says Calvert, and when your partner better understands what you appreciate about them, they’ll probably start doing those things a bit more.“This is the person you have chosen, and they are who they are. You can’t change somebody else,” says Dee Holmes, a senior practice consultant for Relate. This can even come down to not sweating the small stuff. “We all do things that irritate our partners,” says Holmes. “Does this really need addressing or should you accept that’s just what they do?” Respect and celebrate each other’s iniduality. While couple time is important, says Holmes, “you’ve got to allow someone that space to still see their friends and do their own things”. After all, if you stopped them from pursuing their interests and doing all those things that makes them them, she warns, “they’re not going to be the person you got together with”.“It can be quite easy to not say the obvious things, because you assume the other person knows,” says Holmes. It can be just as easy to erroneously assume you understand them. If your partner says they don’t want to go out tonight after all, says Holmes, you might feel cheated by their backtracking, without considering what caused their change of heart. Perhaps something is troubling them. Try some active listening, suggests Calvert. “Make an effort to be fully present, and really learn what is going on for that person, rather than just hearing the words.”“Some people feel loved through their partner’s actions, anything from bringing a cup of tea for them in bed to upgrading their technology,” says Calvert. Some need affirming words, to be told that they’re loved. For others, physical contact is more significant: intimacy, sex, holding hands. Maybe it’s quality time, with your full attention, or perhaps gifts hold greater meaning for your partner. “If they think that what really matters is holding hands in public,” says Calvert, “and you’re just saying to them, ‘I love you,’ but not giving them any physical contact, then they’re not going to feel so loved.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abfe338bc8c05b21701e94c26a9153ff30df35c1/145_0_1693_1016/master/1693.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e18f3697f0c349d12e31013bb776622a","title":"human hibernation the restoring effects of hiding away in winter","story":"How do you flourish through the darkest months of the year? Take a lesson from a sleepy dormouse…I sometimes think that winter doesn’t truly start until February. Once the final sunny moments of autumn have gone, I’m bounced along by preparations for the festive season. Even after the final New Year corks have popped, my own reforming zeal gets me through. I may not be tempted by dry Januaries, diets and punishing exercise regimes, but I’m always a sucker for a fresh start, for plans drawn up on new stationery and commitments made to improve myself.But by early February, I’m sagging. Tired, hungry and sick of the dark, my motivation has run out, my bank account is empty and the world feels soggy underfoot. I start to skip my yoga class and social invitations feel like an imposition. The urge to pull the duvet over my head becomes very strong indeed.Humans cannot actually hibernate, but in the coldest months of the year, many of us are drawn to something similar. We want to batten down the hatches against the treacherous weather outside, preserve our energies, lay on fat. If only we could suspend the demands of life, just until the sun comes out again, all would be well.Is it such a bad thing, this desire to hibernate until spring? After all, it feels like a natural response: winter simply demands that we slow down rather than drop out altogether – why can’t we find a way to do this?I recently visited hibernating dormice at Wildwood Trust just outside Canterbury. Dormice are one of only three UK mammals to hibernate (alongside hedgehogs and bats) and they do so for half of each year, retreating to their nests with the first frosts in October or November, and only emerging when food is abundant again in April or May. In late summer they gorge on fruit, storing the energy as easily accessible liquid fat just beneath the skin. As I learned when I held one – a perfect ball of amber fur rolling in my palm like a marble – you can leave fingerprints in a sleeping dormouse.To get through this long period without food, a dormouse will slow down its metabolism to the extent that it consumes almost no energy at all, waking briefly every 10 days to keep its organs in working order. We humans, having a few more worldly commitments and physical limitations than your average dormouse, are unable to do the same, but we can allow winter to modify the rhythms of our lives.Everything about me changes in winter – and I let it happen. Winter is a time to enjoy the pleasures of solitude, to dream and contemplate. It opens up a space in which I can mass my energies, to restore and repair. I want to eat cooked food instead of raw, comforting carbs over fresh flavours. I want to revisit beloved old films and spend time pottering in the company of the radio. Gone are the splashy novels of summer winter urges me towards thoughtful, ambulatory reading, chewed over in lamplight. In winter, I can spend hours in silent pursuit of a half-understood concept, or a detail of history. Winter has patience. There is nowhere else to be, after all.While summer often wakes me at 4am with dawn, in winter I can sleep for hours, surrendering to my bed shortly after 9pm, and drowsing there until my morning alarm. Our recent ancestors would have known this pattern well after all, electric light has only been with us for just over a century. Before that the winter nights were very long indeed.Sleepy as I am in winter, I find that I rarely slumber right through. Instead, I often wake in the middle of the night and spend an hour or two mulling over my thoughts, sometimes getting up to read, write or meditate, before returning to my bed to sleep until morning. I used to worry over these moments, considering them to be insomnia, but A Roger Ekirch’s book, At Day’s Close: a History of Nighttime, convinced me otherwise. Waking in the midst of a long winter night is, he argues, a form of sleep that would have been entirely normal before light was at our command. Nights were ided into a first and second sleep, with a “watch” in between, during which people would pray, reflect, make love or indulge in quiet conversation with family. It was an intimate time, so private and mundane that it barely merited a mention.A 1996 study by Thomas Wehr and colleagues suggests that we could fall back into this pattern given the right conditions. Wehr deprived his subjects of artificial light for 14 hours at a time in an attempt to replicate the prehistoric night. After several weeks, the participants fell into a routine of lying awake in bed for two hours before falling asleep for around four hours. They would then wake up and enjoy two or three hours of time that was characterised as contemplative and restful, and then take another four hours of sleep until morning. Most interesting of all, Wehr observed that the midnight watch was far from an anxious time for his subjects. They felt calm and reflective in these moments, and Wehr found that they had elevated levels of prolactin in their blood, a hormone more usually found in nursing mothers. It usually stimulates milk production, but in this context it seems to produce feelings of contentment and calmness. Wehr suggested that the watch was a unique state of consciousness with an “endocrinology all of its own”. Waking during this natural break in sleep seems to release a cocktail of hormones that isn’t found at any other point in our existence.Is this, then, our human version of hibernation: a thoughtful mode of being that’s profoundly restorative, brought about by the conditions of winter? Perhaps, but I prefer to see hibernation as a useful analogy rather than a biological imperative – after all, winter only comes to populations who live far from the equator wintering is not a universal human experience.We also need to understand the healthy limits of our urge to hide away in winter. In regions where solitude is forced upon communities through impenetrable weather, careful preparations are made to ensure that life remains stimulating and joyful during the dark months. Hygge may have been a lifestyle trend in the UK, but closer to the Arctic Circle, those cosy candles and comfort foods are tools of self-preservation. In Nordic countries, it’s common to stock the freezer with cakes and pastries over winter, ready to offer hospitality to anyone who comes to the door. The sauna is one of the ways that Finnish people battle against the cold. It is a place of refuge and a place that brings a sense of conviviality during periods of isolation. Chosen or not, our periods of hibernation need to be punctuated with moments of social contact, or else we unravel.I’ve learned to find my own way through winter though. I also seek moments of light and heat to keep my spirits high. In recent years, I’ve developed the (admittedly slightly eccentric) habit of retrieving discarded Christmas trees and squirrelling them in my back garden to light a series of spectacular, resinous bonfires on the darkest nights.I’ve learned to seek out some of the older winter festivals, too, which mark the beats of the season until the coming of spring. In January I attend one of Kent’s growing number of wassails, a half-pagan, half-Christian ceremony in which an apple tree is fed a tribute of cider to encourage a good harvest later in the year. And I pause on 1 February to mark Imbolc, the Gaelic festival that marks the start of spring, when the ewes are pregnant and the first snowdrops are appearing.Perhaps we can actually learn more from badgers and frogs than we can from dormice. Instead of hibernating, they fall into states of torpor for short periods of time when food is scarce. It seems to me that this is a model that works for our own winters, conserving our energies by avoiding the worst ravages of the cold rather than dropping out of life altogether.Wintering: How I Learned to Flourish When Life Became Frozen by Katherine May is published by Rider at £14.99.

The advice from fire authorities was firm: “If you don’t need to be here, leave now.”Soon after, the message flipped. “We need you here, come back!” was the call, as towns reliant on tourism, especially from peak times such as the summer school holidays, suffered an avalanche of cancellations.Yet with landscapes scorched and fires still flaring up, the reality of rebooking is muddied by concerns. Is it safe? Are roads open? Are power lines functional, supermarkets stocked and beaches clean? Are national parks open? Moreover, will it be a nice time?We talked to people in four bushfire-affected regions and discovered that in most cases the answer is yes. While itineraries may need tweaking and you should certainly call in advance, the Blue Mountains, the Hawkesbury and large parts of the NSW south coast are indeed open for business, with many spots not affected even at the height of the crisis.The National Parks and Wildlife Service is still recommending people avoid remote areas. While parks are progressively reopening, a closed park means your safety can’t be guaranteed and some are still being assessed after recent fires or still managing active blazes. The maximum penalty for entering a closed park is a fine of $3,300. And yes, it’s enforceable.Check NPWS alerts for closures and fire bans and read the safety tips. Current NSW fires are updated on the Rural Fire Service website, the bushfire information line (1800 679 737) or the Fires Near Me app. Check roads on livetraffic.The Shoalhaven area takes in 170km of coastline from Kangaroo Valley in the north to Pebbly Beach in the south, via 49 towns and 100 beaches – many enclosed by bush that thrums with insect drone and rustles with birds.Shoalhaven’s major tourist towns of Berry, Jervis Bay, Mollymook and Ulladulla are fully operational yet uncannily quiet. The lull means visitors can book beds at places such as glamping pioneer Paperbark Camp, which usually fills up six months in advance.Five minutes from Mollymook Beach is Cupitt’s Estate winery. Overlooking Burrill Lake, it has a cellar door, a fromagerie, a brewery, an excellent kitchen and Sunday music sessions. It’s just one of several wineries close to beaches around Berry and Shoalhaven Heads with multiple wine-and-swim combinations possible.From Sydney, you can drive the 90 minutes to Berry through the windy countryside of Kangaroo Valley or directly to Seven Mile Beach national park with accommodation in Gerroa, Nowra or Jaspers Brush. Alternatively, the Keep On Camping website displays which caravan parks and campground are open around Australia.Further south, the new Jervis Bay Brewing Company is one of many businesses feeling the pinch of a slow summer. “The locals are out as much as they can be but their pockets are only so deep – they’re also hurting,” says co-owner Paul Walker. The company is currently in a precarious position – they’d banked on visitors over the Christmas period and now, “because we didn’t get that trade we are now in a position where we don’t have enough money to make or can more beer”.Walker is thankful his area was spared the worst of the fires, saying “we dodged a bullet, big time,” but now he says “the whole area is screaming for people to come back”.If you take his invitation, dolphin tours and fishing trips will be at your fingertips. As will Booderee Botanic Gardens, Australia’s only Aboriginal-owned botanic gardens, with guided walks available. Or head further south to Pebbly Beach in Murramarang national park, to see surfers, sea eagles and kangaroos in a single beach outing.From Bilpin, travel through Mount Victoria, home of the historic Mount Vic Flicks cinema, to Blackheath. Many lookouts and walks in the Blue Mountains national park are open again. On the wheelchair-friendly Fairfax Heritage track “you’ll see fire regeneration at its best”, says a NPWS spokesperson, including “lovely bright-coloured shoots re-emerging on the blackened trees”.Katoomba, meanwhile, offers antiques, cocktails, record shopping and an abundance of outdoors shops and cafes. Mr Pickwick’s Fine Old Books is a treasure trove of vintage delights, or pop by new business Steep St for a mash-up of immaculately sourced loose-leaf tea, ancient remedies, plants, art and vintage synthesisers.Halfway between Sydney and Melbourne, the sapphire coast brims with national parks, lagoons, rivers, fishing and delectable seafood. Its main coastal towns of Bermagui, Tathra, Merimbula, Pambula and Eden are unaffected by fires however some national parks remain closed.The NPWS hopes Bournda national park (near Tathra) will reopen soon so visitors can enjoy its secluded beach, dolphin spotting and lagoon kayaking. The rocky 47km coastline of Ben Boyd national park between Eden and Pambula, meanwhile, has long loop walks and crystal-clear snorkelling.It’s possible to stay close to townships too. The photographer’s delight of Bermagui Blue Pool – a sea bath with showers, toilets and stairs – is good for kids or older people. Famous for its deep-sea fishing, at Bermagui Fisherman’s Wharf you’ll see tuna or kingfish coming off boats – and straight on to your plate at local favourite Il Passaggio. The new Harbar meanwhile, overlooks, well, the harbour.Merimbula has some stunning beaches to choose from, or you can do an oyster farm tour with Wheeler’s Seafood, served straight from Merimbula Lake. Sydney rock oysters are freshly shucked at Broadwater Oysters at Pambula Lake, too, or packed for a picnic from anywhere along the oyster trail. Pambula village has a splash of historic homes with bull-nose verandahs and some excellent shopping, including Wild Ryes artisanal bakery.In “the humpback highway” of Eden, the local Aboriginal land council is working to link up ancient trails to form the Bundian Way, a 365km walk. For now, you can stroll the 600-metre whale dreaming trail to learn how the Katungul people and the beowas (killer whales) interacted, or do the 1.8km beach-to-beach story trail. Kids will enjoy the Killer Whale Museum in Eden township."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d9917705e51ae3d91bf613685308b5b3c491c13/0_84_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5cb91e5880e8c6d91e19eac31f79178e","title":"i was in despair at world news then i started a local campaign group","story":"I knew I had a problem when I realised that my days were bookended with despair. My blood would be boiling along with the kettle as I listened to the radio while making my first cup of tea of the day, and I would go to bed either seething or feeling forlorn about everything that was going wrong in the world after watching late-night news shows.It had all become too depressing and I felt useless. Environmental apocalypse, alternative facts, taking back control. I didn’t want to hear about it any more, which was a bit of a problem, given I was a reporter. Like a butcher who turns vegan or a podiatrist who goes off feet, it is hard to do your job as a journalist if you can no longer stomach the news.The real problem, I realised after a while, was the feeling of impotence. I could do nothing to change gun laws in the US or to stop a bad Brexit. But, if I thought small, maybe I could try to make things better.I had not long moved out of Manchester to Romiley, on the edge of Stockport. It was my first taste of suburbia since I had left home at 18, drawn to the bright lights of various big cities. I didn’t know anyone there, but I was determined that this time I would get to know my neighbours. I wanted the newsagent to remember my shopping habits and for the people next door to trust me with a key.Early last year I spotted an opportunity when I heard about a group of residents in Levenshulme, a suburb in south Manchester, who had won £2.5m of funding to make their area nicer and safer to walk and ride a bike. I knew that Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, had £160m to spend exclusively on walking and cycling, and I thought my new neighbourhood should have a piece of the pie. I had already helped set up Walk Ride Greater Manchester, a regional lobbying group, but it was time to go hyperlocal.Calling the first meeting of your new group is like organising a party when you don’t know any of the invitees. I was nervous. I booked the tiny back room of the pub and hoped someone other than my husband would turn up. Last March, to my enormous relief, about 30 people crammed in and I thought: OK, this might just work.The premise behind Walk Ride Romiley was pretty simple: bid for some of that £160m and make our area better, particularly for children walking or cycling to school. The learning curve was steep. I entered the baffling world of transport engineering, where lamp-posts are “lamp columns” and everyone insists on calling pavements “footways”. I discovered that a pegasus crossing has an extra set of buttons high up for equestrians, that toucan crossings also allow bicycles across and that the railings people think keep them safe mostly just encourage cars to drive fast. Thinking about dropped kerbs provided welcome respite from writing about flooding or investigating terrible crimes.I had to learn to be diplomatic – not necessarily my strongest suit – when people on the local Facebook site responded to all of our news with: “Use the money to build a bypass instead.” I learned when to let things go: alas, the pavement, sorry, footway trampolines of Romiley did not get past Stockport’s highway department. But when I felt my patience faltering, I thought of Leslie Knope, the indefatigable heroine of Parks and Recreation, determined to build a park in an ugly pit. “What I hear when I’m being yelled at is people caring really loudly at me,” she says after a particularly fractious public meeting.The best thing about campaigning is meeting people. One happy day last June we closed our street for a party, as a way to introduce the idea that roads don’t always have to be for cars. Children whizzed up and down on their bikes the dog show was won by Marjorie, our street’s oldest resident, who, on her Zimmer, expertly guided her pooch through an assault course. In September, we all dressed as Mancunian worker bees when the Tour of Britain passed over a hill on the outskirts of the village.

Following the success of new presenting line-up Freddie Flintoff, Paddy McGuinness and Chris Harris, Top Gear is to follow in the footsteps of other hit shows including Line of Duty, Peaky Blinders and Great British Bake Off and make the transition from BBC2 to its bigger stablemate BBC1. The BBC hopes it will reach an even wider audience than the latest series, which has hit a four-year high of 4.3million viewers thanks to the new line-up’s chemistry and stunts, such as Flintoff’s daredevil car bungee jump in a Rover  off a 500-foot dam.The move to BBC1 marks a turnaround in the show’s fortunes, which took a dip after Jeremy Clarkson, James May and Richard Hammond left in 2015 when Clarkson was sacked for punching a producer.Their replacements, Chris Evans and Matt Le Blanc, failed to ignite the same reaction with the motoring show’s fans and it hit the ratings buffers, until the new trio of Harris, Flintoff and McGuinness were hired last year. Their bid to combine entertaining banter with what they called “emotional depth” made Top Gear BBC2’s highest-rated show of last year and put it among the top four shows for 16-34-year-olds during each week of its run. It is not known whether the show will move from its regular Sunday evening time slot.Attracting younger audiences is crucial for the BBC at the moment as it faces a battle with the government over the future of its funding in the face of rivals such as streaming giants Netflix and Amazon. Culture secretary, Nicky Morgan, suggested the television licence could be abolished from 2027 and has launched a consultation on whether to decriminalise non-payment of the licence fee.The corporation is also facing cuts due to taking on free licence fees for over-75s so the future of Top Gear is vital as it is made by the BBC’s commercial wing BBC Studios and sold to over 100 countries around the world including the US and Australia.Explaining the move to BBC1, director of BBC content Charlotte Moore said : “The time is right to move the world’s best motor show to the nation’s most popular channel and bring it to an even broader audience on BBC1. Freddie, Paddy and Chris have revitalised the hit series with their escapades and banter and we couldn’t have asked for a better response to their series so far and the impact it’s had with young audiences.”Losing Top Gear will be a blow for BBC2, which has aired the show since it began over four decades ago.However BBC2 controller Patrick Holland said rejuvenating Top Gear was “one of my biggest priorities” and it was an “utter joy” to see the new presenters do well.“From Peaky Blinders to Line of Duty and now Top Gear, BBC2 is a place where unique shows can evolve and thrive before moving to even broader audiences on BBC1, it’s a vital part of the BBC portfolio.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1fddffe09bfaeb1670ba802a17d0eb07e41830d/0_430_5256_3153/master/5256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=919f6e95f4db1fe317629594226967ab","title":"the new york timess success lays bare the medias disastrous state","story":"A handful of legacy institutions thrive as digital startups face increasing pressuresThe financial health of journalism has been deteriorating in such an acute way that every spit and cough emanating from its institutions is anxiously pored over to ascertain whether it’s a death rattle or a sign of miraculous recovery. An outcome few would have predicted for the future of media has been the resilience of a handful of decidedly old-fashioned legacy institutions, at the cost of the shrinking of the supposedly more innovative digital players.The new gatekeepers of the global media, which are mostly American and Chinese mega-platforms such as Facebook, WeChat, YouTube, Google, Apple and co, have created a business environment that is inherently hostile towards free, advertising-supported media.Costly journalism is the first casualty of an advertising model that favours these online platforms. Those organisations that have unbelievably survived the past 15 years of digital onslaught are defined by both the presence of mission and money.Take for instance the New York Times, the midtown Manhattan local news organisation which is transforming itself into a global digital news brand. Historically characterised by its preponderance of seersucker suits and Mont Blanc pens, the “Grey Lady” was on the critical list a decade ago. Weakened by the financial crisis, its market capitalisation had halved to $1.5bn (£1.16bn) and its lavishly staffed newsroom numbers were heading south of 1,300. When it introduced a paywall in 2011 it felt like a last roll of the dice.Even as recently as 2013 former publisher Arthur Sulzberger noted that it was a “very low moment” when the New York Times’s biggest rival, the Washington Post, was sold by the Graham family to Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos.Last week, the New York Times emerged from its period of digital transition as a financially stronger, editorially robust organisation. It hit its very ambitious target of earning $800m per annum through digital revenues 12 months early and its share price rose to a 15-year high.The newsroom, no doubt too busy to celebrate as it documents the unravelling of American politics, is at a historic high level of 1,700 journalists.Ironically, this remarkable revival in both its subscription base and its share performance stems from the policies of Donald Trump. Digital subscriptions have boomed as the progressive audience sees support for reporting institutions like the New York Times as the only effective opposition to a corrupt government.And the stock market boom, as we are constantly reminded by the president’s Twitter feed, is peaking on the basis of an economic policy that largely favours rich business owners at the cost of everyone else.The revolving door between media organisations is in constant motion, but as the layoffs in local and digital news outlets continue, the New York Times is hiring many more than it is firing. Many of those who have joined as either staff or columnists come from the world of digitally native publishing.Ben Smith, former editor-in-chief at BuzzFeed, left the newsroom he founded to join the New York Times as a media columnist. Pioneers of journalism startups such as Kara Swisher, America’s best-known technology reporter and commentator, joined the huge roster of writers. Choire Sicha, a key founder of defunct but highly influential sites such as Gawker and the Awl, now heads the styles section. Taylor Lorenz has joined, bringing with her beat reporting on influencers and TikTok, making the New York Times relevant to a whole new audience. The Daily Podcast is also hugely popular among younger audiences. This isn’t how the future was meant to be.Chief executive, and former BBC director general, Mark Thompson put the success of the New York Times down to a strategy that allowed the digital assets within the news organisation to grow independently of the gravitational pull of the still-declining print product. Crosswords and cookery, both addictive and slick digital offerings, are far more important in revenue terms than their positions in a printed package would indicate.However, there’s something else at play here which has more to do with the political and economic environment.An aging audience of wealthy newspaper subscribers helped get the New York Times across the wobbly bridge to a digital world, where now, the same elderly subscribers have embraced digital subscriptions on their iPhones.The adaptation of the BBC as an extended platform to support local reporting was also effectively nixed by budget cuts. Further pressure on funding comes from the government’s dogged determination to decriminalise the licence fee a consultation on the matter was launched only this week. Facebook’s refusal to curb lies in political advertising has been immediately rewarded by the culture, media and sport select committee switching emphasis from probing platform power to exploring how to diminish public service media.The culture secretary Nicky Morgan’s most high profile utterance on the task of rethinking media was to urge the BBC to be more digitally adaptable, so as to not end up like video rental chain Blockbuster. It should be far more concerning to Morgan and the British electorate that instead the BBC ends up like Netflix: undifferentiated, afloat only on borrowed money, and inherently uninterested in the cultural needs of a population that needs reliable news."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db3646ba391ff6b8b244e3a70aef3a78e3859a36/0_0_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e7123b968311a8ff8d0fbda18204341","title":"should i buy a manual petrol car or automatic hybrid","story":"My children are likely to learn to drive on it – and I’m wondering if the era of geared cars is overEvery week a  Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next Saturday’s paper.I’d like to buy a hybrid car but they’re nearly all automatics.

Going through her bills after Christmas I noticed her Virgin Media bills were far higher than they should have been – with most of the extra costs due to Sky charges. As her TV viewing comprises mostly of network quiz shows and Coronation Street, I was curious as to why she felt she wanted to start watching sports. She said she didn’t and hadn’t, but then remembered an unsolicited and prolonged call from a Virgin Media representative in 2018. She said that she found the call confusing and intimidating and was unable to extricate herself. She remembers, “just wanting the young woman to go away but I couldn’t get her off the phone”.Virgin Media insists that it will not refund the £400-plus that I estimate she has overpaid, as my mother had failed to cancel the package within the cooling-off period, and it is more than 12 months since it began. I pointed out that my mother was elderly and not “market savvy” but this has cut no ice.

We asked Virgin to take a second look at this case and suggested listening to the sales call in which your mother allegedly agreed to take the expensive Sky package.However, Virgin Media says that it doesn’t keep sales calls for more than six months. However, it accepts that your mother has never watched the sports channels and has now agreed to a £450 refund (that’s the full £379 paid for Sky Sports since it was added to the account, plus an additional credit as a gesture of goodwill). It has also added a further £5-a-month discount on future payments.

The idea was first raised by Boris Johnson during his campaign to become Conservative leader.It is proposing zones – which do not necessarily have to be located in a port – where no duty is paid on goods until they enter the full UK market, meaning none at all is paid if they are re-exported from the port.Other extra freedoms include duties only being paid on final goods, not on any raw materials that are imported into the area and then processed. Businesses would be exempt from filling out full customs declarations on imported goods.The government has argued that these zones could bring thousands of new jobs and significant investment, notably to deprived coastal areas.There could be measures to “reduce the costs of hiring workers working in Freeport sites”, the government said, not specifying how this could be done. The ports could also trial ideas in areas such as customs and transport before they are rolled out across the country. After the 10-week consultation, areas will be invited to bid to become one of the zones.Among half a dozen ministerial quotes sent out to talk up the idea, the business secretary, Andrea Leadsom, said: “Freeports represent a fantastic opportunity for our businesses to increase their trade with companies from all over the world. Not only will they help create jobs and level up the UK but they underscore our commitment to championing global free trade, unleashing our country’s potential.”There is, however, some caution about the risk of freeports being used as a base for money laundering or other organised crime. In a report on illicit financing last year, the European commission said freeports could be “potentially vulnerable to money laundering or terrorism financing” in the European single market.The European justice commissioner, Věra Jourová, said freeports were “the new emerging threat”, adding: “This is something we want to focus more on.”Labour has condemned the idea. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, called freeports a “revival of a failed Thatcherite plan from the 1980s designed to cut away at regulation and our tax base”.He said: “There is very little solid evidence that so-called freeports create jobs or boost economic growth, showing this up as another ideological move from a far-right government. This plan only represents a levelling-up for the super-rich, who will use freeports to hoard assets and avoid taxes while the rest of us feel the effects of under-funded public services.”Sarah Olney, the Liberal Democrats’ business and trade spokeswoman, said: “No number of freeports can replace the economic benefits of seamless and tariff-free trade with Europe. Freeports don’t create new jobs or business opportunities, while their special administrative status makes them a tax-avoidance and money-laundering risk. The country needs real investment, not white elephants like freeports.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88bff56d26a74d655f4004888490d83c8fce90bc/595_529_3932_2360/master/3932.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b2fcdd1e98734274c7c921d3af657e87","title":"can you solve it are you smart enough for mit","story":"Teasers from MIT’s puzzle guyToday’s problems come from what might be the longest-running puzzle column in the history of the printed word.In 1966, MIT student Allan Gottlieb published his first Puzzle Corner in the MIT Technology Review.More than half a century later, Gottlieb – who has been a computer science professor at New York University since 1980 – continues to publish Puzzle Corner in every issue.The column has legendary status among maths puzzle nerds.

If it’s not there then don’t use it as you can’t be certain it’s been reliably tested.“Make sure you always store your condoms out of the heat and sun, and if you are using latex condoms always keep them away from oily substances, including moisturisers and oil-based lube, as this will damage them.“Lastly, keeping loose condoms in your wallet, pocket or bag can also damage them. If the wrapper looks at all damaged it’s best to throw it away and use a new one.”The products seized were found to be in breach of the Medical Devices Regulations 2002. In 2018, unsafe condoms were the most common product seized by the MHRA, followed by needles and in vitro diagnostic devices.Prof Mahendra Patel, an honorary visiting professor in pharmacy from the University of Bradford, said consumers should ensure they are obtaining contraceptives from registered chemists and pharmacies, sexual health clinics and GP surgeries.He said: “The number of condoms seized would be much larger if authorities had more resources – 90,000 alone is a scary amount. Because of the availability on the internet, they are easy to obtain and suppliers are selling them cheaply.“Latex condoms are normally made of natural rubber – some unsafe condoms are not made using natural products, which could cause an issue.“Some makers are using ‘fillers’, which become porous. Tests show how much these leak after ejaculation. Other tell-tale signs are when instructions are in foreign languages, contain typos or are not there at all.”Fake condoms were among a haul of unlicensed prescription medicines and medical devices worth more than £2m that were seized by the MHRA in 2018.The raids were part of Interpol’s globally coordinated Operation Pangea initiative involving 116 countries. Operation Pangea led to 859 arrests globally and led to the seizure items worth in the region of £10.9m.An MHRA spokesman said products which meet UK laws should have a CE mark.He added that CE marking on contraceptives should also be accompanied by a 4-digit number as their risk classification means these types of devices must undergo conformity assessment by a notified body. “The absence of a CE mark on medical devices is a clear indication that the products do not meet the safety and performance standards in place in the UK and EU.“MHRA advise that consumers should purchase medical devices from reputable sources and if they have any concerns about product quality or safety they can be reported via our Yellow Card Scheme.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b89a4bd9e399aab03d2bc05b8c01c7cd3fa27890/0_662_2137_1281/master/2137.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=926488e4c19550ce4064e46a5b0bd0b4","title":"england eoin morgan adil rashid moeen ali south africa","story":"Eoin Morgan said the key to victory was the performance of England’s veteran spin-bowling duo, Adil Rashid and Moeen Ali, after a nerve-jangling but ultimately comfortable two-wicket win against South Africa in Johannesburg.England recalled the two most capped spinners in their one-day international history for the series finale, and saw them effectively decide the game in the first innings. Rashid, in particular, bowled beautifully.“I thought we bowled well today. Adil and Mo coming in and showing their value, Adil with the control and variation he was outstanding. I thought the chase was well within our grasp, and it was disappointing to limp over the line. I thought we should have done it four or five down with the partnerships we had.”For Rashid this was a first proper game since November, having worked hard in the gym to regain the “snap” in his action after his shoulder injury. On a pitch that does not often take spin he said the key was his use of variations. His googly in particular had an alluring amount of dip and fizz.“One thing I look to strive on is my variations in whatever conditions, that’s a big part of my armoury,” he said. “Today was one of those days where I tried it and it came out nicely.”When asked Rashid also explicitly ruled himself out of any chance of selection for the Sri Lanka Test tour, the squad for which will be announced next week.“I’ve got to go back into county cricket, get the performances under my belt and then get selected on merit. If the selectors do ask me: ‘If you are available, can you play?’ it would be a straight ‘no’. I feel as though I’ve got to deserve my place back in the team.”South Africa’s captain, Quinton de Kock, praised the “energy” of his team in defeat. “We thought it was getting tight at the end. We gave ourselves a sniff and it was cool to make it tough for the England guys.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68bef438baf2ce00ee5b57d3f9b5c67ddf864a74/0_42_3034_1820/master/3034.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fc5a3f2e24b1c87b0cb469b17e07a5a4","title":"france italy six nations match report","story":"• France 35-22 Italy• France run in five tries to go top of Six Nations tableRomain Ntamack raced in the bonus-point score in Paris as France laboured to a patchy 35-22 victory over Italy.Teddy Thomas, Charles Ollivon, Grégory Alldritt, Ntamack and Baptiste Serin all crossed for the French, who coasted to victory despite several phases of wayward attacking play.Wasps’ electric wing Matteo Minozzi, hooker Federico Zani and Mattia Bellini bagged tries for the battling Azzurri, but Franco Smith’s side still slipped to a 24th straight Six Nations loss.France have not won the Six Nations since their 2010 grand slam, but hopes will now be high that the drought can come to an end. Galthié’s side will face a strong test of their title credentials when heading to Wales on 22 February though. Factor in the return of defence coach Shaun Edwards to his old Principality Stadium stomping ground, and that encounter will doubtless prove pivotal to the tournament.And Paul Willemse has warned France will need to cut out their indiscipline to stay in the hunt. The South Africa-born lock lamented Les Bleus’ errant showing and admitted they must sharpen up, especially without the ball.“It was definitely a bit frustrating against Italy, we got what we wanted with the bonus point so we’re happy with that,” Willemse told BBC Sport.“But our performance, a lot of errors especially discipline wise, so we’ve got to fix that as quickly as possible.“Our previous game it wasn’t a big thing, so we definitely want to fix that as quickly as possible, it’s not normal for us to have so many penalties. But that will definitely be a focus in the weeks to come to make sure it doesn’t happen again.”Les Bleus bludgeoned into early control, Thomas racing in after neat build-up. Ollivon then doubled the hosts’ try count, punching over the line from short range.Minozzi then capped a fine 13-phase move with a morale-boosting score for the Azzurri and Tommaso Allan’s penalty just shy of the half-hour hauled Italy into touching distance at 13-10 down, but the visitors could not muster enough of a comeback to alter the outcome.The France No 8 Alldritt cantered home having lurked on the left wing and been duly furnished with a superb floated pass from Antoine Dupont to leave France leading 23-10 at the break.A largely forgettable third quarter came and went without incident, before France sealed the bonus point.Italy’s first-half rally had long evaporated when Ntamack bisected the visiting defence and Les Bleus’ fourth.Zani registered for Italy however, dotting the ball against the base of the post for the Azzurri’s second try.Again the Italians were unable to make good on any kind of comeback though, and the replacement half-back Serin scored with a sharp quick-tap try.Italy managed the last word, with Bellini scampering home after Jayden Hayward’s break. But France roll on to Cardiff.• All times GMT all matches on BBC or ITVItaly’s captain, Luca Bigi, maintained his side are moving in the right direction under their new coach Smith, despite another frustrating defeat.“We showed how strong we can be in attack,” he said. “We never gave up and that’s a positive. The guys on the pitch showed great face on the pitch today.“It was a tough week because we conceded so many turnovers at the breakdown last week. We conceded too many penalties in the first half even though we were better.“We have to keep the positives from this game. It’s important that we scored at the end and we’ll keep to the positives for the Scotland game.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c30fc453ab228e5da0f38e0a2c73542f6356c7a8/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3041451f0cc0c27c19c50e414458c64d","title":"six nations talking points stormy second weekend","story":"Wales’s fabled ability to recover from defeat will be tested by France while England need to start taking the initiative earlierWayne Pivac suffered his first defeat, but while the greater emphasis he places on attack was evident in the off-loads and running angles the Six Nations champions indulged in when they managed to generate quick ball, they came a distant second physically. It could be seen as a vindication of Warren Gatland’s insistence that ambition to play a wide game matters little if the gainline battle is lost, but he watched similar defeats in Dublin two years ago and in 2014 when they were pounded into submission. Wales under Gatland tended to recover quickly from a setback and with France at home in the next round, it will be an early indicator for the new regime of how much they have preserved. Paul ReesAs Eddie Jones rightly observed on Saturday night, international rugby is a game of increasingly fine margins. Had Stuart Hodge not got into a tangle inches from his own line and given England the position from which Ellis Genge scored the match-winning try, there might conceivably have been a different outcome. Once they go ahead England are a seriously tough team to reel in they are less assured when they have to chase a game. Ireland, however, will have noted the improvement in English defensive line speed and the difference George Kruis made to their lineout efficiency. In Genge they also have an impact sub in every respect, with the Leicester loose-head growing steadily in assurance with every Test he plays. On the flip side, England have lost the knack of scoring early tries and seizing the initiative. They were bailed out at Murrayfield by the excellent breakdown work of Sam Underhill, Tom Curry and Lewis Ludlam but Ireland will pose different questions in that area. Robert Kitson“Without doubt,” said Johnny Sexton when asked if the victory over Wales had marked his most enjoyable match with Ireland for a while. “It was not hard after last year.” It was his side’s second victory in a week but the difference in the performance against Scotland was stark, as it had to be given the greater threat posed by the Six Nations champions. They quickly worked out a way to get the ball wide, regularly generated quick ball and were energised by their half-backs. What was most impressive was the composed fury they played with: there was a reaction to the week before, but it was measured and it shifted the immovable. It was also mechanical and they may need a bit more at Twickenham in the next round. Paul ReesGregor Townsend will hate this but the truth is there’s only one topic that everyone’s going to be talking about in the next fortnight, even though Finn Russell, gifted as he is, isn’t a miracle fix that’ll necessarily get Scotland winning again after back-to-back defeats. But given what Russell said in his recent interview with the Sunday Times about the way Townsend was running the team, this issue’s blown up into something much bigger than a question of whether he ought to play at No 10 against Italy. Now it’s about whether Townsend even ought to carry on as head coach, given that his star player has such a low opinion of the way he’s doing things. Andy BullFrance have won their opening two games for the first time since 2016 when they followed up a two-point victory over Italy at home with a 10-9 success over Ireland in Paris. Their third round match was their first away, in Cardiff, and they lost 19-10. It was the same in 2014, home wins over England and Italy followed by a defeat in Wales. A statistic that shows how far they slumped in the last decade is that their last away victory in the Six Nations other than in Italy or Scotland was in Dublin in 2011. They are on the up, if still mercurial as they showed against Italy, and this time in Cardiff they will have Shaun Edwards on their side. Paul ReesIt was already clear that women’s grand slam champions England performed excellently in their victory away in France on the opening weekend. But in view of France’s 45-10 demolition of Italy on Saturday, the value of England’s win became even clearer. Italy had beaten Wales away the previous week, but were blown away by Les Bleus in Limoges. It seems certain that England, whose second match against Scotland was postponed due to Storm Ciara, cannot afford to slip up if they are to defend their Six Nations title. France are contenders but it is Ireland who top the table after an emphatic victory of their own, 31-12 at home against Wales on Sunday. They are top, with nine points from two matches, and England know they have their work cut out. Luke McLaughlinThe Azzurri showed ambition against France, as they had in Cardiff, and produced well-worked tries, but for all the inidual excellence of their back row, they could do with another Marco Bergamasco. Too many moves ended because forwards, and backs, were standing in anticipation of the ball being moved rather than making sure it was secured. They were too often turned over and need to get Jake Polledri using his strength over the ball at times and not just on the charge or in the tackle. Italy have the bits and pieces, but not the detail. Scotland next, at home.

You swap gilded spires, cobbled backstreets and tourists for peaceful tree-lined avenues and a masterclass in socialist realism. The Nowa Huta museum in the monumental former theatre documents the area’s short, action-packed history: “a job for everyone” in 1954 through the rise of Solidarity in the Lenin steelworks to the downfall of communism. That wasn’t in the Soviet master plan, but thanks for the parks and affordable housing!Martin CharlesworthThe district of Śródmieście, or downtown, is a swath of land above Wrocław’s old town. To its east are the brutalist grandeur of Wrocławski Manhattan, the smattering of bars and restaurants around the university buildings (my favourite restaurant, once you get past the decor, is Warzywniak, which caters for vegans) and the culture centre at the Unesco heritage-listed Centennial Hall, surrounded by one of the finest urban green spaces in Poland. But what really makes the area a cut above the bars and architecture elsewhere in the city (and Świdnickie is a really honourable mention for its nightlife) are the cycle paths along the River Oder, wonderful in the summer.Emily MooreAs a student I lived near Wilhelminapark in the Dutch city of Utrecht. It is a beautifully green area with gorgeous villas as well as typically Dutch narrow houses. It continues to be one of my favourite neighbourhoods in Europe: it’s very peaceful and tourists don’t seem to have discovered it yet. It is named after its large park, where my friends and I would go for picnics in summer, and adjacent are a number of tasteful cafes and restaurants, among them the lovely Parkcafé Buiten. Close by, you will also find the Rietveld Schröder House (€18€9.50 in advance), an extraordinary example of De Stijl architecture and a Unesco world heritage site.Paula KaandersEvery week we ask our readers for recommendations from their travels.

A trip here will return you to an authentically Madrileño experience and the Madrid of yesteryear. Stepping out of  Portazgo, you’ll come straight on to the bar-lined Avenida de la Albufera in front of the stadium of football team Rayo Vallecano, which lends a lively atmosphere to the local tapas joints. Behind the main street there’s a good park known as Las Siete Tetas (Park of the Seven Tits) for its seven hills. Take a winding climb up to one of the peaks and be rewarded with the best vistas in Madrid and sunset over the city centre.ClaireUnlike some of its flashy neighbours, Moabit in Berlin is still a few years off full gentrification so there’s still a nice mix of old family businesses (mainly around Turmstrasse) alongside the hip street food and craft breweries you find near the beautifully restored covered market of Arminius Markthalle. Lots of the old industrial buildings have had makeovers – the train depot was transformed into a great art space and an old meat factory became the Kulturfabrik, which hosts theatre, festivals and more. Fritz Schloss Park, in postwar years a dumping ground for bombing debris, offers plenty of green space alongside mini-golf, climbing walls and a spa. And adjacent is the Poststadion, which hosted football in the 1936 Olympic Games, where Germany was defeated by Norway in a match witnessed by Nazi leaders who were not best-pleased.Paul After the hustle and bustle of the old port of Marseille, head up the steep steps towards the peaceful Panier district of leafy squares and cobbled streets. Independent shops and restaurants reflect the city’s multicultural roots while cool cafes host theatre and live music, buzzing with an energising arty vibe at night. Old houses in pastel shades with fragrant flower baskets create an ambience of a Provençal village in the heart of a busy city. You almost expect to see the ghosts of Monet and Renoir setting up canvas and easel outside. Try fresh fish dishes at Le Refuge (22 rue du Refuge) from €12, menu chalked on a blackboard as you enter.Bill CoxA charming, working fishing port on a peninsula north-east of Dublin, Howth is easily accessible from the city centre by taking the frequent Dart train from Connolly station (30 minute-ride). You can stroll along the harbour and the pretty streets lined with pubs and restaurants all serving the freshest of the local catch, or rummage through the market for a range of artisanal goods and crafts. If you really want to blow the cobwebs away, spend an hour or two walking on Howth Head, a green and wild outcrop with stunning views and salty air, and watch the seabirds and sailing boats.BerniI lived in Vienna’s 9th district for two years, and it was a great halfway house between the city centre and the hills. But my favourite was the 19th, Döbling, with charming wine villages surrounded by vines where scenic hiking routes show off the best views over the city. Among lots of fabulous heuriger (wine taverns) where you can sit in the vineyard garden looking over vines quaffing a carafe or two, our favourite was Weinhof Zimmerman, for its lovely garden full of apple trees and its fine food. Another summer favourite was the Döblinger Freibad, an appealing open- air pool complex with huge lawns, free sunbeds and dappled shade.MarthaThe charming streets of Józsefváros are the veins pumping lifeblood into Budapest’s District Eight. An area once renowned for its chaotic energy and seen as somewhat dangerous has become one of the best areas to enjoy a drink, food or even just a leisurely stroll. Head over to Mikszáth Kalman Ter (named after revered novelist Mikszáth Kalman) for a bite to eat at fabulously decorated Zappa cafe or a coffee over at airy Lumen with its plethora of indoor plants. A short stroll away lies the baroque revivalist Szabo Ervin library, once the private home of aristocrats, whose gorgeous interiors certainly have a wow factor. Grab some traditional lunch at family-run Öcsi Étkezde and peruse the stunning art nouveau Iparművészeti Museum, among the oldest applied arts institutions in the world, with interiors inspired by Hindu, Mogul and Islamic design. AmyMidway between central Athens and the coast is the lush family-friendly neighbourhood of Nea Smyrni (tram from Syntagma to Aghia Fotinis, or an easy 25-minute walk). Its many squares are host to an interesting history: the neighbourhood gained its name from the former Greek city of Smyrna, now Izmir, from where refugees settled the area in the 1920s. Car-free Nea Smyrni Square is at the neighbourhood’s heart and is spectacular, with fountains, shops, restaurants, trendy cafes and bars to suit all ages, trends and budgets. With a plethora of outdoor entertainment during the summer, it’s a real find not on the typical tourist route. Venture beyond the square and you’ll find Nea Smyrni Alsos park, a large green oasis with aleppo pines, cypress and stone pines and good for strolling. It also has a jogging track, an outdoor gym and a cafe. DavidLooking for a holiday with a difference?

Both Sanders and Buttigieg declared victory in a race that was marred by chaotic results, and ended up too close to call.On ABC’s This Week with George Stephanopoulos, Biden was asked if he thought Democrats can’t defeat the president if they have to defend socialism.“I think it’s going to be incredibly more difficult. I’m not going to say – look, if I don’t get the nomination and Bernie gets it, I’m going to work like hell for him,” the former vice-president said of the Vermont senator.“But I’ll tell you what, it’s a bigger uphill climb running as a senator or a congressperson or as a governor on a ticket that calls itself a democratic socialist ticket.”Trump has already begun waging a negative campaign against the spectre of socialism ahead of November’s election, often singling out Sanders, 78, a self-declared democratic socialist with climate, education and healthcare plans costing trillions of dollars.Biden also called out Buttigieg during an event on Saturday, saying the 38-year-old former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, a city of 100,000 people, lacked experience.“I do not believe we’re a party at risk if they nominate me, and I do believe we’re a party at risk if we nominate someone who’s never held a higher office than mayor,” Biden said at a rally in Manchester.“This guy’s not a Barack Obama!” he added, dismissing comparisons with Obama during the presidential campaign in 2008, when Biden said he also lacked experience.“Well, he’s right, I’m not. And neither is he. Neither is any of us running for president,” Buttigieg told CNN’s Jake Tapper on State of the Union on Sunday. He added: “This isn’t 2008 – it’s 2020, and we are in a new moment calling for a different kind of leadership.”Asked whether “the Democrats can defeat Donald Trump if they have to defend socialism”, Buttigieg told Stephanopoulos on ABC that it would be “harder”.“I think it will be a lot harder. But the bigger concern that I have is further iding the country. You know, when the campaign says that either you’re for a revolution or you must be for the status quo -- most of us don’t see where we fit in that picture,” Buttigieg said.“And the irony is at this moment, we actually have a historic American majority, not just the line around what we’re against, we need to get rid of Donald Trump, but what we’re for,” he continued. “Let’s hold together and not blow up that American majority.”Appearing on CNN, Sanders was asked about Biden’s criticism that the Democratic socialist label would hurt candidates in other races.Sanders said that his agenda – a higher minimum wage and healthcare system for all – had “overwhelming” support.“Our agenda is the agenda of working-class and middle-class Americans,” Sanders said.Sanders also addressed criticism of socialism on Fox News Sunday with Chris Wallace, including Trump’s past allegations that Sanders is a “communist”.“No 1, in many respects – in many respects, we are a socialist society today. We have a huge budget. It puts money into all areas,” Sanders responded, saying that Trump received hundreds of millions in subsidies and tax breaks for his businesses.“The difference between my socialism and Trump’s socialism is, I believe the government should help working families, not billionaires,” he said.On CBS’s Face the Nation, Buttigieg also addressed criticism that he wasn’t experienced.One Biden attack ad, for example, states that Biden “helped save the auto industry, which revitalized the economy of the midwest and led the passage and implementation of the Recovery Act, saving our economy from a depression. Pete Buttigieg revitalized the sidewalks of downtown South Bend by laying out decorative brick.”Chris Meagher, Buttigieg’s national press secretary, said: “While Washington politics trivializes what goes on in communities like South Bend, South Bend residents who now have better jobs, rising income and new life in their city don’t think their lives are a Washington politician’s punchline.”Elaborating on Sunday, Buttigieg said: “Maybe my community does look good from – does look small from the perspective of Washington. But to us, a lot of times, it’s the infighting in the Washington establishment … that looks small.” Stephanopoulos asked Warren why she did not raise her hand when asked whether she was concerned about having a Democratic socialist on the ballot during the televised New Hampshire debate on Friday night. But the Massachusetts senator declined to be drawn.“So, look, I am not – I am a capitalist. I’m a – I believe in markets. This is what I talk about all the time,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebc66788e7b47a2a91ece0f1a759640f6822bed0/0_434_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3cd5cd8fd46a53d494c453cffef4d27e","title":"iowa caucuses sanders campaign to ask for partial recanvass of results","story":" Senator, who trails Pete Buttigieg by just two delegates, plans to ask for tally to be checkedBernie Sanders’ campaign plans to ask for a “partial recanvass” of the results of last week’s Iowa caucuses.A campaign aide confirmed the plans on Sunday night, ahead of a Monday deadline for candidates to ask the Iowa Democratic party to recanvass the results. A recanvass is not a recount, but a check of the vote count to ensure the results were added correctly.The state party released updated results on Sunday showing Pete Buttigieg leading Sanders by two state delegate equivalents out of 2,152 counted.The Associated Press remains unable to declare a winner because it believes the results may not be fully accurate and are still subject to potential revision.Technical issues have plagued the caucuses. Use of an app used by party volunteers to report results and jammed phone lines set up for the same purpose meant the Iowa Democratic party failed to release any results to the public until nearly a day after the event. Behind the scenes, party volunteers reported inconsistencies in the complicated maths used by caucus volunteers to calculate the outcome of each inidual caucus.To confirm the validity of the data they received, Iowa Democratic party officials spent much of the week collecting paper records of the results and checking them against the numbers reported by volunteers. But issues continued to plague the party’s reporting, and the Iowa Democratic party on Saturday said it was reviewing reported inconsistencies in 95 precincts.

So what are the campaigns feeding their staff and what, if anything, does it tell us about them?Campaigns are required to submit detailed records of their spending to the Federal Election Commission (FEC) each quarter, showing how much money they raised from donors – and what they spent it on. We used those filings to analyze the remaining candidate’s expenditures on all things edible – from Starbucks coffee runs and airplane snacks to and steakhouse dinners and pizza pies. This analysis covers spending from each campaign’s launch through 31 December 2019.A caveat: each campaign uses slightly different categorizations in its FEC filings. We excluded expenditures if they included event space rentals or appeared to refer to catering for fundraising events. This decision primarily affected the analyses for the Amy Klobuchar, Pete Buttigieg, Joe Biden, and Andrew Yang campaigns, since Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Tom Steyer and Michael Bloomberg are not holding high-dollar fundraisers.Overall, we examined $1.9m in spending on food and beverages by these eight campaigns. Here’s what we found.About $1m of that spending went to catering companies or restaurants that we characterized as generally American. Of the other $900,000, Mexican food was the top choice. Democratic campaigns spent $92,120 at Mexican restaurants throughout 2019, led by the Warren campaign, which accounted for more than a third of that total.Soul food and barbecue were popular choices in South Carolina, another state with an early primary. Andrew Yang, whose parents emigrated to the US from Taiwan, spent the most on Chinese food, followed by Tom Steyer, Warren, Biden and Sanders. Yang’s campaign was also the only one to show expenditures from Korean and Creole restaurants.The Warren and Sanders campaigns also demonstrated notable ersity in their choices. Sanders staffers shelled out for Thai, Jamaican and Middle Eastern food. Warren workers dined on Filipino, vegan, Thai, and Indian food.Meanwhile, Bloomberg’s campaign dominated the spending on Japanese food, shelling out $16,877 at a single sushi restaurant in the six weeks after he launched his run in late November. That restaurant, Hanabi Japanese Cuisine, is just a few blocks away from the Bloomberg Philanthropies offices, which are housed in a 19th century Italianate mansion on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. (The Bloomberg campaign is paying rent to the Bloomberg Philanthropies building, according to the filings.)Lest you think the campaign blew all that money in one sitting, Hanabi is no Nobu. The storefront restaurant offers specialty rolls at prices ranging from just $7 to $13.Bloomberg staffers might have a taste for mid-range sushi, but his campaign is not exactly pinching pennies when it comes to meals. Despite only having launched in late November, the campaign has already spent about $310,000 on food. Most of that went to office catering services, but one notable line item was more than $10,000 to Air Culinaire, an in-flight catering service for private jets. Options for travelers out of New York range from a seared wagyu steak with foie gras, morels and potato hash to sous-vide black chicken thighs with green onion salad, beetroot puree, jasmine tea-infused rice and sesame dressing. Each menu also features extensive options from Petrossian Caviar, Air Culinaire’s “caviar partner”.The other self-funding billionaire in the race, Steyer, spent more than half a million dollars on food and beverages. Much of that spending went to catering and restaurants, but there were also some notable expenditures:For those campaign workers who don’t work for billionaires, however, meals of pizza, sandwiches, and bar food were much more common.The Sanders campaign spent the most on pizza – about $30,000 – while Domino’s racked up the most orders of any pizzeria.America’s most disappointing sandwich chain,Panera Bread, meanwhile, accounted for $50,450 in spending across all the campaigns.Campaign staff typically work exceptionally long hours, and you can’t make it through the day without a strong breakfast.

If so we want to hear about it. At the dawn of the 2020s, “activism” is an almost omnipresent buzzword.The acute housing shortages, increasing rates of unstable employment, low wages, rising living costs, environmental pollution and government cuts that have defined the last decade may have caused widespread political disenfranchisement and apathy. But a growing number of people are suddenly motivated to use their frustrations and turn them into action.Grassroots community movements come and go, and while some end up petering out before they have achieved the desired outcome, others effect markedly visible change.

And they all came together at one of the most-watched live television events of the time, when feminist protesters stormed the stage at Miss World 1970, and a black woman walked away from the beauty contest with the crown for the first time.Fifty years on, that night is being retold in a film, Misbehaviour, inspired by the memoir of Jennifer Hosten, who won the contest and made history. In the decades that have followed, the one-time beauty queen has come to the conclusion that she and the women disrupting the competition had more in common than they might have thought.“I didn’t realise it fully at the time but we were all using that contest as a way to get a message across,” she told the Observer last week. “For me it was about race and inclusion – for them, it was about female exploitation.”Hosten, who came from the tiny Caribbean island of Grenada to scoop the crown at the age of 23, was peeking through the stage curtain at the Royal Albert Hall, a few feet from compere Bob Hope as he delivered his now infamous opening remarks.“I don’t want you to think I’m a dirty old man because I never give women a second thought,” he said. “My first thought covers everything.”“He was struggling,” remembered Hosten, now 72. She recalled hearing a firecracker go off and seeing people running scared. But the huge bang was from a group of well-dressed women who had started pelting the US comedian with flour bombs, then rose up in outrage. “We’re not beautiful, we’re not ugly. We’re ANGRY!” they screamed.The supposed firecracker was actually a football rattle, sounded by a women’s liberation activist and designed as a cue for the other feminists strategically planted among the audience to leap into action. The plan had been to kick things off when the contestants were on stage being paraded around in their swimwear, but Hosten says the women were so outraged by Hope’s jokes that the rattle went off early. “It was a big deal then, it’s still a big deal now!” she added.Watched on TV by over 22 million people in Britain, and 100 million worldwide, the incident was seen as a galvanising moment for the women’s liberation movement and is to be retold in the film starring Keira Knightley, Gugu Mbatha-Raw and Jessie Buckley later this year. Hosten’s memoir, Miss World 1970, will be published next month.But for Hosten it was also a big win for racial equality. Not only was she crowned Miss World but her friend, Pearl Jansen from South Africa, was the runner-up. Organisers had been shamed into sending her, a black contestant, at the last minute but Jansen had to be known as Miss Africa South because there was already a white Miss South Africa.Hosten recalls Jansen telling her there was a reason for black women being represented at the contest that was “much more important than just representing our country”.Her success, however, outraged sections of the tabloid media. The Sun newspaper presented Hosten’s victory as a conspiracy by black members of the judging panel. “How else could a black girl with 25:1 odds have walked away with the title? That’s what they were saying,” she said.And it wasn’t only the press. Eric Morley – the then head of the Miss World beauty business – had handpicked 15 of the 58 contestants for a dress rehearsal the night before the event, parading them before the cameras. “They were his favourites,” Hosten said. “But only one of them – Miss Guyana – was a woman of colour. The rest of us were told to go and sit down with the audience.”Hosten was shocked. Growing up in Grenada she had not thought much about skin colour. That changed when she arrived in Britain for the show.“It was such an eye-opener, seeing the way the media only saw beauty by European standards. It was supposed to be Miss World – people of different races and different cultures. Most of us were written off before we even started.”It made her participation much more meaningful, she said. “It made me want to win.”When she did just that she was celebrated right across the Caribbean. In 1970 Grenada still didn’t have independence from Britain, so it was an opportunity to put her small country on the map. “I showed off my country and showed that women can do anything,” she said.In the 50 years since then, the world has moved on. Last year, for the first time in history, Miss World, Miss Universe, Miss USA, Miss Teen USA and Miss America were all won by women of colour. “The question is, though, why are we talking about that?” said Hosten. “The fact that we’re talking about it as a big deal means to say that it is still a big deal.”Misbehaviour is released on 13 March"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5626b97c918ffd6548a75688bc2fc8952beebea/0_247_3210_1927/master/3210.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1bb9d7c200a052675a231817d45a8014","title":"sinn fein to try to form ruling coalition after irish election success","story":"Party disrupts Ireland’s centrist tradition by taking almost a quarter of votesSinn Féin will try to form a government in Ireland after apparently winning more votes than any other party in Saturday’s general election – a historic result that upended the political system.The party leader, Mary Lou McDonald, told cheering supporters on Sunday that a “revolution” had occurred and she would try to form a ruling coalition with other parties. “This is no longer a two-party system,” she said.Sinn Féin, once a pariah for its IRA links, won almost a quarter of first-preference votes, possibly pipping Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, two centrist rivals that have taken turns ruling Ireland for a century.It rode a wave of anger over homelessness, soaring rents and hospital waiting lists as well as disillusionment with the traditional political duopoly.McDonald, speaking over rapturous, deafening chants at a Dublin count centre, said she had spoken to the Greens and small leftwing parties in hope of forming a coalition without Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil – an unlikely scenario. She did not rule out a deal with either Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil.Parliamentary arithmetic may exclude Sinn Féin from power, however. Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael ran more candidates and are expected to each win more seats than Sinn Féin in the 160-seat Dáil Éireann, the Irish parliament’s lower chamber, leaving unclear which parties – if any – will be able to form a viable coalition. Deadlock could lead to another election.During the campaign Leo Varadkar, the taoiseach and Fine Gael leader, and Micheál Martin, the leader of Fianna Fáil, both ruled out entering government with Sinn Féin, citing ethical and policy reasons.On Sunday evening, Varadkar told journalists in Dublin: “For us, coalition with Sinn Fein is not an option, but we are willing to talk to other parties.”Varadkar, Ireland’s first gay taoiseach, had hoped a healthy economy and his record on Brexit would deliver a third term for Fine Gael, but he encountered voter fatigue and anger over the cost of living and state of public services.Varadkar’s party colleague Richard Bruton, the outgoing environment minister, said Fine Gael’s poor but not disastrous results gave it a chance of forming another government.Asked if Fianna Fáil would now consider sharing power with Fine Gael or Sinn Féin, Martin appeared to leave the door ajar, citing a need for stability amid political fragmentation. “The country comes first … there is an onus and an obligation on all that such a functioning government is formed after this.”Many in Fianna Fáil, stung by the backlash over their confidence-and-supply deal with Varadkar’s outgoing government, would prefer a deal with Sinn Féin than another centrist alliance.Ireland’s single transferrable vote system of proportional representation means it could be Monday, Tuesday or even later before all Dáil seats are allocated.It was a stunning result for Sinn Féin, which was the IRA’s political wing during the Troubles and remained a fringe party in the republic until well after the 1998 Good Friday agreement.Preliminary vote tallies suggested Sinn Féin could win around 36 seats, up from 22 in the outgoing Dáil, far exceeding its own expectations.Many candidates ratcheted up huge surpluses in urban heartlands while others appeared on course for unexpected victories in Galway, Tipperary, Roscommon, Mayo and Wexford.Gerry Adams, who stepped down as party leader in 2018 and as a Dáil member in this election, credited McDonald’s leadership and said he had not foreseen the extent of the gains. He said Sinn Féin would use its mandate to plan for a united Ireland – a defining tenet for the party.The issue of a united Ireland barely featured in the campaign, but an exit poll of voters found most supporting a border poll in the next five years. Sceptics say that could destabilise both sides of the island. Unionist leaders in Northern Ireland gave no immediate response to the results south of the border.People across the political spectrum said the election was seismic, even if its consequences remained unclear. The former Labour leader Pat Rabbitte said a tectonic shift had killed the old system of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael alternating in power with Labour or other small, establishment parties.The commentator Fintan O’Toole wrote in the  that young voters had shattered the taboo of backing a party associated with terrorism. “They have gone where they were warned not to go and in doing so they have redrawn the map of Irish politics to include territory previously marked ‘here be dragons’.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39fc36381893800fe2a93143d9dcdf096a82d325/0_306_4928_2956/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=df9d8c4f9a9e2927dc59d5640414d35c","title":"monday briefing sinn feins irish revolution","story":"IRA’s former political wing could form government in Ireland after election triumph … Ciara batters Britain … and Parasite makes Oscars historyMorning everyone.

The head of the World Health Organization says “we may only be seeing the tip of the iceberg” with regards to the spread of the coronavirus. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who dispatched a team of experts to China today, said there were “some concerning instances” of the virus’s spread from people with no travel history to China. In China, where the death toll from the outbreak has jumped to 908 with 40,000 cases, authorities began to oversee a partial return to work for millions of people furloughed last week in an attempt to contain the contagion.

You can email me at aamna.mohdin@the, or reach me through my Twitter profile, @aamnamohdinHere’s a report by my colleague Frances Perraudin on what it means now the UK has declared the coronavirus outbreak a serious and imminent threat to public health. Under the measures announced on Monday, the Department of Health said people with coronavirus can now be forcibly quarantined and will not be free to leave, and can be forcibly sent into isolation if they pose a threat to public health.A spokesman said: “Our infection control procedures are world leading and the NHS is well prepared to deal with novel coronavirus.“We are strengthening our regulations so we can keep iniduals in supported isolation for their own safety and if public health professionals consider they may be at risk of spreading the virus to other members of the public.“This measure will rightly make it easier for health professionals to help keep people safe across the country.”A team of experts headed by the World Health Organization (WHO) flew into Beijing on Monday to help assess the latest outbreak. While China has borne the brunt of the disease with the vast majority of confirmed cases and all but two of the deaths, the WHO chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said there had been “some concerning instances” of transmission from people who had not been to China.“The detection of a small number of cases may indicate more widespread transmission in other countries in short, we may only be seeing the tip of the iceberg,” he said on Twitter.He called on the global community to work together and share what they know in real-time with WHO.Military personnel set up a covered walkway this morning next to the Diamond Princess cruise ship. About 3,600 people are quarantined onboard due to fears of the new coronavirus at the Daikoku Pier cruise terminal in Yokohama port.

The figures they have used are taken from the Chinese national health commission.Chinese state media is reporting that the government pumped $129bn into the financial system today. It says the money has gone in via “reverse repos”, which is a reverse repurchase agreement. This is the purchase of securities with the agreement to sell them at a higher price at a specific future date. A citizen journalist who had been reporting from the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak has gone missing, prompting claims that the Chinese authorities are silencing another whistleblower.Chen Qiushi, a human rights advocate, has been missing since Thursday – the same day Li Wenliang, a 34-year-old ophthalmologist who was punished by authorities for trying to warn colleagues and friends about a new Sars-like virus, was first reported to have died from the coronavirus.You can see our full story here.Sixty more cases of coronavirus have been confirmed on the Diamond princess cruise ship, domestic broadcaster TBS TV said via Twitter. NHK Japan is also saying around 60 new cases have been identified, quoting the health ministry.That brings total cases on the ship docked in Yokohama, south of Tokyo, to 130, according to TBS.When the boat arrived off Japan, authorities initially tested nearly 300 people of the 3,711 on board for the virus, gradually evacuating dozens who tested positive to local medical facilities.In recent days, testing has expanded to those who had close contact with other infected passengers or crew, and several more cases were reported over the weekend.Those who remain on the ship have been asked to stay inside their cabins and allowed out only briefly onto open decks.They have been asked to wear masks and keep a distance from each other when outside, and given thermometers to regularly monitor their temperatures.The Mobile World Congress – the largest exhibition for the mobile phone industry – being held in Barcelona this month, has announced travellers from Hubei province will not be admitted. In addition, organisers announced that:Amazon has announced it will not attend the conference, because of coronavirus-related concerns.Other companies believed to have pulled out include LG and Ericsson, according to Techcrunch. China’s consumer prices rose at the highest rate in more than eight years, official data on Monday showed, with inflation more than expected on the back of lunar new year demand and a deadly virus outbreak.“People also tend to hoard food and other supplies in this kind of situation.

For example, the bonus allowed students who scored between 500 and 600 points overtake about 20 per cent of other students who scored above them.A commentary accompanying the report states that it is not possible to determine whether students who completed their exams in Irish would have performed better if they answered them in English.“While we can assume that all of these candidates are very good at Irish, the great majority are not native speakers. They might therefore have done better (exclusive of the bonus) had they both studied the subject and been examined in it through English,” the report states.“If one takes this view, the effect of the bonus scheme is to partially or fully rectify a cause of unfairness. If one does not, then the effect is to create an unfair advantage.”Scheme rulesUnder Irish bonus scheme rules, students who answer written exams in Irish may receive bonus marks of up to 10 per cent for subjects such as history, geography, physics, chemistry and biology.The bonus marks are lower – 5 per cent – for subjects where there is less reliance on Irish, such as foreign languages, maths, accounting and engineering.Irish and English are excluded from the bonus scheme.The full bonus only applies if the student has obtained less than 75 per cent in their exam.Above this point, the bonus applies on a sliding scale to the point where a student who scores 100 per cent gets no bonus.The SEC report also found that the way students benefit from the Irish bonus is “erratic” due to the way the grading process works by disproportionately benefitting more students over others.For example, it points out that it is possible for the Irish bonus to cause an upgrade from an E to a D3 in a higher-level subject, which would yield 45 points, or 70 points in the case of higher maths.It says changes should be considered so there is a more even distribution of the benefit.“Decisions over the future of the bonus points scheme do not simply come down to whether to abolish it or not,” it states.“The scheme has been amended in its manner of application on a number of occasions through its history. There is no reason why it cannot be amended again if there is agreement that there is a fairer way for it to operate.”AnomaliesIn response to queries from The , the State Examinations Commission said some of the anomalies highlighted in its report no longer arise due to grading changes introduced in 2017.These changes – which replaced As, Bs and Cs with wider grade bands such as H1s and H2s – followed recommendations from a group led by the Department of Education which included education partners such as higher education institutions.This same group decided not to make any recommendation in relation to the Irish bonus scheme when making the grading changes in 2017.“The SEC continues to implement the Irish bonus scheme in accordance with Government policy,” it said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4167475.1581280529!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"election 2020 how sinn f%C3%A9in turned their fortunes around","story":"Candidates Dessie Ellis and Aengus O’Snodaigh of Sinn Féin celebrate their party’s success in the general election at the RDS count centre.

Photograph: Crispin RodwellTwo years after she was elected Sinn Féin president, Mary Lou McDonald has wildly exceeded the expectations of party members who chose her to succeed Gerry Adams.When the Dublin Central TD was elected party leader at a special ardfheis in the RDS, Dublin, on February 10th, 2018, those present hoped she could extend Sinn Féin’s reach into the parts of the Irish electorate Adams could not touch.It is unlikely party members thought her leadership would herald this level of success, which saw her walk through the front door of the same RDS on count day two years later as the star of Election 2020.Sinn Féin is set for a seat haul in the mid to late 30s, a significant increase on the 22 seats it had when the 32nd Dáil was dissolved.The feat is all the more remarkable for the fact McDonald has encountered setbacks in the two years since she succeeded Adams. Her first electoral outing was the 2018 presidential election, when Sinn Féin candidate Liadh Ní Riada came fourth on just 6.37 per cent of the vote.That was followed by last year’s local and European elections, which saw Sinn Féin drop from the 159 council seats it won in 2014 to 81 seats and lose two MEPs: Lynn Boylan in Dublin and Ní Riada in Ireland South.The party, as it always does after elections, carried out a review. A view formed among some that Sinn Féin needed to strike a better balance between promoting its own policies and criticising the government.The key frontbench spokespeople – Eoin Ó Broin in housing, Pearse Doherty in finance and Louise O’Reilly in health – came to the fore. Party sources also said TDs went back to their “bread and butter” of providing constituency services, which Sinn Féin sources claim outstrip those of other parties.Fortunes turnIn the aftermath of the drubbing in the local elections, many in the party felt that some who lost their council seats had not done enough work on the ground. The same could not be said of the TDs.The final months of 2019 saw the party’s fortunes turn. Ó Broin engineered a byelection victory for Sinn Féin in his Dublin Mid-West constituency, with Mark Ward joining him in the Dáil and then holding the seat at the general election.The Westminster elections last December were more mixed, with John Finucane taking the Belfast North seat held by the DUP’s Nigel Dodds, as the Foyle seat was lost to SDLP leader Colum Eastwood.Confidence was returning, even if the expectation within the party was still that this general election would be about consolidating rather than expanding its Dáil numbers.The fact that it decided to run only 42 candidates was evidence that Sinn Féin did not expect this level of success. It pruned tickets and left many TDs, including McDonald herself, without running mates, thus leaving seats behind.Yet those who canvassed during the byelections said they felt something stirring among the electorate – a desire for change, and the identification of Sinn Féin as the party that could bring it about – which carried through to the general election.“They were clear who they weren’t voting for: Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or Labour, ” said one source of the attitude of party voters.Even though her performance in that debate was poor, party figures said her mere presence on the RTÉ set that night was enough. It said Sinn Féin was now on a par with Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.McDonald herself was the star of the campaign, and her repeated attacks on Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael for, as she claimed, being in power together for four years were brutally effective.It robbed Micheál Martin of his claim to be an agent of change and solidified Sinn Féin as the party offering radical change.McDonald herself was a hit on the canvass. In person, the Dublin Central TD is warm, friendly and approachable, and this came across in broadcast coverage of her daily walkabouts.Those who dislike Sinn Féin are turned off by her strident Dáil and debate performances, and are unlikely to have been swayed during this campaign. But her stump appearances showed her warmth and ease with people.Before she took over as leader, McDonald suggested her party should be prepared to enter government as a junior partner.But she has brought Sinn Féin much further than being the new half in the old 2½-party system. She has firmly established it as the third force in Irish politics.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4167392.1581276072!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"don t mention the b word brexit barely figures as an election issue","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar arrives at the count centre in Dublin. Despite its best efforts, Fine Gael was  unable to make Brexit a critical talking point for voters. Photograph: Donall FarmerGetty ImagesThe B-word barely figured as an election issue, despite Fine Gael’s best efforts during the campaign to make Brexit a critical talking point for voters.Despite Brexit dominating Irish and British politics for the past three years, the UK’s departure from the EU – and the potential risks of a no-deal crash-out (still) at the end of the year – came joint last along with immigration on a list of 10 issues cited by voters in Saturday night’s exit poll.But the talk about Fianna Fáil being the “junior B team” failed to hit home with voters on the issue. Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin dismissed the attacks, stating that he had supported Fine Gael’s stance on Brexit and the parties maintained “a good national consensus” on the issue.Backroom dealings“There is a lot of goodwill and thanks on the doorsteps for Brexit, but voters have priced it in as yesterday’s news,” said one Fine Gael insider. He regretted that, to set it apart, Fine Gael did not tell the electorate more during the campaign about the Government’s backroom diplomatic dealings at critical junctures in the Brexit process – for example, the Varadkar-Boris Johnson meeting on the Wirral that broke the Brexit deadlock in October or the times when EU solidarity behind Ireland and the Border waned in recent years.Any attempt to make Brexit more of an issue during the campaign by calling an election for a week after the UK’s scheduled exit from EU on January 31st – even though Fine Gael dismissed this - was hampered by the fact that the departure ended up being a non-event for Irish voters.The risk of a hard border on the island of Ireland faded, with the Brexit deal putting a trade border between Northern Ireland and Britain in the Irish Sea. When it formally happened, the UK exited with a whimper.“It is a measure of the fact that January 31st went off without a single piece of friction that the voters don’t care about it,” said the Fine Gael source.Full impactThe standstill transition period, postponing any Brexit effect on Irish businesses until the end of December 2020, means that the full impact of the UK’s departure has not yet been felt at home.“People have put it to the back of their minds until the end of the year, to the date when it kicks in. It is the only explanation why it has not been an issue because everyone was very concerned,” said Imelda Munster, the Sinn Féin TD re-elected in Co Louth.Munster said the seriousness of the country’s health and housing crises overtook Brexit as an election issue.“It was the only thing they could go with,” she said of Fine Gael pushing Brexit as a concern during the campaign.“They could hardly go with health, housing or the pension age with people lying on trolleys. It was the only positive thing that they thought would work for them.”Damian McGenity, a south Armagh farmer and spokesman for Border Communities Against Brexit, said the increase in Sinn Féin’s vote in the Border counties was a sign that Brexit was “definitely a factor” in those parts.It was “not a big issue to people south of the Boyne”, he said.“Eaten bread is soon forgotten. The withdrawal agreement has, for now, achieved a deal, but it is yesterday’s news the future is what people see as critical,” he said.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail Full results and counts for the 39 election constituencies.

Photograph: Tom HonanThe results of this earthquake general election will continue to unfold but it is already clear that the landscape on which our politics happens has been reordered for the third time in three elections.If change was the message of this election, wild volatility is the trend of the last three.There is no reason to think that this process will stop this year.Since the economic crash ended the previously unshakeable fealty of the Irish electorate to the voting patterns that had dominated for decades, elections have featured sudden, sharp swings. Basically, Irish voters are liable to do anything.The swing this time was to Sinn Féin – and in proportions that, while signalled by the opinion polls, had not been truly comprehended by either that party or its competitors until the ballot boxes were opened. But since its first TD was elected in Cork South-Central, where Donncha Ó Laoghaire roundly beat Micheál Martin and Simon Coveney to top the poll, the party has enjoyed the spectacle of Sinn Féin candidates charging home in early counts all over the country, often with huge – and electorally wasteful – surpluses.\u0027Unprecedented power\u0027The election has brought the party to a position of unprecedented power in the Republic. Mary Lou McDonald must now decide what she wants to do with that newfound power. She says she wants to go into government it remains to be seen how earnestly she wishes to pursue that objective.For a party that always thinks long term, there are as many political arguments for Sinn Féin staying out of government as for going in.For Fine Gael, the party is facing a loss of seats, and – perhaps – the loss of power. But it fared much better than it feared a week ago, when a full-scale meltdown seemed possible.Projections suggest that losses are inevitable, though. High-profile figures like Minister for Social Protection Regina Doherty and outspoken backbencher Kate O’Connell are tipped for the chop, while Minister of State for higher education Mary Mitchell-O’Connor could yet be replaced by newcomer party colleague Jennifer Carroll MacNeill.When they elected him, Fine Gael TDs – and it was the TDs that elected him taoiseach, rather than the public – hoped that Leo Varadkar could be a transformative figure, an election winner. In recent weeks it became clear that wasn’t going to happen. But he could yet manoeuvre them back into government.For Fianna Fáil the result is a disappointment, and a paradox. It’s the second-lowest result in its history after the bailout massacre of 2011. But politics is a funny old game. Micheál Martin may yet end up as the leader of the largest party in the Dáil if later counts break his way.Government formationThe result confines his options for government dramatically, and for both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, the focus is moving inexorably and smartly towards government formation. Their leaders will have to make some far-reaching decisions quickly and under pressure. Should they hang separately or together?The Green Party is also looking at a paradox – a disappointing result that may still end up as its best ever. Eamon Ryan has made his ambition to be part of the next government clear over the course of the campaign but those ambitions have taken a battering from these results.They are not, however, entirely extinguished even a combination of two of the big three might fall a bit short of the 80-seat mark necessary to command a Dáil majority. If so, such a coalition might need some help, and the Greens might be willing to supply it. When the Lord closes a door, he opens a little window.The Labour Party lost\u0026nbspthe seats held by Joan Burton\u0026nbspand the retiring Willie Penrose, and looks set to lose that held by Jan O’Sullivan, though it nurses hopes of replacing some of these losses with Aodhán Ó Ríordáin in Dublin Bay North and Ged Nash in Louth.Hopes are faltering for Kevin Humphreys in Dublin Bay South, while Alan Kelly will be in the scrap of his life to hold on in Tipperary. But the reality is that Labour is a party on life support on the national stage, and you’d wonder where its growth is going to come from during another spell in opposition.IndependentsThe smaller parties and Independents have recorded inevitably mixed fortunes. Things are looking up for the Social Democrats, which won’t have escaped Labour’s attention.The fate of the Independents who were part of the outgoing Government tells us something important about Irish politics today.Two retirements in the face of probable losses – Finian McGrath and John Halligan – an actual loss in the form of Shane Ross, two almost certain losses for Katherine Zappone and Kevin “Boxer” Moran and just one survivor in Sean Canney will give anyone contemplating government food for thought.It is not just parties that are punished for being in government. Independents can face the public wrath too.This is now a feature of Irish politics that will weigh on the minds of everyone engaged in the elaborate dance of government formation in the days ahead.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail Full results and counts for the 39 election constituencies.

Photograph:  Damien EagersThe “Sinn Féin has won the election. We have won the popular vote,” the Sinn Féin leader said.Counting in the general election resumes in centres across the State this morning with 82 of 160 seats left to be filled.Thirteen of 39 constituencies have completed their count with Sinn Féin currently leading with 29 seats, Fianna Fáil on 16, Fine Gael on 14 Independents on nine, Green Party on five, Social Democrats on two, Solidarity People Before Profit on two and Labour on one.Sinn Féin has run 42 candidates with both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael running double that amount and while the party is currently leading the polls, the final result may see either of the other two parties with more seats than Sinn Féin.Ms McDonald said her preference remains a government without either of the two formerly largest parties, but added that “grown up people” sit down and talk.“The democratic thing is for them to speak to me and stop this business of saying Sinn Féin can be put on the margin . . .so many people now have chosen us to represent them,” she told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland.Ms McDonald said she has made contact with the Greens, the Social Democrats and People Before Profit to explore whether there are the numbers and political will to form a government without Fianna Fail and Fine Gael.She will also talk to Independents as seats are filled and “obviously also the Labour party and everybody outside the old two”.But she was also “very glad” that Fianna Fail leader Micheál Martin has “come to his senses” by seemingly softening his opposition to a coalition with Sinn Féin, she said.“It was never a sustainable position to suggest that a party such as ours, that represents such a substantial number of citizens, that there would be an active campaign to exclude us was completely wrong,” she said.“We’ve known for for a long time that the dominance of Fianna Fail and Fine Gael is over . . The people have made that decision.”Ms McDonald added: “This vote for Sinn Féin is for Sinn Féin to be in government, for Sinn Féin to make a difference, for Sinn Féin to be tested, for Sinn Féin to deliver.”Ms McDonald said she believes a “people’s government” can be formed.The Sinn Féin leader also admitted the party, which stormed home in many constituencies with huge surpluses, should have ran more candidates.“There is no doubt there are constituencies where we have left seats behind,” she said.Sinn Féin candidates stormed to a series of spectacular victories in general election counts on Sunday, reshaping Ireland’s political landscape as party leaders begin to turn their attention to how the next government might be formed.Though many seats remain to be filled, a hung Dáil, which will be dominated by three big parties – Sinn Féin, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael – is inevitable.Sinn Féin candidates all over the country won huge victories, with many elected on the first count with huge surpluses, catapulting the party into the front rank of Irish politics and making it a contender for government. Fine Gael seems certain to suffer losses, while Fianna Fáil looks set to be the largest party in the new Dáil, analysts were projecting last night.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, who was elected on the fifth count in Dublin West, reiterated he would not form a government with Sinn Féin, but indicated a coalition with Fianna Fail could be possible, saying “we are willing to talk to other parties about the possibility of forming a new government, one that would lead the country forward for the next five years”.Fianna Fáil sources reported an emerging debate in the party about potential coalition with either Fine Gael or Sinn Féin. Party leader Micheál Martin, who was elected on the sixth count in Cork South Central, appeared to soften his pre-election refusal to contemplate coalition with either of his two rivals, declining to explicitly rule out a coalition deal with either.Mr Martin said for any government to be sustainable, the policy platforms between the participating parties have to be compatible. “It has to be coherent and it has to be sustainable and deliverable. They’re very significant issues that can’t be glossed over in the euphoria of an election day and all of the tension, interest and excitement around it,” he said.Later, Mr Varadkar seemed to echo Mr Martin’s views when he said to form a government together “you need to have roughly the same views around the courts of the criminal justice system, around how the economy and society should be run and also how democracy should function and that’s what makes my party, Fine Gael, not compatible with Sinn Féin”.Opinion was ided in Fianna Fáil on whether it should enter coalition with Sinn Féin or Fine Gael, or stay out of government. The ide was evident on the party’s backbench and among the frontbench of Mr Martin’s most senior TDs.“Government with Fine Gael isn’t a radical gesture,” said one member of the frontbench. “I don’t see how Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael can be seen as reflecting a radical general election result. Sinn Féin is a mixture of Brexit Party populism and nationalism that kinda has to be tempered in my view – or else the centre collapses.” Another TD said he would prefer coalition with Sinn Féin rather than Fine Gael, adding Mr Martin “needs to swallow his pride” or step down as party leader.Consider coalitionGalway TD Éamon Ó Cuív has suggested that Fianna Fáil must consider coalition government with Sinn Féin rather than a grand coalition with Fine Gael.Mr Ó Cuív, who topped the poll in Galway West, said he has always been open to a coalition with Sinn Féin and that he would be “totally opposed” to any arrangements which would see Fine Gael retain power. “There is great arguments going on all day about whether we are nearer Sinn Féin or Fine Gael,” Mr Ó Cuív said.“My heart is much nearer the Sinn Féin side of the argument in terms of services for the people and putting the people before economic theory.”Another senior Fianna Fáil TD last night said if the party was to share power with Fine Gael, “We may as well shut up shop.” However, the TD also added Sinn Féin should be allowed to form a government of the left. But others in Fianna Fáil are more open to coalition with Fine Gael, perhaps including one of the small parties, such as the Greens.Senior Fine Gael sources said they expected Mr Varadkar would approach Fianna Fáil about entering into a grand coalition.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail Full results and counts for the 39 election constituencies.

Photograph: Matthias RietschelReutersAngela Merkel’s designated successor has announced she is not planning to run for the German chancellorship at the next federal election and plans to step down as leader of the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU), German media reported on Monday morning.The surprise announcement comes in the middle of a major row over the centre-right party’s “firewall” against the far-right, in which CDU delegates in eastern Germany have defied the party headquarter’s ban on co-operating with the Alternative für Deutschland (AfD).Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer (57) won the contest to succeed Dr Merkel as leader of the CDU in December 2018 and was seen as the candidate most likely to continue the current German chancellor’s centrist course.But “AKK”, as she has come to be known in German media, has struggled to build a profile in Dr Merkel’s shadow, even after doubling up as defence minister last July.Questions over her control over an increasingly ided CDU returned to the fore last week, after politicians from the party’s branch in Thuringia voted with the AfD to oust the state’s premier Bodo Ramelow, of left-wing Die Linke.Dr Merkel’s unusual decision to intervene in the affair, announcing that it was “unforgivable” for democratic parties to win majorities with the help of Alternative für Deutschland, further accentuated Ms Kramp-Karrenbauer’s lack of authority.News magazine Der Spiegel on Monday morning reported that AKK had cited the unclear positions of certain elements in her party towards the AfD and Die Linke as the reason for her resignation. – "},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons february 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178.Soldiers enter El Salvador\u0026#39s parliament to demand $109m loan Politics latest: Sinn Fein\u0026#39s historic surge in Ireland raises serious questions for future Anglo-Irish relations Coronavirus latest news: Patient threatens hospital breakout, as disease declared \u0026#39serious and imminent threat\u0026#39Storm Ciara: Britain braces for more chaos amid gusts of up to 70mph The Briefing: Sign up for two-minute audio news updates on WhatsApp, Apple, Spotify and Alexa twice a dayComment: The BBC is in desperate trouble because British TV just isn\u0026#39t as good as it used to beComment: To revive faith in capitalism, make employee share ownership the norm not the exceptionSolar Orbiter takes off on unprecedented mission to capture sun\u0026#39s polar regionsHow the British-built Solar Orbiter\u0026#39s mission of discovery will make a giant leap in our understanding of The Sun Coronavirus: Briton tests positive in Spain as fourth case is confirmed in UKStorm Ciara: Britain\u0026#39s \u0026#39storm of the century\u0026#39 brings chaos with 100mph winds as Met Office warns of further disruptionCoronavirus: a quick guide to the outbreak sweeping the world Storm Ciara\u0026#39s trail of chaos: Trains, planes and even the Queen couldn\u0026#39t escape the mayhemAlmost half of councils fail to collect food waste from householdsHow prehistoric cave paintings are helping scientists discover secrets of spaceWould-be rapist dragged teenage victim into ThamesEndeavour, series 7 episode 1 review: Morse discovers his inner 007 in a reliable returnWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"guyanese indigenous tribes hold key unprecedented wealth worlds","story":"Kicking up clouds of red dust and scattering flocks of wild ibis, Guy Fredricks guns his Honda motorbike over the dirt tracks of the Rupununi savannah in southern Guyana.Election season is a busy time for a toshao, the chiefs of Guyana’s indigenous Amerindian villages. For Mr Fredricks there are errands to be run, gifts to be delivered and political news to be relayed. On March 2 the former British colony, South America’s only English speaking country, will hold its most important general election in a generation. Whoever wins will preside over the first revenues from a colossal offshore oil project set to radically transform the tiny country\u0027s fortunes.With the main parties equally matched, the votes of the country’s Amerindian minority could be crucial for victory.  “We make the difference in the election,” says Mr Fredricks. “Recently we have seen a lot of development. Our requests for assistance have been coming through, but will that happen after the elections?”The three villages Mr Fredricks represents - totalling 700 members of the Macushi people - lie at the heart of a 5,000 square mile region of grasslands. The area is separated from the coastal capital, Georgetown, by 500 kilometres of pristine rainforest populated by giant anteaters, 40-stone anacondas and monkey-eating harpy eagles.The region is famously remote. When a bruised and penitent Evelyn Waugh visited in 1932 while escaping a collapsing marriage, he used the savannah and region and surrounding jungles as the setting for the nightmarish ending of A Handful of Dust. In his notes he described the local parish of St Ignatius “as lonely an outpost of religion as you could find anywhere.”Outside of campaigning season, the Macushi – along with the nearby Wapishana and Wai-Wai tribes – are largely neglected by the state.Following the decline of the cattle ranching and latex industries, many inhabitants rely on subsistence agriculture and the tiny eco-tourism industry.Three quarters of inhabitants live in poverty, compared to a national average of 36 per cent.Nine out of ten Guyanese live on the country’s Caribbean coast, once home to vast sugar estates worked first by slaves and then indentured labour from the Indian subcontinent.Those waves of immigration has left the population of 778,000 almost evenly split between Guyanese of African and East Indian ancestry.With each group expected to vote along ethnic lines, the backing of indigenous voters, who make up 10 per cent of the population, is the key to victory.The stakes have never been higher. Guyana is on the brink of becoming filthily, incomparably rich. A few days before Christmas the first oil began to flow from the depths of ExxonMobil’s giant Liza 1 offshore field, the first of a series of oil projects that promise to transform Guyana’s economic destiny.Early estimates say the oil will earn Guyana’s government over $120 billion in royalties and taxes, pushing up its GDP by 86 per cent in 2020 alone.In Georgetown, however, there is little sign of such riches. The city’s once-grand timber architecture creaks and crumbles in the Caribbean climate. The roadside waterways clog with litter.So far the main benefits of the boom have been landowners, who have sold riverside and coastal terrains to shore bases for the oil industry and property developers who can charge New York City prices for houses in gated communities.A sense of pessimism prevails. “We’ve been told Guyana would be a rich country before, first with sugrar, then with bauxite, then with gold, yet our country remains poor” says Jared Kissoon, an agribusiness entrepreneur. “People are sceptical about how politicians will manage the money and whether that the oil wealth with filter down to where it is needed.”International experts share the concern that the country could succumb to the resource curse, whereby immense natural resource riches leads to worse economic and developmental outcomes.Its neighbour to the west, Venezuela, has seen economic collapse and the establishment of authoritarian rule despite sitting on top of the world’s largest oil reserves.“We are already seeing the effects of the resource curse in Guyana,” says Marla Dukharan, a Trinidadian economist with a regional focus. “There is serious – and wide – institutional weakness, a lack of transparency and rising levels of corruption.”The government has made positive steps, she concedes, through the establishment of a sovereign wealth fund aimed at saving and invested oil funds for benefit future generations and the development of a national development strategy focused on green growth and investing in human capital.Winston Jordan, the finance minister, says that of the $300 million the government expects to earn from ExxonMobil’s oil production in 2020, roughly half will be saved in the fund and half made available for spending.“This is not a slush fund, we have strict rules on what can be drawn down by the government,” he says. “Oil has been a saviour for the economy.”Guyanese politics are already balanced on the tiniest margins. In 2015 the People’s National Congress party (PNC), which draws its support from Afro-Guyanese voters  – in coalition with a smaller party – won 33 of the country’s 65 national assembly seats but, following the defection of one its members, it subsequently lost a no confidence vote in December 2018.That should have led to a general election within 90 days but a protracted legal debate pushed the date back until 2020, to the frustration of many voters.The opposition People’s Progressive Party (PPP) – and its East Indian base – are emboldened, but the emergence of a new party with indigenous rights at the centre of its campaign strategy, has created the prospect of a hung parliament with the new party as potential kingmakers.“The traditional parties use indigenous votes to get into office and then marginalize the very same people,” says Lenox Shuman, a former toshao and presidential candidate for the newly-formed Liberty \u0026amp Justice Party (LJP).“They delay the awarding of indigenous land rights, give timber and mining licenses to their political allies and do nothing to prevent the daily incursion of hunters who slaughter animals and destroy livelihoods.” The LJIP have a real chance of winning a handful of seats in indigenous majority regions, according to Denis Chabol, a journalist and political commentator.Mr Shuman – who renounced his dual Canadian citizenship in order to run for office – has refused the overtures of both main parties to enter into coalition but says if his party win seats in parliament he will propose legislation allowing for the establishment of post-election coalitions, potentially putting his party in the position of kingmakers.Then the LJP will target the oil industry, with Mr Shuman promising to table legislature to renegotiate oil contracts, which many Guyanese believe are overly generous to foreign companies.A report by Global Witness released this week alleges that ExxonMobil’s “exploitative deal” in Guyana has deprived the country and its citizens of up to $55 billion. The government and Exxon deny the claims.“It is very difficult to see how the oil revenues will be governed with integrity and integrity and in the best interest of the people,” Mr Shuman says. “The international oil companies have conspired with the politicians to undermine the sovereignty of Guyana.”Guyana’s government “views the report as a cunning and calculated attack on a sovereign state with a duly elected government mere weeks before an election.”“We have complied with applicable laws at each step of the exploration, appraisal and development stages, anything to the contrary is baseless and without merit,”  Exxon said in an email to Bloomberg.In Georgetown, Julian McEwan, wipes down the long wooden bar of his guesthouse, a popular watering hole for PNC members. With demand for accommodation surging, he is about to add another floor of rooms upstairs.A close vote and a legal challenge from the losing party could lead to a period of limbo and slowed investment. “In Guyana the races live in harmony,” he says with a pause, “until election time.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pressure health chiefs british virus super spreader","story":"Health officials are under pressure to release details of the movements of a British coronavirus “super spreader” - amid fears the virus is far more contagious than was thought.The unnamed businessman, who contracted the virus in Singapore, is now known to have infected at least seven fellow Britons in a French ski resort, before returning home to Brighton, falling ill some some five days later.Those he infected include the fourth person to have contracted the disease in the UK and patients in Spain and France, all of whom were believed to have been with the \u0027super spreader\u0027 in France.But health authorities have refused to provide any details of the man’s movements during the five days he spent in the UK before showing symptoms - all that is known is that he spent two hours in a local pub the night before finally succumbing to the illness.On Sunday, it emerged that the man travelled back by Easyjet from Geneva to Gatwick on the 6.50pm flight on January 28th. The budget airline said it was notified by PHE on the evening of Thursday 6th. PHE said all passengers sitting near the man had been contacted and given advice. In a statement, Easyjet said it had been notified by the public health authority that a customer who had recently travelled on one of its flights has since been diagnosed with the Coronavirus.Public Health England is contacting all customers on the flight which was flight EZS8481 from Geneva to London Gatwick on 28 January, to provide guidance in line with procedures.  As the customer was not experiencing any symptoms, the risk to others on board the flight is very low.We remain in contact with the public health authorities and are following their guidance. The health and wellbeing of our passengers and crew is the airline’s highest priority. All of the crew who operated have been advised to monitor themselves for a 14 day period since the flight in line with Public Health England advice. Note this happened 12 days ago and none are displaying any symptoms.”On Sunday night scientists warned that medics may be “flying blind” in the war on coronavirus, amid growing evidence that it could be passed on long before symptoms show.Their warnings came as Public Health England (PHE) came under increasing fire for refusing to provide any information about the whereabouts of the “superspreader” during the period when he was likely to have been infectious.Health officials say they are tracking anyone who was within two metres of him for more than 15 minutes in the two weeks before his diagnosis, including those on the flight with him.They say those who have not been have not been contacted as a close contact, do not need to take any action. But the stance is coming under question, amid concerns that the virus appears to be far more contagious that was first thought.The middle-aged man contracted the virus during a company conference run by Servomex Gas, in Singapore, before flying to the Alps for a four-day break with friends. He is understood to have displayed no symptoms as he spent time in the resort of Contamines-Montjoie in the French Alps, before flying home on January 28. During the short break, he infected seven people, including environmental consultant Bob Saynor, 48, and his nine-year-old son. Two of the cases were only identified on Sunday one after flying back to his home near Palma in Majorca and the other having returned to London.Mrs Saynor\u0027s wife Catriona is now in a UK hospital, though it is not clear if she is the latest case to be diagnosed in Britain.The ski resort at the centre of the outbreak is now in lock-down.It was not until February 2 - five days after his return -  that the businessman fell ill, alerting the NHS which treated him in isolation at Royal Sussex Hospital, before transferring him to London for specialist treatment. He had felt well enough to visit his local pub before succumbing to the illness, spending two hours at The Grenadier in Hove last Saturday evening, February 1.Five members of staff working that night have been told to “self-isolate,” while a student at the nearby Portslade Aldridge Community Academy, who is also understood to have had contact with the man, has been advised to remain in isolation for two weeks. His journey is outlined here:Prof Richard Tedder, Visiting Professor in Medical Virology, Imperial College London, said the fact that the virus might have been passed on by a person without symptoms suggested the outbreak could be worse than SARS, and turn into a pandemic. Given current testing methods, “we are truly flying blind if it is the case that the coronavirus can be transmitted by those without symptoms,” he said. Brighton residents expressed anger at the refusal of the authorities to provide more information. Valerie Painter, a regular patient at the Royal Sussex County Hospital, said: The population of Brighton and Hove is very densely populated. We are living cheek by jowl in tiny streets close together,” she said. “Where has this person been on the buses and trains? What kind of tracing are the authorities doing?A spokesman for PHE said: “We are contacting people who were in close contact with any of the cases that have been confirmed in the UK, to provide them with health advice. We are working closely with the French authorities.PHE said it would not release patient identifiable information, such as a timeline of movements about any inidual who is part of a public health investigation.The new cases came as a second and final plane carrying British citizens evacuated from the Chinese city of Wuhan landed in Oxfordshire.The flight, with more than 200 people on board, including some foreign nationals, arrived at RAF Brize Norton shortly before 7.30am on Sunday, taking evacuees to a conference centre in Milton Keynes. The death toll in China from the virus now stands at 904, surpassing the number of Sars fatalities in 2002-2003.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/02/06/14/beetroot-leaf-dhal-cooking-indyeats.jpg","title":"garden sustainable space how to build tips tricks climate 20 pledges","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.This year, Chris Riotta is growing his own fruit and vegetables – in the middle of New York CityWhether you’re working with a few feet of space in a community vegetable patch, or have 65 acres of luscious foliage on a sprawling estate (looking at you, Oprah Winfrey), the first step to building a sustainable garden is mapping out a vision of your intentions.Each year before planting my own vegetable patch, I draw out an image of the garden I hope to build, indicating where each plant should go based on available sunlight and shading.\u0026nbspI’m currently planning to build the largest garden I’ve ever grown, while working to harvest one-third of my annual vegetable consumption directly from my backyard, as part of my mission for The Independent’s 20\u0026nbspPledges\u0026nbspfor 2020 initiative. While mapping out the garden, I put together a few tips and tricks to help get you started on your own sustainable vegetable patch.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesPlan out where to place your\u0026nbspplantsRoot to fruit: How to join the ethical food revolutionI like to plant crops that grow on vines (think: cucumbers and cherry tomatoes) in small groups, as close to a fence as possible so they scale upwards, while giving other plants that will likely grow much larger a separate space off to the side. That way, I can still walk by and tend to the crops growing up the fence, no matter how big the other plants off to the side eventually grow.\u0026nbspThis also works with smaller plots of soil like community garden space: keep clusters of similar plants in the same tight groups, and don’t worry so much about spacing. With some proper TLC, plants usually find their way around each other in the dirt.\u0026nbspSeeds can always begin growing indoors ahead of the season around the time you lay out your soil, which will provide you with plenty of time to start growing your crops in a stable environment. Some farmers will recommend you transport these seeds to your garden based on the location of the moon, but since I don’t have time for all that, I simply give the soil a good rinse of water for a week before transporting or planting anything in my garden.Study your plotBefore stepping into that dirt, it’s important to study your space and gain an understanding of how many hours of sunlight you’re working with and what kind of plants grow well in the region. Most will require about eight hours of sun, but if you’re in a shaded area and can only get six, that should still work, as many plants favour partial shade and only require about four hours of direct sunlight.\u0026nbspGetting a head start on laying out the groundwork for your garden will help it produce sustainable harvests that last throughout the summer months – and then some. You can look up the last frost date in your region here.\u0026nbspI tend to lay out my organic soil exactly where I plant to grow my garden about six weeks before this date.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Back to our roots: Warming winter vegetables recipes Show all 2Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Maximise your spaceIt’s also just as important to consider ways to maximise the space while gardening. Vertical garden walls can be purchased or made easily in DIY projects, allowing plants to grow above each other rather than spread out over a small space.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Most crops only need a few inches of space for their roots to grow: things like peppers, tomatoes, broccoli and kale can all grow much closer together than most people think. I tend to believe that crops grow better when they’re in close, clustered mixes of similar plants, but that’s just my unprofessional semi-gardening enthusiast opinion.Transplant the seeds to your garden once its warm enough for them to survive in an outdoor climate, but only when the seeds are busting out of their trays or starter pots. The seeds should look vibrant and almost too big for their trays by the time they are brought to the garden for planting.\u0026nbspI tend to believe the first moments catering to a garden and each inidual plant are some of the most important in a life cycle the only way a garden will produce healthy crops is with tender love and care during its birth. These moments of transporting, growing the seeds, placing them into the ground and giving them nutrients and fresh water throughout the process are all vital to the longevity of a harvest.\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Ciaran Hinds as Steppenwolf (Justice League)We were so distracted by the bad jokes and Henry Cavill’s computer generated upper lip that it’s easy to forget that the Justice League faced off against a horned CGI muscle man voiced by Ciaran Hinds. So bad it effectively got everyone but Gal Gadot dumped from the franchise. (AW)234 33. Mark Pillow as Nuclear Man (Superman IV: The Quest for Peace)Presumably hired because fellow “foreign, unconvincing muscle-man” Dolph Lundgren wasn’t available, Mark Pillow made for one of the worst DC movie villains. To be fair to him, Superman IV: The Quest for Peace is a famously abysmal film, but his Nuclear Man – a villain so blandly nefarious even his name feels like it came about via 30 seconds of brainstorming – doesn’t help matters. (AW)334 32. Cara Delevingne as EnchantressJune Moone (Suicide Squad)It’s not been plain sailing swapping the catwalk for the big screen for this aristocratic supermodel-turned-actor, specifically with her role in this puerile comic book film. She plays June Moone, an archeological boffin transformed into a bikini-clad witch by some haunted dust. The film got devastatingly bad reviews, despite doing well at the box office. It may well be a performance Delevingne would like to forget. (CC)434 31. David Thewlis as Ares (Wonder Woman)The one area of Wonder Woman we don’t like to talk about is its villain, as his appearance in the film’s final act turns a smart and funny movie into one just like all the others – namely with two superpowered beings throwing things at each other. (AW)534 30. Patrick Wilson as Ocean Master (Aquaman)It was always going to be tricky to make much of an impression in a movie in which Amber Heard, sporting an enormous red wig, catapults her way into underwater battle riding a dolphin. Which might explain why Patrick Wilson, playing Aquaman’s dastardly half-brother Orm, has fallen so rapidly out of memory. (AW)634 29. Faye Dunaway as Selena (Supergirl)The doomed Supergirl movie is a living testament to how badly Mommie Dearest impacted the career of Faye Dunaway, with her turn as a witchy supervillain with a dangerous love spell at her disposal secretly the nadir of her Eighties career. She may nail a certain level of camp here, whether deliberate or not, but Dunaway is certainly no good – it’s no surprise she was awarded a Razzie for her performance. (AW)734 28. Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor (Superman Returns)A big gulp in 2019 for obvious reasons, but also pretty regretful because it\u0027s an incredibly dull performance from an actor who was, whether we like to admit it or not, masterful at playing villains in his prime. Here, however, Spacey is just a snooze. (AW)834 27. Yahya Abdul-Mahteen III as Black Manta (Aquaman)About as threatening as a Power Rangers villain and just as stupid-looking, Aquaman\u0027s recurring nemesis is more a perpetual irritant than someone particularly enjoyable to watch. (AW)934 26. Liam Neeson as Ra\u0027s al Ghul (Batman Begins)Ra\u0027s al Ghul, or The Demon\u0027s Head in Arabic, jumped on the climate activism bandwagon nice and early. For him, the human race is a cancer poisoning the Earth, and he wants to eliminate people to save the world from environmental disaster. Neeson played the villain so well because he really believed in him. “It was quite a good argument he comes up with,” the actor said. Terrifying. (EH)1034 25. Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr Freeze (Batman \u0026amp Robin)Arnold Schwarzenegger wasn\u0027t so much playing Mr Freeze in Batman \u0026amp Robin as he was The Pun King, few surviving his merciless deployment of woeful gags. Schwarzenegger is by no means good here, but he\u0027s absolutely captivating nonetheless. (AW)1134 24. Sharon Stone as Laurel Hedare (Catwoman)Only one of the worst DC villains because her evil plot was to poison Gotham City via killer face cream, Laurel Hedare at least allowed Sharon Stone to be devious, slinky and cartoonish for the first time since Basic Instinct. It\u0027s a very minor victory, though. (AW)1234 23. Jared Leto as Joker (Suicide Squad)It would be easy to pity Jared Leto, who was always going to be compared to the late Heath Ledger’s transcendent portrayal of the Joker in Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight, if it weren’t for how much hype he built up before Suicide Squad was even released. There were the tattoos, his green hair, a shiny grill in his mouth, and a ludicrous number of articles about his supposed bad behaviour on set. So it was downright embarrassing when it turned out Joker wasn’t even the lead villain in the movie, and instead just an annoyance who turns up to mock the lead cast every now and then. (RO)1334 22. Marion Cotillard as Miranda Tate (The Dark Knight Rises)Although many will purely remember Cotillard’s performance in The Dark Knight Rises for that awfully awkward death scene, she was great in the rest of the movie. She played one of Batman’s most interesting female adversaries with a slyness and a deception that was mysteriously alluring and effective. (EH)1434 21. Michael Shannon as General Zod (Man of Steel)The kind of role Shannon could play in his sleep, his General Zod is more angsty and human than his live-action predecessors playing the same character, but harmed by the relentlessly dank surroundings of Zack Snyder’s film. He’s also saddled with the most unflattering haircut in all of DC movie history, which couldn’t have helped. (AW)1534 20. Tom Hardy as Bane (The Dark Knight Rises)1634 19. Burgess Meredith as The Penguin (Batman 1966)Entirely unsubtle work from Meredith here, the actor grinding his teeth and chewing on the end of a large, thin cigarette to emphasise the Penguin’s dastardly villainy. But it’s a lot of fun to behold nonetheless. (AW)1734 18. Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor (Superman)The Oscar-winning actor was easily the most fun incarnation of Lex Luthor when he was cast in the 1978 Superman. As the hero’s arch nemesis, his light-hearted and theatrical portrayal came across as more comical than menacing. But despite the fact it was hard to take him as a serious threat, he was still a compelling villain to watch. He reprised the role in Superman II and Superman IV: The Quest for Peace. (CC)1834 17. Parker Posey as Kitty Kowalski (Superman Returns)One of the few bright spots in an otherwise drab and rapidly forgotten Superman reboot, Parker Posey very much plays to type here. But it\u0027s such a delicious, mischievous performance, all eccentricity and barely-concealed madness, that it\u0027s not remotely a problem. (AW)1934 16. Joaquin Phoenix as Joker (Joker)The role that, for better and for worse, Phoenix was born to play, his Joker is disturbing and brilliantly oddball. But it’s a performance that is also suffocating by nature of how present it is. Without any respite, in the form of a Christian Bale or a Michael Keaton, it ends up feeling a lot like Phoenix swallowing you whole, and that’s not the best of experiences. (AW)2034 15. Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle (The Dark Knight Rises)Catwoman – the thieving, on-again, off-again love interest of Batman – was brought to life brilliantly by Anne Hathaway who deftly encapsulated her slinky, feline energy and gave an emotionally nuanced performance which offered a fresh perspective on the character after Michelle Pfeiffer’s turn in the Nineties. (EH)2134 14. Lee Meriwether as Catwoman (Batman 1966)The actor, who is now 84, is unforgettable in her portrayal of Catwoman in the 1966 film. Using feline movements when she walks, she winds up with one of the best scenes in any Batman: when disguised as a Soviet reporter called Miss Kitka, complete with Sixties Beehive hair, she seduces Adam West’s Caped Crusader so she can abduct him. They have a very passionate kiss, but when he figures out she is Catwoman, he is heartbroken. (CC)2234 13. Cesar Romero as Joker (Batman 1966)It may be an unpopular opinion, but Cesar Romero always had the best Joker laugh – a shrill, gleeful racket of purely mad joy. He’s also one of the few actors to play the character without a heap of exhausting off-screen intensity, too. With his white makeup merely painted over his moustache because Romero couldn’t be bothered to shave it off, there’s a blissful, unique ease to his work in the original Batman movie. (AW)2334 12. Uma Thurman as Poison Ivy (Batman \u0026amp Robin)Batman \u0026amp Robin may feature a vast ensemble of stars all acting in very different films, but Uma Thurman is the only one truly in keeping with the gaudy, camp vision that director Joel Schumacher (probably?) had in mind for it. Her Poison Ivy is basically a ludicrous, plant-groping drag queen dressed occasionally in a gorilla suit, and playing up the absurdity is arguably the smartest acting choice in the whole damn film. (AW)2434 11. Jim Carrey as The Riddler (Batman Forever)Released at the peak of Carrey’s Nineties fame, Batman Forever didn’t cast Carrey because he would be perfect for The Riddler, but because they wanted Jim Carrey – squirming, scenery-chewing, face-contorting and all. It ends up falling somewhere between genuinely brilliant and mildly awful, but on occasion becomes actually chilling. (AW)2534 10. Frank Gorshin as The Riddler (Batman 1966)Gorshin’s work on the original Sixties Batman series, and its 1966 film, has always been underappreciated. It’s partly due to The Riddler himself, a character notorious in Batman’s rogues gallery of villains, but always one that has struggled to be well portrayed on-screen. But Gorshin tried his best, morphing his Riddler into a sinister genius with a maniacal laugh and a fearsome, intimidating intelligence. (AW)2634 9. Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face (Batman Forever)“I will not sanction your buffoonery,” Jones reportedly told his co-star Jim Carrey on the Batman Forever set. One of the most notorious examples of Jones\u0027s famed workplace grouchiness, his unhappiness working on the film at least wasn\u0027t visible on screen. He\u0027s fantastic here, all mad cackling and hysterical showboating. (AW)2734 8. Cillian Murphy as Scarecrow (Batman Begins)Cillian Murphy didn’t get the screentime he needed – or deserved – to really develop what could have been one of DC’s most intriguing villains: a corrupt psychopharmacologist testing his wares on the inmates at Arkham Asylum. What works is his understated manner and appearance Scarecrow didn’t need an outlandish costume because the terror he instilled was all in your head. (RO)2834 7. Christopher Walken as Max Schreck (Batman Returns)The true villain of Batman Returns, the tragic humanity of Catwoman and The Penguin entirely lacking in Schreck\u0027s capitalist, salacious and pro-gentrification business mogul. It\u0027s no surprise there have been Trump comparisons in the years since. But it\u0027s also important to not forget quite how brilliant Walken is in the role, too. (AW)2934 6. Aaron Eckhart as Two-Face (The Dark Knight)Less spoken about by nature of the stunning work by Heath Ledger elsewhere in The Dark Knight, Aaron Eckhart is also the film\u0027s secret weapon. His Harvey Dent is noble and well-intentioned and dripping with vaguely Kennedy-esque suave, which only makes his eventual transformation into Two-Face that much more tragic. (AW)3034 5. Danny DeVito as The Penguin (Batman Returns)3134 4. Terence Stamp as General Zod (Superman II)A villain played with delicious apathy and verve by Terence Stamp, General Zod is far and away the finest nemesis Christopher Reeve’s Superman ever had to face off against. Ruthless, menacing and dressed like the coolest cat on the Studio 54 dancefloor, he’s a blast. (AW)3234 3. Jack Nicholson as The Joker (Batman)The only thing lacking from Jack Nicholson’s Joker is an element of surprise. Even in 1989, there was something admittedly tried-and-tested about Nicholson playing insanity with such ripe conviction on screen. But regardless, his work here is terrifying – not quite Jack Torrance levels, but equally as captivating. It’s no wonder he got top billing over the guy who actually played Batman. (AW)3334 2. Heath Ledger as The Joker (The Dark Knight)The best of the best: Heath Ledger transformed himself completely and made the role his own opposite Christian Bale’s Batman in The Dark Knight. His performance was so outstanding that he has become the gold standard to which all other actors aspire when they take on a villainous role. It’s hard to believe there will ever be a better Joker. (RO)3434 1. Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman (Batman Returns)The mystery over Catwoman\u0027s moral allegiances has been alive almost as long as she has in comic book lore, but it also makes her the most captivating sort-of nemesis in all of the DC movies. Michelle Pfeiffer is a sensual, terrifying and incredibly funny presence throughout Batman Returns, her irresistible allure making her the most threatening inidual Batman has ever faced off against. She also gives one of the greatest performances not only in comic book movies but in all movies entirely, to whom all her successors, Catwoman or not, can\u0027t help but pail in comparison. (AW)134 34. Ciaran Hinds as Steppenwolf (Justice League)We were so distracted by the bad jokes and Henry Cavill’s computer generated upper lip that it’s easy to forget that the Justice League faced off against a horned CGI muscle man voiced by Ciaran Hinds. So bad it effectively got everyone but Gal Gadot dumped from the franchise. (AW)234 33. Mark Pillow as Nuclear Man (Superman IV: The Quest for Peace)Presumably hired because fellow “foreign, unconvincing muscle-man” Dolph Lundgren wasn’t available, Mark Pillow made for one of the worst DC movie villains. To be fair to him, Superman IV: The Quest for Peace is a famously abysmal film, but his Nuclear Man – a villain so blandly nefarious even his name feels like it came about via 30 seconds of brainstorming – doesn’t help matters. (AW)334 32. Cara Delevingne as EnchantressJune Moone (Suicide Squad)It’s not been plain sailing swapping the catwalk for the big screen for this aristocratic supermodel-turned-actor, specifically with her role in this puerile comic book film. She plays June Moone, an archeological boffin transformed into a bikini-clad witch by some haunted dust. The film got devastatingly bad reviews, despite doing well at the box office. It may well be a performance Delevingne would like to forget. (CC)434 31. David Thewlis as Ares (Wonder Woman)The one area of Wonder Woman we don’t like to talk about is its villain, as his appearance in the film’s final act turns a smart and funny movie into one just like all the others – namely with two superpowered beings throwing things at each other. (AW)534 30. Patrick Wilson as Ocean Master (Aquaman)It was always going to be tricky to make much of an impression in a movie in which Amber Heard, sporting an enormous red wig, catapults her way into underwater battle riding a dolphin. Which might explain why Patrick Wilson, playing Aquaman’s dastardly half-brother Orm, has fallen so rapidly out of memory. (AW)634 29. Faye Dunaway as Selena (Supergirl)The doomed Supergirl movie is a living testament to how badly Mommie Dearest impacted the career of Faye Dunaway, with her turn as a witchy supervillain with a dangerous love spell at her disposal secretly the nadir of her Eighties career. She may nail a certain level of camp here, whether deliberate or not, but Dunaway is certainly no good – it’s no surprise she was awarded a Razzie for her performance. (AW)734 28. Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor (Superman Returns)A big gulp in 2019 for obvious reasons, but also pretty regretful because it\u0027s an incredibly dull performance from an actor who was, whether we like to admit it or not, masterful at playing villains in his prime. Here, however, Spacey is just a snooze. (AW)834 27. Yahya Abdul-Mahteen III as Black Manta (Aquaman)About as threatening as a Power Rangers villain and just as stupid-looking, Aquaman\u0027s recurring nemesis is more a perpetual irritant than someone particularly enjoyable to watch. (AW)934 26. Liam Neeson as Ra\u0027s al Ghul (Batman Begins)Ra\u0027s al Ghul, or The Demon\u0027s Head in Arabic, jumped on the climate activism bandwagon nice and early. For him, the human race is a cancer poisoning the Earth, and he wants to eliminate people to save the world from environmental disaster. Neeson played the villain so well because he really believed in him. “It was quite a good argument he comes up with,” the actor said. Terrifying. (EH)1034 25. Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr Freeze (Batman \u0026amp Robin)Arnold Schwarzenegger wasn\u0027t so much playing Mr Freeze in Batman \u0026amp Robin as he was The Pun King, few surviving his merciless deployment of woeful gags. Schwarzenegger is by no means good here, but he\u0027s absolutely captivating nonetheless. (AW)1134 24. Sharon Stone as Laurel Hedare (Catwoman)Only one of the worst DC villains because her evil plot was to poison Gotham City via killer face cream, Laurel Hedare at least allowed Sharon Stone to be devious, slinky and cartoonish for the first time since Basic Instinct. It\u0027s a very minor victory, though. (AW)1234 23. Jared Leto as Joker (Suicide Squad)It would be easy to pity Jared Leto, who was always going to be compared to the late Heath Ledger’s transcendent portrayal of the Joker in Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight, if it weren’t for how much hype he built up before Suicide Squad was even released. There were the tattoos, his green hair, a shiny grill in his mouth, and a ludicrous number of articles about his supposed bad behaviour on set. So it was downright embarrassing when it turned out Joker wasn’t even the lead villain in the movie, and instead just an annoyance who turns up to mock the lead cast every now and then. (RO)1334 22. Marion Cotillard as Miranda Tate (The Dark Knight Rises)Although many will purely remember Cotillard’s performance in The Dark Knight Rises for that awfully awkward death scene, she was great in the rest of the movie. She played one of Batman’s most interesting female adversaries with a slyness and a deception that was mysteriously alluring and effective. (EH)1434 21. Michael Shannon as General Zod (Man of Steel)The kind of role Shannon could play in his sleep, his General Zod is more angsty and human than his live-action predecessors playing the same character, but harmed by the relentlessly dank surroundings of Zack Snyder’s film. He’s also saddled with the most unflattering haircut in all of DC movie history, which couldn’t have helped. (AW)1534 20. Tom Hardy as Bane (The Dark Knight Rises)1634 19. Burgess Meredith as The Penguin (Batman 1966)Entirely unsubtle work from Meredith here, the actor grinding his teeth and chewing on the end of a large, thin cigarette to emphasise the Penguin’s dastardly villainy. But it’s a lot of fun to behold nonetheless. (AW)1734 18. Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor (Superman)The Oscar-winning actor was easily the most fun incarnation of Lex Luthor when he was cast in the 1978 Superman.

(AW)Prior to this Margo Robbie appeared as Harley Quinn in Suicide Squad, a film which had a record-breaking $133.6m ($103.6m) opening.\u0026nbspIt’s possible the film’s R-rating held back younger female audiences from being able to enjoy the film.\u0026nbspThe Birds of Prey comic writer Gail Simone has criticised the film’s depiction of the character of Cassandra Cain. While in the original comics, Cass struggles with speech, reading and socialisation, this aspect of her character was largely missing from the film. Simone detailed in a Twitter thread that she sees this as a “missed opportunity”, adding “I love Cass dearly, and this is not a Cass I recognize.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They were to be the last pieces of the lunar surface to come back to Earth, since humanity has not been back in the nearly 50 years since.That means that those remaining samples are especially precious since they are limited and can not be easily replaced. They can also be profoundly illuminating, offering us our only chance to get close to rock taken from a whole separate world.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

It\u0027s the first time a lunar sample has been studied like this. We\u0027re using a technique many geologists haven\u0027t even heard of.Scientists to make air out of lunar dust amid plans to live on MoonAs researchers make use of the new technique, they expect to find a vast set of new information about the lunar surface.We can apply this technique to samples no one has studied, Philipp Heck, a curator at the Field Museum, associate professor at the University of Chicago, and co-author of the paper, adds. You\u0027re almost guaranteed to find something new or unexpected.This technique has such high sensitivity and resolution, you find things you wouldn\u0027t find otherwise and only use up a small bit of the sample.The technique is called atom probe tomography, and involves incredibly precise manipulation of inidual grains. It has previously been used in industrial processes – but the new breakthrough has come in turning it for the first time to lunar samples.It works something like nanocarpentry, said Professor Heck: like a carpenter shapes wood, we do it at the nanoscale to minerals.The sample is placed inside a special probe and then shot with a laser that knocks off inidual atoms, which then fall onto a special plate. Researchers can examine those elements by timing how long they take to hit the detector – since heavier ones take longer – and so the type of atom can be worked out.It has already helped researchers see the weathering and materials that can be found inside the lunar soil. That in turn could help future astronauts as they move to live on the Moon, since they could survive by taking resources out of that dust.The researchers now hope they can get hold of samples from elsewhere on the Moon, and elsewhere in space, to allow them to better understand the makeup of the worlds that surround us. They compare our current understanding to analysing Earth using only one mountain range – to get a fuller grasp, they will need to examine a variety of terrains across the solar system.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Down the block, the line snaked around the corner, then around yet another corner.The turnout was a testament to the newfound celebrity of the candidate, a former mayor of a mid-sized city in Indiana who, just a year ago, virtually nobody in America even knew existed.But they certainly know him now. Just at the start of the 2020 primary process, Mayor Pete –\u0026nbspas many like to call him, due to his tongue twister of a last name –\u0026nbsphas shown that in American politics, no candidate is inevitable.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesInstead, a 38-year-old newcomer to national politics can seemingly topple the candidate folks thought was unstoppable, and head into the nation\u0027s first primary as a front-runner and candidate just about everyone is talking about. That quick rise in political fortunes does not seem lost on him.I know how seriously voters here in New Hampshire take that responsibility, that influence, that thumb on the scale that you\u0027ve got, Mr Buttigieg told the crowd on Sunday. In the New Hampshire tradition that had a lot of you in the summer and the fall coming to my events and hearing me out and at the end saying, \u0027You know, that was pretty good. I think you\u0027re in my top seven now.\u0027\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Democratic candidates compete on the campaign trail: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A man holds up a sign criticising billionaires in the presidential race in front of Michael Bloomberg in Compton, Califronia.

From left to right: Billionaire-philanthropist Tom Steyer, Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren, former vice president Joe Biden, Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, mayor of South Bend, Indiana, Pete Buttigieg and Minnesota senator Amy KlobucharMr Buttigieg heads into the Tuesday primary on the heels of a strong performance in Iowa, when voters came together last week for the bizarre spectacle that is the state\u0027s caucuses.While the reported results from that contest have been criticised for inconsistencies and muddled reporting that took days before a full account was released publicly, Mr Buttigieg\u0027s status as a front-runner out of the state alongside Vermont senator Bernie Sanders is uncontestable – even if he was criticised for seeming to claim victory far too early.The former midwestern mayor now finds himself ahead of the former vice president, Joe Biden, who once seemed like the obvious choice for moderate Democrats seeking to find a candidate with a vision that can win a Democratic nomination in a cycle marked for a surging progressive sentiment, while avoiding the kinds of policies and labels like socialist that some view as a liability for Mr Sanders should he face off against Donald Trump.\u0026nbspI\u0027m 98 per cent sure that I\u0027m voting for Pete at this point, said Mary Rioux, 42, of Manchester.\u0026nbspMs Rioux said she made her decision just after the CNN town hall late last week. Still, she said she also likes Amy Klobuchar quite a bit.Biden escalates attack on Buttigieg before tepid performance in NHMr Buttigieg still faces several notable obstacles on his path to the Democratic nomination. At 38, he\u0026nbspis the youngest candidate in the field, a potential liability that is underscored by the fact that his highest elected office sits several rungs down from some of his most prominent opponents.On Sunday, Mr Buttigieg was introduced by Nashua\u0027s mayor and himself recognised that fact, but cast his distance from Washington as a political strength in spite of the brutal attack ads placed by Mr Biden, mockingly comparing his experience as vice-president with the kind of decisions Mayor Pete made in South Bend, like whether to put colourful lights underneath a bridge or whether to change pet chip regulations.I\u0027m so glad to have the support of a fellow mayor at a time like this. Remember, mayors have to get things done. You\u0027re never gonna hear of a city government shutting down because two parties don\u0027t agree. We just have to make sure that the water keeps flowing through your taps so we figure it out, Mr Buttigieg said.We need to make Washington look like our best run cities and towns, instead of the other way around, he said.Why the man who sank Biden\u0027s chances in 1987 would vote for him nowStill, Jamie Bourgeouis, a 43-year-old Nashua voter, said that Mr Buttigieg seems like a sensible choice\u0026nbspheading into 2020. She said he\u0027s not quite as progressive as she might like, but that he might do the trick.I don\u0027t know who I\u0027m voting for yet, but I like Pete, she said. I\u0027m torn on who to vote for. I want someone who can beat Trump. So, I\u0027ll probably go for someone who\u0027s a bit away from my personal politics.Days before the primary, Mr Buttigieg trails Mr Sanders in aggregates of polls, with 21.3 per cent support in the state compared to the Vermont senator\u0027s 26.1 per cent. Eight points below that is Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator who came in third place in Iowa and is seeking a strong showing in New Hampshire, where she has focused a considerable ground game.And so, before he can begin counting his chickens, Mr Buttigieg must prove himself in the Granite State, where voters like to tout their sense of independence, and many say they don\u0027t really care what Iowa had to say about the candidates –\u0026nbspthey want folks like Mr Buttigieg to prove they\u0027re the right choice again.I\u0027m just here evaluating, Carl Dubois, a 48-year-old voter from Hudson, New Hampshire, said outside of the event. He said he planned on seeing Mr Biden and Amy Klobuchar before making a final decision. I wasn\u0027t really paying attention to the Iowa caucuses. I don\u0027t really engage until New Hampshire.When will he decide? Last minute, right when I walk into the polls.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Responding in a way that in 2020 seems remarkably Trumpian –\u0026nbsp“I think I probably have a much higher IQ than you do, I suspect” – Biden put one of the last nails in the coffin for his campaign, and dropped out of the race shortly after.But, some 33 years later, Fahey says\u0026nbspthat he is ready to vote for Biden during his third race. If anything, the mere fact that Biden was on the campaign trail so long ago when someone like Pete Buttigieg was kindergarten-age underscores an experience Fahey values deeply: “I think he has had so much experience between his 36 years in the Senate and eight years as Obama’s vice president.Created with Sketch.Democratic candidates compete on the campaign trail: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A man holds up a sign criticising billionaires in the presidential race in front of Michael Bloomberg in Compton, Califronia.

From left to right: Billionaire-philanthropist Tom Steyer, Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren, former vice president Joe Biden, Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, mayor of South Bend, Indiana, Pete Buttigieg and Minnesota senator Amy KlobucharAfter four years with Donald Trump as president, undermining international alliances, Fahey thinks the next president needs to know what he or she is doing from\u0026nbspday one: “I think Biden can hit the ground running. I think he knows the people to get a good team of advisers around him, so I think he could make an outstanding president.”With just two days until the New Hampshire primary, all signs point towards a disappointing third run for Biden, even as he has insisted that he could lose in both of the first two states in the primary season –\u0026nbsphe came in fourth place in the Iowa caucuses last week –\u0026nbspand still mount a comeback in Nevada and South Carolina.Biden escalates attack on Buttigieg before tepid performance in NHIn New Hampshire,\u0026nbspBiden has been campaigning around the state, but doing his best to manage expectations as enthusiasm has seemed to shift away from him and towards candidates like Pete Buttigieg, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar.On Friday night, early in the final debate in Manchester before voters head to the polls in the Granite State, Biden all but conceded defeat early. “I took a hit in Iowa”, he acknowledged, “and I’ll probably take it here”.It was a statement that was realistic, given the polls. According to Real Clear Politics, Biden has seen his polling tank, and currently sits in third place behind Sanders and Buttigieg. He’s just a tad ahead of Warren in aggregates of Granite State polls, though her numbers have shown much less volatility as the former vice president has cratered.Fahey didn’t seem to mind that Biden’s polls might not look so great. But\u0026nbsphe was offended by the concession, just days before the primary,\u0026nbspas volunteers across the state would have been gearing up to head out into 10F\u0026nbsp(-12C) weather to knock on doors for him, or spend their weekend making calls trying to boost his support.“I know for a fact having talked to some today that it’s discouraging to hear him say something like that with his supporters still out there working hard on the phone and knocking on doors as they are,” he says.On Saturday night, just a day after the debates, those volunteers and supporters didn’t seem to show up to support the vice president, either. At the Mcintyre-Shaheen 100 Club fundraiser in Manchester, Biden’s section of the SNHU arena was dwarfed by those of Warren, Klobuchar, Sanders and Buttigieg.Created with Sketch.Democratic candidates compete on the campaign trail: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A man holds up a sign criticising billionaires in the presidential race in front of Michael Bloomberg in Compton, Califronia.

Instead, Biden gave what has become a somewhat regular campaign speech. He asked aloud how there could be the poverty he said he saw that morning at a food drive in Manchester. He promised to restore the US to its former dignity. The crowd largely sat silent.When pressed, Fahey acknowledges he is “not 100 per cent” sure that Biden can win the nomination, or the election. He says\u0026nbsphe has never harboured a grudge against Biden for the 1987 outburst, and was actually planning on voting for him if he had the chance all those years ago.

There is often hope where we may first see ­dficulty. You just have to look a bit harder sometimes.In Portpatrick, at Scotland’s bottom left corner, the harbour had fallen into miserable disrepair. A plan was hatched to stop the rot.A local hero organised a share issue for locals to raise the money to buy the harbour and restore the buildings around it. The village now has its pecker up again and the future looks bright.It’s a similar story on Anglesey. At Halen Mon a thriving family business draws water out of the Menai Strait, harvests the salt and sells it all over the world.Near there I met a woman called Sian Sykes who cared about those waters so much she paddle-boarded  miles around Anglesey picking out the plastic.Asthat wasn’t enough, she then paddled the whole coast of Wales doing exactly the same.But my favourite character round there is no longer with us. On the very western tip of Holy Island off Anglesey’s west coast, there is the South Stack lighthouse. It’s been saving sailors from watery deaths since .A hundred years ago, John Jones was its keeper and it was his great granddaughter Denise Shaw who took me up to the top of it.Denise showed me a photograph of her great-grandad sporting a magnicent moustache the seagulls must have coveted for their nests.He was no loner, though. Denise remembers her mum saying old great-gramps was a bit of a ladies’ man.And what a chat-up line he had at his disposal: “Do you want to come back to my place to see how bright my light is ”All four of the areas we’ve looked at for this series of Our Coast are around the Irish Sea. I had a brilliant time at Belfast docks where I joined the harbour pilots, whose work astounded me.It’s their job to bring the giant ships safely into port.I sort of assumed they did this by chugging out to meet them, lighting up a sign saying, “follow me” and gently leading them to their berths.Far from it. Round the clock, all year round, whatever the weather, they race out several miles to pull up alongside these huge vessels.Incredibly, a rope ladder is dropped over the side for the pilots to clamber aboard, make their way to the bridge, take over the controls and steer these monsters into tight spaces on the docks.The ship I boarded with them, somewhat terried, was carrying grain from Romania.As my man took the helm I asked the Polish skipper which country had the best harbour pilots. “You do,” he said, with feeling.Back across the Irish Sea, in Formby, north of Liverpool, I met Mike McComb in the £million place he’s built himself a stone’s throw from the sea.He has more bedrooms, bathrooms and children than I could count .His fortune could have bought him a lavish home anywhere in the world. But it was up here, along the endless beach, that back in the day he and his mates would come on their bikes from their tiny homes in Bootle.So, he tells me as we stand on the beach, lashed by rain and wind, you can keep St Tropez or Malibu. This coast, his coast, is where he’ll stay.The sea seems to be a magnet for the most memorable people, from Grace the crane engineer in Belfast Docks who played rugby for Ireland in three rugby world cups, to Sandy the tattooed pagan near Stranraer who says the sea’s our mother, and the Bulgarian dissident I chanced upon sitting in a hot tub ­surveying Liverpool from the deck of the Queen Mary .My grandad used to tell me that when you put your toe in the sea you’re connected with the whole world.With that in mind, I’ve enjoyed many a paddle this summer reflecting on the power and history of what our island nation is all about.And I urge you to do it, too. After all, it’s pretty easy. Britain’s most landlocked place — Coton in the Elms in Derbyshire — is just  miles from the coast. So none of us is more than a couple of hours away from the sea.There’s never been a more relevant time to get out to the edges and see the soul of this country.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But it saddened us all because it felt like this incredible human being would go on for ever.He headed the Douglas dynasty with a zest for le that put the rest of us to shame and was one of our final links to Hollywood’s golden age.Long before actors ostentatiously wore their hearts on their sleeves and made self-aggrandising speeches about the latest trendy cause, Kirk determinedly set out to do the right thing, regardless of any impact on his career.In the Fties, at the height of the Cold War, he stood up to a paranoid US government that considered anyone to the left of Genghis Khan a Soviet sympathiser.The McCarthy witchhunts ruined careers and wrecked lives, but Kirk dug in his heels and hired blacklisted writer Dalton Trumbo to work on Spartacus, which would become Kirk’s most famous movie.That took balls of steel.Kirk gave millions to charity and was a US Goodwill Ambassador, receiving the Presidential Medal of Freedom from Jimmy Carter in .He experienced heartache with the death of his son Eric from an overdose and the jailing of grandson Cameron for drug offences.But even a near-fatal helicopter crash and a stroke couldn’t defeat Kirk.His son Michael — a superstar in his own right, of course — told me last year his dad worked out almost every day with a personal trainer and remained as sharp as a tack, keeping the whole extended family on their toes.I was lucky enough to interview Kirk back in my days with TV-am.The Beeb would fly them over from LA and put them up in a posh hotel.All we could offer was a hearty breakfast, plus the chance to talk about themselves and their new project for as long as they liked.There were no pesky managers and PRs to go through.Bette Davis, Burt Lancaster, Lauren Bacall and Sammy Davis Jnr all popped into our studio at the crack of sparrows, staying for the duration of the show.Kirk was here in , promoting Dance With The Devil, a racy novel that bore a passing resemblance to his extraordinary le story.After his Jewish parents escaped persecution in Russia, Kirk was born and raised in a poor area of New York.It is a real rags-to-riches tale. His dad actually worked as a rag-and-bone man.Kirk never forgot where he came from, which is perhaps why he became a champion for justice and a fairer society.He was a delight that morning and even laughed when the crew declared, “I’m Spartacus”, one after another in his honour — though he must have seen it done hundreds of times before.He was a also a much-loved husband, father, grandfather and great-grandfather.The Douglas clan will be in mourning but they can celebrate a le well lived.This weekend, I am on a Kirk Douglas marathon, starting with Paths Of Glory, before The Bad And The Beautul, Ace In The Hole, The Vikings, Lust For Le and, of course, Spartacus.Tomorrow’s Oscars will rightly honour him. We won’t see his like again.I WAS honoured to host The Millies this week.It is a wonderful event run by The Sun to salute our Armed Forces and give us all a chance to say a huge thank you.As always, there were astonishing stories of bravery, courage and self-sacrice.And as always, our lovely winners told me they were nothing special, just doing their job.I honestly don’t think they realise just how remarkable they are, or how much we owe them.One of my highlights was seeing -year-old Private Fin Doherty collect his award for inspiring others.Fin was just six when his paratrooper big brother JJ was killed in action in Afghanistan.Fin was determined to follow in JJ’s footsteps to honour his brother’s memory, and join the Parachute Regiment.He has been an outstanding addition and, in an emotional ceremony, was presented with JJ’s beret in December.Their mum Joyce admits she struggled with Fin’s decision to sign up, following the death of her eldest son.But she knew it was all Fin wanted – and she is so very proud of him.We honestly don’t deserve such an inspirational young man. But thank the Lord we have him on our side.NOTHING has changed. Phillip Schofield is exactly the same person he was before he felt the time was right to tell the world he’s gay.He’s still a loving father and husband and will still host his TV shows with consummate professionalism and skill.As Phillip said himself, you never know what people are struggling with every day and, for him, it was time to be honest with himself and everyone .I’m really glad that he has made the decision and very proud of him, although obviously it can’t have been easy.There’s been lots of tears, sleepless nights and a great deal of soul-searching. I hope he now finds peace of mind.He is a very lucky man to have a family and friends who love him very much and just want him to be happy.He also has a loyal fan base who love watching him on This Morning and that won’t change. Why would it Of course, he can expect a small number of bigots and homophobes to spew out hateful bile, but they are to be pitied and ignored.Those carping about why he took so long also need to shut up.People should be allowed to come out when it feels the right time for them.Phillip began his career at a time when being openly gay in a TV presenting role was just not an option.Thank goodness things have changed and he can be open now – and know that the overwhelmingly vast majority of us wish him and his family nothing but the very best.I was really touched by what he said about interviewing brave people on This Morning, and realising that he had to be just like them and tell his truth.Love comes in many dferent forms.Phillip and his we Stephanie adore each other and that won’t change. Again, why on earth would it At the end of his statement Phillip urged us all to be kind, especially to his family, and I hope we all take those words on board.Let’s wish them all the best and let them get on with their lives.WHAT a furore over a bare shoulder. Actress-turned-MP Tracy Brabin didn’t deserve the vitriol about her outfit but it WAS distracting.It’s unfortunate because Tracy was making important points about journalists being shut out of No  briefings – a move that makes my blood run cold and threatens Press freedom. Sadly, no one was really listening.Tracy told me she had been at a music event and didn’t expect to be back in the House. She is bemused by all the fuss.How those in public le dress should not detract from their message, be it a female MP in a low-cut top or mini-skirt, or a man wearing a gaudy tie or tight trousers.Our MPs are not known for their style and rarely make headlines for their fashion sense.I am very happy for them to keep it that way.WELL, that was a rather ill-advised memo to send, reminding local councils to fly the Union Flag on February  as a “celebration” of Prince Andrew’s birthday.I had no idea this was a “thing” and that Andrew was on a list of VIPs whose birthdays are marked with a flag waving on the roof of our town halls, instead of just cake and prosecco like the rest of us.Unsurprisingly, this ludicrous edict has caused much disgruntlement.As we know, Andrew has been booted out of The Firm by his own mum after that disastrous TV interview delving into his friendship with the American paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.Then there is the ongoing scandal over whether or not Andrew will be interviewed by the FBI as part of its investigations into child trafficking allegations against Epstein.It is all very sordid and murky. Surely even his nearest and dearest would agree this is not the time for official celebrations.He is no longer a working royal and has no place on that list.Time to lower the flags for good. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Nobody on that ship has tested positive.Meanwhile, the World Health Organizationhas shown that the reported number of new cases has fallen over the past two days, which experts welcomed with caution.There were roughly , new cases reported worldwide on February , , on February  and , on February  - the vast majority in China, WHO figures show.Patients in England with the virus will be transferred to one of four High Consequences Infectious Diseasesunits.These include two in London - the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust and Guys and St Thomas NHS Foundation Trust, where the third victim is understood to have been taken.There are also two in the north of the country - Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen University Hospitals NHS Trust and Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust.Two other patients who tested positive for the virus last week in York are still being treated at the Royal Victoria Infirmary infectious diseases centre in Newcastle.Access to these units is restricted to a team of trained medical staff who are made to wear protective gowns, face maks, visors and gloves before they can enter.In some cases, patients will have a specially-designed tent with a ventilator set up around their bed.But experts warned it is not yet clearthis represents an actual fall in cases or whether the fall will prove sustainable.The Department of Health and Social Care said that  people in the UK have been tested for coronavirus as of pm Friday, with three cases confirmed.It is understood that the third person in the UK to be diagnosed with coronavirus caught the illness in Singapore.He is reported to be a middle-aged British man and is understood to be the first UK national to contract the disease.The man is thought to have been diagnosed in Brighton and was transferred to St Thomas Hospital in London, where there is an infectious disease unit, on Thursday afternoon.Professor Keith Willett, NHS strategic incident director, said the patient had called the NHS  service after becoming concerned.After a telephone assessment, they were advised to make their way to Royal Sussex County Hospital Brighton for testing, he said.Following a pre-arranged plan with the NHS they drove themselves to the hospital, were tested in isolation and away from public areas of the hospital, and ed home in isolation in their own car.Two other patients, who had recently travelled from China, are still being treated at the Royal Victoria Infirmary infectious diseases centre in Newcastle.One is a student at the University of York, while the other is a family member.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But I can’t be sure, as I have other things to think about like: I need some new trousers.Then out of the blue she announced on social media that she was going to speak out because “mine and my families le is no longer up for entertainment or gossip”.“Wow,” I thought. “That’s amazing. She doesn’t know how to use apostrophes.”It turns out, however, that while she can’t write properly, she can at least think straight because she never did speak out. Which means she stopped the story from rearing up again.If only Prince Andrew was as bright. We were all dimly aware that he knew a man in America who’d had lots of sex with young girls.And that one day, this man had been found dead in a police cell. Then we went back to wonderingwe needed more washing-up liquid.Prince Andrew, however, decided that instead of letting the story die down by not saying anything, he’d go on television to set the record straight.It was a disaster. He was suddenly front-page news all over the world and he looked guilty as hell.Of what, we weren’t sure. But whatever it was, we all worked out that as he has a Bentley, he could definitely have got from a Pizza Express restaurant in Woking to the centre of London in less than six hours.A few weeks later, as the story was withering once more, Hank J Dieselburger, an American prosecutor involved in the dead sex-man’s case, announced that the FBI had received “zero co-operation” from Prince Andrew.You’d think Andrew would have learned from his earlier mistake. You’d think he’d do a Flack and say nothing.But no. The very next day, “friends” of the Prince — which is another way of saying “the Prince” — went on the attack, telling reporters he was angry and bewildered. “They haven’t even approached me — I mean him.”The problem is that ego-fed celebrities read every single thing that is written about them. And they believe everyone  is reading everything, as well.We aren’t. We don’t really care. So when you attempt to clear your name, it’s like trying to put out a fire with petrol.It’s better for Andrew, and the whole Royal Family,he takes a leaf from singer Ronan Keating’s book — “You say it best, when you say nothing atThen, perhaps, he could take a leaf from his nephew’s book. And bugger off to Canada.I’M not defending drugs here, but when you see someone giggling their way through a packet of frozen peas and some leftover sherry trle at five in the morning, it’s easy to see why someone might think: “Yes, that cannabis malarkey looks like fun. I shall give it a go.”It’s the same story with cocaine.You see a dullard finding himself absolutely fascinating at a party and you think: “I’ll have a crack at that.”But this new drug, flakka, is dferent.One man who took it ate a homeless man’s face. Another gouged her own mother’s eyes out. And a third cut off his own penis.Which raises an interesting point. Why would anyone look at someone cutting off his old fella and think, “Ooh, I’ll have what he’s having ”A BUNCH of people who think the Lake District should only be used by ramblers decided to stage a protest over plans to put ten small tourist yachts on Grasmere lake.However, before the protest could take place, the idea was abandoned. And guess what  Yup. The protest went ahead anyway.They were actually protesting about something that wasn’t going to happen. Which proves what I’ve suspected for quite some time. Ramblers aren’t entirely right in the head.Next week, they will be protesting about the sonic booms made by Concorde and the burning of witches.LAST Sunday, driving was banned in the Italian city of Milan.Who thought that was a good idea  Getting an Italian to leave his car at home is impossible. It’s a part of his being, like his liver and his lungs.Needless to say, the scheme was not very successful.So not very successful in fact that, in the first three hours, the police had issued  fines. And the authorities now admit the ban was “largely ignored”.THERE’S much talk at the moment about how internet shopping is killing the High Street. But I’m not one of the murderers.When the time comes for my annual clothes shopping trip, I simply head to the Levi’s store on Regent Street in London, point at the label on the back of the jeans I’m wearing and ask for three more pairs just the same.I love Levi’s. I’ve worn nothing  since I was  and I’ve always loved their shop, the staff have always been brilliant. They always have what I need in stock and they never ask for my phone number or email address. I’m in and out in two minutes flat.This year, though, there was a disaster. There were two disinterested youths in there who looked at the label on the back of my jeans and said, “We don’t make those any more.”WHAT  ! !On the verge of fainting with shock, I dragged them back from their interesting conversation about Stormzy and was told in an exasperated fashion that I could still buy them online.This begs a question. What’s the point of having an expensive-to-run shopyou then fill it with people who tell you to go home and buy what you need on the net PETA, an organisation for animal enthusiasts who like to wear clothes made from crude oil, have announced that people often see their pet dog as nothing more than a cheap burglar alarm.Cheap You can buy a home alarm kit these days for less than £, whereas a proper dog is going to be way more than that.Plus, you only need feed an alarm with a tiny amount of electricity to keep it running, whereas a dog requires a bed, a blanket, food, water and, later on, vets bills that will make your eyes water.THIS week, a car crashed through my fence, turning it and an expensive new gate into matchsticks.By the time I got there, the car was gone. But there was still a lot of “police aware” tape fluttering about in the breeze.So I called the nearest station, which was approximately  miles away, as I needed to contact the driver to talk about insurance. Sadly, however, while the police are “aware” of the incident, they are not prepared to give me any details.Mustn’t grumble, though.

The young folk born this century, like my -year-old daughter, do not watch it. The BBC means nothing to Generation YouTube.And the millions of us who grew up with the Beeb no longer recognise it as the benign Auntie that gave us Doctor Who, Top Of The Pops, Le On Earth, Fawlty Towers, The Likely Lads and David Dimbleby staying up all night at the General Election.That old beloved BBC — endlessly entertaining, scrupulously fair — is dead now. The BBC’s coverage of the night we left the European Union was nothing less than shameful.Here was a moment of truly historical signicance, the kind of national event that the BBC was born to cover. And it was dished up like a dull night at the Eurovision Song Contest.Down in Parliament Square, awash with Union Jacks and peaceful, happy patriots, BBC reporter Geeta Guru-Murthy blurted: “It’s a very white crowd mostly” — to the bewilderment of the many black and Asian people who were there to celebrate.But, of course, the BBC continues to peddle the filthy little lie that Brexit has its roots in the racism of the bigoted British people.Meanwhile, Sophie Raworth sat primly in a BBC studio made up to look like the EU flag. The studio never turned red, white and blue. There was no sense that the largest vote for anything in British history was being honoured. Why must we pay £billion a year for this one-sided garbage My colleague Ally Ross has pointed out that BBC “comedy” shows like Have I Got News For You, Frankie Boyle’s New World Order and The Mash Report have all been larded with anti-Brexit orthodoxy for years. Now the predictably loony Remainer-speak even seeps into the poison the BBC drips into our children.On the day we left the EU, the BBC released a CBBC Horrible Histories special mocking British stupidity.Queen Victoria was accused of callously sweetening her tea with sugar harvested by slaves — even though slavery was abolished four years before Victoria came to the throne.Historian Andrew Roberts described the mocking film as “a stream of bigoted hatred directed at this country”. They truly don’t get it in Broadcasting House. Millions of licence fee payers are deeply offended by the BBC’s relentlessly anti-British, anti-Brexit sentiment.It is why we fell out of love with the BBC. There is talk about decriminalising non-payment of the licence fee, or making payment optional. But the BBC no longer represents the entire nation. It peddles the prejudices of the disappointed elite who run it.The BBC does not speak for the British people. It doesn’t even seem to like us very much. So why should we pay anything at all for this crap AFTER being overlooked at the Oscars for her sensational performance in Hustlers, the half-time show at the Super Bowl felt like the revenge of Jenner Lopez.But Hustlers is my favourite film of the past  months. Lopez deserved an Oscar for her role.And whoever wins Best Actress at the Oscars tonight, I bet they can’t slide down a pole like her.MICHELLE OBAMA always said: “When they go low, we go high.”Meaning that when the Republican opponents of President Obama struck a low blow the Obamas had a strict policy of keeping their cool, their dignity and the moral high ground.The most senior Democratic politician in America just failed to take Michelle Obama’s advice. At his State of the Union address, President Trump petulantly refused to shake the hand of NancyPelosi, the Democratic Speaker of the House of Representatives. Pelosi should have shrugged off Trump’s rudeness and perhaps laughed in Donald’s orange face.Instead, clearly boiling with rage, Nancy ripped a copy of Trump’s speech to pieces. As the speech was full of optimistic stuff about making America a fairer, more prosperous place, the only person Pelosi humiliated was herself.The Democrats are starting to make Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party look like an effective opposition.THE classic James Bond films – Dr No, From Russia With Love, Goldfinger – were all less than two hours long.But in the modern fashion for over-long movies – The Irishman clocks in at three hours and  minutes – the next Bond film, No Time To Die, will be the longest ever at almost three hours.Let’s hope that means plenty of Ana de Armas, , as Bond girl Paloma. And not too much of Daniel Craig, , moaning about ’s dodgy knees.Teenage girls are messier than teenage boys. But teenage boys are, in my experience, more likely to leave takeaway pizza under the bed for six months for the mice to nibble.And when vermin move in, you really long for your little darling to move out.SUCKING up to the millionaire snowflakes in the audience, Prince William complained about the lack of ersity at the Baftas.I don’t believe it. This year a black actor, Micheal Ward, won the Rising Star Bafta for gang film Blue Story. Six years ago,  Years A Slave won Best Picture, competing with epic Hollywood fare like Gravity.If the film or performance is good enough, then the Baftas is colour blind.The real lack of ersity is among British actors. These days most of them went to Eton with Prince William. Now that’s what I call a lack of ersity.A SURVEY reveals that  per cent of Canadians are against paying the £million to-£million-a-year security bill for Harry and Meghan’s new le.Wherever they lay their hats, from Toronto to Tinsel Town, there is only one sucker who will ever pay for Harry and Meghan’s security.

I cant even explain how I feel.Yes I was born in Jamaica, but I was brought up here. I dont know anything . I made one mistake in le, and it feels like I tried to kill the Queen.I look at my daughters pictures now every night before I go to bed.

Im going to be targeted.His we of five years, Tonique Kerr, , said her husbands deportation would prevent her from going back to work and force her to have to claim welfare benefits.Ms Kerr, who is currently on maternity leave but works as a complaints handler at an energy company, told the newspaper: I had been hoping to go back to work so he could look after the baby. I wont be able to. Thats not something I wanted because I dont want to sit down and rely on benefits. Ive always worked. Ive never been on benefits in my le.I never imagined being a single mum. I dont want to fall into the statistics of young single parents, especially for something that isn’t my fault and could have been prevented. Its hard, emotionally and I would need help financially because it is hard having a young baby.Reshawn is a great dad. Hes been here all the time with her. She loved him. He does a lot – feeds her, changes her, plays with her. A child needs their dad. I don’t know what’s going to happen now.Mr Davis MP, Dawn Butler, said she objected to him being branded a serious criminal.The shadow women and equalities minister said: His we feels like this stress is going to kill her husband because he has a heart problem.She backed calls for the flight to Kingston to be halted until we establish the true facts of the situation.Mr Davis lawyer argued that he should be allowed to remain in the UK because of his family ties.However it was ruled on Friday that he did not have a genuine and subsisting relationship with his we or daughter and that it would not be unduly harsh for them to be without him.In a Parliamentary briefing last week, the Joint Council for Welfare of Immigrants said it was concerned some of the passengers could be potential victims of trafficking or victims of county lines exploitation.The issue was raised at Prime Ministers Questions, when Labour MP Nadia Whittome called for the flight to be halted until a review into the lessons learnt from the Windrush scandal was published and its recommendations implemented.The Windrush scandal saw many of those who had arrived in Caribbean countries between  and  detained or deported despite having the right to live in the UK for decades. The fallout led to the resignation of Amber Rudd as home secretary.A Home Office spokesperson said: The planned charter flight to Jamaica is specically for removing foreign criminals. Those detained for removal include people convicted of manslaughter, rape, violent crime and dealing class A drugs.The spokesperson added that everyone on the flight will have had their cases fully reviewed to ensure there are no outstanding legal barriers, including trafficking and slavery claims, that would prevent their removal from the UK.The law on joint enterprise was challenged in  following the case of Ameen Jogee, who had been convicted of joint enterprise murder of former Leicestershire police officer, Paul Fyffe in .While the court heard that it had been Jogees friend, Mohammed Hirsi, who stabbed Mr Fyfe in the heart, he had egged him on and both were convicted of murder and given le sentences.But during the appeal, Jogee argued he was not inside the house when the incident took place, and could not have foreseen what his friend intended to do.Delivering the judgement, Supreme Court judge Lord Neuberger said it was wrong to treat foresight as a sufficient test to convict someone of murder.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Liu Xiaoming praised ministers for their “good decision” to allow the Chinese tech giant to build some non-sensitive parts of the new infrastructure.The PM has faced mounting criticism from within his own party over the plan amid fears that the company, classed as “high-risk” by officials, could be a major security breach.US President Donald Trump was “apoplectic” in a phone call to Mr Johnson after the announcement of the decision, according to reports, which ignored Washington’s warnings over the firm.

Miss Symonds is apparently backing ministers who claim Mr Cummingaposs heavy-handed treatment of ministers, officials and journalists is harming the Prime Ministeraposs image, according to Treasury sources.Reports that the advisor urged the PM to sack Chancellor Sajid Javid and Defence Secretary Ben Wallace - two ministers with close links to Miss Symonds - has stoked the flames of the feud. Mr Johnson is said to be against firing Mr Javid but how secure Mr Wallace remains is unclear with a reshuffle likely to happen this week, reports the Daily Mail.Mr Cummings is also understood to be looking to remove several Tory ministerial special advisers, some who are close to Miss Symonds. The Prime Minister could be dragged into the centre of a potentially damaging power struggle between the pair - the most powerful members of his Cabinet of key advisors. Miss Symonds and Mr Cummings each have prominent Cabinet allies and hobby horses fighting their corners. The former joined the party as a press officer a decade ago before being pushed up to director of communities three years ago, working for senior Conservatives John Whittingdale, Zac Goldsmith and Mr Javid.  She is described as a skilled networker, as well as being a environmental campaigner, with her animal welfare views and stance on the release of violent criminals having influenced Mr Johnson.Mr Cummings, meanwhile, pioneered radical school reforms as special adviser to then-Education Secretary Michael Gove and is hailed as the genius behind the Vote Leave campaign in aposs EU referendum. During a party on January , marking Brexit night, the Prime Minister praised his chief advisor for coming up with the powerful aposGet Brexit Doneapos slogan, paving the way for his landslide General Election victory in December. Mr Cummingsapos war on the mainstream media since then though has seen him come under fire, including recently banning reporters from organisations considered hostile to the Government, resulting in a revolt of Westminster lobby journalists. He had also banned ministersapos special advisors lunching with journalists, to avoid stories being leaked, though both he and Miss Symonds have close ties with certain senior journalists. It is also understood he is behind a Number  campaign to chop the BBC down to size, including blocking ministers from appearing on Radio aposs Today show, claiming it is anti-Tory. A Treasury source told the Mail: There was always a risk that Carrie and Dom were going to fall out and that the PM would get caught in the crossfire.

But many at No  felt that Mr Johnson, the public face of Vote Leave, had been determined to undermine her attempts to get Britain out of the European Union ever since she took over at No .  In an explosive interview with the Institute for Government, Mr Hunt said: “It was a deliberate decision to take Brexit out of the hands of the Foreign Office while Boris was Foreign Secretary, that was what No.  intended.”  The ex-Cabinet Minister claimed that when he took over Mr Johnson’s job in  the department became “a bit more involved”. Mrs May created the Brexit department in July , in the wake of the referendum vote, and handed it the responsibility for the UK’s departure from the EU instead.   But in the same series of interviews, her de facto deputy David Lidington claimed it had been “a mistake” to do so and Brexit should have been run from the centre of Government instead.  He added: “There should have been a dferent approach to the [Brexit] negotiations at the start, because I think it would have been possible then to come to the deal earlier.”  And he disputed claims by ex-minister Liam Fox that the civil service had dragged their feet over Brexit - claiming they were “working flat out” and would have “done their utmost” to deliver the politicians’ wishes. Mr Lidington also claimed that he had backed Mr Johnson’s Brexit deal - which was % Mrs May’s - after the PM privately assured him that a no deal departure was “not something that any sensible PM would choose”.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA dad-of-five who lived off Pot Noodles after nearly going bankrupt now heads a multi-million pound business. Gary Fredson has experienced both dizzying highs and scarring lows in his career. He achieved remarkable success as one of the countryaposs top retail managers before losing it all, with his properties and car repossessed.But he got back on his feet and eventually launched a profitable solar energy firm ESE Energy, reports the Liverpool Echo.The business recently represented Liverpool at a top utility conference in Paris following a year of success and expansion. Having grown up on a council estate in Runcorn, Cheshire, Gary left secondary school to go straight into employment, working as shop assistant at Currys. He soon progressed to a full-time salesman at the computer brand and within four years, became one of its top sales people. That brought him into the multimillion pound club for sales - success that propelled him to the role of store manager at the age of . Dad-of-five Gary said: It was very young to be a store manager. “The average age for one at that point was late s or early s. I was managing people a lot older than me. I was managing people who had previously been my manager, but I was very passionate about sales and giving a good customer service experience.” Gary was then headhunted to run a branch of office supplies shop Office King in Liverpool in  - becoming the youngest manager to work for the company. That was before moving to electrical retail store Powerhouse in Speke Retail Park in , where he became area manager, responsible for £m worth of turnover. But this was the point where things began to take a turn for Gary, starting with Powerhouse going into administration in , making half of their staff redundant. In , the firm entered receivership. Gary said following the earth shattering news he was to lose his job, he began some consultancy work in helping startup businesses. He said: “The money I received from my redundancy I also invested in property. Buy to let was a great market to be in. But the financial crash in  brought further bad news for Gary.  He said: “Interest rates were high. People couldnapost get mortgages, and many were losing their jobs. “A lot of people had several properties but their tenants were not paying rent. I had no money myself and was actively looking for work. “But with my background, there wasn’t much out there. I was a retail professional who worked in customer service and I had a bit of HR experience. “There were lots of people from banks who had lost their jobs too, so they had saturated the market. That meant I was unemployed for a while.” Personal financial problems for Gary grew, and soon enough, on the verge of bankruptcy, his house, along with all of the properties he owned were repossessed, and his car taken off his drive. He said: “ came and I was living in a flat, on the dole and getting housing benefit, on a prepaid gas and electricity meter. “I was broken at this point. I didn’t have WiFi in my house, I didn’t have a laptop, I couldn’t even afford to use my car. “I was missing direct debits for insurance, and struggling to eat. I was on Pot Noodles. There was no McDonald’s or eating out for me. Put simply, I was single and on the verge of destitution. Describing it as a “dark time”, Gary likened the situation to how some professional athletes can struggle after retirement. He said: “People say footballers have to try and adjust after they stop playing, but I think thataposs the case with anyone whoaposs been very successful and then all of a sudden has lost. “It was bleak so I hated everyone - I was very negative. You find you have lots of friends when you are very successful, and when youaposre not, you donapost tend to.”  Gary said he felt like he’d lost “a little bit of dignity”. He added: “I couldnapost hold my head up high - having to ask my dad to lend me some money to buy my daughter a present for her birthday - itaposs a bit crap. I went four years without going on holiday.” Determined Gary began to take measures to change his mindset and focus on his personal wellbeing in a bid to turn the situation around. He said: I wanted to be a bit more positive. I wanted to think about setting myself goals on a daily basis.” By chance, he developed an interest in eco technology after speaking to an engineer who had been called out to his rented accommodation due to a problem with the boiler. He found out about a government initiative called the Green Deal - giving tenants the chance to pay for energy efficient home improvements through savings on their energy bills, and began to research eco energy and eco funding. Before long, he had been enrolled onto a course in Warrington, training to be an energy surveyor, and soon after qualying, found a job working on commission with a £ basic salary. He said: “It was all about walking the streets, knocking on doors and getting sales. That’s what we did.”  He launched the firm in  and by  had moved into solar energy. An initial success was delivering a solar energy contract for Nottingham City Council, installing the technology on , properties. A sht in the market then saw the firmaposs focus sht away from installations to providing service and maintenance to firms using solar energy, with a key focus on helping people out of fuel poverty. ESE now claims to be at the cutting edge of renewable technology in the UK, offering design, installation and technical support for major green energy products, as well as making homes and workplaces more energy efficient. Over three years of growth, it has gone from strength to strength - and is now one of the country’s biggest solar electricity systems suppliers, offering free programmes to educate corporate leaders on the benefits of the energy. It is also working with organisations across the North West and engaging with construction companies to promote the renewable power within new developments in Liverpool. The firm has expanded into offering battery power solutions employs  people after moving to its brand new Liverpool city centre HQ on Old Hall Street in December. Recent profits hit the £m mark.

The evening event several nights later, on November , would entail Derek Mackay sharing his le story, reflections and advice for young people in politics. Students and teachers from schools across the greater Glasgow region will be in attendance, and photograph opportunities, a QA and meet  greet opportunities are available, the invite read. Over the same month, Derek sent dozens messages to a -year-old boy over Facebook and Instagram- just a fraction of the  social media messages he sent the boy over a six-month period.Derek was forced to resign on Thursday after details surrounding his interactions with the schoolboy emerged. The messages he sent in November included one asking Howaposs the rugby and another reading Would you want to go to a rugby reception in the Scottish Parliament . It is not clear whether the boyaposs school was invited to the “Le story of Derek Mackay” event on November . Organiser Kieran, , has told how he initially asked Nicola Sturgeon to speak but then heard back from Mackay’s team, who said he would attend instead.He said: “We contacted  Nicola Sturgeon initially but the next thing we heard back was from Derek Mackay’s team. It became apparent it would be Mackay who would come along. “We had a group of around -odd young people along with some teachers and friends of our organisation. “A shiver goes through me when I think about it now because we work with schools across the country and my biggest priority is to make sure our people are safe. “The last person that I thought I would have to worry about was a senior government minister and, hence, we didn’t go through disclosure checks with him – so I was pretty shocked. “The event was to be shown to , students across the UK but I can now confirm that we won’t be putting that video out for obvious reasons. We are going to withdraw that given the situation.” Kieran runs workshops for aspiring young entrepreneurs and did not suspect anything of Derekaposs conduct.  “He came in and made a speech and he spoke about acting with integrity, which he clearly wasn’t practising at the time. I have now seen that Mackay sent one of these messages the day before, which is quite worrying.” Mackay, , quit the Scottish Cabinet hours before he should have been delivering Scotland’s £billion budget, after his online behaviour emerged. Labour’s Neil Bibby has demanded a full investigation into the school event.He said: “Given what we now know about Derek Mackay abusing his position and reports that he was previously warned about hisbehaviour, this matter should be fully investigated. Parents will rightly be asking why Derek Mackay was allowed to attend this event instead of the First Minister.Parents have the right to know there are proper safeguards in place whenever their children are being invited to an event outside the school.”Dad-of-two Mackay, who came out as gay in , has been suspended from the SNP and the parliamentary group pending an investigation.The teenager involved has spoken to police over the online bombardment, which happened after Mackay sent him an initial message out of the blue.

Mum Charlotte Charles said the news that suspect Anne Sacoolas had a more senior role with the agency than her spy husband made her feel “downright lied to” by the British Government. Ministers and officials were said to be aware of Sacoolas’s career in espionage. But she was not declared as an agent when she came here with intelligence officer husband Jonathan. And Mrs Charles, , said the revelation means “things are now beginning to fall into place” on why the US is blocking her extradition to face justice. Slamming the Government, she said: “How could they do this to us  We have thrown ourselves into building relationships with the Government, despite the terrible way they were treating us. I am livid and my family are full of anger. How could they keep this from us  “This doesn’t affect the fact that Anne Sacoolas is coming back, which she is. “But to hear how they have not been candid with us takes us back to those terrible days when they were trying to kick this all under the carpet. I do not know what the Government think they are doing or why they are treating us the way they are. It is an absolute scandal.” Family spokesman Radd Seiger added: “At a recent meeting with the Foreign Secretary, the parents asked him specically what Anne Sacoolas’s role was.“He confirmed what we all knew – she had in the past been an employee of the State Department. But he made no mention of the fact that she was CIA. Something has clearly gone badly wrong and it is no wonder Boris Johnson has not seen it fit to meet the parents and I. “I now call for a full public inquiry into who knew what and when, and into the deplorable manner in which this family have been treated.” Sacoolas’s Volvo allegedly hit Harry’s motorbike last August while she was driving on the wrong side of the road. The -year-old fled the country after the smash outside US base RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire. The US claims it notied the Foreign Office that she was leaving. In December, Sacoolas was charged over the fatal accident and she has apologised for Harry’s death. But she refuses toand US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has rejected an extradition request.

Deit Deitreich-Briggs, , looks after his grandchildren five or six days a week from am to pm, plus a couple of nights, to enable his daughters to work. The Birmingham pensioner loves to cook for Lacey, eight, Indie, six, and Zayn, six, and also collects them from school, helps them with homework and supports them during their out of school activities. Running to a tight budget on his pension, Mr Deitreich-Briggs says he manages to feed the four of them for just £ a week.Among the dishes he prepares for the children, there are homemade fish and chips, pizza and mini toad in the holes, Birmingham Live reports.At the weekend, the kids often like to help their grandad bake chocolate and vanilla cakes for them to eat during the week. “I love having a close bond with my grandchildren and wouldn’t want it any other way,” the retired retail manager said. I’m proud of my daughters and their careers, and glad I can help them to have the lestyles they need to be able to work and have children. I enjoy making all our food from scratch, ensuring itaposs healthy and balanced, and teaching the children to cook too. Mr Deitreich-Briggs, from Erdington, Birmingham, is a widower so he cares for his grandchildren on his own.  We have an extremely good breakfast every day and then they go off to school laughing and happy, said Deit, they are doing well and are happy, they’ve got that stability. They also do their homework every morning before going to school. He gives them tea at pm then takes them to football, swimming and the gym before their parents come to collect them. The -year-old, who is a yoga teacher, then goes to work. Among his tips to cook healthy meals on a budget, Deit said it is important to plan and prepare ahead, make sure nothing is wasted. Other tips include storing leftovers, shopping at value supermarkets, using honey instead of sugar and getting the kids a meal chart.  His daughter Amii Deitreich-Worthington, , is a corporate travel consultant and lives just down the road in Erdington. She said: My and my husband wouldn’t be able to both work full time without dad, he takes the pressure off us. It’s nice that the children have that special time with their grandad. When I was younger, I used to spend a lot of time with my nan. It’s great to have a dferent role model in your le who brings dferent ideas on how to do things. Amii, whose husband Ross works as a sht manager, added: The children learn a lot from their grandad. He has more time than we do and helps them with their homework. It’s such a big pressure having to get homework done and trying to get to after school clubs when you’re working full time.  It’s great that he makes sure they eat healthily too. We totally trust him to make the right decisions. When the kids are in his care, it’s his rules and what he wants to teach them. His daughter Zita Deitreich-Irving, , works as a part time legal secretary so her son Indie goes to his grandadaposs three days a week.  On the days when she is not at work, Zita meets her dad, niece and nephew to do the school run together and she helps Deit take them swimming on a Monday too. Dad is a massive help, we wouldnapost be able to do it without him, said Zita, who lives in Erdington and is married to Neil, a plumbing and heating engineer. It means by the time me and my husband get back from work, Indie has had his dinner and so he doesnapost have to wait to eat at pm at night. Dad was just the same with us when we were kids, he loves it. We love that he has that close bond with them and that the cousins see each other every day. When dadaposs on holiday, Amii and I will still keep the kids together, sharing the childcare the way dad does.

Peter Stanton, , was raised by mum Hilda after she got pregnant following an affair with a US sailor. He began searching for his father Roland aged  and had almost given up hope. But he uploaded his DNA online and was put in touch with half-brother Larry Arnold, , who lives in Florida. Dad-of-four Peter said: “We actually look alike, it is absolutely amazing. I was over the moon. “He used to play golf and I used to play as well and there are loads of silly similar things like that. “I was really disappointed that I missed my father. He passed away in  aged  but to know I have a brother feels out of this world. “I just want to give him a hug.” The pair are now making up for lost time by chatting on Skype weekly and plan to meet in person. Larry added: “I am completely in awe of this whole thing and I am looking forward to the day we meet. “I have so many things I want to tell him about our father. “I would have loved for dad to have known Peter. He would have been so proud.” Roland joined the US Navy aged  and served as a minesweeper. He was stationed in Plymouth, Devon, when he met Hilda during preparations for the Normandy invasion.  But following the Second World War he ed to the US, leaving her pregnant and heartbroken. Peter joined the Royal Navy Gunnery Division aged  to follow in his mother’s footsteps, and served for  years. He sent DNA to ancestry five years ago but there was no match until Larry, who was in the US Army National Guard, registered himself. Larry told him Roland believed Hilda had given birth to a daughter. Peter, of Walthamstow, East London, explained: “He had a wire signal back when he ed to the States and he tried looking for the girl and could never find her and he couldn’t locate my mother either. “Obviously the signal was wrong.  “He also seems to think my mother looked pretty much like his mother, which could be the reason they got together.” Sadly the half-brothers discovered they have both suffered from types of cancer.

Last month, the pair had been involved in a bust up with police before being photographed out shopping together.  Matthewsapos engagement to Saunders also saw her sacked from her job at a charity shop and her home - the location of which cannot be disclosed for legal reasons - egged by angry vigilantes, reports the Sun.“She has got no friends where she lives any more because of Saunders, a former friend told the newspaper. “People have ditched her because she refuses to kick him out.  The unnamed former pal said Matthews lied to people that she was going to do so when in reality he has been living there full-time for a while. “To see a paedophile move into any neighbourhood is just disgusting, they continued. “Some people believed she should be given the time to prove she had turned over a new leaf after she got out of jail.

Dean Chapman, , snubbed university to serve burgers at McDonaldaposs and now runs a business boasting four branches with a turnover of more than £ million. The dad-of-three, from Leicester, took his first McDonaldaposs job aged  job to generate cash for a college canoeing holiday. But now, Dean and his team run restaurants at Cherry Street near Temple Row, Bristol Road, near Belgrave Middleway Stephenson Place, on the New Street ramp, and Kings Parade in Dale End, Birmingham Live reports. Deanaposs blue collar parents -  dad was painter and decorator and mum a machinist - were less than thrilled when he decided to ditch his A Levels to work full-time at the Golden Arches.  But he worked his way up from McDonaldaposs crew member to director level. In  he was appointed Head of Franchising UK, helping franchise owners run and manage their restaurant more effectively. In , he resigned as a McDonaldaposs employee to buy his own restaurants as a franchisee. Dean said: I first bought two - Stephenson Place and Dale End. A year later I took on Cherry Street, followed by Bristol Road. All the McDonaldaposs in Birmingham are franchisee owned. Dean said: When I started only around  to  per cent of UK McDonaldaposs restaurants were franchises - that is owned by independent business owners like me. It was not the UK model then. Now around  per cent of McDonalds restaurants in the UK are franchises. It has grown hugely. With a turnover of more than £.million, according to public accounts published for the year ending December , , he is certainly doing something right. Dean put his success down to hard work, graft and a bit of luck along the way. He said: If you put your heart and soul into the work, the opportunities are there. So what are his multi-million pound secrets   What were you doing before you started at McDonaldaposs  I was studying Physics,  Maths and Electronics at Leicester College. I wanted to be an electrical engineer and planned to go to university - I would have been the first in my family to go. I got a part-time job at my local McDonaldaposs in Leicester to help pay for a canoeing holiday.  When I came back from the holiday, I continued to work at McDonaldaposs and I ended up working more and more hours. I was practically a full-time employee before I knew it. I guess my lightbulb moment came after I ed from my holiday. I remember sitting in class at college, putting my hand up to ask to be excused to go to the toilet and being told I couldnapost and that I should have gone on a break. I threw my toys out of the pram, walked out and never went back. My parents were very disappointed,  I wasnapost going to university. Obviously they donapost feel that way now.  What I loved about the job - which is still true today - was it was all about teamwork and camaraderie. I’m a very shy person in general but after a few weeks I found my feet and within a few months,  I was running the kitchen with  staff. How do you progress from crew member   The management set-up back then was quite dferent. By the age of ,  I was running my own restaurant. I became Leicester area manager at . While going through the ranks I got a lot of training and business qualications at what we call hamburger university - an office in Sutton Coldfield. These are courses not externally recognised but when I go into organisations to talk about the franchisees, the stuff I’ve been taught are well-known business models.  My last few jobs as a McDonaldaposs employee were as director of operations and head of franchising in the UK. Why did you decide you wanted to be a franchisee  The higher up I got in the company, the further away I got from what I loved - interacting with staff. When I was training franchisees for the company, Iaposd give advice about what they could do to run a better McDonaldaposs and move the business forward. I wanted to implement these things myself. Now I have my own franchise business consultant  - the job I used to do -  who gives me a fresh pair of eyes and a good overview. Have your children any plans to follow your career path  They are very proud and it is a family business - my we is the bookkeeper. I have three children, Heidi, Finlay and Luke. Finlay has a natural affinity with business and wants to study that at university.  Luke and Heidi love maths. She is studying maths at St Andrews, where Kate Middleton and Prince William met. Apparently an Indian princess is studying there now! How do you become a franchisee and how much money do you need  You need an initial outlay of unencumbered cash of £,. And be accepted for an application programme. The selection process is quite intense. There is an extensive application process. Then there is a nine-month training period after that. Whataposs the best thing about being a franchisee  Seeing people progress. All my managers worked from crew up. I think it would be frustrating to work somewhere where there were no ways to progress - absolutely the opportunities are there in McDonaldapossyou want them.  For example one employee Cha who was on our apprenticeship programme started as crew in October  and was promoted to sht manager within four years. aposYou need an initial outlay of unencumbered cash of £, to own a franchiseapos You have to work very hard and put your heart and soul into it. There are other employees who donapost want to go up the ranks - which is fine. They just want a flexible job - and some cash to let them focus on other interests, whether that be sport or the arts. What changes have you seen since you started  When I started we didn’t sell breakfast - shocking when you consider how popular it is.   On the back of customer demand we have increased the breakfast time from .am to am so people can have a lie-in.  I remember the film Falling Down, when Michael Douglas is told he is a few minutes too late for the breakfast menu at a fast food restaurant and explodes. We donapost want people to feel like that! Also back when we started, it was just filter coffee. The only chicken we sold was nuggets. Now  per cent of our products are chicken.We sell as much chicken as beef. As the years have progressed,  peopleaposs tastes have evolved. More recently we have offered salads, veggie wraps and vegan dippers. Who knows what it will look like in  years  The restaurants themselves have transformed massively over the last five years, we have table service, the My McDonald’s app and McDelivery. Describe your average day Every morning I get up at  and drive to Birmingham. Iaposm usually at the Dale End branch by .am. Iaposll get the business managers for the four stores together for a couple of hours.  Then they go back to their teams and have similar meetings with their teams. The rest of the day is spent catching up on emails. Every day starts with a meeting of some description - so it could be a team meeting.

But now tens of thousands of motorists, who were encouraged by the ­Government, have been given a kick in the teeth. It turns out they were not quite as efficient at lowering emissions as was originally thought. Boris Johnson this week brought forward a ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from  to  to ­coincide with the launch of a UN climate summit in Glasgow later this year. He said Britain, as the first country to industrialise, had a “responsibility” to lead the way in cutting emissions. A welcome move.  But the decision to extend the ban to all hybrid cars is confusing and enraging. A vehicle is one of the most expensive purchases we will make. Many owners now also fear the fiasco will see resale values e as the ban approaches. Who wants to buy a car that will be illegal in the near future  Tests have found that the new ­generation of plug-in hybrid cars emit up to three times more greenhouse gases in “real world” driving than official figures suggest. The reason for this is that hybrids – which contain an extra electric motor and battery – tend to be heavier than their petrol counterparts. In addition, many plug-in hybrid owners are neglecting to charge their vehicles, running them on petrol alone and losing the benefits of the dual system. We have been greenwashed before. The move is ­comparable to the knee-jerk Labour policy of diesel tax breaks, which led to increased air pollution and was later discredited.

British citizens could see changes to healthcare, driving permits and border control being made as a result - as well as ato the blue British passport, Gloucestershire Live reports. Immigration Minister Brandon Lewis has confirmed the current maroon covers are due to turn blue now that the UK is no longer a part of the European Union. The design is in fact ato the original passport colour first used back in  - and itshas been delayed while stocks of the EU-style burgundy one are used up. For a standard ten-year passport, it means they will be stuck with red until . The first wave of blue passports will start being sent out by the end of March, but there is no guarantee which colour will be issued. A Home Office spokesman said: “There will be a mixture of blue and burgundy passports issued over a period of months, and we expect all new passports to be blue by the middle of the year. “As well as using up the existing stock of burgundy passports, the printing presses all need to be tweaked to make blue covers, which needs to be done in stages, otherwise the printing process would grind to a halt.”  The blue passports changed colour once the UK joined the EU and the burgundy shade was agreed upon and adopted soon after. The new passport is due to have up-to-date security features and technologies to protect against fraud and forgery - but the pages will be plastic instead of paper, making it more dficult to alter. Those who prefer the burgundy shade will not lose out - these passports will continue to be issued but without reference to the EU.

Some areas saw a month and a halfaposs rainfall in just  hours and gusts of more than mph swept across the country on Sunday, bringing widespread flooding. Thousands of people were left without power, some homes were evacuated, buildings were damaged and sporting occasions postponed. Flights, ferries and trains all saw cancellations and delays, while drivers faced treacherous conditions with floodwater, fallen trees and other debris closing roads.A Met Office amber weather warning for wind, which had been in place across most of England, elapsed at pm Sunday as Storm Ciara moved away to the north-east of Scotland.But a yellow warning for wind remained in force for the whole UK until midnight, with strong winds, heavy showers, snow and ice expected on Monday. A yellow warning for heavy snow and strong winds is in place for Northern Ireland and most of Scotland and a yellow warning of snow and ice is in force for North West England throughout Monday and Tuesday. A yellow warning for wind in the south is in place between am and pm Monday. Met Office meteorologist Alex Burkill said: While Storm Ciara is clearing away, that doesnapost mean weaposre entering a quieter period of weather. Itaposs going to stay very unsettled.  We have got colder air coming through the UK and will be feeling a real drop in temperatures, with an increased risk of snow in northern parts of the UK and likely in Scotland. There could be up to cm on Monday and Tuesday and with strong winds, blizzards arenapost out of the question. The Met Office warning states: Frequent and heavy snow showers will affect the region throughout Monday and Tuesday. Snow showers will occur especially over high ground, giving slight accumulations of one to three cm above  metres and five to cm above  metres. Snow will gradually build up and in a few locations, accumulations of over cm are possible by Tuesday evening over the highest routes in Scotland.  The height of the snow level will y throughout the period, but it is likely that any snow accumulations at low levels will only be temporary. Strong winds, gusting - mph, will lead to blizzard conditions at times and considerable drting of lying snow over high ground. Train passengers are being advised to check with operators before travelling as there are likely to be some cancellations to early trains as Network Rail engineers work through the night to assess the damage. Motorists are also warned to take care with continued disruption to the road network and tricky driving conditions likely to continue into rush hour. And airports around the country on Sunday night told travellers to check their flight with their airline due to the continuing bad weather conditions. British Airways said in a statement there will be a minor knock-on effect to Mondayaposs schedule. Weaposre getting in touch with those affected, and have brought in extra customer teams to help them with a range of options including a full refund or an alternative flight between now and Thursday, the airline said. Any customer flying short-haul to or from Heathrow or Gatwick, can also choose to make changes to their travel plansthey would prefer to fly another time.  Scotland Transport Secretary Michael Matheson said there is the potential for signicant disruption to travel. He said: The Traffic Scotland service gives details of aposwind basedapos closures for the bridges on trunk road network, allowing people to plan ahead accordingly. Motorists should check Traffic Scotland before they set off to make sure that their route is available. More than  flood warnings were issued across England on Sunday, with the town of Appleby-in-Westmorland, in Cumbria, severely hit.

Nearly , homes were left without power after a month’s worth of rain fell in one day in some areas. Dozens of flights were cancelled with others erted as far away as Germany because of the perilous conditions from the high winds and torrential rain. One BA plane was forced to declare an emergency and land in Lyon, France as it ran low on fuel while waiting to touch down at Gatwick. As waves up to ft high battered the coast, hundreds of PO ferry passengers were stranded at sea for hours as the Pride of Hull struggled to dock. Have you been affected by Storm Ciara  Email webnews@mirrorThe Isle of Wight was cut off after ferries were stopped as winds of mph were recorded at landmark The Needles while the port of Dover was also closed. Sporting events, including Manchester City’s Premier League clash with West Ham were called off. Helen Roberts, from the Met Office, said: “In terms of area this is probably the biggest storm this century.” She added she had not seen amber warnings – the second most severe level – “on this scale across all of Wales and much of England”.  “This could end up being the biggest since ,” Ms Roberts said, when the “Great Storm” killed  people and felled an estimated  million trees. Her colleague, Alex Burkill, said that this was just the start warning of “plummeting” temperatures this week. There would be dangerous ice in the North he said, and snow showers affecting many parts of the country.  “Once we say goodbye to Storm Ciara, it’s not a complete calm-down by any means,” Mr Burkill said. “It’s not a pleasant outlook. It’s going to stay very windy, we’re going to have plenty of heavy showers with hail and thunder and some snow.” Yesterday’s winds damaged multiple buildings including London’s Victoria station and a guest house in Hawick, Scotland, which partially collapsed. Trains were cancelled and planes in Manchester and London aborted landings faced with mph winds.  Residents had to be evacuated in Lancashire and Yorkshire as rivers burst their banks and a major incident was declared by Lancashire police. Families hit by Boxing Day floods in  were in the line of fire again and those hit by November’s River Don floods were warned to “be prepared”. Sirens in the West Yorkshire town of Hebden Bridge warned of what was to come. Hours later, parts of nearby Mytholmroyd were under ft of water as it flooded for a third time in eight years.  Resident Adele Smith said: “Utter devastation in my home town of Mytholmroyd and Hebden Bridge and a catastrophic failure of the flood alleviation scheme, which is nowhere near finished. “For all those non-believers of global warming visit the Calder Valley.” Keith Crabtree, a flood warden for nearby Todmorden added: “I can sum it up in one word: grim. “That’s through the whole of the Valley, ...there’s problems all the way down. “It’s striking me like another Boxing Day... the number of incidents are certainly at Boxing Day  levels.”  Yorkshire shepherdess Amanda Owen watched a metal livestock carrier being swept away on a hillside. She said: “The energy and power of this storm are unreal. The gusts of wind are exceptional and water is pouring. “Can’t believe this just happened. A flood of biblical proportions.” Emergency services ferried residents to safety using inflatable boats in the Lancashire towns of Bury and Ramsbottom. And Bury councillor Tamoor Tariq helped families board a bus to a temporary rescue point set up at a local leisure centre.  Mr Tariq told the Mirror: “It’s so deep we’ve had to close off the roads, we had to support people coming out the properties because some of the water was knee high. There are bins floating around and lots of residents outside their properties.” The Environment Agency issued  flood warnings and a red “danger to le” was declared for severe flooding from the River Nidd at Pateley Bridge in North Yorkshire. Three people were injured when a pub roof in Perth, Scotland, collapsed.

Worried families, wearing facemasks, gathered at a medical centre adjoining the childaposs school in Les Contamines awaiting the results, which are due this evening. Officials have closed the -pupil primary school for lessons this week in the small ski resort, an hour from Geneva. The nine-year-old son of British couple Bob and Catriona Saynor, who moved to the Alps three years ago, is in hospital in France after being airlted from the resort on Friday afternoon. The local ambulance service estimated  people had been tested by Sunday afternoon. Health Minister Agnès Buzyn, speaking at a hastily arranged press conference in Les Contamines, said: “We have prioritised the children who have been in the most contact with the affected child, then the children who have symptoms and finally those who are less at risk because their contact has been reduced. “The situation is changing, our decision will depend on whether we have positive results in the evening.” Environmental consultant Mr Saynor, , has also been diagnosed with the deadly virus along with three other Britons from another family who were staying in the Saynor’s six-bedroom ski chalet. Mr Saynor’s two other children and four other Britons from the other family are in isolation in French hospitals as a precaution. A second school in nearby Saint-Gervais, which has  pupils and was attended by the Saynor’s son for one day last week, will also be shut this week. The mayor, Jean-Marc Peillex, advised against panic. He said: “We must not panic an entire population. We want to put into perspective the risk of contamination - the young Briton did not rub shoulders with a whole school but he rubbed shoulders with five students for half a day.” The Les Contamines Ski Club, where the child is a member, cancelled training on Sunday. One mother, whose child is friends with the British boy, was taking him to be tested. She said: “It’s scary. My son has had five days of high fever. Is it ‘flu  Is it something   We don’t know. I think it’s more contagious than they want to say.” Didier Mollard, a father of a child at the Les Contamines school, said: “We are taking their temperature twice a day and are watching them closely. We are worried  per cent for sure. “ Émilie Bétourné, a mother whose son attends the school, said: “My son is in the class of the brother of the child who is infected. “I am not panicking for the moment. I am waiting instruction from the doctors. We’ll listen to what they say and observe the health of our children. School is closed for the week.” Les Contamines village was eerily quiet on Sunday.

His replacement Osman Sow was stretchered off on Saturday. Unfortunately, it sounds like he’ll sit out the rest of the campaign as well.But it’s a sign of the quality they have in their squad that Clark and Sow can be missing and you still have a striker of the calibre of Lawrence Shankland to lead the line. vw, px\"  Sow being out leaves a great chance for youngsters like Declan Glass and Chris Mochrie to show what they can do in the No  position.It’s unfortanute for people to get injured but also a great chance for some of United’s youngsters to impress.On top of Sow’s injury, Paul McMullan, Louis Appere and Calum Butcher have been carrying injuries recently, too.This week is an ideal time to give the players a bit of a break and recharge the batteries for the run-in.The Tangerines want to get that title wrapped up as soon as possible but this breather couldn’t have been better timed.Once again, other teams weren’t really able to make up any ground on the runaway leaders – Inverness clawed one point back at home to Alloa.United are the only team that have managed any sort of consistency this season – a wee break is just what they need to get going again."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/02/Gary-and-Piacquiao-940x531.jpg ","title":"boxing fanatic gary todd describes brushes with the biggest stars in the sport since move from st marys to sydney","story":"Interviewing Muhammad Ali, having lunch with Manny Pacquiao and tracking down Deontay Wilder # it#s all in a day#s work for Dundee-born Gary Todd.Growing up in St Mary#s, Gary never would have imagined that one day he#d get the chance to meet boxing legends such as Mike Tyson and Julio César Chávez, however after moving to Sydney in  his le changed completely.The former Rockwell High School pupil now has two international bestselling books on the sport of boxing, and has had the chance to travel to countries such as Japan, Canada, the Bahamas, Hong Kong and the USA.He said: #I grew up in St Mary#s andI#m honest I didn#t go to school a lot.#I went to MacAlpine Primary School and I was at Rockwell for a year, but I dropped out to start working and earning some money.#I got a job at the slaughterhouse, but after a while I felt like I couldn#t see a future for myself in Dundee, so I decided to do a bit of travelling.#I went to Australia on a visa and loved it so much I decided to stay.#My we Jenny came with me and we got married and started a family here.#The boxing fanatic decided to join a local gym near his new home in Sydney, and soon found himself interviewing some of boxing#s greatest legends for a book on all the dferent workouts used in the sport.He said: #I#ve always been passionate about the sport, so I joined the gym.#I started training there and I made some connections and pals, then I kind of slipped into writing my book.#Throughout the course of writing his workout book, Gary has travelled across the globe, getting interviews and pictures with over  boxing champions.However, it hasn#t all been a walk in the park for the father of three.He said: #One time, a bodyguard threatened to shoot me.#I was talking to Marvin Hagler, who#s actually my favourite boxer of all time.#His bodyguard was annoying me and getting in the way and we started arguing.#He threatened to take me outside and shoot me, and Marvin Hagler just had to stand between us.#Gary, whose day job is as a director at a construction company in Australia, has gained a large amount of fame and respect in the boxing community for his work.He has produced two books, Workouts from Boxing#s Greatest Champs Volume  and , which have been popular among fans of the sport.The -year-old has been invited to watch Deontay Wilder#s fight against Tyson Fury later this month in Nevada, and plans to continue his work interviewing the biggest names in the sport.He said: #I#m a family man, I#m a construction worker, and I#ve got a passion in le which is boxing.#I#ve been into it since I was  years old, when the first Rocky film came out in cinemas.#It took me around  years to finish my first book, and I went all over the world.#I saved up my money and frequent flyer miles, flying all over the world economy class.#In two weeks, I#m planning to fly to Las Vegas to watch the Tyson Fury vs Deontay Wilder fight as part a member on a press accreditation.#He also confessed that his thick Dundonian accent does present a bit of a challenge at times, saying: #I do get some comments on it.

It was very late in my international career and very early in his to be fair!“But you just have to look at his career to see the quality he’s got. You don’t play in the Premier League for as many years as he did without being a very, very good footballer.“These are the guys that can turn it round for Dundee – the big characters.“The season I captained the team to the Championship title, we had loads of characters in that dressing-room, and it kept us going through what was a rollercoaster season.“It was touch and go at times but guys like Peter McDonald, Ian Davidson, myself, Kyle Benedictus and Christian Nade kept it ticking over.“You need leaders in any successful team, and with Christophe and Graham in the current side, they should be the ones setting the standards.”Standards of late have not been high enough at Dens Park.A run of four Championship games without a win since the festive season has seen the Dens men drop out of the play-off places.For a side who started the season with designs on a title charge, that is a cause for concern.But Rae believes the talent peppering the Dee squad ought to be enough to turn the tide – and ensure at least a shot at a quickfireto the Premiership.“If you look at the Dundee side, there are guys with plenty of Premiership experience there,” he said.“You’ve got Jack Hamilton at the back, Christophe in front of him, Dorrans in the middle, Kane Hemmings up top . . . the list goes on.“These are the guys James McPake will be asking to drive the team on in the second half of the season. vw, px\"  “They’ve been there and done it – some of them at a very high level.“So you have to think thatthey turn it on, they’ve got enough about them to get Dundee firing again.“Things have been tough in recent weeks and being out of the play-off places is not good.“The players have to fight to turn that round because another season in the Championship isn’t ideal – and it could easily happen.“But, for me, there should be enough experience and quality there to turn the tide.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/02/5e3a89398efbe7.12644030-831x564.jpg ","title":"elliott happy to be utility man if it means upturn in dee fortunes","story":"New boy Christie Elliott says he’s happy to arrive as Dundee’s utility man – as long as it means the Dark Blues can get their act together in their promotion play-off push.The former Partick Thistle player takes on his old side this weekend in what’s likely to be his home debut.After last weekend’s - draw at Morton , where Elliott came off the bench in the second half, Dundee’s recent record doesn’t make pretty reading with no wins in their last five games in all competitions.They are still searching for a first victory of  as they dropped down to sixth at the weekend.For a new signing coming in, though, Elliott has the chance to make a real dference to the side’s fortunes – in whatever position the manager chooses.Elliott told the Tele: “To be fair, I’ve played a lot of positions in my career!“I’ve played mostly on the wing but, as formations change, I’ve played wing-back and at right-back.“Anywhere, left-wing, left-back, right-back, I’m happy to do a job for the team.”He added: “It was good to get my debut, get a few minutes on the pitch and, hopefully, I can help create things for the team and get the team going on a good run.“It is a massive club and when the opportunity came along I was really happy to take it.“The club deserves to be in the Premiership and,we can get a few wins in the league, we’ll be back up in the play-off mix.“It’s in our hands sowe can get a good run going we can still get where we belong, back in the Premiership.”Elliott was signed by Jackie McNamara for Partick Thistle back in  and stayed at Firhill until last summer when he headed back to his native England to play for Steven Pressley at Carlisle.Pressley’s time at Brunton Park ended in November and Elliott found action hard to come by. vw, px\"  He said: “It was hard at Carlisle, a new manager came in and changed things.

I’ve told him I’m going to leave one on him! That’s a joke, obviously.Alex Jones is there, too, and I know him from Bradford so there’s already been a lot of banter.”The young full-back is also familiar with Dens Park.“I’ve been here before, I watched a game.“Lee Carsley was our U s manager and we came for a pre-season tour, playing a few teams and we watched a game against Everton here at Dens Park.“That was five years ago so I don’t remember much but I do remember the atmosphere being good. It was pre-season but there was still a great atmosphere.” vw, px\"  Field’s deal with the Dark Blues is only until the summer but the left-back is happy just to be given a chance to get football.“That suits me,” he added.

The site was then occupied by Jamie’s Italian, which opened in February , before closing down in .Dustin Macdonald, chairman of the Aberdeen City Centre Community Council, said: “It’s disappointing to see so many units lying empty on Union Street but it becoming increasingly dficult for business owners who are up against online shopping.“There are a lot of empty units, particularly on the upper floors of Union Street, and it would be great to see that space being used.“But it is a widespread problem because businesses are up against online shopping nowadays. I do think there is an onus on business owners to try to make their building more appealing to customers.“There are grants available for business ownersthey wish to have the front of their stores done up, and I would encourage them to do so.”Under the city centre masterplan, a blueprint approved by the local authority in June , a number of objectives were set out to regenerate the city over the years to come, while conserving its heritage.Phase one of its planned projects are currently underway, which includes the rejuvenation of Aberdeen Art Gallery, which opened in November, and the pedestrianisation of Broad Street, which was finished at the start of August .Other schemes include installing suspended street signs in areas across the city centre and banning traffic on Langstane Place, Justice Mill Lane and Windmill Brae from pm to am.Phase two of the scheme is planned for years four to seven of the project and includes ersying employment space as well as developing skills and training in the services sector.The Queen Street initiative, which forms part of phase two, also hopes to deliver more than  new homes and incorporate a civic hub.In , a Union Street Conservation Area Regeneration Scheme , was launched. The five-year initiative aims to “restore the majesty” of Aberdeen’s main street, and is a £. million grant fund which is available to owners of eligible buildings to undertake high quality repairs, restoration and the refurbishment of buildings.Since its inception, it has been used to refurbish a former jewellers into a hot dog restaurant.Real Hot Dogs at  Union Street opened in August  after making use of the grant to clean up the shop front, however it closed in January last year.The scheme is currently planned to run until .Adrian Watson, chief executive of business body Aberdeen Inspired, said: “Union Street as a high street is changing and this is necessary, in a challenge that is not felt in Aberdeen alone, but across the country.“We need to think dferently about the experience we offer and of course there are still challenges here as we make this transition. Our efforts to continue revitalising Union Street are ongoing and enhancing the experience for those living and working in the city is an integral part of what we do as an organisation as we aim to drive footfall in the city centre.”Aberdeen City Council is taking an active approach to improve the city centre and has served notices on businesses deemed to “negatively impact the amenity of the area.”The owner of one business, Inspirations on Union Street which is vacant, was asked to make a string of repairs due to its condition bringing “signicant disamenity” to the area.An appeal was lodged with the Scottish Government last year which was rejected this month.Councillor Marie Boulton, the council’s lead on the city centre masterplan, said: “Union Street remains very much the heart of Aberdeen. The council is working with Historic Environment Scotland to conserve the fabric of its most important buildings by offering grants to owners.“CARS also aims to stimulate the economy by encouraging occupancy of vacant commercial units and upper floors for residential use. The council is continuing to invest in our heritage as well as events that showcase our unique streetscape.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2020/02/court3-1-126x84.jpg class=attachment-small size-small wp-post-image ","title":"north east homes left without power","story":"More than  homes in the north-east have been affected by power cuts.A total of  homes in the AB, AB, AB, AB, AB and AB areas have been affected, including Insch, Rothienorman, Turrf and around the Huntly area.The power cuts are a result of adverse weather from Storm Ciara, with conditions resulting in incidents of trees being uprooted, and other wind-borne debris damaging overhead power lines.Some have more than  postcodes affected in each area, and homes have been without power for several hours.

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation. So on the day of the swap four operations took place and two needy people received le-giving new organs.Although not presently being considered in the UK, with the ethical issues sorted, this multi-swap procedure opens the way for extended chains of donors and many more lives saved.*Torres et al Am J transplant. :-."},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll rugby players pictured in their prime","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowA black and white photograph featuring a Mid Argyll Rugby team, handed to the Argyllshire Advertiser by Tayvallich reader Donald Carmichael, has generated a great deal of interest.After we asked our knowledgeable readers to tell us a little more about the photograph, Lochgilphead#s Murray MacFarlane visited the office to offer some background information on the image.Murray named every member of the team in the photograph, but added: #I was playing rugby as stand-off at that time as well, so I must have had a hangover or something when the photo was taken.#He recalled that Mid Argyll Rugby Club played in the Glasgow District League and only just missed out on promotion to the national leagues during the s.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community.

Back then, we had ice-cream and jelly for dessert.#Jean added: #It was all good fun and we had loads of laughs.#Elma continued: #We used to have sales to raise money for the dinner. Santa was on the stage and Jean’s children were his elves. They were only little then.#We modelled the clothes and the older women loved the bargains. We thought they were old, but they were probably the age we are now,# Elma said laughing. #We would shout #Roll up, roll up# to get them to come and see what we had on offer.#After a warm welcome from compère Martin Jefferies and a prayer of thanks for the food, the five-course meal was expertly served by members of the organising committee and their youthful helpers.A raffle, again free of charge, saw a large number of guests receive prizes and no-one was left disappointed as the remainder of the guests received selection boxes.Tarbert’s seniors showed they know how to party as dancers left their seats and enthusiastically took to the floor as soon as the musical entertainment began.A stunned Margaret Henderson was named #Citizen of the Year#, confessing she never expected to win the award.For more than  years, Margaret has collected money to support the Tarbert Sea Food Festival and Music Festival.

A wee van and a motorbike were behind them at the time and they let them pass and they disappeared down the twisty road at an incrediblespeed.They reached Tighnabruaich at about  o#clock and saw Fulmar in the water, but when they stopped to speak to Johnny Malcolm and Donald Turner they were told she was not in the water more than # an hour and still not fully rigged. They were quite right but George Smith said they were busy getting Psyche ready for launchingbut they would be out first thing in the morning to bend on the sails and finish off the rigging.They got their storesin the yard and with these and their luggage went aboard in two trips. Things were soon put sufficiently enough in order to allow them to get to bed and after watching Psyche go down the slip they were soon in their bunks. It was a beautully clear evening but distinctly cold.Next morning they were up at sevenand about eight the yard men came out and finished up their jobs. Jimmy Smith fixed up the slipping clutch and suggested we do away with the present gear lever fancy arrangement which was not strong enough for its work. This the Skipper agreed to though it meant a less handy working but it did away with the pin and shield that broke up the dog-house seat, they being replaced by a removable hatch cover. It certainly made sitting in the dog-house more comfortable.The Skipper went ashore to the village for meat and some curtain hooks while Archie watered ship and the other two continued cleaning and clearing up aboard.At quarter to twelve they were away under full sail and in brilliant sunshine but with a cold north-westerly they ran to Ardlamont then beat up to Tarbert, being passed just outside Tarbert as an aeroplane flew close overhead, by Blink. They noticed a huge oil tanker doing trials just off Arran.They were anchored off the herring pier before  o#clock and they had supper-cum-lunch then went ashore. The Pilot to visit a friend, the others to get milk in the village then to walk to the end of the road on Loch Fyne. On their way they spoke to an enthusiastic English pair, working in their garden, who wanted to know off which yacht they had come.During the evening Arcturus and Tunnag came in and one or two motor boats. Zaidie was in when they arrived and Leonora was anchored across Loch Fyne in Buck Bay.All aboard, Margaret and Archie went off to the islet in the harbour to get some roots for their new garden then soon afterwards all turned in, for though it was a glorious looking evening it was perishingly cold and the stove, lit as soon as they anchored, had been very welcome.On Sunday they were again up early and found a dull overcast day. The Pilot, ashore for water, heard a poor weather forecastfrom a fishing board. On the strength of this they hurried breakfast and by  o’clock were away with a south-westerly breeze.The Skipper gave the first beacon a rap with the boom-end as they ran out of the harbour. The beat down to Ardlamontand thee ran the engine for five minutes to get out of a nasty lop. The sun came out for about five minutes but by the time they had reached the Carry Buoythe rain had started and it got heavier and heavier.The wind strengthened with the rain and they moved up very fast into Tighnabruaich Bay then up to Loch Riddon to anchor off the pier at Ormidale. As they passed Tighnabruaich they saw Torridon was on Fulmar’s mooring and they watched her crew panicking to get off before Fulmar arrived. They wondered what the Torridons said when they saw Fulmar pass on through and realised that they could have stayed where they were. As they passed Glen Caladh the new Jansi of Kames passed under a not very healthy-sounding engine.They had lunch and the stove was lit then Margaret and Archie went ashore to visit friends and when they came back they brought with them a big sack of coal . The late afternoon and evening were spent below talking and listening to the rain hammering on the deck.Monday morning it was dry but blowing hard. They got the anchor early and motored to the moorings. The sails were hoisted to dry them and St Roma came close by to make their number and at one time a big school of thrasher whales went through the Kyles heading east and at a great speed.About noon they went ashore for a visit to the hotel and for a run round the Ardlamont road . Back aboard they had lunch and soon after packed up and came home."},{"url":null,"title":"the cinema on wheels returns","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe screen machine will be rolling back into Mid Argyll at the end of the month.Bringing with it a host of movies for film fans the Screen Machine will be in Campbeltown Road car park in Tarbert from Wednesday January  to Thursday January  and Lochgilphead Resource Centre car park from Friday January  to Sunday February .Musical fantasy film Cats, based on the Andrew Lloyd Webber stage musical, features an ensemble cast including James Corden, Judi Dench, Jason Derulo, Idris Elba, Jenner Hudson, Ian McKellen, Taylor Swt, Rebel Wilson, and Francesca Hayward.Also known as Star Wars: Episode IX, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an epic space-opera film.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"hair raising happenings at the co op","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Co-op staff are on a fundraising mission which they hope will raise awareness and help overcome stigma around mental illness.Trusting her hairdresser Nicky MacDougall, from Casa in Ardrishaig, Tina Holloway will have her hair shaved off to raise funds for the Scottish Association for Mental Health .Explaining why she decided to take on the challenge, Tina said: #I didn#t really think before I opened my mouth.

Fulmar got off equal first with half a dozen others and the Bosun, at the tiller, is reported to have had a look of near terror on his face. If he had known that one of the yachts, Sinbad, had lost its rudder during the melee and was virtually out of control he would probably have been more frightened. Two boats, Islay and Saionara, were in trouble with burst and torn mainsails. Fulmar held her position well and was among the first half dozen boats up to Colintraive but thereafter the wind fell light and they got stuck in the south narrows and nearly all the boats passed them – those taking the north channel scoring very decisively.Down the Kerry Kyle they recovered some of the lost ground but when they rounded Ardlamont they were still well down in the tail. They passed through the Skate and this paid handsomely as they got a tremendous lt up the east shore and passed boat after boat – those out in the middle of the loch got stuck and never got going again. Seewolf was lying rd or th at the Skate but she crossed the line a very bad last of the whole fleet. A spell of very calm weather followed while Fulmar was away over at Kilfinnan but, a light air coming away, they managed to cross over to the west shore and there got quite a nice little breeze which brought them along splendidly till they reached the buoys south of the breakwater then it died – absolutely. And it took them half an hour to do the distance.Next day, in a strong easterly, they had a slow and strenuous trip through the canal to Crinan then, borrowing Davie Weston’s dinghy to save launching their own, they went straight out and anchored off the canal entrance.There was a straggling start at .am on Monday owing to there being no gun and no one quite knew when to go but followed Arcturus when she gave a lead. Fulmar was moderately well placed about the middle of the ruck. A quite steady easterly gave them a quick passage to Fladda but, off Sheep, it fell light and all were becalmed. This, of course, suited Fulmarfine as no one was moving and, as long as this was the case, she was piling up a fine credit balance of handicap minutes. She tried to keep as well up to the eastward as possible but did not quite succeed in passing east of Sheep island as Arcturus did .A puffer coming south with her smoke trailing away to the west gave them a hint which few,any, of the others took and they held more and more to the east and, as a consequence, got the first of a fresh easterly breeze and swept past boat after boat, most of which had held down to Mull. By the time they got to Duart and were able to bring the breeze dead astern they were well up in the first half and well ahead of their time allowance. Thereafter it was just a question of #Would the wind hold # Provided it did so they felt they had an excellent chance as, with the hold-up at Sheep, they had accumulated more than half an hour of handicap from the leading boats and had lots in hand for those but a little ahead of them.The wind did hold and Fulmar won the Tobermory Cup and the st prize for the second section of the race which with Saturday’s second prize made a very good showing for the weekend.The Mate, Tar and Skipper, were following the race as best they could from the shore. When they came down Loch Fyne side it was a dead calm and they were very surprised when they got to Tarbert to see the boats, half hidden in the rain, coming round Ardlamont – they had no inkling of the breezy start. In Loch Fyne they watched the very slow progress, then the rain cleared off and they were glad to see the big lt Fulmar got up the east shore after going through Skate. For the last two or three hours things went desperately slowly till late-ish in the evening a little breeze brought in the leading boards but it died and left Fulmar no further from the finishing line than the buoys south of the breakwater – she was well up and ahead of several in the big class and most of the small class. She had only about  yards to do when she stopped and, after hurriedly working out the elapsed time handicaps, the Skipper found she had  minutes in which to do them but she failed by a little over two minutes to do it. The Skipper thought she had won as he thought Vanda had been the leader up till then and it was a disappointment when, checking up, he discovered Sally of Kames was ahead of Vanda and had saved her time by two minutes on Fulmar.The start from Crinan was at .am and the Skipper, Tar and Mate got up at .and went across to see them go. The start was a bit of a fiasco as the officials slept in but all the boatsgot off more or less together. As it happens it was perhaps a good thing as, with all the boats starting together on a short line and with the strong easterly breeze that was then blowing there might, too easily, have been some nasty accidents.The Tar, Skipper and Mate went back to their beds then after breakfast went to Oban with little expectation of seeing anything more of the boats. Again they were surprised when, on going to the summit of the Pulpit Hill in Oban, they saw the leading boats just coming up to Duart – they did not know anything of the hold-up at Sheep.Anxiously they watched a number of boats come into view round a hill on Kerrera and were more than pleased when, well up amongst the leaders and passing boat after boat as they watched, they saw the red gaff sails of Fulmar reaching up the Firth of Lorn then running up the Sound of Mull. They watched until most of the boats were well out of recognition distance up the Sound then went home confident thatconditions remained as they were Fulmar had more than a good chance of winning that leg of the race and, with luck, the whole thing.Extract from The Glasgow Herald of Tuesday, July : #Clyde Cruising ClubIn the early hours of yesterday morning the yachts of the Clyde Cruising Club set off from Crinan on the nd leg of their face from Port Bannatyne to Tobermory. The first part of the race ended at Ardrishaig, after which the yachts went through the Crinan Canal.The winners at Ardrishaig were:-Class . st Sally of Kamesh m s.nd Fulmarh m srd Vandah m sExtract from the Glasgow Herald of Monday, July :-Clyde Cruising ClubThe  yachts which raced from Port Bannatyne to Tobermory under the burgee of the Clyde Cruising Club got a rare dusting and with as much wind as they wished the bigger boats came into their own. The  ton cutter Fulmar, which distinguished herself many years ago as one of the few finishers in a stormy Fastnet race, won the Tobermory Cup for the large class, and the  ton sloop Trefoil captured the Torridon Cup for the small class.Driven hard from Port Bannatyne by a fresh easterly, the yachts found a calm patch off Ardrishaig, but they were blown through the canal to Crinan, where the second leg of the race was sailed in a good easterly breeze, resulting in fast passages.

and embarked on a year-long campaign to eradicate dog fouling.Now, thanks to a successful bid for funding, new bins and bag dispensers have been located throughout the town.ldquoIrsquove always found the notion of dog poo smeared across our streets abhorrent, even as a small child, said community councillor Jackie Couchman.ldquoInnerleithen has a high density of dogs in a relatively small area which magnies the issue.ldquoMost dog owners are responsible and pick up, a sizeable minority do not and, it would seem, will not. I thought it was worth a concerted effort to seewe could make a dference to the state of our streets to benefit everyone. I was prepared to make a personal commitment of time and effort to this cause.The project got off ground last January when Innerleithen community councillors made the decision to try and rid the streets of dog mess.Reflecting on the actions they undertook, Jackie said: ldquoI became involved after Gordon Daly taped plastic bottles to lampposts to dispense free poo bags to those in need.\"Susan Meikle and I offered to help these from supplies Gordon had procured from the Dogs Trust.The following month, the community council was encouraged by local authority councillors to apply for funding through the Localities Area Bid Fund.ldquoThis concentrated my mind and I took it upon myself to complete the application with offers of help from both a previous applicant and The Bridge, said Jackie.ldquoWe heard our project had been shortlisted to be put to the public vote in time for our May community council meeting.But the timetable for the public voting process was disrupted by other political happenings, and after a tense wait and a flurry of activity to encourage voting, good news was delivered.Jackie added: ldquoWe heard our bid was successful in time for our July meeting.\"Various conditions had to be met before the funds could be released, including  percent of the amount applied for supplied by us, copies of our constitution and accounts.ldquoHaving won the funding, final details of ordering, delivery, installation and maintenance had to be agreed.Whilst waiting on the new bins to arrive, the community councillors did not rest on their laurels.With the help of SBC leader Shona Haslam, Jackie and Gordon stencilled anti-fouling signs on problem pavements in Innerleithen.Community councillors also mapped out locations for the new bins and Scottish Borders Council agreed to install these and remove or relocate the redundant ones.ldquoOperationally, the local authority agreed to provide the litter bags and to replenish the poo bags with us taking responsibility for funding them, added Jackie.With the bins now in place, the community council is due to meet on Monday to discuss further fundraising initiatives.The townrsquos community council, in particular, the poo-busting trio of Jackie, Gordon and Susan, have worked tirelessly this last year to combat the dog fouling issue in Innerleithen.Nevertheless, inevitable questions remain.Will they no longer witness the flattened deposit bearing the imprint of a shoe, the stressed parent quickly steering their child away from the offending brown mess, or irritated adult repeatedly scraping their foot off a kerb Probably not says Jackie, adding: ldquoWas it worth it  Yes.\"And in the shorter term it has made a dference.\"Longer term, my feeling is that it will depend on continuing effort and collective ownership of the problem. People have generally been very supportive although every post on social media has triggered lsquothey wonrsquot ever pick up commentsrsquo.\"Despite the campaign Jackie says itrsquos unlikely that everyone will become law abiding citizens and pick up after their dog, but says shersquod do it all again in an effort to keep clean the streets and grass verges of the bonnie town she resides in."},{"url":null,"title":"council-asked-declare-interest-planet","story":"CAMPAIGNERS descended on Thursdays meeting of Scottish Borders Council in a bid to convince the local authority to declare a Climate Emergency.So far  councils across Scotland have made the declaration as efforts continue to halt and reverse the damage being done to the planet.Despite the Extinction Rebellion protest outside the council headquarters at Newtown St Boswells, bosses have yet to issue any statement.Protestor Jennie Gibson said: \"The declaration is the first step to deal with the problem.\"It shows the council takes climate crisis seriously and so should we.\"It means they have to make plans to cut emissions and we can seethey do it or not.

attempted to defend their track record despite being rated amongst the worst performing in Scotland.Figures released by the Local Government Benchmarking Framework last week puts the Newtown St Boswells authority towards the bottom of the heap in most categories.With housing stock transferred over to Scottish Borders Housing Association and all cultural and leisure facilities in the hands of Live Borders, the local authoritys portfolio of responsibility has diminished over the past decade or so.But much of what remains under Scottish Borders Council control is lagging behind other authorities.As well as having the second worst roads in the country, according to the   findings, bosses at Newtown spent less than half the national average on repairs, pound, per kilometre against the Scotland-wide pound,.Although an argument can be made regarding the additional amount of carriageway in the rural Borders, similar authorities, such as Highland, Aberdeenshire, Moray and both North and East Ayrshire, all spent considerably more.Only Dumfries and Galloway, and Eilean Siar authorities spent less during  .Scottish Borders Council also spent below the national average on every aspect of education.Across Scotland the average spend per pupil in secondary education was pound,, while in the Borders it was only pound,.Primary pupil spend in Scotland was pound,, while in the Borders during   it was pound,.And pre-school spend per pupil in the Borders was only pound, against a national average of pound,.The number of sick days taken by teachers in the Borders was also worse than the national average.While spending on frontline education is well below Scottish averages, the amount spent on office-based administration and support across the whole authority during  , at seven percent of budget, was almost double the national level of four percent.Local MSP Christine Grahame believes Scottish Borders Council should re-prioritise its spending.She told us: \"I am sure Borderers will be angry at the information coming to light from this given how clearly it demonstrates the councilrsquos deeply skewed priorities for its spending.ldquoTime and time again constituents have contacted me to complain about the frankly dangerous state of some roads in the Borders and I have repeatedly raised it with SBC.\"To now find out it has the third lowest spend per kilometre on roads in the country, and that the area has the second worst A roads and B roads is an unsuprising but damning indictment of the councilrsquos priorities.ldquoWhy is this Tory-led administration spending poundm on vanity projects like the purchase of the Lowood Estate for speculative development, whilst it underspends on our schools, tourism and helping people back to work  Why does it spends so little on economic development to bring down the  percent of shops that lie empty in our town centres ldquoThere are serious questions for SBC to answer here and I for one will certainly look to see them held to account.Investment in helping people back to work was the second lowest, at . percent, of all the  authorities in Scotland.Scottish Borders Council also spent less than half the national average when it came to economic development and tourism.Across Scotland authorities averaged pound, per , population on attracting tourists and improving the local economy, in the Borders the spend was just pound,.And the figures also show that there was a higher proportion of empty town centre propertiesin the Borders than the Scottish average .Elderly care was also ranked poorly with only  percent of council services rated as good or above - the fourth worst in all Scotland - compared to a national average of  percent.Ron Sutherland, who had a successful career in corporate governance, finance and management, has been a strong critic of spending at Newtown St Boswells in recent years.The retired consultant from Innerleithen told us: \"As those who have attempted in recent times to get to the heart of topical issues, transactions and dealings will already be aware, it is often dficult to ascertain what goes on at SBC, through the barrier of smoke and mirrors around the councils Newtown St Boswells nerve centre.\"It might be thought that senior officials - of which we evidently have many - and elected members prefer to inhabit those parts of

expenditure, or investment of council taxpayers money last year in several key local authority areas of responsibility such as roads, schools and education, tourism, economic and social development, etc. are unsurprising.\"There are fewany bright spots - especially worrying when SBC allocates almost twice the national average funding to administration support, doing little to dispel impressions of a top-heavy, inefficient organisation.\"This resonates with the recent eye-wateringly costly and confused SB Cares debacle - indicative of poor planning and organisational management allied to woefully inept financial control and monitoring by those senior people charged with doing just that, and paid handsomely into the bargain.For the record in the year to March , its last full year of operation, provisional accounts for SB Cares LLP disclosed a net loss of over pound. million, with net current liabilities - effectively, accumulated insolvency - in excess of pound. million - plus an audit report casting material uncertainty and signicant doubt on the organisations viability as a going concern.,params: .push\"In most peoples book, that would read like mismanagement, which would be little short of a scandal.\"Moreover, in the four years of so of employment, the CEO of SB Cares took home more than half a million pounds for his efforts and he was also employed as an executive director of SBC, in clear contravention of relevant guidelines relating to conflict of interest.\"Will anyone be held accountable \"In a statement from Scottish Borders Council, bosses attempted to highlight the amount of money spent with local suppliers and contractors was signicantly higher than the national average.But it didnt mention that only  percent of invoices were paid on time - against a national average of  percent, making it the fth worst for paying bills in the country.Rather than being disappointed SBC Chief Executive Tracey Logan prefers to look at more locally sourced surveys.She said: ldquoThese statistics are just one element of how we regularly monitor and report the performance of the council.\"Many of these figures are not new, and in some areas we believe that some of the local data we collect, for example the Scottish Borders Household Survey and those undertaken with Live Borders customers, are more representative due to the volume of responses received.\"These show much higher levels of satisfaction with services.ldquoHowever, every piece of information on our service delivery is useful, and we will use the statistics and comparison data to look at how we can continue to change, improve and invest to provide the best possible services to the residents of the Scottish Borders.Scottish Borders Council did fare well in council tax collections and support offered for looked-after children.And it has the second highest spend of any authority, at pound, per , population, on parks and outdoor spaces, with the national average being pound,.The signicant spend is down to the investment in new parks and the additional cost of staff from other departments.Council leader Shona Haslam said: \"It is abundantly clear when you look at the full range of data released that council services are under pressure across the country, with average performance falling across many areas.ldquoIn some measures this follows long periods of improvement, suggesting that we may be reaching a tipping point in how council services are being affected by the need for us all to make savings due to the gap between the funding required to maintain and improve services and that actually available.ldquoScottish Borders Council continues to make and maintain progress in some key areas, but we have to be realistic and acknowledge that services, particularly non-statutory ones, are impacted by reductions in spending.\""},{"url":null,"title":"borders-holiday-inspires-authors-debut-novel","story":"A NEW author has set his debut novel

We are a public body\".He said: \"We have looked very carefully at all the options and this site is the only viable one. If the project does not go ahead on this site, it is very dficult to see it going ahead at all.\"The proposed site is on the Gilmerton estate, south of the current museum.Councillors questioned whether a field to the west of the Scheduled Monument had also been looked at and were told that Historic Environment Scotland had said it would not allow the hangar to be built there either.The planned removal of the trees had led to a public outcry, with an online petition against it gaining more than , signatures.The Woodland Trust told the council that replanting trees would not replace some of the ancient woodland which it said would be lostthe plans were given the go ahead.And Councillor Norman Hampshire, planning convenor, pointed out that East Lothian councillors had declared a climate emergency last year.The committee was told it was likely the new trees would take  years before they equalled the positive impact the felled woodland had on the countys carbon footprint.Fellow committee member Councillor Fiona ODonnell said: \"When this council took a decision about climate change we used the word emergency, not down the line, so we cant lose  years.\"I think the loss is not a price worth paying.\"Three councillors supported the plans, which were recommended for approval by planning officers, including Provost John McMillan, who is the administrations economic development spokesperson.He said: \"I believe in the round this will be doing something for public benefit.\"His views were supported by councillors Lachlan Bruce and Katie Mackie, who pointed to the jobs benefit of the new centre and increase in tourism.Councillor Mackie said: \"One of the things I love about East Lothian is its natural heritage but the introduction of  jobs and need for people not to have to commute to Edinburgh for work is really important.\"Councillor Colin McGinn told the committee that a young boy who attended the meeting with family told him when he came in to \"save the trees\".He said: \"This is about their future. If we make a decision to cut down  trees we are doing him a disservice.\"Councillor Jeremy Findlay refused to support the planning application, saying he was not convinced all other options had been considered.He said: \"I would encourage the Museum of Flight to go back to Historic Environment Scotland and have further discussions with them.\"I am not convinced they will turn round and say no, we have not seen any evidence they will.\"A National Museums Scotland spokeswoman said: \"We are disappointed by the outcome of the East Lothian Council planning committee meeting.\"This is an important project for East Lothian. It will ensure the preservation of historically important aircraft, it will also create jobs and play a transformative role within the local tourism economy.\"We will now take stock and review our next steps.The committee rejected the planning application on the grounds it would result in the loss of  trees, to the detriment of the climate of East Lothian and the councils climate policy, by eight votes to three.Councillors who voted against were Jeremy Findlay, Sue Kempson, Fiona ODonnell, Neil Gilbert, John Williamson, Kenny McLeod, Colin McGinn and Norman Hampshire.

After the session, as the children were heading for lunch, a girl from the class came up and said: ldquoI think the moral in that tale is that we should be kind, but that itrsquos often not easy to do.It was a traditional tale in which the tables are turned on a selfish rich man who had shown no compassion, but then hoped for kindness when he was the one in need. In the brief discussion with this young person, we agreed that itrsquos easier to show kindness to someone who we believe truly deserves it.She told me: ldquoI think the woman in the story did the right thing butIrsquom being honest,it had been me I donrsquot knowIrsquod have been able to be kind like her, because Irsquod have wanted revenge. Thatrsquos the problem, I think, we always think about revenge first. It can make us feel better for a short while but really makes things worse, well at least not better anyway. I try to be kind, sometimes it isnrsquot easy, but I try. Kindness is like a seed we have to plant.I shouldnrsquot have been bowled over by this, for I know a -year-old can have wisdom that many so called grown-ups have forgotten. But I was deeply impressed by her reflection on the storyrsquos message, and her honesty and integrity.This conversation also revealed the power of stories to raise moral dilemmas and human issues without finger pointing or being preachy.And she is right, it can often be very dficult to be kind. The world seems so full of stress, selfishness, anger and intolerance that there seems little space for kindness, except towards those we love and care about. On top of that, it seems increasingly dficult to survive, keep a roof above our heads and pay the bills. Kindness begins at home and often there is little energy, emotion or resources left to think or care about others we arenrsquot responsible for.There can even be a real fear thatwe show lsquotoo muchrsquo kindness we risk becoming a doormat, being used or treated unfairly. We can sometimes watch a child being kind to another and it not being reciprocated, and the temptation then is to suggest kindness isnrsquot shown next time.ldquoWe need to teach people a lesson, is often the mantra which derails our instinct to be kind another way of saying we want revenge. And letrsquos be honest: cruel, uncaring and selfish people can take advantage of someonersquos kindness and revenge does often make us feel better, in the short term anyway.But is the answer to allow unkind behaviour to frame the way we want to live and be treated  Do we respond to unkindness with more unkindness in   So consequently, cruelty with more cruelty, intolerance with more intolerance, selfishness with yet more selfishness  Doesnrsquot this mean that we allow lsquothe lessonrsquo to be that kindness doesnrsquot pay  As Gandhi is famously reported to have said: ldquoAn eye for an eye only ends up making the whole world blind.The truth is, kindness is not weakness but strength. It often isnrsquot easy and takes great courage. It doesnrsquot mean that people should not face consequences for their actions, or that people should be asked to forgive the unforgivable. But it does mean not allowing the unkindness of others to define how we are. We should not allow such acts to clip our butterfly wings.What do I mean by this  There is a theory called the lsquobutterfly effectrsquo. In this theory, it is said that the flapping of a butterflyrsquos wings could cause a chain reaction in which a hurricane could be caused on the other side of the planet. It is not meant to be taken literally, but to show that a very small act, although seemingly insignicant in itself, can have huge, unforeseen repercussions.In this way, kindness is a butterfly. Small acts of kindness may have a huge effect that touches people beyond the knowledge of the person who displayed the kindness. Acts of cruelty and hate also have the same power but all the more reason to flutter the wings of kindness so the wind more likely blows in the right direction.In this way, our behaviour is a butterfly. The way we flap its wings can have huge unforeseeable consequences, either for good or bad, both for ourselves and others. When we are kind, we actually makes ourselves happier too.So to make a real dference, we need only do tiny acts that are easily within our power, and as often as we can. A smile, a moment you truly listen to someone, a helping hand, holding the door open, trying to understand how someone feels, making a cup of tea, not meeting anger with anger, trying not to gain revenge but a change of heart and so on.This is what will truly make up the index of a healthy and happy society. And all of us can be players in this, and beneficiaries of our own kindness.David W Orr, a professor of environmental studies and politics, has said: ldquoThe plain fact is that the planet does not need more successful people. But it does desperately need more peacemakers, healers, restorers, storytellers and lovers of every kind.Great words, but that -year-old school girl already got this.

The world will stop this evening to watch a carnival of wealth, adulation, fame, talent, glamour and ndash most of all ndash power. It is a night bestowed with global signicance. Millions around the planet see it as the cultural and artistic heart of the year. Wersquore told that the Oscars matter.But is that true  Do the Oscars say anything about the world we live in, about our culture, our society  Or is it all, as the cynics believe, just an empty, gaudy show that signies nothing Who decides First of all, letrsquos be clear what the Oscars are. Like their British equivalent, the Baftas, the Oscars are an expression of how a very narrow sliver of society sees both culture and the world at a specic moment in time. When it comes to the Oscars, that sliver of society is the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.It is the academyrsquos roughly , members who hand out the gongs. All members are part of the film industry ndash directors, cinematographers, producers ndash but actors make up the biggest proportion, %.Of the academyrsquos active voters, % are white, % male and % over , and about one-third are former Oscar nominees and winners. Given wersquore in Hollywood, the academy also has a liberal bias. Right-wing movies ndash unless yoursquore Clint Eastwood ndash donrsquot get far.For such a youthful art form as cinema, the old, white, wealthy, male demographic is jarring ndash and it lies at the heart of the Oscarsrsquo ersity problem, with not enough black or female artists up for awards.The question of raceThe movie Green Book, which won Oscars in  for Best Picture, Best Original Screenplay and Best Supporting Actor for Mahershala Ali, is a good case study when it comes to liberalism and ersity.In an elevator pitch it sounds the perfect pro-ersity film: a white, working-class man learns to be a better person by working for an intellectual black man.The only problem is the film was hammered for its ldquowhite saviour narrative. In the film, the black guy only learns about himself thanks tothe white guy. Green Book was criticised for perpetuating a fantasy that racism only happened in thepast ndash itrsquos set in the s ndash ratherthan today.Green Book is a perfect example of Hollywood trying to be liberal, but falling on its face with a story about black le filtered through white eyes. If the academy wanted to hand the Best Picture Oscar to a ldquogood film about race last year it could have awarded BlacKkKlansman by Spike Lee.American powerSo the Oscars represent a very narrow worldview. They also represent a very American worldview. Of course, America is the planetrsquos cultural powerhouse, but the Oscars crowd out the vast majority of films which donrsquot come from the English-speaking world.The rules have a built-in bias against foreign films. Any contender for the big awards ndash Best Picture, Actor, Actress, Director, Screenplay ndash must play for seven nights in LA. That might be hard for a brilliant but broke filmmaker from Africa or Asia.The nominee for Best Foreign Film doesnrsquot have to open in America ndash but it does have to be its countryrsquos official selection, which in itself is a mountainous task of networking, campaigning and schmoozing.The schmoozeSpeaking of schmoozing ndash thatrsquos the other problem which erodes belief in the Oscars having real cultural signicance. If you want your film to win you need deep pockets.Winning an Oscar is all about campaigning ndash and campaigning costs. In , Doctor Dolittle was a turkey. Over budget, critically hated and a box office disaster, it still managed to get a Best Picture nomination, and eventually won Best Song and Visual Effects after th Century Fox launched a champagne-fuelled charm offensive for Academy members.In , the schmaltzy Shakespeare In Love beat Saving Private Ryan when Harvey Weinsteinrsquos studio Miramax spent an unheard-of  million on an Oscar campaign.Money, however, does not buy cultural signicance, or lasting appeal. Who cares about Shakespeare InLove today The golden ageSo the Oscars have more than their fair share of problems ndash and itrsquos hardto argue that the awards, as a whole, have something consistently signicant to say about the world, cultureand society.However, that doesnrsquot mean inidual Oscar-winning films arenrsquot important. Many speak directly about societyrsquos big issues, the problems confronting the world and the changing shape of culture. When the Academy gets it right ndash which isnrsquot often ndash it gets it very right.The seventies is a good era to explore ndash after all, itrsquos the golden age of modern cinema. In , Kramer vs Kramer swept the boards, winning five Oscars including Best Picture. It stars Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep, and tells the story of their orce. The film focuses a lot on their child, Billy, caught in the middle.Billy was a symbol of generation X ndash the first generation to grow up with orce normalised. The film explores gender roles ndash who should raise a kid and why  ndash womenrsquos rights, fathersrsquo rights, the growing demands of corporate careerism, work-le balance and single parenthood. Kramer vs Kramer was socially astute and culturally ahead of its time.That same year Apocalypse Now won two technical Oscars ndash Cinematography and Sound. Today, itrsquos Francis Ford Coppolarsquos film which has stood the test of time much more than Kramer vs Kramer.Divorce is no longer a zeitgeist subject, but Apocalypse Now continues to say something culturally signicant: that Western power is dangerous. Often it is films which are nominated for Oscars, but donrsquot scoop the Best Picture award, which make the most interesting cultural statements. In , the academy basically replicated what happened the year before ndash it gave four big gongs to another family drama, Ordinary People.However, Raging Bull ndash hailed as one of the greatest movies ever made, and a film which has easily outlasted its Oscar rivals ndash only won two awards, including Best Actor for Robert De Niro as the boxer Jake LaMotta. It was a study in ldquotoxic masculinity decades before the term was coined.Sometimes, though, the academy just goes a bit mad ndash like in  when it gave four Oscars to Network but still handed the Best Picture award to Sylvester Stallonersquos Rocky. Network is a brutal, brilliant satire, which still says something culturally signicant about the media and society.War: where it all beganIf we go right back to the first Oscars, in , we see the Best Picture winner, the war film Wings, struggling to make sense of the First World War. The US Library of Congress has listed Wings, which starred early screen idol Clara Bow, as a film of ldquocultural signicance because it was a real pioneer in the industry.The following year, , saw cinema still wrestling with the aftermath of war and looming danger in Europe. All Quiet On The Western Front was the big winner. After protests by the Nazi Party in Germany, the film proved its cultural signicance by promptly getting banned.The Second World War profoundly affected the Oscars as neutral America tilted towards Britain. Gone With The Wind ndash although racially unsettling today ndash made clear that war was monstrous. It beat The Wizard Of Oz to the Best Picture award in . Oz, though, summed up better the sense of dislocation, confusion, fear and nostalgia sweeping a world facing global conflict.In , British and American culture fused when Mrs Miniver ndash which tells the story of an ordinary English housewe during wartime ndash took six Oscars, including Best Picture, Director and Actress . Casablanca won Best Picture the following year with a clear message about Americarsquos attachment to Europe: wersquoll always have Paris.The big issuesAs the years march on, we see that so many Oscar nominees were commercially successful but artistic non-entities. The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button, anyone Still, a few of the Best Picture winners stand out, capturing perfectly the spirit of the times in which they were made. On The Waterfront, which won Best Picture in , looks at le from a uniquely th-century working-class perspective. West Side Story in  used the cover of a musical to tackle immigration.In , though, To Kill A Mockingbird ndash a film fuelled by the US civil rights movement ndash lost out to Lawrence Of Arabia. David Leanrsquos epic is a visual delight, but itrsquos a clunking and colonial take on the Arab world.In The Heat Of The Night, the  drama starring Sidney Poitier as a black detective in the Deep South,won Best Picture and put African-Americans front and centre. In , homosexuality was explored in Midnight Cowboy, although the film is critiqued for homophobia today.Mental illness was the theme in when Best Picture went to One Flew Over The Cuckoorsquos Nest. Gandhi in  turned attention to colonialism. Rain Man in  looked at autism ndash albeit in an exceptionally misinformed way. And American Beauty in  grappled with the crisis in masculinity.IdentityFrom the turn of the millennium, it is often who the filmmaker is rather than the film theyrsquove created which makes the biggest cultural statement. The Hurt Locker took six Oscars in  and made history when Kathryn Bigelow became the first woman to win Best Director. An emotionally astute war film, it signalled the power dynamic between the sexes shting both in Hollywood and across the west.Then, in , Moonlight took Best Picture. Itrsquos a film about being black, gay and poor, by a black writer-director, Barry Jenkins, and with an all-black cast. Itrsquos one of those films which crystallised the time in which it was made ndash in Moonlightrsquos case right in the middle of Black Lives Matter.In , the bizarre fairy tale The Shape Of Water won Best Picture. Beneath the surface lay an examination of female sexuality, with all its quirks and wonders laid bare. Its central character, played by Sally Hawkins, may be mute but the story is about women finding their voice in the world of men.This yearrsquos nomineesSo what of tonightrsquos Best Picture nominees  Do they speak to our times  Certainly some do. Joker is perhapsthe film with most cultural clout.Some see it as a comment aboutthe left-behind, gun nuts, socially awkward losers and the alt-right.Thatrsquos mistaken, but evenit weretrue it would show a film unafraid of tackling the big social questions.What Joker really explores is the increasing isolation of modern le, the breakdown of community, the corruption of decency in an amoral world. In the era of social media, hate, and disinformation, Joker couldnrsquot be more of its time. It speaks directly to the experience wersquore all going through right now.However, itrsquos unlikely Joker will win Best Picture ndash though Joaquin Phoenix should be a cert for Best Actor. Joker is too edgy for the academy to give it the top prize.The most likely winner is . Wartime heroism wins awards ndash think Schindlerrsquos List and The Pianist. The only thing that wins more awards than wartime bravery is Meryl Streep ndash nominated a record  times.Sam Mendesrsquo First World War film does speak of something prevalent in our society ndash nostalgia for a glorious past. The veneration of the past lurks within the rise of Western populism. Thatrsquos not to say  isnrsquot a good film, it is ndash itrsquos just that it says something a little disturbing about our current cultural obsessions.The gangster epic The Irishman sees Martin Scorsesenot just to form but also old ground as he rummages through the undergrowth of toxic masculinity again. Jojo Rabbit, a dark fairy tale about le in the Hitler Youth, may seem quirkybut itrsquos also back on safe Oscar territory: wartime heroism.Like Greta Gerwigrsquos multi-nominated Lady Bird in , Little Womencontinuesthe rebalancing of the cultural scalesby telling stories specically about women and by women. The Netflix movie Marriage Story is essentially a Kramer vs Kramer reboot for millennials.Ford v Ferrari finds itself in the slot marked ldquowell-made film that no-one particularly cares about. Still, it had enough star power to ensure nominations. In terms of cultural import, itrsquos al. Think The Big Short from  ndash nominated for five awards, won one. In a decade, few will remember it.Quentin Tarantinorsquos Once Upon A Time In Hollywood is fun, but itrsquos really just an in-joke for Tinsel Town. For comparison, therersquos Robert Altmanrsquos  movie The Player ndash it too was Hollywood on Hollywood and earned a clutch of nominations. Again, few remember or care today.Parasite is the oddball in the mix. Firstly itrsquos foreign ndash and although foreign films rarely make it into the Best Picture category, the last few years saw things change with The Artist, which inexplicably won in , and Roma, which inexplicably lost to Green Book last year.Could a South Korean comedy-horror win Best Picture  If wersquore judging a film on what it says about culture and society then Parasite should be a leading contender. If you want a movie which explores lersquos inequalities and the deadly nature of the rich-poor ide, then pick Parasite.Who emerges as top dog all depends on whether this is a year when the academy gets it right, and rewards a film which explains where we are right now when it comes to culture and society ndash orthe academy gets it wrong and just slaps a gold star on what it thinks is an important film, but is in reality just an ephemeral piece of entertaining fluff which says nothing about the world."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-gardens-scheme-peek-secret-spaces","story":"In a tiny corner of what was once Glasgowrsquos shipbuilding heartland, bordered by a steel spiked fence and overlooked by a car park, a garden oasis waits to wake from its slumber.Lovingly created on a derelict site of a former shipyard, the delphiniums, ornamental grasses and gerbera of the Duchess of Montrose Memorial Garden have brightened its small corner of Govan since it openedlast summer.Normally restricted to a select few visitors, the city garden is tiny compared with the manicured grandeur of Gardyne Castle,  miles north in Angus, with its perfectly pruned knot garden, bluebell wood, fishpond and immaculate lawn.Meanwhile, at the rear of a fairly ordinary semi-detached house in an ordinary street in Ayrshire, therersquos an extraordinary garden growing ndash exotic tree ferns, towering bamboo and feathery palms have turned what wasa bog-standard Scottish back garden with typically crumbling shed and untameable ivy into a minitropical jungle.For gardeners who have not been blessed with a single green finger, these and dozens of other lovingly nurtured and weather-defying gardens are either something to aim for or a reason to just throw in the trowel.They are among hundreds of gardens up and down the country now being pruned and planted in preparation for Scotlandrsquos Gardens Scheme, an annual showcase which celebrates the often hidden beauty of the nationrsquos private havens, community allotments and therapeutic school and retirement home gardens.Many of the  gardens taking part are labours of love, growing in defiance of wild Scottish weather and carefully cultivated by gardeners more likely to be found dusting the rose bushes than relaxing on a recliner wondering why the freesias have died.Around % of gardens involved in this yearrsquos scheme feature specially created wildle areas designed to attract birds, bees, butterflies and bugs ndash inspiration, the organisers hope, for visitors to encourage bioersity in their own gardens.The scheme sees gardens open to visitors at certain times throughout the year or by appointment, and includes  which will open for the first time ndash among them social support charity The Preshal Trustrsquos Govan garden.Some seem to defy the odds: at the most northerly garden, Norby at Burnside in Sandness, Shetland, Chinese tree peonies, shrub roses, lilies, hellebores, and grasses fromNew Zealand thrive despite the exposed landscape.And at Leathad Ard, Upper Carloway on Lewis, the owners refused to be deterred by the westerly winds, challenging hillside setting and surrounding peat bog to create a garden of colourful herbaceous borders, exposed beds packed with delicate blooms, fruit orchards, and vegetable patches.The scheme asks visitors to pay a small fee to visit each garden which then goes towards a range of charities, infor a look at often hidden back gardens and private woodlands where wildle thrive, and snowdrops and bluebells carpet the floor.Visitors who make an appointment to visit  Burnton Road in Dalrymple will step from a typical Ayrshire street tino a tropical haven. ldquoThe garden was fairly awful when we moved here, says David Blatchford, who since  has transformed the triangular corner plot into a welcoming jungle.ldquoBack then it was just a lawn, a gigantic leylandii, ivy and a crumbling shed.While that may sound like most Scottish gardens, David and his we Margaret planned ahead and brought favourite tree ferns and bamboo from their former property to plant.With the leylandii, ivy and shed gone, they created raised beds to tackle the dearth of topsoil and laid a serpentine path which now meanders through the dense, lush foliage, past giant, glossy leaves and towering palms.Bonsai and potted terrestrial ferns including rare blechnum species and succulents rest on the patio. Outside, hardy and tender bromeliads and aroids share space with lilies, cannas, gingers and bursts of Mexicanfeather grass.At the front of the garden, dahlias and a Chinese imported buddleia bring bursts of colour and dozens of red admiral butterflies.ldquoWe do have time to sit in the garden and enjoy it, he adds. ldquoAnd we do have a washing line ndash you just donrsquot see it hidden behind the bamboo.Around three hoursrsquo drive away, at Barochreal in Kilninver near Oban, a remarkable -year labour of love has seen its hard-working owners, Nigel and Antoinette Mitchell, scrape and shovel scrub grass and old sheep pens into a colourful haven.The pretty garden which hugs their white-walled, two-storey home buzzes with bees from their hives.A wild garden and rockery complement a rose garden created from a former sheep fank while raised beds have been made using stone left behind when the old dairy was taken down. Further on, their  acres extend to a waterfall and a small glen where  species of moth and more than  species of wildflowers thrive, including three types of wild orchid, and red squirrels and pine martens make their home.ldquoItrsquos slowly evolved, says Antoinette. ldquoAs one thing is done, another comes up. It takes all our energy to keep it going.

rarest of them all, is usually found hiding behind a cairn, up a tree or curled up in a ball, snoozing.At noon most days, however, visitors to the Highland Wildle Park at Kincraig near Aviemore will be treated to a fleeting glimpse of its bushy tail, mean green-yellow eyes and thick fur, as one of the nationrsquos most elusive creatures emerges to snatch a lump of meat for lunch before retreating to the shadows.For most park visitors, that brief glimpse of the Scottish wildcats is at the top of their list of must-see attractions, possibly alongside Hamish the juvenile polar bear, a national treasure and the first cub born in the UK for  years, and the Amur tiger.What they wonrsquot see, however, is a massive behind-the-scenes effort spanning the UK and Europe, and which itrsquos hoped will throw a leline to ensuring Scottish wildcats ndash  times more endangered than the giant panda ndash will not just be around for generations to come, but could eventually become established in locations right across Scotland.Tucked out of sight on a patch of the Royal Zoological Society of Scotlandrsquos park which is out of bounds to visitors, a new wildcat reintroduction centre is about to become \"ground zero\" for the survival of a fragile species entwined in Scottish national identity but currently in a fierce catfight for its very survival.A combination of cross-breeding with feral and domestic cats, habitat loss, road accidents, historic persecution and disease has all but wiped out the purest of Scotlandrsquos treasured wildcat population.Left to their own devices, the tiny number with genes not already severely diluted from mating with outsiders, will dwindle, fade and disappear.Hopes are now pinned on a pound. million scheme led by the Royal Zoological Society of Scotlandand, almost certainly, some amorous intervention from the speciesrsquo closest European cousins to help the Scottish wildcat get back on its feet.By the end of this year, the first wildcats will be in settled in at the new reintroduction centre,  breeding pairs which ndash assuming nature takes it course ndash should produce enough healthy offspring to see  wildcats reintroduced to carefully picked spots in the Cairngorms over a three-year period.Eventually itrsquos hoped they could be reintroduced where in Scotland ndash raising the possibility of the creatures becoming commonplace across the country.Although, according to David Barclay, cat conservation project officer with the RZSS who currently oversees the  wildcats in the UK-wide breeding programme, the first challenge is to save the handful of remaining Scottish wildcats from extinction.ldquoTherersquos perhaps a very small number of wildcats left in Scotland, he admits. ldquoAnd we have a lot of evidence that says the population is non-viable.ldquoWithout putting more wildcats back, they will almost certainly go extinct in the next few years.ldquoWildcats are in that short list of animals that are iconic species for Scotland, such as the golden eagle and the red squirrel, he adds.ldquoFor Scotland not to have wildcats would be a very sad day.At Kincraig, a recent pound.million EU LIFE grant added to funding from the Garfield Weston Foundation, the National Trust for Scotland, the Peoplersquos Trust for Endangered Species and the European Nature Trust, has enabled work to start on building the new centre.A recruitment drive is now under way to find  staff while plans are being drawn up for a major campaign to encourage domestic cat owners to neuter their pets to avoid the main threat to wildcatsrsquo future, hybridisation.Feral or domestic cats that enter the wildcat reserve will be trapped, neutered, vaccinated and released.Most of the  breeding pairs are expected to be sourced mainly from the UK-wide wildcat breeding programme but some are likely to make the journey from Europe, in particular Spain, where wildcats have been found to share physical similarities to their Scottish relations, and populations are more stable.It may sound like a further erosion of the Scottish wildcatsrsquo precious gene pool, however Mr Barclay insists the European presence will strengthen, not weaken, the wildcatsrsquo chances of survival.ldquoThe European wildcats will improve the gene pool, he states. ldquoThe cat we have is a European wildcat, itrsquos just a dferent population thatrsquos more critically endangered.ldquoIf we have to bring some cats from Europe ndash and it would be a relatively small number ndash we would want to bring them from a population where we feel that there are similarities with Scottish cat.ldquoAnd Spanish wildcats look very similar to Scottish wildcats.ldquoIf you bring wildcats from Europe, you are bringing new genetic material which gives Scottish wildcats a boost in terms of the gene pool.The fight to save Scotlandrsquos wildcats has already crossed international boundaries: as well as working with Scottish Natural Heritage, the Cairngorms National Park Authority and Forestry and Land Scotland, the RSZZ Saving Wildcats project ndash the only official wildcats project in the country ndash is partnered with Swedish wildle park Nordenrsquos Ark, and Spainrsquos Junta De Andaluciacutea, which led the successful recovery of the Iberian lynx.It has been boosted by the arrival of two potential \"Adam and Eve\" wildcats: male and female, both accidentally trapped, both found to have surprisingly strong wildcat genes.While the male is now at an English zoo where itrsquos hoped nature will soon play its part in boosting wildcat numbers, the female, Lossie, has already produced five kittens from two litters.Last year, one of her offspring, Katrine, delivered her first litter ndash four kittens, each carrying on its tiny shoulders the future of a species which has roamed Scotlandrsquos hills since the Ice Age.ldquoFor next few years itrsquos about getting all the right tools in one place so we can create a viable, sustainable population of wildcats in one location, adds Mr Barclay.ldquoOnce we have been through that process and know that the reintroduction technology works, then we can replicate that across Scotland.ldquoThe crucial element is controlling the threat: we canrsquot release them until the threat is removed, and one of the biggest threats in hybrid and domestic cats.The reintroduction of wildcats would follow in the wake of the reintroduction of sea eagles, water voles and beavers to the wild ndash each native to Scotland but brought to extinction through hunting and loss of habitat.The wildcatsrsquocould also pave the way for other animals including lynx and wolves. Campaign group Rewilding Britain has also suggested the reintroduction of long-gone species including the dalmatian pelican, bison, boar and moose.Worryingly, however, are further signs that Scottish wildcats ndash and in some cases their European cousins ndash are hanging by the thinnest of threads.Last month an international genetic study of wildcats in  European countries published in the journal Conservation Genetics warned it had failed to identy a single pure wildcat in Scotland.Across Europe, wildcat numbers were also found to be affected by hybridisation, with the first example of a hybrid cat in the Eastern Alps of Austria.ldquoIn Scotland, we found exclusively hybrids of dferent classes, indicating hybridisation has been occurring for several generations, it states. ldquoAll samples from Scotland were identied as hybridshellip supporting previous findings that the genetic integrity of that wildcat population has been seriously compromised.It also presented a dire warning for the future of the species.ldquoFrequent hybridisation with the domestic cat may regionally threaten the genetic integrity of the European wildcat, as documented by the example of the wildcat in Scotland, it adds, ldquopotentially leading even to the genetic extinction of local populations."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-ferry-fiasco-tangled-web-operators-owners-works-theory-least","story":"Victorian steamship tycoon David MacBrayne left his thriving business to his son and namesake in .Soon the fleet, connecting Glasgow to the isles and peninsulas of one of the worldrsquos longest coastlines, was to peak at  packet ships.It was never to be so big again, even more than century later.:Scottish ferries fiasco: competition watchdog issues stark warning to SNPOn the eve of the Great Depression, the MacBraynes sold out their family firm.

Like CML, CMAL is owned by the Scottish Government.This has been how ferries have been run in Scotland since the last year of the old Scottish Executive.

Last week, the businessman took aim at his one-time customers again. His point: they should not exist at all.ldquoWe donrsquot need CMAL to be there, the businessman told MSPs investigating how his contract had failed. ldquoBefore, it worked perfectly well with CalMac. It is surplus to requirements.McColl said CMAL executives had been civil in person but described a relationship which, via email, became testier. The businessman blames changes to spec on the boats he built from CMAL. The old CalMac, he said, ldquoknew what they wanted.

The tale is not strictly accurate, however. On the first day of coverage there was no mention of Aberdeen on the next there was a subheading, ldquoAberdeen people on the Titanic, but it was some way down the page. Still, the legend persists.Over the years, the Scottish media as a whole has become adept at putting a kilt on items when required. Occasionally, London-based political programmes have a chance tothe compliment and feature Scottish stories, but they rarely do.Yesterday was a prime example. As you may have noticed, there was a big story in Scotland last week. Finance Secretary, text messages scandal, having to resign on day of his budget, ring a bell  While one did not expect The Andrew Marr Show and Sky Newsrsquo Ridge on Sunday to take the Derek Mackay story and go wall to wall with it, the subject was surely worth a stand-alone interview.: Beginning of the end for SNP Instead, the line-up on Marr was Liu Xiamoing, the Chinese ambassador to the UK, Dr Rosena Allin-Khan, who is standing for the deputy leadership of Labour, and Justice Secretary Robert Buckland. Sophy Ridge, meanwhile, spoke to Andy Burnham, the mayor of Manchester, Dawn Butler MP, another Labour deputy leadership candidate, former Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, and the Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick.Of the two line-ups, perhaps only Ambassador Liu was of direct relevance to viewers in Scotland. Given the threat from coronavirus, what the Chinese Government has to say is of vital importance to everyone on the planet. ldquoWe believe the virus is controllable, preventable, curable, said the ambassador.Nor did Scotland come up in the paper review on Marr. No surprise there, since the Scottish Sunday newspapers do not feature unless the programme has decamped north. Yet Broadcasting House, in many ways the Radio  equivalent of Marrrsquos show, makes a point of inviting Scottish paper reviewers on to the programme now and then, and encourages them to talk about stories from their patch. How dficult would it be for the Marr team to set up a link to Scotland, or Wales and Northern Ireland, to find out what stories are making the headlines in the rest of the UK Perhaps in the case of Marr the thinking was to leave the Mackay story to Sunday Politics Scotland. It was the first topic in host Gordon Brewerrsquos review of the week with Jenni Davidson of Holyrood magazine and Peter Geoghegan, investigative journalist with the website openDemocracy.The main interview was a pre-recorded sit down between Brewer and Keith Brown, Depute Leader of the SNP. The news line from this was Mr Brown, at the third time of asking, saying it was very dficult to see how Derek Mackay could continue as an MSP.: Keith Brown interviewTalk eventually turned to the budget. Some % of people in Scotland were now paying more tax, said Brewer. According to SPICE, Holyroodrsquos research arm, he went on, the Scottish Government raised poundm more than it wouldit stuck with the UK policy. But when the block grant adjustment was taken into account the Scottish Government ended up with just poundm more.ldquoPeople in Scotland might be prepared to pay more taxthey thought the money was going somewhere useful, said Brewer.Brown said the money was going somewhere useful, public services, and that the majority of people in Scotland paid less tax than they would in the rest of the UK. ldquoScotlandrsquos got the lowest tax rate in the whole of the UK,\" he said.Mr Brown, a former Cabinet Secretary for the economy, did not move off the front foot. It was a robust ding-dong, as it should have been, ending with a challenge from Mr Brown when the looming shortfall in tax receipts was brought up.: Put PM on notice on indyrefldquoLook at the whole context in which we have this budget, said the constituency MSP for Clackmannanshire and Dunblane. ldquoI asked you on this programme a year or so ago why you never interview UK finance ministers hellipBrewer interrupted to promptly invite Chancellor Sajid Javid on to the show. ldquoIf hersquos watching, happy to interview him.Why donrsquot UK Ministers come on to Scottish television as a matter of course  You could argue it was not constitutionally polite to ask London-based Ministers when there are opposition politicians here who could step in.

The fact that she isnrsquot facing a court made it impossible to judge that issue, so instead I asked why the same offence ndash in this case, allegedly careless or reckless driving ndash should receive minor penalties when no harm ensues, and potentially a very serious one , when the worst happens.The conclusion must be that the law is pragmatic and worldly, rather than dealing with abstract ethical questions. The moral issue raised by careless driving is the same whether or not therersquos an accident, but real-world effects are hugely dferent.

The case of Mike Lynch, a British businessman who is to be extradited to America on fraud charges, is a further example of what looks like political expediency winning out over justice.In , the Crown Prosecution Service found no grounds for prosecuting Dr Lynch, who was running a UK company listed on the London Stock Exchange, governed by English law and UK accounting practices.

Unless that changes, Orkney will be left with the oldest fleet and the highest fares in the country — and that can only be described as blatant discrimination.”In a response to Councillor Stockan, the minister for energy, connectivity and the islands, Paul Wheelhouse, says Orkney Islands Council is “wholly responsible for the inter-island ferry services which they provide.”He says minsters understand the “signicant financial challenges that can fall on inidual local authorities with responsibility for ferries” and that the Government has “made clear our commitment to Orkney’s internal ferry services” with additional funding of £. million in total over the past two years.Councillor Stockan said: “I am extremely disappointed that the First Minister has chosen not to respond to our considerable concerns directly, or to meet with me to discuss an issue of fundamental importance to our community.“I can only describe the Government’s current position as irrefutable discrimination against the people of Orkney. The additional funding we received over the last two years was welcome, but fell far short of what is needed to fully fund our internal ferry service.“I call on the Government to address this when the budget is published this week — and I have asked the other parties at Holyrood to offer us their full support in securing full and fair funding for Orkney.“The running and replacement costs of Western Isles ferries are fully subsidised by the Government. It is only right and proper that we in Orkney should be treated in the same way.”In the letter, Councillor Stockan also criticises the Government for its continued failure to introduce Road Equivalent Tarf on routes linking Orkney to the Scottish Mainland.“The roll-out of RET began on West of Scotland ferry routes more than a decade ago, reducing fares for local people and visitors alike,” he added.“It is our firm belief that there is no impediment preventing RET being introduced on Orkney routes, and that any further delay is unfair and will result in signicant prejudice against local ferry users.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He played in bands in London, rubbing shoulders with the Rolling Stones, Eric Clapton and his jamming buddy, Ritchie Blackmore, who went on to form the legendary rock bands Deep Purple and Rainbow.He even jammed at a party with Cream bassist and vocalist, Jack Bruce.A visit from Screaming Lord Sutch, who wanted him to go to Germany with him as a bass playermade Jim think again about a career in rock music.His first passion was always art, and comic book art was his favourite genre.He declined Lord Sutch’s offer and after a few years ed to his beloved Orkney. Here he continued drawing for TV comics before working for AD. He was then head-hunted by the American giants, DC Comics and Marvel Comics.Sadly, Jim suffered with Parkinson’s Disease for over  years and passed away on December , .Despite the diagnosis he continued drawing, painting and writing original sci-fi stories for many years.This celebration of his le and art is dferent from other recent exhibitions, as it contains his le story, original artwork and artefacts relating to him.It also features many Orkney related pieces, rather than just sci-fi heroes like Judge Dredd and Batman.Local characters from the th century hang alongside paintings showing the story of St Magnus, wartime Hoy and illustrations from books, like The Bard of Ballarat and Willick o’ Pirliebraes.Jim’s we, Wendy, said: “I am delighted that the Orkney Museum is having an exhibition of my late husband Jim’s work.“The fact that a young boy from the small Orkney island of Hoy should become world famous in his chosen field of comic book illustration is an achievement in itself, but there were many other aspects to Jim’s le.“This exhibition gives an insight into his early le in Hoy, as well, as his time in the RAF and the excitement of being in the London music scene during the ‘swinging sixties’.“I think it is a true reflection of the times he lived in and I hope it will interest the folk who see it.”The Orkney Museum is open Monday to Saturday, .am-.pm, .pm-pm.

And, just to be clear, it would be equally as seriousthe teenager in question had been a girl.It is likely there is cross-party agreement that the -year-old Mackay should now stand down as MSP for Renfrewshire North and West. However, Nicola Sturgeon was right when she said that “no matter how upset and shocked all of us are in these situations, there’s a need for due process”.Despite the scale of the justied outrage, the full facts need to be established in a calm and considered way. After all, there may be questions for others to answer.It has long been known that those in positions of power will sometimes abuse it, but the MeToo movement should have spelt out the full consequences to anyone failing to grasp them.Once such conduct might have been brushed under the carpet, but society has changed, considerably and for the better, in refusing to tolerate it.MSPs are the democratically elected leaders of this country and their actions must be beyond reproach. It is, or at least should be, part of their job to send a message to those in positions of power in wider society about what is and is not acceptable behaviour.And an MSP, let alone a Cabinet minister, sending scores of unsolicited messages of the type described to a -year-old is, in the words of the First Minister, “unacceptable”.

I already knew that the library held old copies of newspapers from previous research but I was unaware of the sheer volume of information available, and the fact that the library holds documents dating back to the early s.The open day allowed members of the public to come in, ask questions, get to know the department and find out how to use the resources to discover their family history and also the story of Ballymena‘ was like years ago’s growth as a town.The Heritage Collection will mean dferent things to dferent people. Some will have a purpose for their search, such as finding a long lost relative or tracing a map of their home area from years gone by. Others will simply visit and get lost in the vast records, pictures and resources on offer.As a bit of a history buff, I was transported back to my university and school days as Daniel Brown, the senior library assistant for the Heritage Department spoke of some of the hidden treasures within the library.He said past records of the old workhouse are available, giving an extraordinary insight into who was actually in the dreaded facility down through the years, and also into the meetings held by some of the officers.We have artefacts dating back hundreds of years. Some are very valuable to us today, such as a complete map of the original Adair estate from  as much can be learned from this. We also have lots of interesting memorabilia including war rationing books and images of the Queens visit to Ballymena after her coronation.Daniel, who has a personal interest in history, really enjoys showing people around the department, whether they be locals or from further afield.He told me: Weve had many tourists come in, especially Americans who are keen to learn more about their ancestry and research old family names. Its interesting looking back and helping people discover where they come from!You can also trace old church history through births, deaths and marriages, communion and membership rolls and even church offerings.It was down this path that I met Mary Carson and Anne McCaughey as they browsed through the pew rental records of Buckna Presbyterian Church dating back to .Both ladies are members of the Broughshane History Society and were looking through the old records searching for ious recognisable names, however their inidual interest in local and family history was not hard to see.Mary spoke about tracing her family tree and how her curiosity was fuelled by seeing two old pictures of her grandparents at her aunt’s house.She followed rthe trail to a local heritage collection where she was able to find out through old newspapers that her grandfather’s death had made front page news many years before.Her search also revealed that a family member she always believed to be her uncle actually turned out to be her cousin!Researching and delving into the past is so interesting in my opinion, and can also be rewarding, Mary told me. I have found out that Im related to, so many people I didnt know about.Anne agreed, and was full of praise for the resources available in the library. She recalled happy times of listening to older family members talk about the past but said it is often not like that today.Today the younger generation dont seem to be as interested. They are busy working on phones or listening to their earphones that they dont seem to care whats going on around them or what has went before, so they are going to have to depend on information and places like this library to trace their past.As I left them to their church history search, my eyes were drawn to the vast arrays of cases containing maps along a wall.Here there are ordnance survey maps from the s right up to the s. There are also Grfith valuation maps for Co. Antrim and Co. Londonderry as well as th century town plans and local government maps - it really is a local history lovers dream!There are far too many resources to list, but some that need a mention include the vast photograph collection from around Co. Antrim as well as multiple information packs on local schools, people and places all arranged by location and subject.Two of the special collections housed in Ballymena library is the Langford Lodge Collection and the  census for parishes in Co. Antrim.The Collection Officer for the library is Maria Diamond, who is always on hand to direct the public to what they are looking for.She was keen to point out the many online resources made available by the library, so as your search doesnt have to end when you go home!Family history and researching your ancestry has really taken off in the last few years, Maria told me.Therefore we have listed many online resources that can help people trace their history in their own time, or when the library may be closed.Maria enjoys her job, and said she has noticed an increase in the number of people using the department.We are generally a busy department, and we try to always be on hand to help guide people to their desired field of study.“We also enjoy welcoming groups and school classes to the Heritage Collection and tailor the activities to their age or field of study. We have lots of resources for children, and a wealth of information on the local area and how it was affected during major events in history, such as the two world wars or the famine. Teachers or groups just need to get in touch to arrange a visit.I was thoroughly impressed by my visit to the local studies department.Yes, I knew alot of information was available, however I was overwhelmed by the sheer volume of resources, how far back it dated and the way in which it was displayed.No matter what period you are interested in, or what local area there is sure to be some information that will aid your study.My visit to the Cultural heritage open day may have been for business, but my next visit to discover Ballymena of old will more than likely be for pleasure!

He attended St Mary’s Primary School in Portglenone and St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena.Speaking about his early involvement in music, he said: My parents didn’t play but they sent all of us to music and dancing for years and drove us to lessons and events every night of the week, I owe them a lot for that. They had a keen interest and were very supportive.I was sent to the local Comhaltas Ceoltoacuteiriacute Eacuteireannbranch in Portglenone when I was around .I started tin whistle classes with the late John Kennedy first, then progressed onto the button accordion with Tommy Doherty.My parents then started taking us to The Crosskey’s Inn every week for sessions and I also joined the Comahltas branch there too.That place had a huge effect on me, there were great musicians there of all ages and they really helped cultivate my interest growing up. I still go there when I can.As part of the Crosskeys Comhaltas we won many All-Irelands. We had a great gang at the time along with dedicated parents that were also passionate about the music.Going to the Fleadhs was as much about socialising with other kids in music as it was competing. We got up to all sorts of ilment that I won’t get into here!I started on the tin whistle, moved to button accordion then started to teach myself guitar when I was . I quickly became obsessed with the guitar.Its such a versatile instrument and one that you can literally play or learn any style of music on.From playing the guitar I was able to give a few other stringed instruments a go - bouzouki, tenor guitar, bass, electric guitar.Its not a big stretch to adapt the same skills on guitar over to other instruments, and its nice to have dferent colours available, especially when writing.Sometimes I write on the piano - because I’m not great at playing piano, you’re forced to think dferently and that can work in your favour.In terms of my influences, for the accordion it would be Mairtin OConnor or Dermot Byrne. For the guitar, its harder to narrow it down, but three that stand out are Arty Mc Glynn, Steve Cooney and John Doyle. My own style is probably some hybrid mix of those three.I have worked with Grammy nominated fiddler Liz Carroll, folk singer Karan Casey, Duke Special, Liam O’Maonlaiand Bela Fleck.I am involved with ‘Ulaid’ with John Mc Sherry and Donal O’Connor, and Scottish group ‘Fiddlers Bid’. As a guitar player I regularly work with a lot of other traditional bands including Lunasa, Flook, Buille, and the Mairtin O’Connor Band.BEOGABeoga was formed while Seaacuten was a pupil at St Louis Grammar School.He continued: At St Louis, I was involved with the Traditional Group the whole time I was there.Frank Cassidy directed it and was always very encouraging. We competed in ‘Slogadh’ competitionsand had great craic travelling around to the dferent competitions.Beoga was formed around this time and the teachers were very understanding about me missing days here and there to play gigs.I used to go to the States for these long weekends and be catching up on school work on the plane home.Whilst at St Louis I never actually studied music as an option. I didn’t have a classical background and for some reason never thought it would be a viable career option!Whilst studying for my A levels, I started to become really obsessed with music and decided that was it - I couldn’t even think about doing anything .Up until that point I was looking at careers in IT. I heard about a new course in University of Limerick offering a degree in Irish music, that didn’t require A level music, you just had to go for an interview and perform.I got in anyway and I met Niamh there. We were in the same class and became big pals and she ended up joining the band.She’s an amazing fiddle player and singer and I’m lucky to have found her!ED SHEERANBeoga have been together for around  years and they have been afforded the opportunity to travel the world doing what they love.Seaacuten said: We’ve toured a lot around Europe and North America but have also been lucky to tour in more exotic places like Japan, Australia and Russia. We’re travelling a bit less now, thankfully, but at one stage I was definitely seeing more of the band than my own family.One of the biggest audiences the band have performed to was a , strong crowd at the Glastonbury festival in  alongside Ed Sheeran.Sheeran, whose grandparents hail from the Emerald Isle, is well-known for his love of Irish traditional and folk music, even recording a version of The Parting Glass.He has said that one of his earliest musical memories is listening to the Irish Heartbeat album by Van Morrison and The Chieftains and he is also a fan of The Bothy Band and Planxty. Close friend of the band, Foy Vance, shares the same record label as Sheeran and had been supporting him on tour. They had listened to a few of Beogas tunes on the road, and Ed reached out to the band to help with his album.Seaacuten explained: We went to over to his house in Suffolk for a couple of days. It was all very relaxed, he made everyone feel completely at ease.The weather was amazing so we were outside in the garden a lot. We played on four tracks and two made it to the album so we’re delighted.One of them, ‘Galway Girl’, came about just jamming in the garden outside the studio. He was completely sound, we stayed in his house and had a few beers and even played a game of football at one stage.Working with Ed has presented a lot of new opportunities to play and write with other artists.Our friend Foy Vance was the guy responsible for introducing us to Ed. We’ve written a good few songs with Foy now and will hopefully keep creating more with him, he’s an amazing singer and an even more amazing songwriter and is finally being recognised as such.We’ve also worked with Johnny McDaid on the songwriting and production side of things, although he’s been crazy busy since Snow Patrol started touring again.Just recently we’ve been writing a bit with Cormac Neeson from ‘The Answer’. The collaborations are really exciting to me, you just don’t know whats going to come out of a writing session but that buzz of finishing the day with a song is a real high.Seaacuten believes there is a great local traditional music scene stating: I think traditional music is stronger than ever.He encourages all age groups to get involved and give it a try, commenting: If I had any advice, it would be to not to get too worked up about competitions and instead focus more on the social side of the music.While competitions can be good to focus on something, it can put a lot of unnecessary pressure on kids.In his rare free time, Seaacuten has a purpose built recording studio in Portglenone called Bannview Studios.He has been recording for about  years and recently moved into his current space about five years ago.He said:I regularly engineer and produce other artists here, so that keeps me busy outside of the bands schedule.Beoga will be releasing a new album in the Spring. It will include singles released over the last few months along with some new songs and instrumentals that the group have been working on over the last year.Beogas latest release is called ‘Make a Mark’ and features Co. Down singer Ryan Mc Mullan.

I’ve written about music and been to a lot of concerts over the years. The list below is typical of the tracks that stand out in my memory. I haven’t mentioned the Small Faces or Bruce Springsteen, SLF or other old favourites. I like to hear a lot of contemporary music too. Starchild and the New Romantic for example - a NY soulster I came across last week. Locally, Brand New Friend from Castlerock, are an outstanding punk pop sound. Anyway, here goes…!. Town Called Malice - The Jam. Laser eyed social poetry from Weller, tight Tamla baseline from Foxton and finger clicking rhythm from Buckler. Classic mod. . The Highest Apple - Runrig. Spiritual Scots Gaelic song. Our wedding dance, along with Van the Man of course,  years ago. . This Beautul Day - Levi Jackson. I used to be a Northern Soul DJ and had quite a collection of original vinyl singles. I love the genre still. This track has it all: dance, clear gospel uplt, a black civil rights cry for hope. It’s worth hundreds. I once tried to buy it on eBay behind my we’s back. Thankfully the bid didn’t make it. Confession is good for the soul. . Kennedy - The Wedding Present. Indie student guitar based noise. Great band live from the late s. Still going. Much the same as Copper Blue by Sugar - another favorite indie band.. Live Forever - Oasis. Slightly later and closer to the football culture of which I was a part in my youth. I interviewed them twice for music fanzines before they were famous. Influenced greatly by the Stone Roses - another favourite band. . At Least That’s What You Said - Wilco. Existential American alternative musings. Another great band live. Profound sentiments from Jeff Tweedy.. So Danco Samba - Stan Getz. Much into jazz as I’ve aged. I love Mile Davis up to the late s. This track is gentle samba. Relaxing.. Prelude to Cello Solo No.  in G Major- Pierre Fournier. One of the most moving pieces of music I’ve ever heard. I feel unworthy when I hear it. It touches the eternal. . In the Hours - Emily Deloach, Incredible Grace. I listen to Christian praise a lot, it comes with the calling. This track oozes gratitude for the Gospel. Always make me thankful. I love City Alight songs and a Presbyterian praise group called Red Mountain.. Dig a Little Deeper - The Watson Twins. Smoky, sultry, southern Americana. Played this song driving through mid State Tennessee last year. Right song in the right place. Something like Lucinda Williams or Gillian Welch.

During treatment for the condition, she developed the rare le threatening condition necrotizing fasciitis, also known as the flesh eating disease, resulting in surgeons removing large parts of the soft tissue in her face.Despite the trauma, Janine survived but her story made local headlines back in February  when she approached the North Belfast News for help after suffering abuse on the street and online because of the way she looks.In a heartbreaking interview, she revealed that she’d had to start wearing earphones when she left the house to block out the abuse and insults she was receiving from young people.

He has alerted the relevant authorities. The site is just yards from the St Gall’s GAC clubrooms. Belfast City Council waste bags, household fridges, cemetery headstones, construction rubble, wood and huge amounts of other waste have een dumped on to the land and the massive mound is sliding close to the Ballymurphy Stream.The land is known as Milltown Glen and is situated between Maguire’s Garage, Milltown Cemetery and the Bog Meadows.Michael Culbert of St Gall’s GAC said that the issue of land ownership needs to be claried. “There is a gateway that runs from Milltown Cemetery, a lane, and it’s that land that is being dumped on,” he said. “We want a clean environment, we care about the environment. We have all age groups at St Gall’s, from six-year-olds up and have been in this area for approximately  years. We have never seen the like of this. This is a beautul glen, you have the Bog Meadows and here it’s the epitome of fly tipping. This is going on in the heart of West Belfast and it’s not on. We need someone with responsibility to hold whoever is doing this to account for the contamination of this area. We don’t want the river polluted.“It needs to stop and it needs to be cleared up and now our local councillor Steven Corr has taken up this issue.”Ulster Wildle Nature Reserve Officer Deborah McLaughlin told the Andersonstown News that the dumping has got worse since the start of the New Year.“This is an absolute eyesore and I have contact DAERAin relation to it as a lot of the rubbish will end up in the stream,” she said. “We are concerned at the level of fly tipping going on and concerned for health and safety. DAERA are aware of the issue and at the minute we are waiting to hear back from them.”Local Sinn Féin Councillor Steven Corr said the illegal dumping is “destroying the landscape”.“What we are seeing is a localised environmental nightmare,” he went on. “We are only a few feet away from this stream being contaminated. I can’t get my head around why somebody thinks it’s ok to do this. There are lorry loads of rubbish being dumped down a riverbank, killing wildle as it goes. I’ve never seen anything like this, on this scale, in West Belfast. This is fly tipping on an industrial scale, there is industrial waste on the site, glass, headstones. There is confusion as to who is responsible for the land but we would be calling on the Rivers Agency and the NIEAto work with us. Belfast City Council have offered support as their bags are also being dumped on the site. This land needs to be secured as a matter of urgency.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"martin rings the bell for the final time","story":"THE beginning of February will mark the start of spring and change for one West Belfast primary school principal as he prepares to retire.Holy Child Primary School principal Martin Short, himself a past pupil of the Andersonstown school, will hear the bell ring for the last time this week as he calls an end to the role that he has held for the past  years.“I started at Holy Child in September , I’m a local guy, came from Slemish Way, my three brothers came here, my sister went here, my three grandchildren are at the school now,” he said.“For me to think back then that I’d be the Principal of the school, it never crossed my mind but I’m so proud.”Martin told the Andersonstown News that he always wanted to teach.“I got that from the teaching and education I received at Holy Child, at St Mary’s Grammar School. The expectations in Holy Child are as high as anywhere  in Belfast and that has continued on.”Martin said that there were many moments throughout his career at Holy Child that stand out.“Our standards in literacy and numeracy, I’m very, very proud of those. We received an exceptionally good inspection report in  where there were no areas for improvement.“I took great pride in the whole business of ‘opening up the school’, so that the children could come in earlier for breakfast club, afterschools clubs. I’ve enjoyed working with our parents and the links our school has with the local post primaries in the area.“I think I’ve improved the fabric of the building. I fought to get the new windows installed and the final jigsaw of that project will be completed next month with the new windows in the foyer. We had a new roof, new heating system.“We won the big Gaelic Raffo Cup last year which was a great achievement, our shows, our choir, I’ve always been very proud of the strong links with St Agnes’ parish.”Martin spoke of the challenges he faced as school head.“The big challenge was finance. Budgetary constraints. Also the complexities of the special educational needs that children now encounter and the school having to meet those needs, was a massive challenge – all the while not getting enough funding. The big challenge of mental health within children and the influence of social media. We were three years without an Executive, with no direction from the department and that was a challenge for the school.”While not sailing around the world or taking up golf as part of his retirement plans, Martin explained that he will still be assisting and helping other schools through advisory work with CCMS.“I’ll be onhand to tell people to basically not make the same mistakes I’ve made, we all make mistakes what about trying this, try that and don’t be worrying about that too much.“I have a photo in my office from when I was here as a child, it has always reminded me to keep my feet on the ground and that the children are the most important thing.”When it comes to not pulling into the Holy Child car park next week, Martin said it will be a time of “mixed emotions”.“I will be very sad to leave the children, to leave the staff, the staff have been brilliant, the parents have been brilliant and I will miss that. I’ve done two ‘cycles of seven’,  years but I will be in and out of the school. I’m emotionally attached to this building, I’ve been here since I was four and I’m  now. I’ve loved every minute of it.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"queens uni supporting the spar craic","story":"QUEEN’S University are the latest institution to show their support to the annual SPAR Craic K taking place on St Patrick’s Day throughout the city.Starting at the gates of City Hall, the route will take in the Gaeltacht Quarter as well as the prestigious university, Botanic Avenue and Gardens before the finish line at Ormeau Park.

During this time he was the party#s spokesman on Culture, Arts and Leisure. He later resigned from Sinn Fein in  out of protest over the party#s changing policy around abortion.He joined his we Anne, who had left two years prior, in the newly formed conservative republican party, Aontu.Aontu#s deputy leader and long time friend Dr Anne McCloskey described the man as a gentle soul.She added: Francie and Anne were such an incredible team and they shared a searing intellect, caring and a deep, deep faith and deep, deep compassion for the human race.Francie, although he spent a letime in Sinn Fein, both he and Anne were iniduals who very much took their own decisions, and the culmination of that was that when Sinn Fein required them to support abortion - which was against their deeply held fundamental principles - they wouldn#t do it. Francie always said: #We didn#t leave Sinn Fein, Sinn Fein left us#.As well as a long-standing career in teaching, Mr Brolly was also a high-profile inter-county Gaelic footballer with Derry and played hurling and football for Dungiven.The father of well-known GAA pundit Joe Brolly, the father-of-five was also well regarded for his songwriting and his love of the Irish language.The man was known to have taught the language at night classes in Limavady.Tributes to Mr Brolly were paid by figures from across the political ide.Sinn Fein party leader Mary Lou McDonald described him as a committed and dedicated Irish republican, who was a fine political representative, a campaigner and a musician.Deputy leader Michelle O#Neill said he was a signicant figure in the political le of east Derry for many years and will be missed by many.Dungiven Sinn Fein councillor Sean McGlinchey said Mr Brolly#s death was a terrible loss to the town.He said: Francie Brolly was a gentleman, a great Irishman, a family man who loved the simple things in le. He devoted his whole le to helping people and no matter when you saw Francie he had a smile on his face.The SDLP#s John Dallat MLA said: Francie was beyond party politics and I regarded him as a friend that I could trust.As well as the Irish language, GAA, music and many other talents, Francie was incredibly amusing and entertaining. He will be sadly missed.Fr Joseph Varghese said Mr Brolly, who along with his we attended mass daily in the parish, was an integral part of Dungiven.He said: Francie#s death has left us all deeply shocked and saddened. He played a very active role in the church. He was an eucharist minister, a reader and was a member of the choir.

The latest plan suggests that this trench could be spanned by a bridge, which would then link to an underwater tunnel for the remainder of the distance to Larne.Costs are thought to be in the region of £bn for a combined road and rail link, the first to span the Irish Sea.The project has long been supported by the DUP.Last night party transport spokesman Paul Girvan MP said connectivity between the parts of the UK was vital. We must invest in local roads, but we must also build infrastructure for the next generation, he said.We first asked for a feasibility study into this project in . Let#s get the facts to seeit is feasible and what impact it would have on the economy. Whether it#s tunnel or bridge and what route it would take.I will continue to raise this in Westminster. Connectivity between the UK is key, and this could be a vital connection for the future.Critics of the idea have said it is to dficult and too expensive, and that the money would be better spent on other things.But Boris Johnson is known to be in favour of major infrastructure projects that he sees as helping unite the UK in the post-Brexit era, among them the HS rail project.Proposals for a physical link between Scotland and the north of Ireland date back to the th century.

Creator, Tony McCourt, , said a similar Facebook page exists for the Brandywell area so he felt it was only right to set one up for Creggan.  Within a day it had , members and less than a week later it has amassed over ,. Built in the s, Creggan is one of Derry’s best-known estates. It has been home to an abundance of artistic and sporting talent, including Olympic athletes, a Eurovision winner, a Top Ten rock band and international footballers. googletag.cmd.push In the late s and early s, Creggan became a byword for political resistance all over the world. On the Memories of Creggan Facebook page, people have been sharing cherished photos of relatives, historically signicant portraits of the Troubles, images of friends playing on the street, tales of famed characters from the estate, all sorts of myths and legends true and untrue, and everything in between. Former Creggan residents who have emigrated all over the world, including those from America and Australia, have joined the page to reminisce and share old tales from their childhood. “Everybody is enjoying it,” Tony explained, “they’re all sharing old memories.” googletag.cmd.push Friends contacted Tony to tell him that they can’t get their mothers off the page, one of the ladies is -years-old and is “loving all the old photos so much”. He added: “They’ve said they’re getting no housework done and no wains are being watched because they’re all too busy on the page. People are talking about their schooldays and friends who haven’t been in touch for many years are reconnecting.”  Memories Tony spent most of his childhood in Creggan and lived there until he got married at the age of . His brother, Peggy, still lives in Creggan and Tony has happy memories of “great neighbours and friends”. “The page brings back good memories. Nobody had anything but everybody shared what they had with each other.” The Troubles were never far from peoples’ minds, and people had their own troubles, but Tony prefers to recall the joyful times. “There was a lot of heartbreak at that time. But I like to remember all the positive experiences I had growing up. Playing football in the street all day when there were barely any cars around. “I remember the first TV on the street, it was the Kennedy’s and we used to go in to watch the FA Cup final. I also remember watching Popeye and the Lone Ranger. “I had a bad leg at one time and I remember a friend of mines carrying me to Grianan Fort and back again.” Moving forward, Tony would simply like to see people use the page in a positive way. “There are no real rules, we’re just asking people to keep it clean and to refrain from any insults. “Everyone is finding it funny going through all the old photos and that’s what it’s all about.” With that said Tony was off to the attic to unearth a few more boxes of photographic treasures from his boyhood.  ‘Heroes’ Peggy McCourt has lived in Creggan Heights for sixty-two years, asked what the estate means to him, he proclaimed: “Creggan means community.” He explained: “It was tight-knit no one had very much but what they had they shared be it a cup of milk to a drop of sugar, or can you lend me ma three slices of bread. “We all grew up in the Creggan, most of the families came from the Springtown Camp so hardship was a way of le but they made sure their wains were fed and watered, even going without themselves. “Then came the civil rights movement, then a full-blown war on the streets but again the Creggan community rallied around those who were affected by the conflict. “So many young people were first interned just because they were Catholic, many were arrested, put though interrogation centres and ended up in prison.” Peggy continued: “The hunger strikes took their toll on many families but no matter what went on Creggan grew into the best estate in Derry – in the world. “Growing up was hard at the time we lost so many friends and family members but it was a fun place to grow up, friendships formed that still last to this day. The friends I had sixty odd years ago are as strong as when we first met.  “No video games, all street games, football, rounders, even cricket, hopscotch, all these plus many more sitting out till  or  telling ghost stories, then you ran home the living day lights scared out of you. “Creggan is more than a council estate, its a way of le, its in your blood, we don’t even have to look anywhere for heroes, Creggan is full of them they are called ma’s and da’s.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In the second half we werent clinical enough. We should have been finishing that game with -, - at our ease. googletag.cmd.push “We played much better last week than we did this week. Its old school tradition but I felt we didnt get enough blocks on last week, we didnt put enough pressure on the ball going in and today we did that much better and thats probably resulted in Tipp being held scoreless from play.”Gallagher admitted that the uncertainty in the build up to the game was not at all helpful, with the Derry boss expecting the game to be postponed after witnessing the rain at Celtic Park on Saturday night.“In the morning we probably felt that it wasnt going to be on,” he said. “It was a bit of a lottery and you could see the way it cut up there. To be brutally honest I stayed up last night and witnessed the rain. “We were up at the Brunswick and the kids were coming out and it was absolutely baltic and the rain was coming in.“In fairness the pitch improved and to be fair thats part of the challenge of being a sportsman or athlete because you have got to be mentally strong and to be fair the lads started the game strong and that didnt seem to impact them.”Yesterdays game was certainly not the most entertaining nor memorable of games, but for Gallagher and his players it was all about the result.“When it was -, - you would like to have seen us push on but to be honest I thought there were one or two soft frees again,” he continued. “We didnt push on but we overplayed the ball and dropped a couple short and maybe Alex had a couple of shots we missed and we had Sammysgoal chance and we had Dannyschance.“Those things, maybe instead of stretching the game out to -, or  or  points maybe leaves it a wee bit more nervy than it should but I suppose the boys are saying that we havent beaten a team ranked like Tipperary in a couple of years so it probably leads to a wee bit of fear.” googletag.cmd.push Important After disappointments of ious natures against Leitrim and Down, yesterdays win was important for Derry in the short term as well as in the bigger picture.“We need to have an open mind,” Gallagher continued. “We want to be better at the end of the league than we were at the start. Thats the approach we have taken because we are with a new group and we are trying to build a consistency here.“Im not from Derry but looking in from the outside the turnover in players, the in and out of the squad, the lack of consistency in selection, the lack of togetherness probably, were really trying to build on that.“We think the age of the squad is really, really good there and we know theres good talent thats come through in Derry but its a matter now of sticking together. Its a test of character and generally the people who are mentally toughest and the strongest characters win out.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In the second half we werent clinical enough. We should have been finishing that game with -, - at our ease. googletag.cmd.push “We played much better last week than we did this week. Its old school tradition but I felt we didnt get enough blocks on last week, we didnt put enough pressure on the ball going in and today we did that much better and thats probably resulted in Tipp being held scoreless from play.”Gallagher admitted that the uncertainty in the build up to the game was not at all helpful, with the Derry boss expecting the game to be postponed after witnessing the rain at Celtic Park on Saturday night.“In the morning we probably felt that it wasnt going to be on,” he said. “It was a bit of a lottery and you could see the way it cut up there. To be brutally honest I stayed up last night and witnessed the rain. “We were up at the Brunswick and the kids were coming out and it was absolutely baltic and the rain was coming in.“In fairness the pitch improved and to be fair thats part of the challenge of being a sportsman or athlete because you have got to be mentally strong and to be fair the lads started the game strong and that didnt seem to impact them.”Yesterdays game was certainly not the most entertaining nor memorable of games, but for Gallagher and his players it was all about the result.“When it was -, - you would like to have seen us push on but to be honest I thought there were one or two soft frees again,” he continued. “We didnt push on but we overplayed the ball and dropped a couple short and maybe Alex had a couple of shots we missed and we had Sammysgoal chance and we had Dannyschance.“Those things, maybe instead of stretching the game out to -, or  or  points maybe leaves it a wee bit more nervy than it should but I suppose the boys are saying that we havent beaten a team ranked like Tipperary in a couple of years so it probably leads to a wee bit of fear.” googletag.cmd.push Important After disappointments of ious natures against Leitrim and Down, yesterdays win was important for Derry in the short term as well as in the bigger picture.“We need to have an open mind,” Gallagher continued. “We want to be better at the end of the league than we were at the start. Thats the approach we have taken because we are with a new group and we are trying to build a consistency here.“Im not from Derry but looking in from the outside the turnover in players, the in and out of the squad, the lack of consistency in selection, the lack of togetherness probably, were really trying to build on that.“We think the age of the squad is really, really good there and we know theres good talent thats come through in Derry but its a matter now of sticking together. Its a test of character and generally the people who are mentally toughest and the strongest characters win out.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Born and raised in Derry until the age of , I always had a calling for adventure and opportunity, and it was at this stage in my le I took a huge leap of faith and went in chase of the American Dream. A little Irish girl lost in the big city of New York awaiting my immigration papers is where I learned so many le lessons and character building. At the age of  I stumbled upon a movie The Secret which would eventually change my le and my direction. googletag.cmd.push This movie for me was a beginning, an awakeningyou will. I had opened my eyes to a whole new world of self-belief, ambitions and possibilities. At the age of  I opened my first business which was a Health Care Call Centre. Alongside this I worked for a healthcare administration business which was family run and set up by my mother in New York. Whilst I found great business acumen and skillset in my work, it took its toll on me. The corporate pace and stress fuelled environment was not my fit so I sold my shares in the family business and sold my own business. googletag.cmd.push This was an important and pivotal moment for me in my le where I would embark on a journey of self-discovery and promise. From the beginning of le as I know it until now, I have never known fulfilment like being a mom. Being we to my husband, Dr Frank Dos Santos, and mother to our gorgeous and amazing children and brought me happiness like no other and for this I am eternally blessed and grateful. The le we share together is precious and I value this every day. There came a point for me personally, where I had reached that feeling of fulfilment and happiness and these feelings are what I embrace and evoke everyday in le. Drawing on my previous experiences and knowledge of The Secret as well as the process of le which had led me to this point, spurred me on to find my true passion in le. Helping others. I thought, whatI can pass on these feelings that I’m feeling  WhatI can help others to feel joy, hope and happiness whatever their environment or circumstance  So, in , alongside my business partner Chiara I set up a company Joy In The Workplace whose sole aim was to bring and implement productivity and joy into the workplace. This was my fit. The gratication and sense of fulfilment in helping others became a part of me. I knew I could do this, loved doing it and I did not want to stop here. I knew that feeling of being in a corporate environment and feeling stressed, overworked and unfulfilled and being able to approach and work with iniduals and groups who were in the same position and offer them a road to productivity and happiness in their role was le changing. I wanted to do more. In the Secret Bob Proctor was the clear definitive practitioner for me. I got in touch with the Proctor Gallagher Institute and trained in becoming a PGI Consultant The programmes set by Bob Proctor and Sandy Gallagher are some of the most effective and efficient I have ever seen and I was thrilled to become a part of it and be able to offer coaching to clients in both the U.S and Ireland. I recently was promoted within this company to Senior Coach and Account Executive which now enables me to offer some of the most elite personal development programmes PGI has to offer. Working alongside these esteemed colleagues has been a huge ambition of mine and I have learned so many invaluable skills and ideologies that I cannot wait to share with more and more clients whether personal or in a group setting. As my journey to date describes, I have achieved some great things and I am still achieving and believing every day. But there has been for quite some time, a feeling of wanting to offer something back home. I often would hear stories in the news, and reports from my hometown Derry in Ireland of the suicide epidemic which has been playing on my mind for quite some time. It is with such sadness and despair that I have felt the strong urge to help in some way. Derry is such a beautul town steeped in wonderful facts of history and monument but there is a huge cry for help and I simply cannot and will not ignore this. In understanding these facts, I have purchased a building in the city and will be hosting mindset workshops for both adults and children in the near future. It is never too early to implement positivity and to teach the importance of le and its value. In addition to this my foundation for suicide prevention is well underway as I have been working constructively with a team of like minded professionals from the city in order to structure and further develop and implement this project which I know in my heart will instil a new light of positivity and hope for those going through tough times and needing some guidance. My connection to Derry has been growing as of lately and I have found myself travelling back and forward trying to help in ious ways. Myself alongside Catrina Crillyhave set up “Bee Me LTD” which is the first children’s personal development company of its kind. We will be launching a child friendly app and host Bee Me Camps which will have a fun and friendly environment where children will learn about self-image, empowerment, positivity and how thoughts create things. We’re excited about this project and cannot wait to see it develop. My journey has come with its teachings, its blessings and its le changing moments and I for one would not change any of it. I am at this point in my le where I am seeing my dreams come to reality. I am helping others to see THEIR dreams and make them a reality. My work is not work for me anymore, it is my passion and I feel incredibly lucky to wake up everyday to the le I have and to be able to share my teachings that will help my clients achieve the le they too want. It is my pleasure and my honour. The world is ours and we can think it into whatever we want it to be. And together, we are making it happen.

Since diagnosis they have received the much needed help and support of Goldenhar UK, a charity run by families and volunteers affected by the extremely rare syndrome.Now Aodhans uncle hopes to be able to give something back by raising cash and swapping the backdrop of the Celtic Park for the Efel Tower in a fundraising drive.Marty told the County Derry Post: “It’s a very rare condition – I think  in  suffer from it and it’s visible from birth.“Obviously, neither my sister nor I had ever heard of it but she noticed that something wasn’t right. The doctors didn’t pick up on it but I suppose the condition is so rare that they hadn’t seen it before.“My sister had to push but the doctors then realised and to be fair to them they’ve been more than helpful. Some have come over from England to see Aodhan.The John Mitchels Claudy captain added: “It will affect the development of bones like his spine, but they won’t know completely until he grows up and they see more and more how it’s affecting him.“He will have to go through a few minor surgeries just to correct a few things and whenever he starts learning to stand, it’ll affect him that way, but he’s now eight months old and is developing into a happy, lively wee child.”Goldenhar Syndrome is so rare that initially Marty’s sister Catherine assumed they were alone in being affected in Northern Ireland, but since he posted his fundraising efforts online, others have been in touch.“My sister didn’t know that there was anyone  in Northern Ireland with the condition, but as soon as I put up the fundraiser, we’ve been contacted by a local lady who was able to provide my sister with a lot of information and they’re actually meeting up now.“I think there are cases in Northern Ireland but they don’t have a  or a chance to talk about it or help each other.”Marty opted for the Paris marathon despite other, closer alternatives and he is looking forward to taking on the challenge in its picturesque surroundings.“Ah, it was just more attractive. I don’t like running anyway but I just thought ‘why not ’ London is nearly impossible to get into so the Paris one was easy enough to get into and it’s probably nicer to run round than London.My mum and dad are hoping to go and my we, children and her family are all going. My sister-in-law Laureen , who lives in London, has actually decided she’s going to do it as well.“I’ve started training unfortunately, it’s not great at this time of year because it’s so dark, but it’ll give me a bit of an aim – it’s only another  or  weeks away! googletag.cmd.push “With the Gaelic season just being over, the fitness isn’t too bad – Christmas wasn’t too sore on me!” If you want to support Marty in his challenge, you can read his story and donate via the following Just Giving link: https:www.justgiving fundraising martin-donaghy  googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Police informed told activists of death threats made against them.InAugust , Dalradian announced that it would no longer propose using cyanide in the gold mining process, something that had caused reat concern to local people.In November, campaigner Fidelma O’Kane was successful in the High Court after she took a judicial review against the Northern Ireland Environment Agencyover a discharge consent it had awarded to Dalradian The consent allowed the company to discharge nine heavy metals into the local Owenkillew river.In response to the objection letters, a Dalradian spokesperson told The Canary: “Dalradian’s proposal for an underground gold and silver mine in West Tyrone has received over , letters of support.

The bypass is the single biggest road scheme ever proposed for the district.Roads officials have previously insisted that the planned scheme will greatly benefit both strategic and local road users by reducing journey times and improving road safety. In addition, officials are confident that the schemersquos economic assessment demonstrates that the bypass would provide a good economic .Designed to alleviate chronic town centre congestion in Ballynahinch and along the main approach roads to the town, major new roundabouts are proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road.Overtaking lanes stretching almost  metres are proposed at either end of the bypass where major new roundabouts are to be constructed, with the scheme also including a shared footpath and cycle lane.Cllr Walker argued that the Newry, Mourne and Down area has missed out on signicant roads funding for decades, with many major schemes constructed in other parts of the Province.ldquoI believe the time has come for this council to demand its fair share of infrastructure funding, he declared. ldquoI have been a councillor for over  years and the bypass issue has been raised during every one of them.ldquoThe government department has now moved to a position with all its ducks in this particular scheme now in a row. The public enquiry has been completed and the only thing delaying the scheme is funding.Cllr Walker said he believed that with the Assembly restored and a local minister at the helm of the Department for Infrastructure, the council needs to seek an urgent meeting with Ms Mallon to seek the immediate release of bypass funding to not only alleviate town centre congestion in Ballynahinch, but provide a major boost for the wider South Down area, in particular, tourism.Slieve Croob councillor, Cathy Mason, described the market town as the ldquogateway to the wider South Down area through which all traffic must pass, including HGVs.ldquoThis not only frustrates drivers who are part of the through traffic, but increases tension and danger for those living, shopping and working in the town. The proposed bypass will run round the eastern periphery of the town with a grade-separated junction at the Crossgar Road, she continued.ldquoHousing is also being permitted up to the line of the planned new road and includes the potential for a park and ride site. The bypass has been proposed since the s and for decades local community and political representatives from all parties have demanded this new road.Cllr Mason said the new infrastructure minister must signal the start of work on the multi-million pound road scheme as soon as possible.She said that in , the then Infrastructure Minister Chris Hazzard announced his decision to proceed with the bypass proposal and instructed officials to continue to prioritise this scheme until completion unless instructed otherwise by a new minister. Cllr Mason continued: ldquoWith the infrastructure minister now in place following the restoration of Stormont, funding should now be signed off and construction allowed to commence as soon as possible.She said the tender process for construction should begin as soon as possible, suggesting there is no reason why construction cannot commence this time next year, with the scheme complete and open to vehicles by .Rowallane councillor Robert Burgess is also keen to see work on the bypass get underway and hopes that the new infrastructure minister will also formally sign off the scheme to upgrade the final section of the A between Doranrsquos Rock and Rowallane Garden in Saintfield.ldquoThe bypass is critically important to the social and economic regeneration of not only Ballynahinch but the wider South Down area, he said.Cllr Burgess added: ldquoIn addition, the A is the main link between Downpatrick and Belfast and while there have been ious upgrades, the section between Doranrsquos Rock and Rowallane Garden is simply not suitable for the huge volume of traffic which uses this busy road. Itrsquos upgrade is also a priority..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th February 2020 Caroline.jpg","title":"Caroline’s love of Newcastle beach inspires St Patrick Centre exhibition  ","story":"A NEWCASTLE artistrsquos fascination with the townrsquos famous beach has inspired her latest exhibition.Caroline Williamson is showing over  pieces of her work throughout February at the St Patrickrsquos Centre in Downpatrick.Just opened this week, Caroline said that the exhibition is called lsquoShell Sounds from the Shorersquo.She said: ldquoOne of my fondest memories is walking down the Newcastle beach, collecting shells with my grandmother.

The pick of those four has now been decided after years of exploratory talks and detailed investigations. Ironically, the final choice is of a route which dfers only slightly from one suggested by the  Downpatrick Area Plan.The new road will begin, effectively, from the entrance to the Meadowlands housing estate in Church Street and will run behind existing Church Street premises on a widening parallel, into the town centre.It will emerge onto the lower part of Scotch Street, across the rear of the Town Hall building and into Irish Street.

The lane had been sold by Lord Downshirersquos estate to Mr Donnelly, but there had been some doubt whether a right of way clause had been ed.This has now been cleared up by the letters from Lord Downshirersquos estate agents and solicitors, who pointed out that the lane way had been sold but that the right of way was reserved.

The former SDLP councillor was Mr McGradyrsquos election agent.Mr Doris joined the former Downpatrick Urban District Council and was re-elected to Down Council in  and served as the districtrsquos first citizen in  .He retained his seat during several council elections and retired from the council when it formally went out of business in  when it merged with its neighbour in Newry and Mourne to become one of  new super councils.Tributes to Mr Doris have been paid by SDLP leader Colum Eastwood, South Down MLA Colin McGrath, former South Down MP Baroness Margaret Ritchie and fomer council colleague Dermot Curran.Tributes have also been paid by Rowallane DUP councillor Billy Walker and UUPrsquos Robert Burgess.Mr Eastwood paid tribute to the le and legacy of Mr Doris whom he described as an ldquoSDLP stalwart and founding party member.ldquoJohn lived his le in service of others, continued the party leader.ldquoHe had a deep passion for his community of Downpatrick, which he represented with dignity for many years, as councillor and Down Council chairman. John was also the election agent for former South Down MP Eddie McGrady and played a key role in the seismic election in which Eddie unseated Enoch Powell.Mr Eastwood said in addition to his love for his community and constituents, Mr Doris was ldquodeeply committed to the aims and values of the SDLP, working towards peace, social justice and civil rights throughout his le.ldquoJohn was a shining light in some of the darkest days. Even after his retirement, he remained a loyal SDLP member and provided wise counsel to the new generation stepping forward in South Down and across the North, said the party leader.ldquoI want to express my deepest sympathies to Johnrsquos we Mairead, his children and the whole Doris family. In this very sad time, I hope they find the admiration of Johnrsquos friends and colleagues of some comfort to them.Mr McGrath said his friend and former party colleague epitomised the term ldquogentleman.The Assemblyman described Mr Doris as a ldquogentle giant of politics and someone who took him under his wing, teaching him the ropes of being a good councillor.ldquoJohn was also a successful businessman in Downpatrick but never lost his social justice roots and always did what he could to help people, said Mr McGrath.ldquoHis quiet way and manner often won out and he delivered for people on the matters that meant most to them. He was there for people in their hour of need. I offer my sympathies to Mairead and his family at this time.Cllr Curran described Mr Doris as man who had the interests of his local community very much at heart. He said his friend put the people of Downpatrick at the top of his agenda and fought valiantly for them on a range of issues, not least, social justice.ldquoJohn was proud of his roots and Downpatrick was coursing through his veins. He was my colleague and friend and he will be sadly missed by a great many people. My sympathies are very much with his we Mairead and the family circle. Downpatrick and indeed the wider district has lost a great man who was held in high regard by all those who knew him, said Cllr Curran.He added: ldquoJohn and I were very close and had many conversations over the years about a great many things. I and many others from all walks of le will miss him very much.

In all the years we served on Down Council I never once heard him say a cross word abut anyone and he never brought sectarian politics into the chamber.ldquoHe was a councillor for the people and I was very saddened to learn of his passing. My thoughts are with his we and family. The thoughts and prayers of many people are with them at this terribly sad time, added Cllr Walker.Rowallane Ulster Unionist councillor, Robert Burgess, said he will always remember attending his first council meeting when Mr Doris introduced himself.ldquoI had nothing but the highest respect for John. He was a man of integrity and while we may have dfered politically I regarded him as a friend and a man who had the interests of Downpatrick and indeed the wider district at heart, he said.ldquoJohn was an absolute gentleman and was someome whom I held in the highest regard.

But credit due to both Paddy and Alec for their performances against regular league players.Group four, headed up by Colin McKinty, always a dangerous competitor in competitions, but he had to contend with an equally talented player in Sean Poland, who has been in great form recently.John Campbell, another player who is in sight of a regular place in the Strangford C team and the affable Katy Rice, improving with every game she plays, completed the group.The first spot in this group was always going to be tight, but McKintyrsquos steady defence was the key factor in finishing top of this group with Poland second.Group four with Michael Carey having steered Strangford B to their third consecutive isional title, was the clear favourite to finish in first place, but would have to contend with the Drumaness No  Pat Mulholland, who has been in excellent form throughout the league campaign.Also in this five-man group were Michael Deery, team-mate Niall Houghan and Drumaness man Seamus McGivern, more at home on the snooker table, but still no stranger to the plastic ball.The games in this group were hotly contested, but in the final game of the group Mulholland and Carey would battle it out for the top place.The first game could have gone either way with Pat just edging home -.The next was equally close but, in the end, it was the Drumaness man who finished in top place with just five points the dference.The first quarter-final match was an all-Strangford clash between McKinty and McCusker.The first two games were shared, but the steady place of McCusker, mixed with well-judged attack, saw him take the next two games to progress to the semi-finals.The second match featured the Drumanessrsquo Pat Mulholland and Charlie Murray. This was easily the match of the round.Mulholland won the first two games, the next two went to Murray with a nip and tuck decider before Mulholland just edged it -. The third match of the round involved second seed Donald Campbell taking on his skipper Michael Carey.The games were all close, but the blistering attack of Campbell saw him progress in straight games. Vincey Poland had perhaps the easiest match of the round against new comer John Campbell.As expected, Poland had too much iation for his opponent and ran out a comfortable - winner.McCusker stated this competition a dark horse to a least reach the final.His opponent in the semi-finals was Donald Campbell and he started as favourite.This semi-final turned out to be the closest match of the competition. John won the first two games and looked confident to reach the final.Back came Campbell to even the score, but McCusker won the first four points of the game and held on win -, leaving Donald to reflect on a match he should have won when he held a game point in the first encounter of the match.The next match was a close affair, but Poland was always in control with Pat Mulholland delighted to have reached this stage of the competition.It was a gallant effort from the Drumaness man but, in the end, Poland booked his final place with a straight game victoryThe home crowd was pleased to see a local man in the final of the competition, but knew he needed to produce something special to beat a player of Polandrsquos stature.The games were close and John, encouraged by his supporters, did everything he could to stem the flow of winners from one of the leaguersquos best backhand exponent, but to no avail and lost in straight games.League secretary, Jim Ritchie, thanked the Strangford club for staging this event and providing refreshment throughout the evening and the competitors for their generous contribution to the charity fund.Competition referee, Peter Deeny, also acknowledged the friendly, competitive spirit in which this event was enjoyed by all participants..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/18211900.denzil-mcdaniel-double-standards-insulting-language-called/resources/images/11005157.jpg","title":"bandstand paddy mulligan","story":"What genre genres do you consider your music to be How long have you been performing Where do you perform What is your favourite song to play and why What has been your biggest gig to date Any funny gig rehearsal stories Who are your major influences Do you write your own songs  What inspires your songwriting What would be your dream gig Best moment as a musician so far What is the most unusual venue you have played What is your lsquogo-torsquo encore song Whats the best thing about performing Do you always perform solo or do you also play with a band What does  hold for you Any last words This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He did restate his partys refusal to form a coalition with Sinn Fein. Photo: Liam McBurney PA WireThe party might also do less well in vote transfers than it did in first preferences.Both Fianna Fail and Fine Gael could end up with more seats than Sinn Fein when counting is completed on Monday.It will be hard, however, for any party to form the majority needed to form a government.Mr Martin has failed to rule out entering government with Sinn Fein. While he stopped short of repeating his pre-election pledge never to do business with Sinn Fein, Taoiseach and Mr Varadkar did restate his determination not to partner up with Mary Lou McDonald’s party.Mrs McDonald said she was willing to talk to all political leaders but expressed a desire to lead a coalition made up of left-leaning parties, without any input from Fianna Fail or Fine Gael, which are both centre-right in outlook.While it remains unclear whether it will ultimately be part of any future coalition, Sinn Fein’s performance has sent shockwaves through Ireland’s political establishment.Sinn Fein is unlikely to emerge with the most seats, mainly because it ran signicantly fewer candidates than its two main rivals –  compared to Fianna Fail’s  and Fine Gael’s .Warwick and Leamington MP unites with major charity for World Cancer DayNew games development studio will be just the tonic for Leamington Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Arriving at his count centre in Cork, Mr Martin would not rule out working with Sinn Fein or Fine Gael, having definitively refused to countenance either as coalition partners during the campaign.The Fianna Fail leader, who said his party looked like being on course to win the most seats, was repeatedly pressed to restate his opposition to a potential Sinn Fein partnership.While insisting there were “signicant incompatibility” issues in terms of policy, he did not dismiss the suggestion outright.“Our policies, our positions and principles haven’t changed overnight or in  hours,” he said.In a result symbolic of the Sinn Fein surge, the first seat declared in the election was the party’s Donnchadh O Laoghaire, who topped the poll in Cork South Central ahead of Mr Martin.Mr Varadkar was also outpolled by a Sinn Fein candidate in Dublin West.Mr Martin said: “We will obviously listen. The people have spoken and there is no greater democrat than I, but that said we will not pre-empt the outcome itself because it’s very clear to us that the destination of the final seats in many constituencies cannot be called now.”Mr Varadkar said he would not be speaking to Mrs McDonald with a view to forming a coalition, insisting Fine Gael was “not compatible with Sinn Fein”.“We are willing to talk to other parties about how we could form a government and give this country a government that can spend the next five years dealing with the problems that we have had to tackle for the past few years,” he said.If parties do ultimately stick to their pre-election pledges then it would be extremely dficult for any of the three to lead a majority government.Smaller parties such as the Greens, Labour, the Social Democrats and Solidarity People Before Profit – and a sizeable number of independent TDs – may all be courted as the main parties seek junior coalition partners.Arriving at the RDS count centre in Dublin, Mrs McDonald branded talk of excluding her party as “undemocratic”.She said she had been in touch with the Greens, Social Democrats and People Before Profit to discuss the prospect of them joining her party in government.The uncertainty created by the exit poll has even thrown up the possibility of another general election being necessary.There are  seats in the Dail parliament. The speaker is automatically re-elected, leaving  seats up for grabs and  the magic number for a majority.Mr Varadkar’s last government – a minority Fine Gael-led administration that included several independent TDs – was sustained in power through a historic confidence and supply arrangement with Fianna Fail.Counting, which is taking place across the state’s  constituencies, is expected to last at least two days.• Morning View: Dublin insisted SF be in power here, and so boosted them there©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"opinion","story":" getRequiredClientIdforjpiconsole.log requiredClientIdcatch]EV.Core.updateUserProfile]EV.Core.updateUserProfile....... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast News Letter and agreeing to JPIMedia Publishing Ltd#s standard Terms and Conditions.

It’s a conversational well that is unlikely to run dry given the numerous prompts that adorn the walls, the rails and the display counters.Northern Ireland might not be as big a force in world football as the likes of Germany, France and Brazil, but per capita the Province punches well above its weight in terms of a fanaticism for football, be it the Irish League, the national team or an adopted team in England or Scotland..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button The shop which was opened in August by Ryan Gilmore, , and his business partner Pete McDonald, , taps into the rich demand for memorabilia amongst the nation’s football mad population.It leans towards the local game, celebrating the old kits and legendary stars of the Irish league, and immortalising national heroes such as Best, Whiteside, Jennings and more latterly Evans, McAuley and Healy. A Linfield shirt from  Ryan explained how a friendship forged in football gave birth to what is believed to be the only dedicated retro football shop in Northern Ireland.He said: “Pete and I are both Bangor fans – that’s a real labour of love – but we didn’t know each other until we met through work. We worked together for years in Yell where we pretty much talked about football non-stop.“The idea to start selling shirts online came after I’d been over to watch the Frampton fightand I went to the Classic Football Shirts Shop in Manchester. It’s  times bigger than the shop we have here.“I was with my fiancee at the time, now my we, and I said to her I’m going to try and do something like this online. I know how to do marketing, I love football, social media is easy enough when you know what you’re doing so I thought, I’ll give it a go. She didn’t object so that was a good start.The Northern Ireland Subbeteo print is the top seller“I started doing the shirts online last December. I got a bit of traction so I applied for a stall at St George’s in December and again in August.“I was getting married in July so I probably should have only been concentrating on that and nothing , but then I found out this unit in Smithfield was available. “Just before I was getting married – I think it was only a couple of days – I signed for the unit. Just before we got married I had to break the news to my we that I now owned a shop.UPDATE: Met Office issues three day snow and ice warning as slippy surfaces and strong winds are expected to create blizzard type conditionsConsiderable and costly damage done to hayshed roof after blaze started deliberately in hayshed - police say result could have been more devastatingpeople injured Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“Around that time I spoke to Pete about coming on board. He said, ‘you don’t know what you’re doing, I don’t know what I’m doing, let’s see what we can do together’.”Some of retro kit coasters for saleAskedthe dynamic changes when something you love becomes your job, Pete said: “I could never see us getting bored of it, I think I’ll forever be in that bubble, it’s something I love. “People work in office jobs and talk about football all day, that’s what we were like. Now we’ve got a set up where we can talk about football to whoever comes in and it’s part of the job.”Ryan commented: “On the business side of things we’re talking to clubs, striking up partnerships with other companies. Everything revolves around a love of football.”Pete said: “It’s good getting into the business side of it. There’s a buzz that comes from speaking to commercial managers of football clubs, trying to strike up partnerships.“It’s really easy to speak to people over here, quite a few clubs have heard of us.”He continued: “We’ve four clubs from the Irish League we’re in partnership with – Portadown, Linfield, Glentoran and Cltonville – and we’re branching across into England too.”The interior of the shop in Smithfield marketAt the moment the NI Classic Shirt Co is a part time venture, with the shop open on Thursday afternoonsand Fridays and Saturdays from . to .pm.Pete said: “We’re hoping to get full time. We’re going after clubs in England, Scotland and the League of Ireland as well as more local clubs. If they put in orders of a lot of units that can allow us to get a regular income and go full time.“We want to do as much Irish League stuff as we can with every club, that’s including the Championship. It would be great to get everyone on board. We’ve got a concept that can work with any club in the world.”Some of the shop’s best selling items are art prints of Subbuteo players from the Irish League or national team in kits from the eras in which they played. Another popular line sees a selection of classic kits displayed on coasters, mugs, T-shirts and art prints.And for those who like memorabilia they can wear the shop has a great range of old shirts, some match-worn.The strike partners leading the retro football revolution in Northern Ireland talked about some of their key team mates in their bid to climb the commercial ladder.Ryan said: “Tom Woodsdoes the Subbuteo prints. I approached him way back in the summer. I saw what he was doing with teams all over the UK. I commissioned him to do the Northern Ireland one which is a fantastic seller for us. “It’s kits from ious eras worn by  of the best ever players – there’s nothing like this available anywhere .“For the Subbuteo designs the club sends us photos of the players, we send them onto Tom and he works his magic. “We’ve also got him to do some Irish Leagues teams that we’ve teamed up with.” Pete continued: “With Hally Designs, they produce artwork featuring classic kits and you can turn them into prints or coasters or mugs or T-shirts. “They also do art prints of classic moments like when we beat England -. “We persuaded them to branch into the Irish League.”Ryan said: “There’s always new ideas out there, new brands to team up with.”In one of the framed prints by Hally Designs I spot the dubious yellow Broomhill kit which Glenavon wore in . It’s a kit I still own, but can’t recall wearing this side of the millennium.“Some of the worst kits are the best loved,” commented Ryan. “Some of them are an acquired taste. The fans love the Cltonville Kit Kat kit, we keep selling out of that on the coasters.”As well as the bespoke printed items, the shop is home to an array of old football programmes and some rare football shirts.Pete, an Arsenal fan, is particularly proud the shop has recently acquired the club’s yellow and blue ‘bruised banana’ away kit from - as well as a ‘Bergkamp ’ Holland shirt from .He said: “Bergkamp was the top man for me. It’ll pain me to sell those shirts but that’s how a business works.”Ryan said: “When I say we get shirts from all over the world I’m not trying to be vague, they genuinely come from all over the world. “There’s a Linfield top in there I got from Hong Kong. We’ve worked with collectors in Thailand, we’ve got stuff from America. “We get stuff locally as well, for example we sold a ‘ Red Star Belgrade top that had belonged to a guy who lived just outside Belfast. It was bought by someone in Miami, Florida. That shirt has done some miles.“There’s a Rangers match-worn Alex Cleland in there with number two on the back. It came from a collector in Asia.“We do get requests from people looking for specic shirts. There’s a network of collectors you can put a message out to and see what people have.”Of the resurgence in the Irish League that has helped boost the sales of memorabilia, Pete said: “We’re finding a lot of people are coming back to Glentoran and there’s been a big cash injection at Larne. “Some matches are on BBC, some on Sky Sports. You are getting good crowds again, it’s coming back.“Just last week we sold a the Glentoran home kit from - by auction for £. I reckon it would have cost about £ to £ at the time.“The Irish League is our bread and butter, but we want to branch out into the lower leagues in England and Scotland. “We’d especially love to get our own club Bangor on board. There’s a big fanbase still there.”Ryan said: “We’ve spoken to a few Irish League players on Twitter – we’ve got feedback from Joe Gormley and Liam Boyce, they both like their versions on the Cltonville Subbuteo print.”Ryan continued: “We don’t come from a retail background, we’re just football fans.“Initially I was just emailing every address I could find, pitching to them and explaining what I was trying to do. Now we’re speaking to clubs on the phone.“Obviously George Best put Northern Ireland on the map but recently with us doing well in the Euros people are paying attention outside of here.”While the online shop is rising in prominence the lads are trying to spread the word that they have a physical shop in Smithfield as well. “So many people come in to the shop and say they didn’t know we were here,” said Ryan. “Now they’re coming once a month to see what new things we’ve got in. Word of mouth for us is massive, customers telling their friends.“In most sports shops in Northern Ireland you can only get the most recent kits from the main Premier League, European and Scottish teams.

This year, she will celebrate her ninety second birthday and she discusses a letime of activism across Europe.Veganuary is an annual event which encourages people to go vegan for a month. In last yearrsquos campaign, a quarter of a million people pledged to try a vegan diet.More NewsVale school pals brave the shave for animal charityPenarth father of four is recognised in New Year Honour list for services to cricketHouse prices increased in the Vale of Glamorgan, latest figures showOnce a fringe movement, veganism is quickly gaining a vast appeal, especially amongst the young, as the environmental benefits of a plant-based diet become clearer.According to a study by the Vegan Society, , people in the UK were vegan in  ndash  and a half times higher than in . Almost half of these were people aged below .Veganism has brought with it a lucrative trade in plant-based produce as businesses move to accommodate the concerns of their customers and promote ethical alternatives to meat.Long before veganism became a dietary and commercial trendsetter, however, June Holder, a -year-old woman from Penarth, had her eyes opened to the costly effects of meat consumption. After eating a vegan breakfast at a local cafeacute, she settled down to tell me her story.ldquoIrsquove been vegan for  years, she said. ldquoMy daughter had a stall at Camden Market, and she used to collect masses of money for animal rights there. It was her who first introduced me to the cause.ldquoLater on, I organized a charity coffee morning and sent the money I raised to Compassion in World Farming. In , they sent me a magazine which showed what happened to the animals. Well, I sat down that morning and read what theyrsquod sent me ndash and I was vegan!Whilst the public has become more receptive to veganism, June still encounters hostility: ldquoPeoplersquos reactions y when I tell them Irsquom vegan. They become hostile because theyrsquore guilty, I suppose.ldquoI remember that a vegan group had a stall in the market a few years ago. They were advertising parts of Alsatians to eat. People were horried. So, when they were angry, I had a chance to talk to them. lsquoYou accept that any animal can be treated like this except when it comes to your dogsrsquo, I told them. Well, they had to accept it. How could they not Originally from Penarth, June moved to Dinas Powys from Barry after her husband, Derrick, passed away  years ago.Derrick was the owner of Holders Menswear, a menrsquos fashion store which was once renowned throughout the Vale of Glamorgan and beyond.Junersquos decision to become vegan sparked  years of dedication to activism. She joined the Animal Welfare Party, and, in her sixties and seventies, she travelled across the UK and Europe to campaign for animal rights.ldquoI demonstrated in many places. I went to Brussels twice to protest against the exportation of live animals. The International Fund for Animal Welfare took us in a coach.ldquoI was in the front row of the crowd, up against these spikes and razor wire. If they had started to push from the back, I dread to think what would have happened.ldquoThe night before the protest I had this thought: lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo. I wrote it on a little board.ldquoPeople kept tapping me on the shoulder and passing the board around the crowd and eventually it made its way back to me.What does the message mean ldquoIt means that it is more dangerous not to protest against these injustices that are happening.June still has a copy of the placard. Later, at her home, she retrieved it from a trove of scattered paraphernalia accumulated after years of protest.She has written prolically throughout her le about events which have provoked and enthused her. One poem describes the day of protest in Brussels. It reflects Junersquos unceasing dedication to animal welfare but also her frustration at the pace of change:ldquoThe writer of these verses was, quite some time ago, in Brussels with a poster which now rings yet more true. lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo is what the message said.ldquoThen round it went to young and old for everyone to read. From countries all round Europe, but the farmers paid no heed. Live transport, a huge issue then, continues just the same.Another poem read:ldquoChristmas is a time to spend, but why not save instead  In sheds around the country to sate the publicrsquos lust for something huge to set their feast. The turkeys just exist.ldquoTen million in this country at Christmas time alone. Is this the way to talk of peace and teach our children love Veganuary runs throughout January.

This offers the membership and the country a broader choice.I am yet to decide who I will back in the forthcoming election but I know that I want to see a vision from each of the candidates. For me, that vision needs to be a realistic reflection of our last decade out of government in Westminster, but also a strategy for reconnecting with our voters and securing a Labour government which can deliver for those who need us most.Finally, I want to thank the staff across the NHS and wider public services for their hard work under increasing pressures, particularly during the winter period.Our public services work hard all year round and many take the sacrice of working over the Christmas and New Year period for which I, and many others, are extremely grateful.As everyou would like to speak with me, you can call my office on    or write to me at Vaughan.Gething@assembly.wales or Office of Vaughan Gething AM, Room C, National Assembly for Wales, CF NA. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

His second vegan recipe book, Dirty Vegan: Another Bite, was released last month alongside a tie-in BBC cookery programme.Last Friday, Matt Pritchard visited the Penarth Pier Pavilion to discuss his latest culinary enterprise and prepare a vegan dish with Mel Grfin of Grfin Books.Pritchard has not lost his mad-dash style and performative vigour. He relished his new role as he prepared for the talk: ldquoI enjoy it, man. Itrsquos better than shoving a drumstick up your arse on stage, he said.Originally from Cardf, Pritchard studied cooking at college but dedicated himself to professional skating when he was sponsored at .ldquoDirty Sanchez was great. It was just  years of mayhem.ldquoWe were getting paid to travel around the world. Getting drunk and off your head with your mates ndash thatrsquos like winning the lottery when yoursquore that age.ldquoI loved it. But then it took its toll on my mental health. Especially the drugs part of it.ldquoI needed to do something about it and thatrsquos when I started my fitness journey.ldquoWith my addictive personality, when I do something, Irsquove got to do it ndash not just dip my toes in.ldquoI started looking into veganism because a lot of endurance athletes were vegan. The more I researched it the more it started making sense to me.ldquoI love animals. Irsquove got a dog and I wouldnrsquot eat him. Whatrsquos the dference between a dog and a pig  All these things started making sense to me.ldquoAs soon as I became vegan, I felt healthier. So many people were trying to put me off it.ldquoBut on a vegan diet, I did The Decker, which is  full Iron Men in  days.ldquoNow Irsquom looking at doing the Double Decker which is  in  days. On my th birthday Irsquoll be doing  of something for  years.ldquoItrsquos another way of proving to people that veganism helps me, and that age is but a number.Pritchard became vegan in  and began to film his own cooking show on YouTube. In , the BBC aired the first series of Dirty Vegan.ldquoIf yoursquod told me  years ago that Irsquod be sitting here with you now and talking about vegan cooking books, I would I have laughed in your face, he said.Pritchard said that he was forced to leave Twitter last year because of abuse from online trolls and members of the Welsh farming community.Why were people so hostile ldquoBecause of guilt. Anger does it. Cognitive dissonance. Theyrsquore too lazy to change or they donrsquot want to believe it.ldquoBut the evidence is there. What I care about is the evidence and the animals.\"I donrsquot want to kill something that doesnrsquot want to be killed. If you eat steak, how can you say you care for all animals In his characteristic salt-of-the earth way, Pritchard hopes to entertain audiences with his new series whilst gently educating them about the benefits of vegan cooking.ldquoYou know, therersquos   arguing about Brexit. Therersquos   arguing about meat and veganism.ldquoWersquore all arguing amongst ourselves like lunatics. This show is just there for people to enjoy. ldquoTherersquos a bit of fun in it. Therersquos a lot of education.ldquoWhen it goes out on TV, I get a lot of positive messages from people saying theyrsquove cut down on meat.

Veteransrsquo choirs also provide opportunities in music to a whole new range of people.In another Westminster debate on fire risk in flats and shared housing, I raised the concerns of many constituents relating to building defects, fire safety issues and other matters. I stressed my view that companies responsible for defects in construction must take full responsibility and urgently recty them at their own cost.Some of these housing issues are devolved, and I paid tribute to work the Welsh Government has done around fire safety, with the ground-breaking law on sprinklers in , and the ban this week on using combustible cladding on high-rise buildings. We should be working on this on a UK-wide basis.I also secured my own debate on incineration of industrial and commercial waste. Irsquom supporting campaigners in the east of Cardf who oppose a planned new incinerator and have concerns over emissions and the impact of HGVs near schools and homes.With an existing incinerator near Cardf Bay, and continuing controversy over the biomass plant in Barry docks in our neighbouring constituency, this is an area of concern for many people locally. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Who they are will have a real influence on Welsh Labourrsquos prospects in  and beyond. We are the most successful part of the UK Labour family over the last decade in terms of winning elections and running a national government. However, that cannot be taken for granted. An unpopular UK leader could make our task much harder next May.The first and most important attribute the next UK leader must have is the ability to fulfil the mission of our party - to become a party of government again across the UK, not just a party of protest. I want someone who can implement our labour values in government, not just talk about them.That requires some honesty about why we took such a beating at the general election, together with the willingness and strength to do something about it. Offering more of the same would be a betrayal of people who need a UK Labour government and will condemn the UK [or what is left of it] to a further decade of the Tories.We didnrsquot get hammered in  for one reason alone - there were a number of them. Agreeing to the election in the first place when we plainly were not prepared. Agreeing to an election certain to be dominated by Brexit. Our vacillation on Brexit when people wanted certainty and leadership. The factional infighting. The demonisation of the last UK Labour government, asthat would encourage people to vote for us. I grew up with  Tory years in power and I know that things really did get better following Labourrsquos victory in .An overloaded manesto with some popular policies but without a key central message. A costed manesto that then had a huge extra spending pledge added to it, meaning that people didnrsquot believe that we were serious or credible one even the policies they liked. A staggeringly inept UK campaign that wasted the amazing dedication of our volunteers, prepared to go out in the cold and rain to campaign. Our abject failure on anti-Semitism. This and much more.Many people recognised that Boris Johnson is a dishonest man who is completely out of touch with most peoplersquos lives. Lots of people still voted for him or refused to vote Labour because they could not trust and support us. Our own people - long term Labour voters - struggled to support us. Our leader was undeniably part of the reason why. Blaming our defeat solely on the mainstream media or whichever side of the Brexit ide we favour isnt honest and will not help us to win in the future.I donrsquot much care whether someone claims they are from the left, soft left, centre or old right of the Labour Party. We all have a stake in our party and the countries of the UK. These are serious times and we need a serious figure who can nail the Tories and the clown in number ten.Irsquove been interested in what Lisa Nandy has to say and believe that Lisa and many other figures have a key role to play in rebuilding our party ndash first as a credible opposition, then as a credible alternative government at the next UK General Election.However, I think the person best placed to win the argument, and even more importantly to help us win an election, is Keir Starmer. Itrsquos not the protesting, or the taking part that counts. Itrsquos the winning and the decisions you get to make in government that can change peoplesrsquo lives and change the country for the better. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But must also find a new UK Labour Leader who has what takes to unite, win, and ensure the UK Labour Party has a credible vision fit for the world of the s and s ndash and a Leader capable of speaking for and winning the confidence of the whole country.I was delighted to see so many talented and thoughtful colleagues putting themselves forward for election. There are things being said by many that we need to listen to.But, after speaking to many of the candidates personally, and asking them all tough questions - I am backing Keir Starmer for Leader. I think hersquos got what it takes to hold this government immediately and robustly to account to build a team of all the talents and crucially that he has the vision, ideas and credibility to win again.Keir joined me on the streets of Penarth speaking to voters and local businesses during the election campaign ndash and it was clear by the warmth of the reception he received that he is someone who has the immediate credibility and credentials to be our future prime minister, and would work in partnership with Welsh Labour.He has crucial experience of public service and confronting powerful vested interests for the good of the country. He acted to prosecute MPs who had abused expenses and Murdoch journalists in the phone-hacking scandal when he was Director of Public Prosecutions.We need to win back these voters that we lost in the last general election. It was heart-breaking on election night, to see Labour lose places like Wrexham and Bridgend.The UK Labour Party must get back to being a party that votersrsquo can trust. That means we cannot just have a ldquoone more heave approach. We need someone who can speak to the whole of our country, not just one region or subset of voters, with the values and vision to win.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here.

The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay. While still a draft schedule of values, each council will also have to apply its own regional rate, based on the new proposed figures.“The Cathedral Quarter isn’t just about eating and drinking,” Gareth Neill, BID manager, Destination CQ told Ulster Business.“We have a vibrant ecosystem of arts and culture and fantastic built heritage that makes this area stand out, hospitality plays an integral part to the quality of le in this part of Belfast – for a city to be striving to attract new residents, increase our tourism offer these are crucial to the city’s success. “We are concerned about that the potential knock-on effects to the affected business owners and there’s a very real possibility it will have an impact on the price of a pint to the people who come to socialise in Cathedral Quarter. The knock-on effect of outdated methodology for calculation of rates on licensed premiseshas a potentially crippling effect on jobs and character of this area.”A spokesman for Land  Property Services said: “In Northern Ireland, nearly % of pubs will have no change or a decrease in their Net Annual Value .“Any business rate payer who thinks their new valuation may be incorrect, can contact LPS to arrange an informal review and supply any relevant information before the new valuation list comes into force on  April .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mip1.jpg","title":"mipim taking belfast to the world","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Joe ONeill and Suzanne Wylie Belfast Harbour boss Joe O’Neill will help lead a private and public sector delegation to MIPIM – the world’s biggest commercial property event – as chairman of the taskforce. He chats to John Mulgrew about the big announcements, fighting off the competition and attracting a global giant to Northern Ireland For Joe O’Neill and the wider delegation heading to potentially warmer climates, the proposition of selling the city and wider region to major investors has gotten easier.In the five years since Belfast ed to MIPIM – an event which sees tens of thousands descend on Cannes in France for four days of real estate and development – the private and public team, and taskforce, have developed a “strong ” in which to sell the city and Northern Ireland, with hopes of attracting a big name insurance or tech firm on the list.“MIPIM is a great  for the promotion of city-wide initiatives, and demonstrating to investors and to occupiers the growth potential in the city, and the opportunities for them and that the key stakeholders are all aligned behind an appropriate growth agenda,” Joe says.“You see dferent sizes and scales of stands out there – you see some really ambitious stands and proposed developments, so Belfast has to see it’s entry point into that. Belfast first and foremost will be competing against peer group cities within the UK… but then it is a worldwide show, so you will be competing against other cities.”Belfast is leading a major delegation this year, and will also be joined by representatives from other Northern Ireland councils, including those that are part of the Belfast Region City Deal, such as Mid  East Antrim. That deal is also going to be a focus for announcements and development, during the event.This year’s delegation will be led by a host of top private sector developers in Northern Ireland, alongside Belfast City Council and organisations such as Belfast Harbour. That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors. This year we are looking at launching schemes around digital innovation. That aligns with one of the themes in the Belfast Region City Deal, for the city and councils in the deal. We have a particular focus on cyber-security as an investment and operating location – particular those from the US.”Joe says that would be in addition to the already well-established cyber-security development at Catalyst in the Titanic Quarter, and that new names are coming in to the marketplace creating a “cluster” around the sector, and setting up Belfast and beyond as a new global hub.“We are looking at announcing some details around the Belfast-Dublin-London corridor,” Joe says.“As an economic corridor, or triangle. Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/johnm1.jpg","title":"companies must act quickly on new ir legislation reforms","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business At the start of this year the government launched a review into the changes to IR legislation which will affect medium and large private sector organisations and have far-reaching impacts on the way they engage with non-permanent workers, writes John Moore, managing director, Hays NI.The timeframe between the review and the reforms coming into effect in April is shorter than many would have liked but with the reforms now on the horizon, companies need to act, particularly those in sectors such as technology, construction and finance where use of contractors operating as personal services companiesis common. At a basic level, the reforms to IR legislation sht the responsibility of determining the tax status of personal services company workers to the company that engages them where previously they could self-certy. The original rules required the freelance contractor to determine their tax status, but HMRC believed non-compliance was common.Now,a person’s assignment falls outside of IR legislation, they are deemed to be self-employed, so gross payment will be made to the PSC. Butthe assignment falls inside of IR, the professional should be treated as an employee, applying PAYE and NIC deductions from their payment. In simple terms, the tax arrangements for contractors are changing so that they won’t get such a good dealthey can’t demonstrate their work is out of scope and employers will have to pay more for using and keeping what were previously non-payroll workers.This will have a big effect on how people choose to work and who they choose to work for, not to mention how organisations plan and budget. An organisation’s policy towards contractors will affect how attractive they are to freelancers. But on the other side we’ve already seen some risk averse companies adopt a blanket ban on freelancers just to be safe – meaning they are missing out on skilled professionals they need to deliver projects.In Northern Ireland, as where, it’s likely the IR reforms will hit technology hardest, but the effects could be wide ranging across roles in construction, project management and finance.We’ve heard anecdotal evidence of IT contractors leaving the big banks and starting to view early stage tech companies with less than  employees more favourably because they fall outside the scope of the legislation. When similar legislation was introduced in the public sector in , hundreds of highly skilled contractors left roles to join organisations who were prepared, often leading to projects being scrapped. Now the private sector is catching up, preparation is key and anyone who hasn’t done a review of what it means for their capacity should do so urgently. A Hays survey showed % of private sector firms expect cost increases when IR reforms come into effect, % expect to lose key talent and % think it will be harder to bring in non-permanent workers. A third of organisations surveyed were completely unaware of the reforms – a big concern given how tight the labour market is.So, first you need to determine whether assignments are inside or outside of IR. You need to have full visibility of all workers your organisation engages who are paid via agencies and consultancies as well as knowledge of how they are paid. You will also need to have the expertise to determine the tax status of each assignment. When you know that you can then start communicating with freelance workers, renegotiating working arrangements, standardising onboarding procedures and decidingany specialist skills need to be brought in house to get projects over the line.If you expect to use a high volume of temporary workers in , outsourcing your temporary worker provision through a managed services programme could be an option, as an expert would carry out accurate assessments for every temporary worker placed with you.Whatever stage you are at, don’t ignore IR. It’s coming and you need to understand it.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
