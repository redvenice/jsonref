Every child wants to go here and there and spend time with friends, he was sitting in one place all the time so he was very frustrated. \u0027It was hard for me watching other children playing outside and going to school and my child was not.\u0027When Mrs Jain and her husband Rajesh, 37, finally went to see a doctor about bariatric surgery in 2013, Mihir was so big he couldn’t walk properly.\u0027The doctor said he needed to see him but we couldn’t get Mihir out of the house at the time,’ she added. Mihir eventually made it to a hospital in December 2017, at which point the 5ft2in tall teenager weighed more than 37 stone (523lbs237kg), and was suffering with diabetes, breathing issues and high blood pressure.It is thought this made him the world\u0027s heaviest child, a title previously held by Arya Permana, also 14, from   Indonesia, who shed half of body weight after a life-saving gastric sleeve operation.          Operation: Mihir is filmed going into surgery on April 4, at Max Hospital, Delhi  After first losing weight thanks to a high-protein diet, the teenager was finally able to undergo surgery two months ago          In recovery: The teenager stands with Dr Pradeep Chowbey who carried out the surgeryMihir was promised a gastric bypass, if he was able to lose some weight first. He was put on a high protein diet for three months, and dropped to 31 stone (434lbs197kg).Mihir said: ‘I was determined to do what the doctor suggested. And when I lost weight on my own it gave me the determination to keep going. I wasn’t even scared about surgery, I just wanted to do what was needed to get better.’ Mihir finally underwent a gastric bypass surgery at the start of April, and has since been eating soups and soft foods, and has swapped fizzy drinks for juice.‘I feel wonderful,’ he said.‘I used to get very angry and I was aggressive all the time, I had many problems. And anger was there a lot but much less now. \u0027I couldn’t do normal every day things but I used to say to myself: don’t worry, you’ll do it some day. I have reached that some day.’While he still loves playing video games and watching Netflix, Mihir has now begun taking exercise and is looking forward to the day when he is a ‘normal weight’ and can return to school.Mihir said ‘This was a chance for me. I was excited about what will happen. Things have gone very well so far and for the first time in ages I am looking forward to the future.’"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/27/12/4DAE930B00000578-0-image-m-44_1530099737800.jpg","title":"May faces rebukes EU leaders stormy EU summit","story":"    The PM (pictured arriving at the EU summit today) is running the gauntlet of rebukes from fellow leadersWalking into the venue in Brussels, Mrs May told reporters: \u0027I look forward to speaking with fellow leaders about the very good progress we have made on the withdrawal agreement and looking forward to securing our strong future partnership, which I believe is in the interests of both the European Union and the United Kingdom. \u0027I think both sides are keen to continue that work at a faster pace than we have done up till now and certainly we would welcome that.\u0027 Asked if other EU leaders were telling Britain to \u0027get its act together\u0027, Mrs May said: \u0027We will be bringing the Cabinet together within the next week.

Our point of contact of course is Theresa May.\u0027 Mr Rutte also insisted the Irish border \u0027backstop\u0027 being demanded by the EU could not be temporary - as the UK has suggested. \u0027That is crucial and there has to be a backstop that is not temporary, but is continuous in case we are not able to solve this problem in the future,\u0027 he said.\u0027I don\u0027t want to speak in apocalyptic terms, but I believe the first, second and third priorities now is solving the issue of the Irish border. When that is solved, then so many other issues will be easier to discuss.\u0027\u0027I expect EU leaders to send a strong message to the UK that negotiations with the taskforce need to intensify. \u0027The lack of progress in the negotiations on the withdrawal agreement has been very disappointing. \u0027We still need to see detailed proposals from the UK on how it intends to deliver on the clear commitments it made in December and March.\u0027 Mr Varadkar\u0027s views were echoed by Danish prime minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen, who told his parliament in Copenhagen: \u0027It is worrying, given that it is now two years since we had a British referendum.\u0027 But Mrs May\u0027s former chief of staff Nick Timothy urged her to hold firm in the face of pressure. \u0027The EU showed last December - when the talks faltered over Northern Ireland that they want a deal,\u0027 he wrote in the Daily Telegraph. \u0027But they want a deal on the best terms for them, and the very worst for Britain. As things stand, they might well succeed.\u0027There is little point complaining, but we should listen and our strategy should change... The time for sincere cooperation with a partner that does not want to sincerely cooperate is over: we must toughen up.\u0027The EU has demanded a \u0027backstop\u0027 provision in the orce agreement that would essentially mean Northern Ireland staying in the single market and customs union if no other deal is reached. However, Mrs May has dismissed the idea as unacceptable because it would break up the UK.           Aides to French president Emmanuel Macron (pictured on a visit to Italy this week) have made clear he is ready to deliver a \u0027serious and grave\u0027 dressing down to the PM          EU council president Donald Tusk was in No10 earlier this week for talks with Mrs MayShe is hoping to hammer out detailed UK proposals for future trade at a Cabinet \u0027away day\u0027 at Chequers next week.But the PM was yesterday forced to deny her government is in meltdown as she faced a torrent of jibes in the Commons.Business Secretary Greg Clark has publicly urged companies to keep pushing for a \u0027soft\u0027 Brexit.By contrast, Jeremy Hunt has condemned the dire warning about the consequences of \u0027no deal\u0027 - from Airbus among others - as \u0027inappropriate\u0027 while Boris Johnson bluntly told a private reception \u0027f*** business\u0027. Senior Tory MP Nigel Evans urged both factions to \u0027put a sock in it\u0027 over fears the public are getting exasperated by Tory infighting.Suspicions have been raised that Mrs May will try to \u0027bounce\u0027 Brexiteers into concessions after sources confirmed the full Cabinet will attend the Chequers meeting on July 6.Mrs May previously failed to get a customs \u0027partnership\u0027 plan past her smaller Brexit \u0027War Cabinet\u0027 and some MPs believe she is trying to bypass the group in favour of a forum where she has more Remain-minded allies. One Cabinet source told MailOnline: \u0027We haven\u0027t seen an agenda yet.

These included nine valued at more than £250,000.The most expensive was the construction of a new conservation workshop on the site of the disused mushroom shed in the Home Park area of Windsor Castle, at a cost of £2.2 million, funded by the Royal Collection Trust.A further £1.4 million was spent on a replacement roof to Apartment 1, Kensington Palace - former home to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, now occupied by the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester.Work is expected to start next year on essential maintenance to the East Wing, which will see around 10,000 Royal Collection items decanted elsewhere. The Sovereign Grant for 2018-19 will be £82.2 million - a core of £49.3 million, plus an additional £32.9 million for resurfacing the palace.

The most expensive form of royal travel, mile for mile, is the royal train which costs approximately £20,000 per journey. Charles took seven journeys on it, which has sumptuous sleeping and dining cars.He also billed taxpayers £15,385 to charter a plane for a private day trip to London from Birkhall, his estate in Scotland. Aides declined to explain the reason but admitted there was no official engagement, saying royals were ‘allowed to travel from residence to residence’.The public paid £18,170 for Prince William to join the Passchendaele centenary commemoration in Belgium last July – and a further £30,414 to hire a separate private plane for Prince Charles to go too. Aides said the two princes were travelling from different starting points in Britain and following different programmes in Belgium.          Prince William flies privately internally in a country, but takes commercial planes to fly abroad, costing a lot less than his father The rise in Charles’s travel bill is in part down to the fact that, as heir to the throne, he is undertaking more travel on behalf of the Queen, who has stepped down from foreign tours in view of her age.The Prince of Wales derives most of his money from the Duchy of Cornwall, an estate of mainly farmland and residential property that was set up to provide a private income for the heir to the throne and his family. His income from the Duchy rose by 4.9 per cent to £21.7million last year, while he also got £1.2million from the Sovereign Grant from the Government. The prince paid £4.8million in tax, which he does voluntarily, a rise of 2 per cent on the previous year.           Prince Andrew, Duke of York, Queen Elizabeth II, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, Prince Charles, Prince of Wales, Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge and Princess Charlotte of Cambridge stand on the balcony of Buckingham Palace during Trooping The ColourYesterday officials said an incredible 10,000 precious artworks would have to be removed before the builders arrive in April.Some of the paintings, vases, tapestries and antiques will be loaned to galleries and museums around the country and the world.But others will be placed into commercial storage during the duration of the works.All 10,000 items are under the care of the Royal Collection, which has launched a massive operation to find them all temporary homes.          10,000 items are under the care of the Royal Collection, which has launched a massive operation to find them all temporary homesThe Chinese Dining Room, Yellow Drawing Room and lavish bedrooms used during state visits will all be pulled apart during the renovations - the biggest works at the palace since the aftermath of the Second World War.Leaky water pipes and dangerous old wiring behind the walls and beneath the floors all need fixing. Some 10 miles of pipes, 6,500 electrical sockets and 152 antique toilets will be replaced.The Duke of York’s private apartment will be affected by the works and he will have to move elsewhere in the palace. The Princess Royal, who also lives there, already has a second apartment at nearby St James’s Palace.Yesterday a senior courtier said it was hoped the works would not prevent the royals accessing the balcony for Trooping of the Colour next year, but admitted there was a doubt, saying: ‘It will be assessed. It needs to be safe.’ Another aide said: ‘We will be able to provide more details in the autumn, but the expectation is that it will be very much business as usual.’ He added the works were internal and there would not be any scaffolding on the outside of Buckingham Palace.

The Suri are a self-conscious and culturally proud people. They take part in a form of stick fighting called saginé or \u0027ceremonial duelling\u0027. It serves as a rite of passage for male youngsters and brings great prestige to men - it is especially important when seeking a bride - and they are very competitive, at the risk of serious injury and occasional death          Cattle are also enormously important to the Suri, as owning herds boosts status.

I took it on her wedding day in 1985. After the ceremony, which was held in a church in Manhattan, we went back to our aunt’s apartment on Park Avenue. When I was a child, my aunt would have us all over for Christmas dinner, so her home was very much a part of our family, although I hadn’t been there for a long time.The reception was an intimate affair, maybe 50 people, mostly family. It wasn’t loud. There was no music. My aunt was older. It was fairly staid, formal even, although Jill might remember things differently. My most salient memory of that day was that she married the most perfect person you could ever find. We were all very happy.This was a candid shot. There was no time to think about anything, barely time to focus. I don’t even remember if I asked Jill, who is wearing the gold dress, to stand up. And while that is an important Picasso on the wall – Angel Fernandez de Soto, from 1903 – I hadn’t intended to shoot it. Jill just happened to be sitting in front of it.I wasn’t really intending anything much. First of all, this was a party and I was a guest. And I didn’t have assistants. I was just walking around with my camera on a tripod, the flash on top, carrying some film holders between my legs or something. I do remember asking Andrea, the woman with the red hair, to turn. And I probably told my half-brother Paul: “Look at Jill.” But it all happened in seconds. The flash froze that stare on Jill’s face just as she got up.Look closely and you’ll see the similarities between her and the angel in the lamp directly behind her: the clasped hands the legs rendered visible by the flash the dress itself, a golden lamé masterpiece by Arnold Scaasi and the way Jill’s headdress melds with the floral arrangements behind to mimic the angel’s halo.There were further coincidences: the three apples in the painting on the right, echoing the three figures and that fortuitous slit going up the back of Andrea’s dress, breaking what would have otherwise been a very solid rectangle of white in the foreground. The whole palette! I mean, how about finding a redhead whose hair matches the walls?I know Jill’s face well, having photographed her so often. We are only 13 months apart, almost like twins, except that we’re so different. She is as uninhibited as I am controlled, and she has always had great style. I can’t remember if I showed her the pictures after her wedding. My family weren’t all that interested in my photography. I think they just thought: “Oh, here comes Tina again with her camera.” They were happy I was doing something, but I could have been a lawyer or a doctor or something. They certainly weren’t sitting there anxiously waiting to see the results. Actually, I don’t think I’ve ever had anybody anxious to see my pictures, probably because I rarely shoot anyone obviously self-conscious or vain. Which is not to say that shooting the wedding wasn’t scary. It was very scary – because I had such high expectations. I still do. Just recently, I photographed a woman who had appeared in several of my works from long ago. I hadn’t seen her in 30 years. The dreams and hopes I had for that image!

The project, which began in 2001, is perhaps unique in England, and the results have been spectacular. In what has become a glorious “mess”, the animals live out in the\u0026nbspopen all year round and give birth unassisted by humans. Formerly common plants – but also rare ones\u0026nbsp– have returned in profusion, together with insects, bats and other organisms. Scrubland, wetland and other habitats are\u0026nbspgradually rewiring themselves as herbicides and pesticides disappear. The increase in\u0026nbspthe variety and abundance of birds has been particularly astonishing. Even nightingales and turtle doves, whose numbers have crashed nationwide, are\u0026nbspreturning.Tree writes with grace about a legion of doubts, obstructions and delays. And there’s welcome detail. Sussex dialect apparently has more than 30 words for\u0026nbspkinds of mud: clodgy for a muddy field path after heavy rain gawn – sticky, foul-smelling mud gubber – black mud of rotting organic matter ike – a\u0026nbspmuddy mess pug – sticky yellow Wealden clay slab – the thickest type of mud. The list goes on. The book contains moments of lyricism and revelation. Surprised by a “blizzard” of painted lady butterflies in July 2009, Tree experiences what could be called the auraculous – a miracle of noise. “The sound of a single butterfly is imperceptible,” she writes. “But tens of thousands have a breath of their own, like the backdraft of a waterfall or an accumulating weather front. It feels as though the oscillating susurration of their wingbeats, pounding away on their supernatural wavelength, might dissolve the world into atoms.”Wilding is more than the story of a single project, however ambitious. Tree is a trenchant critic of the intensive agriculture that has led to soil degradation and erosion. She questions the goal-driven frameworks of much conservation work: when there is no preferred end state, formerly rare\u0026nbspand even vanished species tend suddenly to reappear. And she battles heroically against the English addiction to tidiness. For a nation obsessed with orderliness and boundaries, land that is endlessly morphing, on its way to\u0026nbspbeing something else, can be discomforting. She\u0026nbspalso\u0026nbspmakes the case that it is possible to feed 10\u0026nbspbillion humans on this planet while also leaving more space for the wild.Inadvertent wilding is nothing new. The demilitarised zone between North and South Korea harbours rare birds including red-crowned and white-naped cranes and mammals such as the Amur goral, Asiatic black bear and musk deer. In the Chernobyl exclusion zone, created after the 1986 nuclear accident, there has been a resurgence of animals such as the lynx and European bison. Fascination with such places and what they may portend was captured in 2007 in Alan Wiseman’s bestseller The World Without Us, which explores what would happen to the natural and built environment if humans disappeared.For most of its advocates, rewilding is not a question of removing humans from the scene, but an active process of intervention intended to maximise ecosystem richness. For some, such as the journalist Emma Marris, it is an enlightened, ecologically aware and rambunctious form of gardening. When animals have been eliminated, soil has been degraded or the land has otherwise been impoverished beyond a certain stage then a rich and productive ecosystem will not rebuild itself. The reintroduction of missing species or animals can help reverse the trend.Deliberate wilding – or rewilding – has emerged gradually as a concept and practice since the term was coined in the 1980s. One of the best known examples is the reintroduction of wolves to Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming in\u0026nbsp1995. The wolves ate many of the elk, and this allowed trees to\u0026nbspregrow, which led to a chain of events that vastly increased the total abundance and variety of life in the park.A major inspiration for Knepp is a project that would not even exist but for large scale engineering work. The Oostvaardersplassen reserve exists on a small part of the land reclaimed from the Zuiderzee in the Netherlands in 1968, and is wilding at its most artificial. As at Knepp, deer, cattle and ponies that have been introduced are left to their own devices. Birdlife has flourished and in 1989, only 21 years after reclamation, the 6,000 hectare site was declared a wetland of international importance for nature. White-tailed eagles nest in the willows.As landowners in one of the most desirable parts of Britain, Burrell and Tree are in a position of privilege. The land is theirs. But they partnered with community, government, conservation groups and ecologists, and their rewilding is for all of us. Not least because as taxpayers we have supported their efforts through such mechanisms as the Countryside Stewardship scheme. For decades, European agricultural subsidies have distorted British farming and encouraged damaging practices but the EU has also pioneered environmental protections, including most recently a\u0026nbsptotal ban on bee-harming pesticides. A British government that believes deregulation is the answer to almost everything is unlikely to be a friend to less destructive agricultural practices, let alone rewilding.The challenges will be all the greater when large numbers of animals die at rewilding sites. This recently happened at Oostvaardersplassen, where thousands of red deer, horses and cattle starved. It’s one thing to contemplate a tangled bank of the kind vividly described in the conclusion of On the Origin of\u0026nbspSpecies – rich in flowers and creatures flitting about. It\u0026nbspis another to confront so starkly the Darwinian struggle for existence.But I will be cheering for the rewilders. The novelist Richard Powers has suggested that a huge part of human anxiety is heightened by “species loneliness” – the sense that we’re here by ourselves, and that there is no purposeful act except to gratify ourselves. “We have to un-blind ourselves to this,” he\u0026nbspsays. Rewilding can help, and Tree’s book is a\u0026nbspgood\u0026nbspcompanion for the journey.• Wilding is published by Picador.

There are more than 140,000 electric vehicles on the UK’s roads, most of which are plug-in hybrid vehicles that can run for a short distance on battery power before switching to petrol or diesel.BP estimates the number of electric vehicles will hit 12m by 2040, although some analysts put the figure much higher.Tufan Erginbilgic, the chief executive of BP’s downstream ision, which includes refineries and petrol stations, said: “Effectively, BP becomes a leading provider of energy to low-carbon vehicles in the UK. I would like to emphasise the world and the UK needs ultra-fast charging for electric vehicles to scale up.”He denied the transaction was a defensive move, saying the company had good returns in powering electric cars, comparable to other parts of its business. “I don’t think this is defensive at all,” he said.Erginbilgic said BP was doing more on electric car infrastructure in the UK than any other market, although the firm is also piloting chargers in Germany later this year.The company said the rebadged BP Chargemaster would prioritise ultra-fast 150KW charging, which can add around 450-600 miles of range per hour of charging. That would mean a car such as Jaguar’s new I-Pace could add about 100 miles in 10 minutes.Charging a car at home usually takes around six to 12 hours, unless the household has an upgraded charging point. Bob Dudley, BP’s chief executive, has said the company is finally strong enough financially, after the Deepwater Horizon disaster and oil price slump, to start moving deeper into greener energy.The £130m paid for Chargemaster is part of the $500m (£382m) the UK-based oil firm has pledged to spend on low-carbon activities and follows a recent return to solar power.However, it is still a small slice of the total $15-16bn that the company will spend this year.The foray into electric car infrastructure is much bigger than the one BP made in January, when it invested $5m in the US firm Freewire Technologies. BP’s Anglo-Dutch rival Shell took its first steps into the market last year, installing chargers on its forecourts and buying the Dutch firm New Motion, which has 30,000 charging points in Europe.Asked if the company could be expected to make further steps into the electric car market, Erginbilgic said: “Yes, but not for the sake of investment they must be in line with our strategy. I don’t believe the fastest person in this space will succeed.”Albert Cheung, an analyst at Bloomberg New Energy Finance, said: “Oil majors like BP face a double threat from electric vehicles. They’ll take a hit on oil demand but they’ll also face declining customer traffic at their petrol stations. BP understand the threats and see the opportunity to be part of the EV industry.”BNEF expects more than half of UK cars to be electric by 2040."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cdec2a2abde0d5f56594e09de57b8d9016746103/0_218_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0db3b8303dbd8ec0e4f23235be0ad23c","title":"brexit britons french students spanish","story":"Putain de bordel de merde. Ces rosbifs sont cons comme des bites. Pardon my French, but we must make the most of the obscenities while we can. English children are increasingly unwilling to learn the language of Molière and MC Solaar, according to the British Council, which reports that within a few years Spanish will overtake it as the most-studied foreign language. At A-level, takeup has already fallen to 8,300, from 21,300 in 1997, while Spanish has climbed to 7,600.Laziness seems to have a lot to do with it. As Vicky Gough, a schools adviser at the British Council, put it, “There is a perception of Spanish being easier to pick up than other languages, which may account in part for its popularity.” Which, one might say, confirms another perception: that the kids of today want everything handed to them on a plate, from chauffeur service to and from school, to first-class university degrees. When I was a boy, we had to walk to Dotheboys Hall in all weathers because it was “character-forming”, and even clever kids were happy with a 2ii.French is undeniably hard work, with its irregular verbs (je suis, tu es, il est, nous sommes …), its convoluted numbering system (vingt et un, soixante-treize, quatre-vingt-dix-neuf …) and its unnecessary sexual differentation. In no sane world is a table (une table) feminine and a desk (un bureau) masculine – presumably on the basis that one has lovely legs and the other doesn’t – the plural of un oeil (an eye) les yeux, or something that is white and masculine blanc and something that is white and feminine blanche. Come to think of it, in no sane world is something that is white, singular and masculine blanc, something that is white, singular and feminine blanche, something that is white, plural and masculine blancs, something that is white, plural and feminine blanches and something that is white, plural and a mix of genders blancs again.Spanish has its own absurdities, of course, and there’s no definitive ranking to tell us which language is tougher to master. But even if it is French, that’s no reason to avoid it. As Nietzsche put it, “That which does not kill us makes us stronger.” He said it in German, of course, but since that’s now even less popular than French, no one would understand that.If an easy life was all that mattered, we wouldn’t wrestle with cryptic crosswords or study medicine. Stephen Hawking would not have written A Brief History of Time, and so many less brilliant people would not have at least tried to read it. Exercising our minds makes us both smarter and more useful to society. And, at the risk of stating the obvious – and ignoring Ireland, like a Brexiteer – France is our nearest neighbour, our most intimate frenemy. We once ruled much of it and it (or at least a certain Norman) once ruled much of us.After centuries at each other’s throats, we fought side by side in two world wars. Our destinies are so entwined that in 1940 Churchill and De Gaulle attempted to merge the countries in a “Franco-British Union”. And yet both nations can be resolutely monoglot, sneering at those who don’t speak their language as the Greeks and Romans once mocked the stammering bar-bar-barbarians. Though born and raised in Britain, I have fluent French and spent most of the 00s in deepest, darkest Lorraine. I still remember how rude officials could be to those qui ne parlaient pas français, while being unfailing polite to moi.The more Britons make the effort to learn French, the richer both cultures will be. Spain is now more popular as a holiday destination (another reason for the rise of its language, according to the British Council) but the stakes are lower there, since all that most of us dream of doing is ordering some albóndigas or a bottle of rioja without needing to point at a menu.Like it or not, we are more invested in France, which has come to epitomise culture, good taste, style and savoir-vivre – even though that reverence is the product of ignorance as much as familiarity. Only when we understand French can we appreciate how vacuous their media is, or how unfunny their comedy. Only when we speak French can we set them straight about being the world’s greatest cooks and lovers, or about their bloody awful taste in rock music. And, to give them their due, only when we know their language inside out can we appreciate how beautiful their literature can be, or how moving their song lyrics.“Je t’ai dans la peau,” Edith Piaf once sang. “Y a rien à faire. Obstinément, tu es là …” In other words, I’ve got you under my skin.

Germany bottled it, exited the World Cup. And I had to watch it happen in the heartland of football failure, a country where the years of hurt now number 52.Watching the World Cup as a German in London is to experience an emotional rollercoaster involving fear, hope and schadenfreude. I’m still slightly wary of leaving the house in my Germany shirt, and was seriously considering flying back if we met England in the later rounds. The prospect of staying in London to watch the English lose to us on penalties yet again seemed a bit too intimidating.Those reflections now seem to belong to a slightly different era.As the former coach Jürgen Klinsmann once famously said: “When Germans have achieved something big, they try to achieve again with less effort.” That didn’t go so well. After the defeats against Mexico and South Korea, I had to shame-walk the streets of London in my Germany shirt after finally being brave enough to sport it in public for the first time after four years in the UK. Perhaps I jinxed it.Luckily I live in south-east London, among fellow immigrants, so the reactions were better than expected. Apart from a few evil looks from some builders, who I couldn’t clearly identify as English, people were actually rather compassionate. My workmates – big shoutout to Syria and Argentina! – tried to cheer me up, and one of the less hostile guys from the construction site agreed with me that we might need a new coach, as I returned from work.So we’re out, and Lineker’s maxim no longer applies. “Football is a simple game,” said Gary Lineker after England were knocked out by Germany in the semi-finals at Italia ’90. “Twenty-two men chase a ball for 90 minutes, and at the end the Germans always win.”Well, quite. But you English should beware hubris. During Euro 2016, I noticed that the English usually talk up their squad to dangerous levels before an international tournament, as they’re usually very decent on paper and win a few absolutely pointless friendlies. Meaningless victories at group stage then induce a state of national euphoria – see beating Panama 6-1. After that, a cataclysmic event such as losing to Iceland normally comes along, and the country plunges into a bout of sarcastic self-deprecation and ticks off another year on the calendar of hurt. Don’t count on it not happening again.Anyway, believe it or not, even though I am German, I too have known dark football times in the past – for example the European Championships of 2000, when Germany were knocked out at the group stage, finishing below England (also knocked out). However, I admit that after the successful recent years, and Löw being able to leave world-class talent such as Leroy Sané at home, I was confident that we wouldn’t have to experience such humiliation again anytime soon.As we all know since yesterday, things went somewhat against expectations. Not picking our only outstanding dribbler (Sané) didn’t turn out to be such a great idea, considering we were expecting three teams in our group who would park the bus. The Erdoğan scandal wasn’t helpful either, but only played a minor role in this one-act play of German football arrogance.• Oliver Imhof is a freelance journalist based in London"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a7c6fe97a51e20536fc6c91e4c254612745f0011/0_116_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d52ba50c3bd9b67e6bdde9f6d0e6ffe1","title":"menstrual leave period taboo work reform women health","story":"In my school there was a code: The gym teacher would ask, “Who’s not having a shower?”– and that was the only way periods were acknowledged, ever. How British, how normal, how expected. I don’t remember ever taking a day off school with period pain, though sometimes it was so bad I was given prescription painkillers by my GP, without question. The question should have been: “If your pain is that bad, is something wrong?” It turns out it that it was, and eventually I was diagnosed with severe endometriosis at the age of 40, by which time my fertility – damaged by endometriosis, probably – was long wrecked. I wish I’d had the courage to demand better, but how could I, when I didn’t know any better?Like millions of other women and girls, I had never encountered anything in society to teach me to treat my periods with anything but shame. It is a powerful message of stigma – so powerful that I found myself recently looking at a lipstick in my pocket and worrying that it looked like a tampon. And this was just after I’d given a speech about the terrible toll of menstrual taboos for the WaterAid charity.Yet a new report by Public Health England shows what we all know: that women’s concerns about period pains and periods are their third biggest reproductive health worry (after avoiding unwanted pregnancies and their sex lives). They just don’t dare speak about it.We have all grown up with the same surround-sound messaging about our biology: be quiet. You can see this from the earliest advertising for what is laughably called feminine hygiene (are we dirty?): ads showing women playing sports in tennis whites, and the word “fresh” being used with abandon. I’m quite fond of a Kotex ad from the 1930s that encourages women to buy its pads so they can be “tangy”. Fresh, tangy, sporty: all these are codes too, for not talking about pain and discomfort – and, above all, for not smelling. This stifling of an entirely normal biological activity causes real harm.A paper called The Girl Who Cried Pain found extensive evidence that women’s pain is treated as less important than men’s by healthcare workers. One study found that boys with post-operative pain were given codeine while girls were given paracetamol. Men who had had a coronary artery bypass graft got narcotics women after the same procedure were given sedatives, “suggesting that female patients were more often perceived as anxious rather than in pain”. When researchers reviewed evidence from the American Medical Association’s Task Force on Gender Disparities in Clinical Decision Making, “physicians were found to consistently view women’s (but not men’s) symptom reports as caused by emotional factors, even in the presence of positive clinical tests”. Why does this continue? Partly because we let it.The last few years have seen things shift in periods at least: now Thinx and other companies do loud and bold advertising, with posters on subways showing grapefruits supposed to suggest vaginas. The first ad that dared show period blood, not blue windscreen-wiper wash, was launched by Bodyform last year. It only took nearly a century.Perhaps legalised time off is a solution. Legislation offering menstrual leave exists already. Women in Japan, Korea and a few other countries are allowed to request days off work, something that one academic called “an unusual institutionalised practice”. It sounds like a good idea. When Italy tried to bring in similar legislation last year, it didn’t pass, and critics came up with the usual objections: Italian women are already stigmatised for their biology, with some employers forcing them to sign undated resignation letters in case they become pregnant. Other objections: menstrual leave sends the message that menstruation is a disease or an affliction. It is sexism, or stigmatisation. It may lead to the women who seek menstrual leave being paid less or be given less authority. Japanese women rarely use it because they fear exactly that, or that they might be considered weak. (This of course would not happen if men menstruated – as Gloria Steinem wrote, brilliantly, in 1978.)That’s not the legislation’s fault. Men won’t hire women if we have menstrual leave, wrote one magazine editor, as if the problem were women, not the men who wouldn’t hire them. What is that, if not internalised stigma? An enlightened employer knows that a woman who can work without being bent double with cramps is a better employee.Whether menstrual leave is the answer is unclear, but at least it puts periods and period pain on the political agenda. Gordon Brown, wrote his adviser Damian McBride, didn’t dare announce that he had reduced the tampon tax – a sure vote-winner – because he couldn’t bear to say the word “tampons” at the dispatch box. Laws are words, and words of all kinds are the solution to stigma. Public Health England’s conclusion was that women “desire that reproductive health issues are normalised and destigmatised so that they can be discussed openly”. When the silence about period pain is still so loud, talking is a decent start."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db40a2c49cf42492e706e5ac5ba54d7e6210742c/45_0_2559_1536/master/2559.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=955941ec2f35cf80c5bc31b08aec31a7","title":"tories tawdry jostling theresa may brexit","story":"The coincidence is uncanny: as Theresa May sits down to dinner tonight in Brussels, England battle Belgium on the football pitch. But the leaders facing burgeoning EU crises will talk little about Brexit, an afterthought over the petits fours. Beyond admonishing her for offering no plan, what can they do but shrug?She arrives yet again unable to explain the inexplicable: how can Britain have no plausible proposal after two long years? She will promise that miraculously, in 10 days’ time, after her Chequers cabinet away-day, she will have a final plan, agreed and united: why would they believe that?Rolling their eyes, they will ask why that cabinet meeting was not fixed before today’s summit, long described as “crucial”? After two wasted years, the EU warns that there are in effect only six working weeks left for negotiation before the October summit and signing of a final agreement. The cabinet ate my homework, she may plead, as she sits there helplessly with no authority to propose anything. Schadenfreude at Angela Merkel’s own weakness will be her only small sour solace – but, unlike the World Cup, a weaker Germany is no help.All cabinets are dysfunctional in their own way. Cameron was forced into his fateful referendum to purge the Eurosceptic disease. The BlairBrown schism was a pointlessly destructive cabinet feud, signifying nothing. Major was brought down by the same kind of “bastards” that wrought the current woe. Thatcher was eventually knifed by her “vegetables”. Harold Wilson, his cabinet split on the EU referendum, dangled over the Bennite v Jenkinsite ravine. Yet governments got things done despite internal ructions.This time is different. With no Brexit agreement, everything else in May’s government is paralysed. Maybe she never meant those words anyway, but nothing has progressed her opening decree about “burning injustices” and the “just about managing”.The great Euro-schism gifted the keys to No 10 to this most inept leader: her impossible task was always to heal it, and now Chequers is billed as that last chance. But the disgraceful behaviour of her cabinet suggests a party too wildly out of control, too intoxicated with rebellion and personal vanities to whip back into coherent government.Battle lines along the Euro-split were inevitable. But this is not two orderly battalions facing off for the final conflict, but a rabble of deplorables elbowing each other for the top job. For non-Tories, the spectacle should be an uproarious delight, a comedy of absurdities, as each “look at me!” contender looks more preposterous than the last. But one of them might win – and these are dangerous times.Liz Truss returned to her Britannia Unchained theme in a clumsy leadership bid this week, calling for rapid deregulation of everything, and attacking Gove for his tiny environmental curbs on straws and wood-burning stoves. Remember, she’s the one who wanted child-minders so deregulated they should each care for six toddlers single-handed. Priti Patel, another author, not to be outdone, just attacked her party as unmeritocratic, signalling her own humble background. And the less said about Gavin Williamson, the better.When Boris Johnson said “fuck business”, Jeremy Hunt suddenly realised he was being left behind and jumped in with his own ludicrous admonition to businesses such as Airbus to stop making “inappropriate … threats”. The party of business is dead and industry despairs, because for now, Brexit fantasies still beat the fatal facts, which risk bearing down too late.Others, too, rush to join this rogues’ gallery of ambitious fools and self-promoters, outbidding one another for Brexit zealotry. What makes them so despicable is that Brexit is just a tool in their leadership bid, not a war of ideas and ideals but mere power jockeying. May has lost control and the lower she sinks, the harder they compete for her job. The real damage done to their party is this: to win the leadership they have to be raving Brexiters and illiberal rightwingers. But to win a future general election, the new leader must swivel 180 degrees, as Cameron did, to pretend to be modern, compassionate, green, huggy and anything but nasty.Imagine the EU leaders gazing down the table tonight at Theresa May, observing the rowdy rabble behind her who refuse to agree on anything. Why take her seriously, unless she can bring a serious Brexit proposition that conforms to the EU rules the UK helped draw up? Until then, should they laugh or cry? The Tory party in such shameless disarray is deeply damaging to us all."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a4e2c76422c86185c41edac6bc8a0a69eae7b17/866_0_2418_1451/master/2418.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=65b939511f48ea5f87700244324e4de5","title":"incredibles 2 feminism animation","story":"With Elastigirl taking centre stage, the new Pixar film’s feminist cape is streaming proudly. But the wider animation industry needs to catch upBrie Larson is the latest Hollywood actor to call for a greater gender balance in film criticism – yet when the US reviews for Incredibles 2 emerged after its 15 June release, voices were overwhelmingly male. Not only that, but some were so focused on their arousal at Elastigirl’s shapely form, they failed to spot – or at least comment upon – the fact that the film is a feminist triumph.As a female film critic watching Incredibles 2, I was thrilled to see an animation that bucked tired gender cliches even more than the first film had. The plot that sees Mrs Helen ParrElastigirl (voiced by Holly Hunter) going to work while her husband looks after the kids isn’t a simple case of role reversal: it’s an act of sisterhood. When rich benefactor Winston Deavor (Bob Odenkirk) starts a plan to bring back banned superheroes, it’s his tech-savvy sister Evelyn Deavor (Catherine Keener) who crunches the numbers and states that Mrs Incredible is the best person for the world-saving job – she’s statistically less liable to cause havoc and more likely to get results. “Heavyweight problems need heavyweight solutions,” bristles Elastigirl’s bulky husband (Craig T Nelson), unaccustomed to having his status challenged – but, like Winston, he complies. Disney-Pixar’s latest film shows signs of taking this on board, and not just when it comes to Helen and her superhero daughter, Violet (Sarah Vowell). We also see the return of successful costume designer Edna Mode (voiced by the film’s writer-director Brad Bird) while a key figure is a female ambassador (Isabella Rossellini), who is presented without comment on her gender. She happens to have grey hair, as do an unusual number of the women in the film – and they are far from hobbling grannies. Cast your mind back to action movies where there are gatherings of influential people in a glamorous location, say at a mayoral opening or a party on a yacht. Chances are – animated or otherwise – these will be dominated by sharp-suited men and a few younger women in tight dresses, a distinctly Weinstein flavour. I couldn’t help wondering if Incredibles 2 was consciously trying to avoid this trope, despite being in the planning many years before the #MeToo campaign. Disney has shown an increasing commitment to family-friendly feminism in recent years: such films as Maleficent and Frozen aren’t simply happy accidents.Might the Weinstein scandal finally have called Time’s Up to unconscious gender bias in animations as well as live action? Marge Dean, president of Women in Animation, says: “The landscape is changing rapidly. There has been movement for the last 50 years, but when the sexual harassment in Hollywood came to fore and there were consequences to male bad behaviour, everything shifted. People started listening to women and believing them. This has empowered women to speak up more.” Pixar itself felt the full force of this, with its co-founder and chief creative officer John Lasseter stepping down after allegations of misconduct.Predictably enough, and despite its record-breaking box-office results in the US, Incredibles 2 has faced a social media backlash. (As if anticipating this, an early scene sees Violet’s schoolmate stating that he’s not intimated by strong girls – because he’s pretty “secure”.) Some US punters remained unamused. @JonWest56 wrote on Twitter: “Tried to relive my childhood by seeing Incredibles 2 yesterday. The movie would have been fine if there wasn’t an agenda. Very modern feminist movie. Leave politics out of cartoons and children’s movies. Bad enough it’s all you hear now, but kids movies?!? COME ON”It’s shocking to think that audiences have been so conditioned that they see a reflection of current, real-world gender dynamics as “political” – especially as Mr Incredible and his two sons see plenty of action, too. This complaint echoes the territorial war cries surrounding the all-female Ghostbusters, and the toxic male Star Wars fans who trolled anyone who supported the fact that The Last Jedi had interesting female characters. But the Twitter naysayers may have to get used to it: there’s been a gradual shift towards complex female characters at the centre of animated movies – and very successful ones.While feisty young heroines – Princess Merida in Brave, Riley Andersen in Inside Out, Moana, Finding Dory – are becoming more common in the Disney-Pixar universe, Incredibles 2 is unusual in offering older, urbane, complicated female characters. In one of several Bechdel test-passing scenes in Incredibles 2, Helen and Evelyn share a drink in what looks like whisky glasses (again, when did you last see that?) and talk about gender dynamics in the workplace, discussing the “man’s world”. I found it quietly groundbreaking: it offered hope that a generation of young girls would be able to envisage a complex working future, albeit with less dramatic moral challenges than those faced by Helen Parr. But while it might pass the Bechdel test, Incredibles 2 doesn’t pass on all counts. Having crunched the numbers, Dr Natalie Wreyford, research fellow on the Calling the Shots project at the University of Southampton, says: “Incredibles 2 has three named male characters for every named female character. One of those women is voiced by a man, and another is only heard off-screen – nagging!” She also points to the gender ratio in the film crew. “There is a difference between paying lip service to equality, and having a woman’s perspective on the world. Incredibles 2 has more than 10 men working in the animation department for every woman. That’s a huge imbalance. The director is a man, and most of the key roles are held by men.” This holds true for most animated films. “Animation is still a profession dominated by men, despite there being more female than male animation students. These men do not have a very good track record of including women on screen, or even letting them speak when they are on screen – the male characters in Frozen, for example, have more lines than the women, despite Elsa and Anna being the leads.” The recent female-directed Japanese anime Maquia improved on this and proved the naysayers – who claimed that women film-makers were too “realistic” for fantasy animation – categorically wrong.There is good news on this front: Jennifer Lee, the co-director of Frozen, was recently hired as one of Lasseter’s replacements as the new chief creative officer of Walt Disney Animation Studios. “It marks an important moment in the visibility of women within American animation,” says Dr Christopher Holliday, an animation expert at King’s College London, “and a real chance for the industry to find a new set of female voices.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1797a2e80ef94dd41fd396a6b823c97664efe67a/205_360_2918_1750/master/2918.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f500391c137bfa61827316cb534d2f24","title":"sicario 2 soldado review benicio del toro josh brolin","story":"Isis is smuggling suicide bombers into the US in this fierce and riveting sequel that chimes with Trump-era tribulationsWith the luck and timing that always go with talent, screenwriter Taylor Sheridan has come up with an uncompromisingly fierce thriller that involves the US government separating a Mexican father from his child as part of a plan to crack down on illegal border crossings.He and Italian director Stefano Sollima (known for the 2015 mob drama Suburra) have collaborated on a horribly gripping sequel to Sheridan’s 2015 Mexican cartel picture Sicario (directed by Denis Villeneuve). This delivers a coolly targeted payload of brutality, launched from a cauldron of male aggression and international politics.That Mexican father-and-child motif is related to other parental agonies: a US agent’s memory of his dead daughter, a woman working for the Mexican cartels who bizarrely brings her infant to a payoff, a terrified woman who tries to get her child out of a supermarket before a suicide bomber presses the detonator. But this film is no bleeding-heart liberal manifesto. It is tactlessly about just that Latino gangbanger-migrant connection that the Trump administration seek to exploit and amplify at every opportunity Sheridan fuses this with a war-on-terror aesthetic taken from the foreign policy of previous administrations. There is something of Kathryn Bigelow in the night-vision scenes, Michael Mann in the large-calibre weaponry and high-speed convoys, and something also of the Coens’ No Country for Old Men, which like this film stars Josh Brolin. And as a grandiose, episodic story of evil, it has something of Christopher Nolan’s Batman films. It is a violent action noir, rocket-fuelled with its own reckless cynicism.Brolin reprises his role from the first movie as US government agent Matt Graver, specialising in torture and deniable dirty tricks, working with operative Alejandro (Benicio del Toro) who had a personal score to settle with the cartels. Now the situation is that Isis are moving suicide bombers into the United States through Mexico, working with the gangs south of the border: Sheridan and Sollima create a blisteringly powerful terrorist-outrage scene in a Texas supermarket. The US government gets Graver and Alejandro to run interference on a monumentally dangerous scale: incite a fully-fledged war between the cartels to disrupt this new entry point. And they plan to do this by kidnapping the spoilt teenage-princess daughter of a top gang boss, Isabel Reyes (a very good performance by Isabela Moner), and blaming it on rival gangs.In the last movie, the sweaty and aggressive maleness was offset by the presence of Emily Blunt as smart young FBI agent Kate Macer, and it’s arguably a flaw that she is not here for this one. Yet this movie is just so piercingly disturbing and riveting. Moreover, Moner is very interesting as the entitled mob heiress who is shown beating up a fellow student at her posh school, smugly making it clear to the principal that he can’t touch her for it – but then terrified as her abductors suddenly show up, as if to enact some supernaturally green-lit punishment. Once released, Moner’s Isabel is calm, blank, watchful as if somehow sensing that her kidnappers and rescuers are the same people, and far from ready simply to accept whatever situation she finds herself in. Meanwhile, a boy called Miguel (played by newcomer Elijah Rodriguez) is recruited by the bad guys for illicit border crossings. He is to be the soldado, or soldier, of the title, his existence intersecting fatefully with those of Matt and Alejandro.Inevitably, things don’t go to plan with Matt and Alejandro’s gang-war ploy and the Washington politicos, chiefly top aide Cynthia Foards (Catherine Keener) are furious at certain embarrassing footage being unveiled on Fox News. This movie channels the paranoia and bad faith that’s in the air at the moment and converts it into a thriller of visceral hostility and overwhelming nihilism. It’s all killer, no filler."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d14580079ec492b336ba6539d00ceaee888cee92/76_125_3319_1992/master/3319.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f1833538d29572c8baf81bb904afc80","title":"when you watch your country play in the world cup who do you watch with","story":"If you’re a fan of the World Cup and have friends and family over to watch your country play, we’d like to hear from you With the World Cup fast approaching, we’d like to hear from families and or groups of friends living all over the UK watching their home country play.

You wouldn’t have thought so on Wednesday evening. Anyone who was walking the streets of Berlin kept staring into the empty faces of people trudging zombie-like to the next tube station and felt like an extra in some post-apocalyptic drama.One can understand why those fans were shell-shocked. If you count the Confederations Cup as a big tournament, Germany had reached eight semi-finals at major events in a row since 2005. Quite apart from the fact nobody has ever achieved anything remotely like this before – not even one of the many fine Brazilian teams in history, not even the Germans themselves previously – it lulled the country into a sense of security that turned out to be very false indeed.Make no mistake, there had been warning signs before the national team left for Russia. Not the fitness debate surrounding some players, most notably Manuel Neuer. That was par for the course, as Germany always go into a World Cup haunted by injury worries. No, it’s rather that a strange mood had engulfed the team in the weeks before the tournament.The preparation matches were sluggish, like the group games that followed. Then there was the debate triggered by Mesut Özil’s and Ilkay Gündogan’s meeting with the Turkish President Recep Erdogan. It was shocking to hear German fans booing German internationals. It clearly got under Gündogan’s skin and while Özil outwardly remained his inscrutable self, we can assume he was shaken as well.Finally, there were reports about two camps in the squad the established players who won the World Cup and the hungry youngsters who lifted the Confederations Cup. The rift was probably not as deep as some observers claimed, but everybody could see that there was a world of difference between players who were hungry and eager to prove themselves – think Marco Reus and Julian Brandt – and most of the veterans.For the first time, either as assistant or head coach, Joachim Löw failed to create team spirit, traditionally the side’s biggest strength. Löw must have sensed it, because this concern was probably why he did not call up Bayern Munich striker Sandro Wagner and cut Manchester City’s Leroy Sané from the squad. Two players with a bit of an ego.Even the fans seemed unprepared for the tournament. There were far fewer Germany flags on display than we have become used to since the 2006 World Cup. One theory says the rise of the political right has reintroduced scepticism about the use of national symbols. Another points towards a growing disillusionment with football in general, epitomised by all those fan protests during the Bundesliga season just past. Personally, I think the fans were just like the players – tired.So, what now?First, Löw has to step down. No, this is not a populist call for heads to roll, I’m merely stating the obvious. Actually, there are many good reasons why he should stay on, starting with the fact that his only logical successor is unlikely to leave Anfield any time soon. But the unwritten rule says our national coach has to resign if the team is knocked out in the quarter-finals of a tournament. Löw would probably have been the first Germany manager to break this, and may even have kept his job if the team had been eliminated in the round of 16 by the likes of Brazil. But the group stage? No way.The national team is an institution like Volkswagen, or one of the major parties. And of course Volkswagen CEO Martin Winterkorn resigned in the wake of the emissions scandal, stating: “I am doing this in the interests of the company even though I am not aware of any wrong doing on my part.” And, of course, a party leader steps down after an awful election result, simply because it’s his responsibility.Also, there is really no alternative. To stay with the political analogy – if Löw decides to continue he’ll be a sitting duck, pretty much like Social Democrat Martin Schulz, who opted not to resign after his party’s September 2017 election debacle. But of course his public standing was so damaged that he belatedly threw in the towel five months after the historic defeat.But a new national manager won’t be enough. Another reason why Germany’s early exit wasn’t totally unexpected was the fact the recent European club seasons were a disaster for the Bundesliga. Since the 2014 World Cup, only four German clubs have reached the quarter-finals of the Europa League and not one made the semis.There will be calls for a radical rethinking – and that usually means an attack on the 50+1 rule (which prevents our clubs from being owned or controlled by iniduals or companies). However, for anyone who cares about the national team, this would be the worst possible scenario. All examples from abroad indicate that deep-pocketed investors are not interested in grooming homegrown talent, as this takes time and is hardly glamorous. Provided those investors who are supposedly waiting to sink large amounts of cash into our clubs do really exist, their money is going buy expensive foreign stars who will relegate German talents to the bench.So we have to continue on the path we have chosen – but we should also ask the one question that is truly worrying. It is a question not only raised by the performance of the team in Russia but also by the fact that Borussia Dortmund, widely lauded for their youth movement, had only one player in Germany’s World Cup squad as the talent the club nurtures tends to be foreign: Christian Pulisic, Ousmane Dembélé, Jadon Sancho.The question is: did we win the 2014 World Cup because our famous Talent Development Programme worked a treat and produced amazing players, or did we simply luck into one golden generation and now have to wait until the hand of fate deals us the next?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6d9560eb50720045227fc5e132f287fa2ef99c8/0_161_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0b374678bfd57cf5bf4e0610ad3a2ace","title":"sweden mikael lustig germany exit world cup","story":"Several Swedish players have admitted they were pleased to see Germany knocked out of the World Cup. “It is sad for Germany,” said the forward Marcus Berg, “but this is the thing: karma can be a bad thing sometimes.”The ill-feeling between the two countries stems from their meeting at the group stage, which Germany won 2-1 after a late Toni Kroos free-kick. The Swedes were irritated that two Germany officials walked over to the bench and clapped in their faces after the final whistle.“Some of the group leaders of their team celebrated by running in our direction, rubbing it into our faces by making gestures,” the coach, Janne Andersson, said after Saturday’s game. “That really got me annoyed and angry. We had fought it out for 90 minutes and at the end you should shake hands.”Sweden beat Mexico 3-0 on Wednesday to secure their place in the last 16, where they will face Switzerland, and the captain, Andreas Granqvist, could be seen laughing when told that Germany had lost 2-0 to South Korea and were going home.“I won’t name them but there were two players who ran past me and shouted straight at my face.

That, in football terms, is what England are apparently aiming to do when they play Belgium Reserves on Thursday night. We thought we’d seen everything with England at the World Cup, but it’s definitely a first to go into a match game fearing a victory.England will top their group if they win or draw and have a superior disciplinary record. We don’t know what that means for the last 16 that will be confirmed beforehand, though we know they will play one of Japan, Colombia and Senegal. But there is a distinct advantage to finishing second in the group, as it would mean a potential quarter-final against Sweden or Switzerland rather than Brazil or Brazil. England have never beaten Brazil in Le Tournoi, the Rous Cup or the Umbro Cup, never mind the World Cup. And there is a history of teams going into the easy half of the draw after an unexpectedly poor performance (sic) in their last group game, including eventual winners West Germany in 1974.It’s not a straightforward issue, because not everyone is as cowardl … sorry, as pacifistic as The Fiver.

In 2002 we went into the first World Cup in Asia as reigning champions and we had also added the European crown in 2000, playing better football and with more confidence in our ability. France turned up in South Korea with Thierry Henry, David Trezeguet and Djibril Cissé – the top scorers in England, Italy and France if my memory serves me well. We were the overwhelming favourites and no one who looked at our group – Senegal (making their World Cup debut), Uruguay and Denmark – imagined we would have any trouble finishing top. And yet we left that tournament after three games, without scoring a goal. One of the biggest flops in World Cup history.In our defence, our star player – the incomparable Zinedine Zidane – got injured in a warm-up game and could only come back, not fully fit, for the third match. But by then we had already blown it. If you have forgotten – and these are painful memories for those of us who played these games, believe me – we lost the opening game to Senegal, 1-0. It was a huge surprise, maybe one of the biggest in the tournament’s history. A bad day at the office, it happens. But what was striking was the way that defeat affected us. We were the world champions but just that one defeat made us suddenly question everything.I was the captain and I sensed we had a problem after that Senegal game. We had several meetings among the players to try to clear the air, get back that confidence, work out what had gone wrong. But I was amazed at how quickly we lost it. Maybe it was the pressure of being the title holders and the fear of losing everything. You have a stature to defend and suddenly you fear losing it all, you lose that assurance.You wonder if it’s the end of a cycle and before you know it, it is. To win a second World Cup is super tough – just look at Spain in 2014 and Germany in Russia – like us, knocked out in the group phase. It’s a bit like a tennis player struggling to finish off a match, the hands shaking at match point. In football that fear can creep in and overtake you.With Argentina, one of the other pre-tournament favourites, I think things are different. For me it’s very painful to talk about the problems Argentina are facing because it means having to criticise Lionel Messi. He’s supposed to show the world that he can carry his national team to victory. But he missed the penalty against Iceland that could have given his team a much-needed victory and, although his goal against Nigeria was magnificent, Argentina were only five minutes from being eliminated from this World Cup.We know Messi is great but we’re confused and sad for him. He is such a pure Barcelona product but with Argentina right now, Messi’s in a mess. Something is missing – is it unity, faith? Messi doesn’t seem to fit into the collective. They have so many talented strikers, so many skilful attacking players and yet they don’t seem to know how to get the best out of them. They are really struggling. Is it the system? Is there a certain spirit missing?Argentina cannot keep blaming the pressure of living up to Diego Maradona’s generation – they have had plenty of time to get used to that and they have top players performing in some of the best clubs in the world. Pressure is something these guys are used to.Going into the last game in last place, behind Iceland, was just unimaginable for Argentina fans. But maybe it’s not that surprising. This team struggled to qualify for the World Cup and of course they got thrashed 6-1 by Spain not long ago – even though Messi was not on the field that night. It is possible to make a slow start and still win it – look at Spain in 2010, beaten by Switzerland in their first match but world champions a few weeks later. But somehow that scenario looks unlikely for Argentina.I can recall Argentina’s 1978 victory at their World Cup – one of my first football memories. Some great players such as Mario Kempes, Osvaldo Ardiles and then of course Jorge Burruchaga, Jorge Valdano and Maradona for the 1986 side. Today, though, you have to say they are not a good team. If you’ve watched their three games you know what they’ve shown so far means you can’t include them in the top five or six.In that respect you could say it’s good for France to have to play Argentina for a place in the quarter-finals rather than Croatia, who have impressed and looked full of confidence. The problem, though, for me as a France supporter, is that maybe their last-gasp qualification will inject a belief into this Argentina squad. You expect them to show something different now. And let’s face it, France have yet to show anything to make us feel optimistic, to give us hope.But then I really do feel that this France team have more to give. I think they will be capable of raising their game and they will have to, if they want to overcome the Argentinians. Until now France have had to play teams who do not want the ball, teams who want to defend. But our team is more at ease against good footballing sides, we have players who can play really well on the counterattack and maybe we are not ready yet to control games. I’m really looking forward to Saturday’s game.A quick word on England, who at least have shown they are capable of scoring goals at this World Cup. People say it was only Panama but you can only beat the team in front of you – it’s not England’s fault the opposition was weak. England’s form suggests there is a future for this team. Is the future going to be at this World Cup or rather Euro 2020?Let me finish with a word about Panama, though. I’m not like those who moan about having little teams at these competitions – for me that’s what the World Cup is all about. Sure, the team let in six goals against England and had a style of defending set pieces that would not have looked out of place on a wrestling mat, but just look at the joy created by their goal! How can you not smile when you see all those Panama fans dancing and singing after that goal by Felipe Baloy? Don’t you just want to be part of that? For me, that’s what the World Cup is all about."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd21e7170f7a73e8f2719ebedacb16fb18b210b3/0_114_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=955aabb49164eaf8f598d0d64c9336f0","title":"germany go out of world cup 2018 at group stage in pictures","story":"For the first time in 80 years Germany have not made it through to the World Cup second round.

SHoji, Haraguchi, Hasebe, Kagawa, Inui and Osako all sit this match out, several of whom are considered their best players. Disharmony in the ranks? Illness? Some other reason? We’ll find out soon enough, no doubt.Early team news: Despite needing a result to progress, Japan have made six changes to the side that drew with Senegal. Poland make five changes to the team that got thrashed by Colombia last time out. We’ll have the full line-ups for you very shortly.Some pre-match listening: Max Rushden waves a Cross of St George while Jonathan Wilson discusses his orthotic insole issues, John Brewin riffs on England’s simultaneous superiorityinferiority complex, Barney Ronay talks about what he’s doing on his holidays in Russia and I recite the lyrics to Craig David’s Seven Days. It’s the World Cup Football Daily podcast and you can download it in all the usual pod places.Volgograd is the venue for this Asia v Europe encounter between Japan and Poland. Having lost their two opening games, the Poles cannot qualify, but may well invoke the spirit of Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Peru and South Korea by going into their final match with nothing (or in the case of South Korea, almost nothing) to play for except pride and going on to show the world just how precious a commodity they consider it to be.

Either way, despite both teams already guaranteed progression, it should be quite an intriguing night of football.In the meantime, there are two more matches and plenty of reading to be done. . .Marcel Desailly on Messi Stuart James with the England v Belgium Italia ’90 playersSenegal v Colombia LIVE with Simon Burnton Japan v Poland LIVE with Barry Glendenning The same game in Japanese with Ben Mabley Colin writes: “Gareth Southgate has not thought this through. He should have brought Rooney along for this kind of game, guaranteed yellow or red.”Gareth Barry would also be useful for this situation.Maybe I’ll just watch Panama v Tunisia to be obtuse. Not much work is being done across the country as the nation decides how best tonight match should play out. . . Nick offers: “I reckon the ideal scenario for England is for someone to get sent off early on – one of the second string as it doesn’t really matter if they’re suspended for the next game – and then the rest of the team hold on for a resilient, fortifying 0-0 draw. Belgium top the group on fair play countback and go into the testier half of the draw and England show they have the defensive mettle alongside all the attacking verve.“It’s also the ideal scenario for more as I’m going to miss a potential quarter-final if we win the group – I’m on a plane. I don’t really know how this happened.”If you want some more mocking of Germans. . .We’re closing on the 3pm kick-offs! We will have live blogs of both Senegal v Colombia and Japan v Poland, with the additional treat of the latter also coming with a Japanese version. We’ve all considered it, David.With both teams contemplating a second place finish as preferable tonight there might be plenty of shots from 45 yards in the hope neither side score.He writes: “Was Xhaka’s goal against Serbia further out? It felt like it was from the halfway line.”Ian ponders: “If England or Belgium deliberately and obviously scored an own goal in the last minute, would that count as unsporting behaviour? Would the ref therefore be within his rights to book the player involved and award a free kick to the other side instead?”Surely the modern international can score an own goal and not make it look obvious.Michal asks: “Just out of interest- what did you bring for lunch? I myself had pasta with tomato sauce and some melted gorgonzola.”I made some chorizo and peas to go with cod last night and have used the extra with pasta for lunch.Away from England and Belgium, Luke takes up back to the simpler time of longest goals.He says: “At work, I have access to a software application that uses algorithms to work out distances on the pitch from a video clip. This application confirms that Josh’s estimate of 26 yards for Modric’s goal is spot on. It also confirms Richard’s suspicion that Kolarov’s was further out which it measures at 30.7 yards.“As I have spent time working this out when I am supposed to be working, and probably broken some copyright laws by downloading the relevant clips, I would appreciate if you did not use my real name..... “Dave” would do.”Does two second-string teams facing off make the game a bit more interesting that if both manager’s had stuck with their usual starting line-ups? Let’s be honest, if Kane et al were facing Hazard (Eden) \u0026amp Co. then it might have been a slow-paced affair, with neither team wanting to get injured nor suspended. Now we will get a collection of players wanting to impress to give Martinez and Southgate a decision or two in the knockout stages. Or am I clutching at straws?ITV will be pleased they held out for this group-decider, as their viewers get to be enthralled by Ryan Giggsy Giggs’s views on Danny Welbeck scuffed shot and why Adnan Januzaj did not make it at Manchester United.Anyway. . .speaking of Gareth Southgate, here he is on the his fear of missing out on being England manager.Bobby Martinez might change his 10 outfield players. It looks unlikely that Southgate will do the same, but it might not be far off that by the look of things, with only John Stones the only outfield man guaranteed to start a third match. Will he be bold enough to change the goalkeeper, too? Southgate has spoken about the misery of going to a major tournament and not playing, although that might be preferably to missing a penalty in a semi-final. The England manager is going what he feels is right for the encounter with Belgium, who will also rest a number of players, and it will be a great boost for those two teams to really be able to go for it. All the other big-name teams have been forced to put our their strongest team for three games, so having 90 minutes fewer under the belt could be a great help for England’s key men.Jamie Vardy is to make his first World Cup start in England’s final Group G game against Belgium this evening, with the tournament’s top scorer to date, Harry Kane, set to start the match on the bench.Gareth Southgate is to make a number of changes to his lineup with progress into the knockout phase already secured, with Vardy – who came off the bench in the 6-1 win over Panama – to begin the game up front. Kane had indicated to the manager that he wanted to start the game in Kaliningrad, and add to his tally of five goals to date, but it appears as if the side’s captain will have to make do with a place among the substitutes.Raheem Sterling has been rested for the fixture, with Marcus Rashford the likeliest to start alongside Vardy up front. The Leicester City forward’s pace will be seen as a potent weapon on the counter-attack against the Belgians, who will see more of the ball than England’s two previous opponents in the group. Kyle Walker, who picked up a yellow card conceding a penalty against Tunisia, is also likely to be rested, with Phil Jones and Gary Cahill expected to start alongside John Stones in the back three.Eric Dier will play in defensive midfield and may captain the team, while Danny Rose will feature at left wing-back. Fabian Delph, who will return home to attend the birth of his third child after the game, has been pressing for a place in midfield and could come in for Ruben Loftus-Cheek, while Trent Alexander-Arnold could also feature given Kieran Trippier has been nursing a slight injury in the build-up.Well. . .after all the posturing of if players were going to be rested, we finally have an answer. Kane has had a long season and merits 90 minutes off during the chaos of the World Cup. It should also be noted that due to the lack of pace in the Belgian backline that Vardy might be the better option anyway.I am in favour of give a few different players a game and keeping them fit for the knockout stages. If Kane turns his ankle tomorrow, then you’d need Vardy, which would then result in a completely different formation and style for England, so it’s positive news in my book.Leicester City striker Jamie Vardy is set to lead the line for England tonight against Belgium, with captain Harry Kane the man likely to be rested. He says: “I guess one thing we’ve learnt is with the bricklayer’s first touch he displayed yesterday, Neuer’s no sweeper-midfielder.”Luckily, Manuel now has plenty of time to work on this for the rest of the summer.While manning the daily World Cup blog yesterday, I agreed to consume some surströmming if Sweden progressed and I will fulfil this promise once I find the time and muster the energy to do so.I planned ahead and brought my lunch, which will be consumed upon Michael’s return as I prepare my mind for a long day of football, which will conclude with me doing the pod tonight. Get your questions in early as I prepare to discuss the positives of England finishing firstsecond in the group.Good afternoon! As Michael goes in search of an ostrich burger, I will provide some light relief.Whatever the Swedish is for Schadenfreude etc etc. . .On that bombshell, I’m going for some lunch. Will Unwin is here to pick up the reins. Today’s World Cup fiver, which features Rob Smyth’s England-Belgium preview …… and quite a sad BitBob about Iran’s Sardar Azmoun, who has quit international football because barbs aimed at him had damaged his mother’s health.“Unfortunately because of the unkindness of some people, and the insults that me and my team mates in no way deserved, her illness has become severe. This has put me in a difficult position where I must pick one or the other – and as a result I pick my mother.”Some lunch-time reading for you:There’s also this from Stefan Stern on Gareth Southgate learning a few things Harvard Business School.“My team at work had no interest in the World Cup - two colleagues actually asked what it was,” emails Josh. “To drive interest I pinned up the obligatory wall chart and ran a sweepstake. To ensure enthusiasm remains high there are various prizes available, some ripped off from Will Dean’s 2016 article. Problem is - I can’t find any stats for the goal scored from the furthest distance!“Can you helpsuggest a place I can find this out? This will help me provide a post-group stages update to the team tomorrow.”I’m going to say Luka Modric’s goal against Argentina, which based on me measuring the pitch markings is 26 yards-ish out. Don’t agree? @ me. Harry Kane really does have it all. Waste even more of your employer’s valuable time by perusing our all singing-dancing World Cup player guide, which includes match ratings for every active player. Remarkably, Manuel Neuer managed to scrape a 410 for yesterday …Also, this is funny. “Good morning Michael, or should I say good evening,” emails Thomas Partridge. “I’m an Englishman living in Japan and I’ve been catching with the  live-blog diligently during my breaks at work. It’s particularly difficult being an England fan over here because all of our games seem to be starting at 3am, so I’ve been having to rely on the wonderful write-ups of your reporters to keep up to date. This World Cup has really been capturing the imagination of my Japanese colleagues. Before the tournament everyone here expected them to finish bottom of Group H , but Japan are currently the leaders! We are starting to believe!“Anyway, one World Cup story that’s getting a fair bit of play over here is the curious story of a Colombian fan who deceived a couple of Japanese fans into repeating horrible things about themselves in Spanish. I’m sure you can imagine what sort of thing he told them to repeat considering Colombia had just lost to Japan. I didn’t read anything about it in the English press, but it caused an uproar in the Colombia. The fan in question is now a national pariah and I believe he was even fired from his job in absentia. It was quite heartening to read about South American fans standing-up to sexual harassment in this post #metoo age.”We need to talk about Group H. Japan v Poland and Senegal v Colombia both kick-off at 3pm BST. This is how things stand. For those of you that didn’t see this earlier: Japan will progress if they get at least a draw against eliminated Poland. Colombia and Senegal face each other. A draw in that game will be enough for Senegal to progress. A draw might also be enough for Colombia to progress, but they would be relying on Poland beating Japan at the same time.This is also the only group in which a European team will not qualify for the knockout round. In fact, the non-European winner of Group H will go into the ‘easier’ half of the group, in which every other team is European: Spain v Russia, Croatia v Denmark, Sweden v Switzerland, Group H winner v BelgiumEngland. Which is the perfect excuse to shoehorn this into the liveblog. Could genuinely watch it on repeat all day. So where is everyone watching the game tonight? I’m clocking off at 3pm. Interesting to see how many tune in to ITV4 for the big one tonight: Panama v Tunisia. We’ve talked a little about Diego this morning. You should click on this piece by Marcela Mora y Araujo, and not just because of its magnificent picture. Manuel Neuer has spoken into a DFB dictaphone this morning, with the following results: You have to say we do not deserve (to go through). In the second round everybody would have liked to play against us. How are we going to be dangerous to an opponent if we do not get our performance (right)? We gave a bad picture in the three games. I can not answer why that happened. We have to take responsibility. We screwed up, (and) we screwed up together.”Asked whether he felt he had a future with the national side, Neuer replied: “I do not intend to stop.” An email from Kevin O’Rourke, who is not alone in my inbox in thinking Croatia are among the favourites to WIN THE BLOODY WORLD CUP. “I’m thinking that Croatia are finalist material. They seem the most dangerous team and waltzed through their relatively strong group. England losing to Belgium gives a semi against Croatia. Beating them means a quarter against Brazil – shocking defensively - Neymar is a reductive show pony who makes them less than the sum of their parts. And semi against most likely France or Uruguay – one has been toothless in a middling group, the other had too many teeth in the weakest groups.”“Wutcha Michael,” emails Paul Lees. “I’ve been loving the World Cup so far and I think it will go down as a classic. There’s been some terrific team performances so far but who do you think has been the standout inidual player so far? Personally I can’t really think of any one player … Hazard? Kane? Ronaldo? Tripper?!”Hard to look past Coutinho in my book, although Ronnie surely can’t be far behind. The quick quiz of the ’s other web bods today yields the following results: And if you think you know what’s going on, this is a good place to carry on.

Barry Glendenning has the latest on that one:Here’s some pre-match reading about a highlight of Colombia’s World Cup history:“Do you think James will have impact this match?” asks PS. “I felt he made a good showing last match.” I thought he had an excellent game against Poland, with one great assist and one even better than great assist, and am thus very optimistic.True fact: over their first two games Colombia have attempted precisely 200 more passes than Senegal, with 866 to a devilish 666.The referee, Milorad Mazic, is a director of a meat company. He likes sport (you don’t say) and reading. He’ll presumably enjoy putting a few names in his book this afternoon.Here are the teams in plain text format for those who can’t see embedded tweets:Here’s Reuters’ take on the teams:Carlos Sanchez returns for Colombia alongside Mateus Uribe as coach Jose Pekerman changes up his midfield for his side*s decisive Group H encounter with Senegal in Samara on Thursday.Sanchez, who was shown a red card in the opening minutes of Colombia’s opener against Japan, returns from suspension and replaces Wilmar Barrios. Uribe comes in for the injured Abel Aguilar in the only two changes from Colombia’s 3-0 win against Poland. Senegal boss Aliou Cisse has recalled captain Cheikhou Kouyate to the midfield in place of Alfred N’Diaye, whilst Keita Balde and Lamine Gassama are also called up in three changes to the team who drew 2-2 with Japan.Sadio Mane starts as part of an attacking three while central defensive pairing Kalidou Koulibaly and Salif Sane will be looking to stop Colombian striker Radamel Falcao. Colombia know a win in Samara will see them progress to the last 16. A draw will be enough to take Senegal into the knockout stages. Colombia are in a false position in Group H, their qualification for the knock-out stages delayed, and potentially derailed, by a third-minute red card in their opening game. They still have the best goal difference in the group, but need to win today to guarantee their progress (a draw will do if Japan lose to Poland). Senegal need to draw to be sure of going into the knock-out rounds, and to better Japan’s result to go through in first place. As it stands, Japan and Senegal have scored the same number of goals, conceded the same number of goals and have identical head-to-head records, leaving open the tantalising possibility of a drawing of lots if both get identical results today and Japan have precisely two more players booked.Currently No1 in Colombia: No Es Justo (AKA, for reasons I can’t explain, ノ・エス・フスト) by J Balvin: I have no idea what’s No1 in Senegal, despite looking quite hard for a chart, but when I listened to Radio Dakar Musique a little earlier they were playing Djoko by Omar Pene, so I will arbitrarily declare that their top song of the moment:Precisely four years ago to the day, James Rodriguez did this:This is the fourth game between Colombia and African opponents at the World Cup.

One of many Rohingya women trying to cope alone in the refugee camps of Bangladesh, she was left by her husband and has five children to look after.Sitting in the bamboo porch of a meeting place, out of the monsoon rains, she relates the serious problems that men cause in the Cox’s Bazar camps. “If I was unmarried I would never get married,” she says. On top of the trauma caused by gang rapes in Myanmar, and pressure for girls to get married at a young age, a new issue is emerging for women in the camps: abandonment. Those working there report a rising number of husbands simply leaving – either to slip off into the black economy of Bangladesh beyond the Rohingya settlements, or with other women.The ramshackle and chaotic camps are already beset by violence. Men routinely beat their wives and girls are now forbidden to leave their sweltering huts unless in full burqa, in the hope that it will make them less likely targets for rape.The problems associated with abandonment are so common, with such grave ramifications, that it is classified as gender-based violence. Women who do not have husbands are at greater risk of harassment and attack, and have to undertake – single-handedly – a huge number of arduous tasks to help their often large families survive. These include cooking, collecting water, monsoon-proofing their huts, fixing roofs, breastfeeding, chopping and carrying firewood, and collecting rations. Since most marriages that end with men abandoning their wives are undocumented, no statistics are available. Girls are expected to marry early – sometimes as young as 12 – after which they leave the family home. And if their husband leaves them, it’s even harder for them to look after themselves and their children. Some aid workers say they have heard of cases where one man has married as many as six women in the camp.At another women’s centre, a ledger records why women are seeing counsellors. The acronym “GBV” – gender-based violence – crops up frequently.“Polygamy counts as GBV,” a worker explains. “Lots of men are leaving their wives for other women in the camp. In Myanmar, they would have been punished by law – perhaps they would be given a fine.”There is no punishment here, however, and Taslia Akter, a counsellor from one of the women-friendly spaces run by Care International, says the problem is growing. “A good number of women visiting the women-friendly space have shared that the instances of men abandoning their wives and children for a second marriage have gone up,” she says.“Unlike in the camps, back in Myanmar one had to go through strict legal procedures prior to getting married, such as submitting forms at the marriage registration office for approval. The situation is slightly different here.” Women who have been abandoned often blame their own “bad luck”, and some become depressed. *Rohima, 20, is adjusting to life since her husband absconded. “We got married in the camp but my husband went off with another woman,” she says. Sitting on the floor of her friend’s hut amid a group of women, she lifts her hand to her swollen stomach. “She will give birth in two weeks,” says her friend, Mariam.“I can’t do anything,” Rohima says. “A few weeks ago, I managed to borrow a telephone and called him. He said: ‘Who are you? I don’t know you’ – and hung up the phone.” Her husband is one of the small number of refugees who have managed to escape the camp and find work outside. He now lives in Chittagong, about 85 miles away, with his new wife. Mariam explains that none of the group of five women have husbands, and that they all support each other. Most of the men were killed in Myanmar, apart from Rohima’s husband.“We have a good bond – these friends are more than my sisters.“We are from different villages, but we are neighbours here. We are worried about the monsoon rains, it’s very difficult to live in this weather. We do not have enough wood even to cook food. We are all helpless, but we will try to help by talking and sharing our stories with each other.” Khatun, 45, is part of a community group, coordinated by the organisation ActionAid, that visits troubled households in the camps. “Yesterday I saw a woman who had been beaten so badly by her husband that her eye was swollen. I told her: ‘If you are not in control of this problem you can come to the women-friendly space.’ She replied: ‘I’m not able to go outside because he will beat me more.’”“She also said: ‘My husband wants to get married to another woman, and when I told him not to, he beat me.’“Sometimes I feel surprised by how common it is, but I have to work to help manage it. Some people listen to me very well, but some are very dangerous.”Back on the baking hot bamboo porch, Khatun says: “Sometimes when I see women whose husbands are about to leave them, I say: ‘If he is able to get married to another woman, you can live happily.’“I feel sad, but I don’t want other people to feel sad. I want peace for women.”*Name changed to protect identity"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e28b192de89baf0e47893f9927ca19130e6ad21e/0_296_5591_3355/master/5591.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=064b96d5706d5807e7573900cac3bf3e","title":"podcast positive news we need to talk about supporters","story":"In our next We Need to Talk About podcast, we’ll consider the key questions in interrupting the news cycle with moments of levity.

Despair is just another form of denial. People long to feel hopeful again – and young people, especially, yearn to feel the hope that previous generations once had.”Rapid developments in technology in recent decades mean that news now reaches us on our phones, TVs, and social media profiles every hour of the day, every day of the week – some of it very distressing. Even when we try to switch off from it, news seems to find a way to reach us. With the dawn of the internet and improved mobility for journalists across the world, we can access vivid, uninterrupted images and footage of events moments after they happen, in the palm of our hands. This onslaught of negative news has a cumulative effect on our collective mental health and our perception of our own worries. It can create a sense of disempowerment and apathy, and exacerbate our feelings of isolation and fear. Conversely, positive news often carries a message of hope and activism: those who have made a difference – for example, by saving a pub, library or park, working closely with a local community, inventing a tool to solve a problem, fundraising for an underreported cause – and whose work has captured the public imagination on a small or wide-reaching scale.

He said:We did expect that we would make more progress - or any progress, really - we expected there would be progress at this summit in June, like there was in March and December. And there hasn’t been. So I will be saying to Prime Minister May we all need to intensify our efforts now. All of us want there to be a deal. We need a deal. Europe needs a deal, Britain needs a deal too.Varadkar did not personalise his criticism of the UK, but it was clear that he felt London, not Brussels, was to blame for the lack of progress. Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, in his remarks to journalists said splits in the British cabinet over Brexit were a problem. (See 1.59am.)Theresa May is arriving at the EU summit now.She starts by talking about the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons vote yesterday, which the UK led, she says.She then claims there has been “very good progress” on the Brexit withdrawal agreement. Both sides want a strong future partnership, she says.She says she wants both sides to continue with the talks “at a faster pace”.Asked if the talks are really going well, she replies:We have been setting out throughout these negotiations our position and at every stage, last December and March, we have come to agreements with the European Union.She says the cabinet will be coming together next week to finalise the white paper on Brexit. Asked if she is annoyed by how rigid the EU is being, she says the UK has already been able to get “flexibility from the European Union” on matters.This is not just about the UK, she says. It matters for both sides.Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister, has arrived. He said Theresa May should relax her Brexit red lines. This is from my colleague Lisa O’Carroll.I will post the full quotes soon.EU leaders have been talking to journalists as they arrive at the summit in Brussels. Mostly they have been talking about migration, but the Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte (who speaks good English, meaning the British journos can ask him questions) has spoken about Brexit. Here are the main points he made.I don’t want to talk in apocalyptic terms. What I want to say is that I believe the first, second and third priority now is to solve this issue of the Irish border. And when that is solved so many other issues will be easier to discuss. The first issue on the table now to solve is this problem of the Irish border. That is crucial. And there has to be a backstop which is not temporary, which is continuous, in case we are not able to solve this problem in future. And that issue has to be solved.The UK’s plan for a backstop is time limited, because this is something Brexiters are insisting on.This is what Reuters has filed on the opening of the EU summit.European leaders promised to help Chancellor Angela Merkel tackle a crisis in the bloc’s migration policies on Thursday, offering the weakened German leader vital support before a high-stakes EU summit. Arriving in Brussels, the leaders of Spain, Greece, Finland and Luxembourg all expressed support for Merkel’s push to curtail “secondary migration” of refugees who arrive at the EU’s southern border before heading north to Germany. Europe’s longest serving leader has come under acute political pressure from her hardline allies in Bavaria, who are threatening to close their border to migrants if she can’t work out a deal with Germany’s European partners. That could trigger the collapse of Merkel’s three-month-old government and cause the EU’s control-free Schengen travel zone to unravel. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez told reporters that European solidarity on migration was vital, “especially with Germany which is now suffering a political crisis”. Luxembourg’s Prime Minister Xavier Bettel added: “There are so many people who arrived in different countries and then made their way to Germany. I understand when Germany says ‘Why do we have to deal with everything?’” Greece’s Alexis Tsipras and Finland’s Juha Sipila also promised to work with Germany on the issue. Nicola Sturgeon has told MSPs she has apparently not yet decided whether to renominate Gilliam Martin as a junior education minister, after Martin’s candidacy was withdrawn for her apparent attacks on transgender rights in a blog 11 years ago. (See 12.27pm.)The first minister told Holyrood she was going to reflect on detailed disclosures in the Times of Martin’s references to “hairy-knuckled, lipstick-wearing transitional laydees” and other social issues while she was a college lecturer. However renominating Martin is highly unlikely given the extent of opposition to it from other parties: Labour and the Tories had said earlier on Thursday they would oppose it, and the Scottish Greens co-leader Patrick Harvie used his first minister’s questions slot to promote gay, lesbian and transgender rights. Speaking as MSPs – many wearing the rainbow colours of LGBT rights as ties, scarves or badges - approved her remaining slate of ministerial candidates, Sturgeon insisted again she was largely ignorant of the full extent of Martin’s remarks. She said took all the criticisms of her decision to nominate Martin “on the chin – they are my responsibility.” She insisted Martin had earned respect from her MSP colleagues since arriving at Holyrood in 2016: “However ill advised they are, they are not reflective of the person I have come to know.”EU leaders have been arriving at their summit in Brussels.Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, has just spoken to reporters. Reuters have snapped this.One of the most interesting features of our current politics is the way the Conservative party is abandoning its heritage as the party of business. My colleagues Aditya Chakrabortty wrote a good column on this subject recently, and many others have made the same point, but today the Daily Mail carries an article that potentially escalates the Tory war with corporate Britain.It is by Iain Duncan Smith, the former Conservative leader and high-profile Brexiter. Prompted by the Airbus warnings about the impact of Brexit, he argues that big businesses and the organisations that represent them have been wrong before in their forecasts and that they don’t represent the views of small business. These claims are at least arguable (although the Federation of Small Businesses takes the same stance on Brexit as the CBI), and have been made many times before.But then he launches into an extraordinary passage implying that the CBI can’t be trusted because its forerunner organisation supported the appeasement of the Nazis. He says:Before World War II, as the historian Andrew Roberts has pointed out, the Federation of British Industries — the forerunner of the CBI — supported both the Gold Standard (which, in its constraints on a government’s ability to manage the economy is an instrument of jobs destruction), and the appeasement of Nazi Germany.Between 1937 and 1939 while the Nazis were opening their concentration camps, the FBI oversaw the creation of no fewer than 33 separate agreements between British and German business groups.Undaunted by this sorry record, after the war the CBI supported the socialistic nationalisation of much of the economy by the Labour government — just as it backed Harold Wilson’s ill-fated introduction of tripartite state planning (social partnership based on affiliations between business, labour and the state to create economic policy) in the 1960s, and the wholesale surrender to trade union power in the 1970s.What’s remarkable about this is not that it’s wrong it is Duncan Smith’s complete absence of self-awareness (and arguable hypocrisy). The Federation of British Industries may have supported appeasement, but no one promoted it more than the Conservative party under the leadership of Neville Chamberlain. Is Duncan Smith says no one should ever trust the Conservative party because of their 1930s foreign policy?To this, you could add that after the war the Conservatives also accepted much of the post-war Labour economic agenda, leading to the term “Butskellism” being coined. And, of course, if you want to write an article arguing that support for appeasement and undue sympathy towards Nazis 80 years ago are proof that an institution’s views have no value today, then the Daily Mail is probably one of the worst places you could choose to publish it.The heads of two influential select committees have expressed concern that parliament has not been given enough information by the government on which to make crucial Brexit decisions over the next few months.Nicky Morgan, chair of the treasury select committee, and Meg Hillier, chair of the public accounts committee, have sent a joint letter to MPs claiming that the true cost of Brexit has not yet been made clear and will need to be revealed before a series of votes. They said:In the months ahead, parliament will be called upon to make key decisions regarding the terms of the UK’s exit, and the framework for its future relationship, and we remain concerned that there is currently insufficient information on which it can base these crucial decisions.They highlighted a recent National Audit Office report which warned that the “orce bill” could be higher than the £39bn estimate and would be subject to a number of fluctuating economic factors. Some have estimated that the final bill could be closer to £50bn once European Development Fund commitments and GDP growth rates across Europe are taken into consideration. Contributions to any EU agencies in which the UK might wish to participate after Brexit, such as the European Medicines Agency and the European Aviation Space Agency are not part of the overall bill should also be considered, Morgan and Hillier wrote. They went on:The government needs to provide clarity on the points above, in good time before parliament comes to decide on the withdrawal agreement and the future framework. Unless we understand what we and future generations are paying for we cannot call this a meaningful vote.Nicola Sturgeon has been forced to sack a junior minister, Gillian Martin, before she was formally appointed after it emerged Martin has written a blog attacking “hairy-knuckled, lipstick-wearing transitional laydees” while she was a college lecturer.Martin’s appointment was announced in a press release yesterday and she was due to be confirmed later today as a new junior education minister, partly responsible for widening access, including promoting minority groups, as part of Sturgeon’s sweeping reshuffle this week.However the Times (paywall) revealed she had made a series of highly contentious angry remarks in a blog in 2007, which has since been deleted, she also spoke about “vote whore, muppet” politicians who had failed to increase teachers’ pay and introduced top-down education reforms.Labour described her as a “cybernat loose cannon” and had notified reporters on Thursday morning it planned to formally oppose Martin’s confirmation – a very rare event at the Scottish parliament, triggering a highly embarrassing vote which Sturgeon was likely to loose.Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Conservative leader, tweeted that her party too had told ministers after the Times story broke they would not support Martin’s nomination.The Times reported her blog attacking a questionnaire at her college asking students if they had ever identified as transgender. In it she wrote:Will they install a third category of loo with a special transgender sign? Are they then going to pinpoint these transgender people and make sure that they get represented fairly on all undisclosed-because-I-don’t-want-to-get-fired-establishment literature in the same way our five endlessly tolerant Asian students do or that guy with the guide dog does?Are we going to see lovely photos in the foyer of hairy knuckled lipstick-wearing transitional transgender laydees being embraced by the principal of undisclosed college or visiting politicians for the press?Scottish government officials refused to confirm Martin’s nomination had been withdrawn but BBC reporters tweeted an amended nominations list.Last year the government introduced a two-child limit for people claiming the child tax credit or universal credit, meaning that if they had a third or subsequent child after April 2017, they would not be able to claim for that child. Today the Department for Work and Pensions has published statistics (pdf) showing how many people were affected and they show that 70,620 families lost money as a result.Commenting on the figures, Alison Garnham, chief executive of the Child Poverty Action Group, said:Our analysis with IPPR last year found 200,000 children will be pulled into poverty by the two-child limit. Today’s DWP statistics now show it’s already having a damaging impact – and at a fast pace. These are struggling families, most of them in work, who will lose up to £2,780 a year - a huge amount if you’re a parent on low pay. An estimated one in six UK children will be living in a family affected by the two-child limit once the policy has had its full impact. It’s a pernicious, poverty-producing policy. Even when times are tough, parents share family resources equally among their children, but now the government is treating some children as less deserving of support purely because of their order of birth. Having older siblings should not mean that a child misses out on support.UPDATE: This is from the SNP’s Alison Thewliss. She points out that the report also reveals that 190 women have had to disclose a rape to get an exception from the two-child rule. The SNP have campaigning very strongly on this issue, highlighting the so-called “rape clause” as part of their call for the two-child rule to be abolished.According to the Mirror’s Dan Bloom, a source close to Nigel Farage insists he hasn’t dyed his hair. (See 11.17am.)A British business manufacturing ground-breaking flushable wet wipes has told a House of Lords committee that an investor pulled out because of Brexit.Ellinor McIntosh, founder of Twipes was one of several start up business who told peers Brexit was impacting their funding and growth prospects. “We’ve actually had investors pull out because of the uncertainty around Brexit,” she said.She told them the water-dispersable tissues her company Twipes makes were an innovation and she is hoping to tap into the market following repeated warnings about the environmental damage of conventional wet wipes. Twipes are made in Estonia and if Brexit means import duties and customs costs of could imperil fund-raising, she said. She told peers on the EU internal market sub committee:Our investor turned around and said, ‘You’re business is dead, you’re going to have charge your customers a lot more … they are not going to want to pay and that’s why I’m leaving’.Her remarks come as Tory Brexiter Ian Duncan Smith claimed protests by big businesses including Airbus and BMW did not reflect majority opinion as most of private sector was made up of small to medium-sized business. McIntosh said she considered moving production from Estonia to the UK but “manufacturing is three times more expensive” at home. Paper manufacturing is all done in either Scandinavia or Baltic states, where forestry and space for the large machinery for paper production is not limited. Other start-ups told the Lords they were concerned about retaining talent. Steven Hunter, founder of 9Fin, a fintech start up, said six of his eight staff were from the EU. Francesca Hodgson, CEO and founder of Goodbox, a start up developing contactless payment services for charities said: “We’re on a mission to make fund-raising feel good again” but “talent is critical”.Nigel Farage, the former Ukip leader, is giving an interview to Sky News. He is making the argument that the EU migration crisis vindicates what Ukip said before the EU referendum, but I’m afraid I’m distracted by his hair. Farage is a big Trump fan, and, unless the lighting is playing funny tricks, it does look as though he’s borrowed some of Donald’s hair dye."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf729ccf0e2a4548ca140f11059fa1a903930906/0_93_1247_748/master/1247.jpg?w=1200\u0026amp;h=630\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;crop=faces%2Centropy\u0026amp;bm=normal\u0026amp;ba=bottom%2Cleft\u0026amp;blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxOC8wMS8zMS9mYWNlYm9va19kZWZhdWx0LnBuZw\u0026amp;s=9bc0c3c347567fe5420cbce204dc17ac","title":"archaeologists stumble on neolithic ritual site in suffolk","story":"Diggers laying groundwork for a new windfarm discover previously unknown site of international significanceAs diggers began to strip the daisies and buttercups and carve down through the parched clay of a field near Woodbridge in Suffolk that sloped down to a riverbank, with archaeologists watching over the pretty but apparently featureless site, something extraordinary began to emerge. Clear spring water came bubbling from the ground, and with it came massive timbers preserved so perfectly that tool marks were still visible and stake posts were sharply pointed. The archaeologists first thought the timbers must be medieval or even Victorian, and were puzzled to find them so deeply buried. But as 30 metres of timber track were exposed, alongside other unexpected objects too, such as the massive horns and skull of an aurochs, an extinct breed of giant cattle, they realised they were dealing with something far more ancient. The timbers were 4,300 years old, according to the first carbon-14 tests, and underlying ones may be much older.The Neolithic trackway, which had evidence of being repeatedly restored and renewed over decades and probably generations, seems to have led up to a level timber platform, with spring water deliberately channelled to surround it. From the platform, objects were dropped into the running water, including metal, pottery and the horned aurochs skull. The skull had been carefully shaped either to fix to a pole or use as part of a headdress – and as the archaeologists who had to lift and carry it down the hill could testify, lugging it to the site would have taken considerable effort.The skull was already ancient when it went into the water – tests dated it to about 2,000 years older than the track. Masses of white pebbles that would have been brought specially to the site were also found.On a recent scorching day, the trackway level of the site was still sodden. “You can’t stop the water,” archaeologist Vinny Monahan said. “We came upon evidence of various attempts to drain the field, but it bubbles up wherever you dig.” Prehistorians and ancient timber experts visited the site, and their opinion and the dating evidence bears out the realisation that the archaeologists had stumbled upon a major site of which not a trace remained in the historical record, despite evidence of Roman, Saxon and medieval occupation of the site. They now realise they did not pay enough attention when they were told that the traditional name of the field was Seven Springs.Archaeologists are nervous of using the word “ritual”, but in this case, Monahan said, it is unavoidable: the people who used the site “weren’t living here – they made this place deliberately and they were coming here because it was important to them.”Richard Newman of Wardell Armstrong, which oversaw the archaeology, said the site was undoubtedly of international significance: “It is exceptionally rare to find preserved organic materials from the Neolithic period, and we will learn a great deal from this discovery. Some of the wood is so well preserved we can clearly see markings made by an apprentice, before a more experienced tradesman has taken over to complete the job. Initially some of the wooden posts looked like they were maybe 100 years old, and it is incredible to think that they are over 4,000 years old.”When the timber trackway was originally laid, the site had already been important for 500 years. A causewayed enclosure with a bank sheltering the slope and its springs is probably early Neolithic, built around 4,800 years ago. This was then reinforced by a later Neolithic ring ditch, which was then enclosed by a bronze age enclosure, which was then itself enclosed by an early iron age ditch. The archaeologists found Roman ditches clipping the edge of the site, and traces of Saxon buildings, but the site remained almost unchanged for centuries until the slope was filled and levelled around the 11th century – which had the effect of burying the springs level and preserving the timbers.Kate Batt of Suffolk county council archaeological service said the artefacts and major timbers have now been removed for further study, but it is hoped that part of the trackway will eventually be displayed in a local museum.The site was the very last in a massive project creating the land base and power lines for a £2.5bn Scottish Power Renewables offshore windfarm, East Anglia One. More than 400 archaeologists from many different units had worked on 50 sites along the 37km line. Scanty records suggested the field had never been anything more interesting than rough pasture, and the archaeologists were surprised and pleased to find evidence of a 17th-century roadside tavern where bullets had been fired into a stone fireplace on some rowdy night. Then the diggers peeled back another 4,000 years.Charlie Jordan, East Anglia One project director, said the uncovering of millennia of Suffolk history was an unanticipated legacy: “In the last two years our project has been responsible for uncovering artefacts from the bronze age, iron age, Roman and medieval periods, but it seems that best has been saved to last.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0af46f9862fba4b98665fecc26e08450ba89534/0_71_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14794712761a158c6582e1df661fdcb6","title":"two child policy costs families thousands financial support figures show","story":"Campaigners warn poverty will rise as 73,500 low-income families lose financial supportMore than 70,000 low-income families lost at least £2,800 each last year after having their entitlement to benefits taken away as a result of the government’s “two-child policy”, official figures show.One-hundred and ninety women were exempted from the policy, which the government insisted was working and had been delivered compassionately, after they were forced to prove to officials their third child was conceived as a result of rape, the figures showed.Campaigners said the number of families affected by the policy would drive up UK poverty levels, putting an estimated 200,000 children into hardship.The statistics showed 2,820 households were exempted during the first year, the majority because they had breached the two-child limit after having twins or triplets.The policy means households claiming child tax credit or universal credit, who have a third or subsequent child born after 6 April 2017, are unable to claim a child element worth £2,780 a year for these children.The rollout of universal credit will increase the number of families affected. All new claims for the benefit after February 2019 will have the child element restricted to two children in a family, even if they were born before the policy was introduced.Alison Garnham of the Child Poverty Action Group said: “An estimated one in six UK children will be living in a family affected by the two-child limit once the policy has had its full impact. It’s a pernicious, poverty-producing policy.”Jamie Grier, the development director at the welfare advice charity Turn2us, said: “We are still contacted by parents, the majority of whom are in work, fretting over whether this policy means they might consider terminating their pregnancy.”The policy was introduced by the former work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith, who described it as a “brilliant idea”, despite it being criticised as a “Chinese-style clampdown on the poor”. Duncan Smith said it would force claimants to make the same life choices as families not on benefits, and incentivise them to seek work or increase their hours.In April, 60 Christian, Muslim and Jewish religious leaders condemned the policy, arguing it would lead to a rise in child poverty and abortions.The so-called rape clause has been vehemently condemned by campaigners, who say it is outrageous a woman must account for the circumstances of her rape to qualify for support. The SNP MP Alison Thewliss called it “one of the most inhumane and barbaric policies ever to emanate from Whitehall”.A government spokesperson said: “The policy to provide support in child tax credit and universal credit for a maximum of two children ensures people on benefits have to make the same financial choices as those supporting themselves solely through work.“We are delivering this in the most effective, compassionate way, with the right exceptions and safeguards in place.”"},{"url":null,"title":"maradona stojkovic oleary italia 90 nigel benn","story":"This week’s roundup also includes Nigel Benn in his pomp, a massive crash and the Jarrow Arrow doing his thing1) The knockout stage of the World Cup begins this weekend, as good an excuse as any to relive the brilliant 1990 version.

But you don’t need to break the bank to discover its richesIt’s no surprise that Ireland’s Ancient East casts a powerful spell over travellers. Think more than 5,000 years of history, spectacular natural scenery, dramatic ancient ruins and a rich local culture all framed by the majestic River Shannon and the rugged coastline of the Irish Sea. And, unlike many European destinations, Ireland really is a country where the best things in life are free … or, in the case of a perfect pint in a centuries-old Kilkenny pub, less than a fiver.For travellers on a budget, driving is easily the cheapest and most rewarding way to get around the country, and Ireland is a land that richly rewards travellers who get off the beaten track. Highlights for most visitors tend to be the places and faces they discover along the way that impromptu folk session in a tiny village pub, the local artist who invites them into the studio for tea, a deserted stretch of golden sand at sunrise. This makes Ireland a nation with plenty to offer visitors on a budget, particularly given that Irish Ferries services start from £79 per car – meaning that taking your car on holiday is easily the cheapest way to drive the Emerald Isle.This is an island fond of a good yarn, full of myths and legends about the epic adventures of heroes and villains, knights, kings, monks, Vikings, Celts and feuding family dynasties. Get a whole lot of history for €8 (£7) at County Kildare’s Castletown House, Ireland’s largest Palladian manor. Built for the wildly wealthy (and morally dubious) politician William Conolly, who rose from humble origins to own some 100,000 acres of land, Castletown became a symbol of his great wealth and makes for a fascinating introduction to Georgian architecture and design. Also in Kildare is the National Stud and Gardens visitors can take a guided tour of the farm and catch a glimpse of one of the equine sporting legends who call it home, such as the now-retired Hurricane Fly, one of the best hurdlers of all time. There’s also a world-renowned Japanese garden and Kids Zone to explore.To the north, in County Meath, you’ll find Newgrange, a dramatic passage tomb dating back to 3,200BC that predates the Egyptian pyramids. Mystery surrounds this large circular mound with an inner stone passageway and chambers at dawn on the winter solstice, a shaft of light from the sunrise illuminates the stone burial chamber, hinting at Newgrange’s religious significance in the past.History is never off the menu in Ireland and simply wandering the narrow lanes of Kilkenny’s Medieval Mile is a swift way to get to the heart of Ireland’s medieval capital, with Kilkenny Castle, St Canice’s Cathedral and Rothe House all in a compact quarter.No trip to Ireland is complete without nourishing the body as well as the soul, and, happily, Ireland’s Ancient East offers countless low-cost culinary delights. Ireland’s gastronomic scene is currently enjoying a resurgence, with exciting young chefs honing their craft overseas before returning to their homeland to launch pioneering new restaurants and pop-ups. The quaint harbour town of Dungarvan is a good place to start, perched at the mouth of the River Colligan in County Waterford and lorded over by the Comeragh mountains. Regular farmers’ markets and fairs showcase local suppliers, while chef Paul Flynn’s fine dining Tannery Restaurant offers a pleasingly affordable bite of Ireland. The multi-course €35 set menu is a particularly good deal.A more casual feast can be had at Foodworks in Kilkenny, which features a rotating menu of mostly local ingredients such as Irish venison, 21-day dry-aged Hereford steak and home-reared pork. Foodworks makes a particularly great feeding station before a tour of Kilkenny’s Smithwick’s brewery, which charts the 300-year heritage of Irish ale in beautiful Victorian premises.For classic Irish pub grub, make for Kyteler’s Inn in the heart of Kilkenny, where chef Margaret Kelly serves a poshed-up version of gamey Irish stew alongside plenty of beer on tap – while the occasional impromptu music session takes place in the corner. A highlight for road-tripping visitors in Ireland is the wide variety of affordable accommodation on offer, from historic village inns to grand Georgian country house estates. Springview Farmhouse was named Irish B\u0026ampB of the Year in 2017, and with prices starting from €30, this late 18th-century home, set in a working farm in County Kilkenny, makes a great budget option. Woodenbridge hotel \u0026amp lodge in the Vale of Avoca, County Wicklow, claims to be the oldest hotel in Ireland, dating back to 1608. With beautifully landscaped gardens overlooking the serene Aughrim River, just 44 miles from Dublin, it makes a great base for exploring Ireland’s Ancient East.Meanwhile, Finnstown Castle hotel is an ivy-strewn Georgian manor house set in a 45-acre estate. But don’t let the imposing architecture and grandness of the rooms fool you the pub and restaurant are beloved local haunts, making for a reliably convivial atmosphere.Explore Ireland from the comfort of your own car with Irish Ferries.

By Anna HartMain image: Durrow Viaduct, part of Waterford Greenway (Getty)Few European destinations are as culturally and historically rich as Ireland’s Ancient East, making it perfect road-trip material for travellers who crave experiences beyond the ordinary. Thanks to ferry connections at Dublin and Rosslare, it’s easy to bring your own car over from Great Britain, opening up a wealth of glorious drives through undulating hills and ancient forests. Add in stop-offs at prehistoric burial sites, spellbinding castles and characterful country pubs and it’s easy to understand why Ireland’s Ancient East is climbing to the top of the must-do lists of intrepid travellers. Here’s what not to miss …Binge on natural scenery Get a brand new profile pic at Powerscourt waterfall at the foot of the Wicklow mountains, Ireland’s highest cascade at 121 metres. It’s a scenic three-mile drive through the ancient forests of the Powerscourt estate – and look out for the giant sequoia. In Wicklow, charter boats leave regularly on dolphin-watching trips, which also showcase scenic and historic spots from a sea-based vantage point. If you’re feeling active, hire bikes and cycle the Waterford Greenway, a 28-mile bike route that traces a former rail track between Waterford and Dungarvan.Culture and creativity  For such a small nation, Ireland has a rich heritage of craft and design. The National Craft Gallery in Kilkenny’s Medieval Mile (which forms part of the Kilkenny Craft Trail) serves as a useful introduction to the Irish traditions of jewellery making, pottery, weaving and other cottage industries. The stable block at Kilkenny Castle is a working gallery and studio space, where you might catch young potters at the wheel, or meet other makers and producers.Exploring Ireland’s Ancient East by car immediately immerses you in some 5,000 years of history. Start with the Boyne valley, where you’ll find ancient burial mounds at Newgrange, Dowth and Knowth (which comprise the Brú na Bóinne Unesco world heritage site). Slane Castle and Slane Castle Distillery are worth a tour, but don’t miss Trim Castle, Ireland’s largest Anglo-Norman castle. Ireland is a country where myths and legends merge into history, and you’ll definitely want to make a pilgrimage to medieval Blarney Castle to kiss the Blarney Stone, which bestows “the gift of the gab” on all who climb the steps to press their lips upon it.Bed down in a country house hotel One of the chief pleasures of an Irish road trip is the array of elegant country house hotels to choose from, often at refreshingly affordable prices. The elegant Athenaeum House hotel in Waterford is a superb choice, a canary-yellow Georgian manor on the banks of the River Suir. In Clonmel in County Tipperary, stylish digs are found at Hotel Minella, another Georgian architectural triumph, dating back to 1863. And less than an hour from Dublin, just outside Naas, sits the stately Victorian Killashee hotel and spa, with views over the Wicklow mountains and the Kildare countryside. Irish Ferries offers three nights at the Hotel Minella with return cruise ferry for two adults and their own car, from £180 each £228 each for the Athenaeum House hotel or £226 for the Killashee hotel and spa.

In 2017, Donegal even topped National Geographic’s list of the coolest places on the planet. Anna Hart rounds up the 10 best things to do on a Donegal road trip Ireland’s most rugged and ravishing county has been a much-loved retreat for artists, bohemians, outdoorsy types and holidaying families for decades, but it’s only now that the rest of the world is waking up to the charms of traversing Donegal by car. Dramatic, secluded beaches, craggy coastlines, soaring peaks, shimmering lakes, verdant valleys and time-warp harbours – all dotted with atmospheric country pubs and quaint seafood restaurants – recently propelled this north-west county to the top of National Geographic Traveller’s Cool List. “It’s a warm-hearted place, but wilderness always feels just a stone’s throw away,” says National Geographic Traveller editor Pat Riddell. “And it is wilderness – world-class wilderness.” It’s definitely the coolest place on the planet right now if you’re a Star Wars fan. The region’s Inishowen peninsula was spectacularly showcased in Star Wars: The Last Jedi, with Malin Head being used to represent bits of Luke Skywalker’s isolated retreat, planet Ahch-To. This only added to the buzz around this long-overlooked corner of Ireland, further embellishing its hip credentials and making it the stuff of road-trip dreams. If you’re taking your car to Ireland by ferry to explore the attractions of Donegal, make sure you hop out at the following must-do spots.Sink a pint at McGrory’sUnassuming but atmospheric, 1920s family-run McGrory’s hotel in Culdaff has long been a local favourite, thanks to its open fires, a dazzling range of Irish craft beers and traditional music sessions. So much so that Daisy Ridley and the Star Wars crew had a night out there around filming, leading to a steady stream of Star Wars-struck visitors. Making the most of the welcoming atmosphere and seafood-heavy menu is now even more of a must.Swap four wheels for two While Donegal rewards road-trippers with sublime coastal scenery, isolated castles, private estates and ancient forests, it’s also a great spot to jump on a bike and blast some of that Atlantic sea breeze into your lungs. The peninsula at Horn Head, forming part of Sheephaven Bay, is perhaps the most scenic of all the Donegal peninsulas, where the cliffs rise to 180 metres (600ft) on the ocean side and provide breeding grounds for seabirds such as the European shag and razorbill. The Hornhead loop can be walked or driven, but biking is the best way to drink it all in, speeding past quartzite cliffs, mud flats, dunes and the salty New Lake area, complete with exceptional views of the Atlantic Ocean.Scale Mount ErrigalThe stark, striking quartzite mass of 751-metre Mount Errigal looms as you head east on the N56 from Gweedore. This is the tallest peak in County Donegal, and along with Mweelrea, is considered one of the most satisfying climbs in the county. Alternatively, drive to the coast and take a bracing walk at the highest sea cliffs in Europe – Slieve League. They stretch 600 metres (2,000ft) above the Atlantic Ocean at the highest point, with impressive views of the rugged coastline and Donegal Bay. Lose yourself in Letterkenny With a population of nearly 20,000, Letterkenny is Donegal’s most populous town, a confident and vibrant former market town famous for gothic-style St Eunan’s Cathedral – and its Hindu temple too. Donegal County Museum, housed in a 19th-century workhouse building, is a great place to get clued up on the county’s former industrial history, and, just south-west of town, the Newmills Corn and Flax Mills have a huge working waterwheel powered by the River Swilly.Picnic at Glenevin waterfallGlenevin waterfall is found at the top of a short hike of just over a mile through the woods in Clonmany, with nicely landscaped picnic areas, footbridges and stepping stones adding to the magic of this beautiful spot. Stock up on sandwiches, quiches and sweet treats at Claire The Bakers in Carndonagh beforehand.Explore Malin Head on the Inishowen peninsulaMalin Head, Ireland’s most northerly point, offers spectacular views, and the northernmost tip, Banba’s Crown, is one of the most photographed spots in the county. Sip a flat white from the Caffe Banba coffee truck (which also has a standalone cafe in Carndonagh) and see if you can spot scenery that made an appearance in Star Wars: The Last Jedi.Take a trip to Tory IslandTory Island, just 8.5 miles off the mainland, is an island steeped in history and folklore, where Irish is spoken and the locals elect a king, who acts as the community spokesperson. Seventy-four-year-old musician Patsy Dan Rodgers has been king for two decades now, ruling over this island of 150 inhabitants, a single road, one church, one grocery store, one lighthouse, one hostel and a social club.Surf the AtlanticThe Wild Atlantic Way is studded by tiny surf towns and beaches that have become legendary among the European surf community. Bundoran is widely considered one of the best surfing spots in Europe, and is fantastic for all kinds of water sports and horseshoe-shaped Magheraroarty Strand and sand dune-backed Ballyhiernan Bay are both suitable for windsurfing and surfing. Beginners can get to grips with the sport at Inishowen, which has some of the most consistent waves in Ireland, due to its exposure to rolling swells. Its long stretches of golden sandy beaches make for safe surfing conditions and a pleasant environment for newbies.Cook your catchCatch and cook your own dinner on a fishing trip with An Duanai Mara Boat Charters, based in the fishing town of Killybegs. On these deep-sea angling trips (combined with sightseeing trips around Donegal Bay), you’ll have the chance to reel in a cod, ling or turbot, watch the skipper fillet it, and then feast on it at nearby Kitty Kelly’s restaurant.Hike Glenveagh national parkGlenveagh national park is one of six in Ireland, encompassing some 16,000 hectares in the heart of the Derryveagh mountains. These lands were managed as a private deer forest before becoming a national park in 1975, and this is now bona fide wilderness, home to a lot of indigenous wildlife and rare plant species.Explore Ireland from the comfort of your own car with Irish Ferries.

Can he prevent this?I work for a large company and use the Gmail set up for my account. As a senior manager, I have many confidential conversations internally and externally via email.I have found out that one of the tech guys accesses employee’s emails when requested to carry out checks by the CEO. Do they have the right to do this? I think it creates a feeling of mistrust and insecurity. Can I lock my account so only I can access it? MartinHistorically, the assumption has always been that companies own and can access mail used for company business. When I was a manager, I dictated letters to a secretary who typed them and filed copies. I never reached a level where these filing cabinets were locked and inaccessible, but they contained nothing of personal interest.Email has blurred the lines between corporate and private uses. People usually type their own emails, and even business emails tend to be informal. Convenience plus the illusion of privacy has led more people to use company email addresses for personal emails.None the less, emails do sometimes lead to contract disputes and lawsuits, and email records can be subpoenaed by courts. They are part of the audit trail for many negotiations, and as a matter of principle, companies should back them up and archive them. It’s therefore better to avoid using corporate email addresses for personal emails – or, indeed, anything you don’t want archived.Email seems to be more private than the letters we dictated to secretaries, but probably isn’t.Very few people actually trawled through filing cabinets and photocopied things they found. Emails are, by contrast, extremely easy to forward to others, including – by mistake – the wrong people. Something juicy can soon reach an audience of thousands.Further, standard emails are not encrypted and are usually passed on by numerous routers where they could, in theory, be read by anybody who can access them. The new GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) is encouraging companies to adopt secure, encrypted email services, but that won’t happen overnight.And if encryption makes email less convenient, people will use WhatsApp, Signal and other messaging services that are beyond the reach of the company email administrators and auditors. There’s a version of WhatsApp for Windows and MacOS, so you could consider that.I am not a lawyer so I don’t want to get into legal issues, especially as these vary by country. However, there is clearly a conflict between the company’s need to manage staff and the employees’ right to privacy. Ultimately, which one takes precedence may be decided in court, and one landmark case went as far as the European court of human rights.Companies want people to do the work they’re paid to do, so they should have explicit rules about things like making personal phone calls, reading Facebook or viewing pornographic sites at work. These things can usually be monitored by phone and server logs. Personal emails are harder to monitor, but it would seem reasonable for companies to have access to similar logs, without necessarily being able to read the contents of emails.Some companies also monitor emails by scanning for key words that suggest illegal or unethical behaviour. This could include sexual or racial harassment, or bullying. Note that these filters will also catch emails sent from personal email addresses. If you must send personal emails at work, you should ideally use your own device and either a VPN or your own internet connection.Thomson Reuters’ Practical Law site has a good guide to email and internet use at work by Michael Hart and Ellen Temperton from Baker McKenzie LLP. It includes sample warnings on internet and email abuse and a guide to formulating a company policy.Email services usually keep logs of email access, which can include the IP address and the type of device used. There are several ways to check the records for your Gmail account. The simplest is to scroll to the bottom of a page of email, find “Last account activity” and click “Details”. This will pop up a table showing the type of access (browser, mobile, etc), Location (IP address) and DateTime. It will also show any accesses made by authorised applications.You should also go to https:security.googlesettingssecurityactivity to find out which computers, mobile phones and other devices have accessed your account. In my case, for example, there are three devices: a desktop PC, a laptop and a smartphone.Everyone should check these details from time to time, to look for unexpected entries.If your company has a G Suite account, then the email administrator can see a dashboard with details such as the total number of emails sent and received, and the last time you accessed the account via a web browser or email programme. It also shows the number of files created, edited and shared in Google Drive.G Suite for Education – used in many schools – and G Suite Enterprise provide more advanced account management features.It’s also easy to set up delegated access, which means you can access one Gmail account from another Gmail account. This is handy if you have one for business and one for personal use. You can even allow someone else to read and send mail on your behalf, without giving them your password.It’s also a way that someone else can read your emails. To see if they are, click the cogwheel, pick Settings, go to “Accounts and Import” and check the “Grant access to your account” section.Google doesn’t allow administrators to force delegated access, but some third-party G Suite programs do. Examples include BetterCloud’s FlashPanel and GAT (General Audit Tool). GAM (Google Apps Manager) appears to do it without warning the user.Your G Suite administrator can also access any account by resetting the password. This is essential because people sometimes forget their passwords, get fired, or just quit.Of course, you would notice if your password changed. However, email administrators could try “social engineering”. For example, they could reset passwords, add delegated access, then tell users to reset their own passwords “for security reasons”. How many are going to check their Accounts and Import settings?There are also ways to read people’s Gmail without accessing their account. For example, a G Suite administrator can set up rules to copy incoming and outgoing emails to a different account, or to copy all incoming emails to a different server.Alternatively, they can read everyone’s emails in a backup such as Google Vault, BetterCloud, Backupify or whatever. Once your unencrypted emails are stored outside your mailbox, there are no real access restrictions.So, even if you could lock your account, your emails would still be available to any company smart enough to keep backups. They would still be accessible even if you deleted your account.A real solution would have to be non-technical. Specifically, your company should have a clear statement about its policies on email and internet use and privacy, so employees know exactly where they stand. Further, email administrator access should be policed by a data protection or privacy or security officer, not the whims of the CEO.Have you got a question?

Inhumans was so dire that mankind appears to have already reached a tacit agreement to pretend that it never happened. New Warriors is lost in limbo without a network. The whole thing is disappointing and small-scale. With one exception.Legion. Noah Hawley’s extremely tangential X-Men spin-off finished its second series on FX last week in the US, and wraps up in the UK this coming Monday. By all accounts it’s a doozy. At least, I think it’s a doozy. It certainly looked very nice, and the performances were all terrific. As for what actually happened in it? That’s less clear.I know the broad strokes. There was a hero and a monster, and a giant plughole in the desert. There was definitely a dance-off featuring one of Flight of the Conchords, and some of the characters introduced this year can only be described as androgynous, Autotuned 118 men. From what I have been able to tell, the final episode ends on such a dark note that it deserves any Breaking Bad comparisons it receives. But pin me down and interrogate me on the specifics of any given episode, and you’d get nothing.Because Legion’s storytelling is so opaque and fragmented – with various dimensions and timelines at play, some of which are real and some of which are imagined – that trying to piece it together into a cohesive whole is almost impossible. Legion is not a programme inclined to hold your hand. It’s a flurry of images and noises that leap about according to their own whims. It’s a tidal wave full of broken masonry, and viewers have the choice of dissecting it in immense detail or simply letting it wash over them. Legion demands either all of your attention or none of it. Fall anywhere between those poles and you’ll drown.As Sean O’Neal recently pointed out on AV Club, Legion shares a core DNA with Westworld, in that both shows make hay of muddying their narratives to the obvious bafflement of their audiences. However, where Westworld is portentous and self-important, Legion is a kaleidoscope. Its tone is always playful, and it always drips with invention. If nothing else, it is gorgeous to look at.It isn’t perfect, of course, and sometimes you find yourself yearning for some narrative directness. It shouldn’t be a surprise that the best and most moving episode of the series – Chapter 14 – was the one that stepped back from all the frantic pinwheeling to explore a character in a moment of grief. However, it also shouldn’t be a surprise that this episode took place within a shattered multiverse that drew heavily from quantum mechanics. Sometimes, it must be said, you’re desperate for Legion to get out of its own way.But still – compared to the rest of Marvel’s television output – Legion stands alone. In a world of product, Legion feels like a statement. It feels like it’s the result of a definitive vision, rather than a corporate decision to fill gaps that didn’t need filling. Legion is its own thing, and it absolutely isn’t for everybody. But I miss it already, and I can’t wait for series three. I won’t be able to understand a single second of it, but that’s half the fun. Legion’s second season finale airs at 10pm, Monday 2 July on Fox."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/04adac99267de7a3991ca08995d1a9fee8347ce8/3_0_3750_2250/master/3750.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b837dd90e097db8123d0047b123b1b4","title":"deluge of electronic waste turning thailand into worlds rubbish dump","story":"Thailand has been swamped by waste from the west after Chinese ban on importsAt a deserted factory outside Bangkok, skyscrapers made from vast blocks of crushed printers, Xbox components and TVs tower over black rivers of smashed-up computer screens. This is a tiny fraction of the estimated 50m tonnes of electronic waste created just in the EU every year, a tide of toxic rubbish that is flooding into south-east Asia from the EU, US and Japan. Thailand, with its lax environmental laws, has become a dumping ground for this e-waste over the past six months, but authorities are clamping down, fearful that the country will become the “rubbish dump of the world”. The global implications could be enormous.A factory visited by the  in Samut Prakan province, south of Bangkok, which was recently shut down in a raid for operating illegally, illustrated the mammoth scale of the problem. Printers made by Dell and HP, Daewoo TVs and Apple computer drives were stacked sky-high next to precarious piles of compressed keyboards, routers and copy machines. Labels showed the waste had mainly come from abroad.  For locals, it is unclear why Thailand should be taking this waste. The Samut Prakan factory sits in the middle of hundreds of shrimp farms and there were concerns it was poisoning the landscape, with no environmental protections or oversight in place. Paraton Gumkum, 32, who owns a nearby shrimp farm, described the smell that enveloped the area when the factory was operating. “I wish that Thailand would say no to the e-waste trash. I am worried because it contaminates the air and the water with dangerous chemicals,” he said. “We have been very worried that the chemicals will leak into our shrimp farm.” But in January, having calculated that the environmental impact far outweighed the short-term profit, China closed its gates to virtually all foreign rubbish. It has prompted something of a global crisis, not just for e-waste but plastic waste as well. Asian nations such as Thailand, Laos and Cambodia stepped in. Chinese businessmen have set about attempting to open about 100 plastic and e-waste recycling plants across Thailand since January.However, after five months in which e-waste imports have increased to 37,000 tonnes so far this year (more is thought to have entered illegally), Thailand has become the first south-east Asian nation to follow China’s example and crack down on the legal and illegal e-waste coming in. “We already have too much electronic waste here in Thailand. It is not our burden to bring this pollution from the rest of the world to the next generation of Thai people,” said Thailand’s deputy police chief, Wirachai Songmetta. Songmetta, who has led raids on more than 26 illegal e-waste factories in recent weeks, described some of the recycling set-ups as “frightening”, with primitive and contaminating methods used to extract valuable metals from the electronics while the rest is thrown into vast incinerators that pump out toxic smoke.  “These factories have been polluting the environment because of all the heavy metals in the e-waste like lead and copper, which can poison the soil and the water,” he said. “They also burn the plastic, which brings toxic fumes into the air. So it is very dangerous for the Thai people living near these factories.”While the word recycling implies doing good for the planet, in fact most of the e-waste recycling plants involve a dirty and toxic process to extract lead and copper that does huge amounts of environmental damage. The plastic in e-waste, such as computer screen casings, also contains high amounts of flame retardants that are poisonous if burned or recycled into cheap food packaging, as is happening in some of the factories.  Thai customs officers are now pushing back 20 containers of e-waste a day that are landing in Thai ports, and in the next two months the government plans to pass legislation to bans foreign e-waste and plastic waste from entering Thailand.But with countries such as the US and the UK already relying on south-east Asia to pick up the e-waste and plastic waste slack in the wake of China’s ban – in the past four months alone, UK exports of plastic to Thailand have risen fiftyfold – this presents a problem. In Hong Kong and Singapore, where most of the world’s e-waste is sent before it is bounced to less-developed countries, there is already a backlog of e-waste in shipping containers. If south-east Asian countries do not take it, it has nowhere to go. Jim Puckett, of the Basel Action Network, which works globally to tackle the problem of toxic waste, said that in the short term a ban by Thailand would “inevitably lead to countries resorting to perverse ways to get rid of their e-waste, probably dumping it in terrible places and incinerating it all.” But he emphasised that in the long term a ban on e-waste imports across the region was “extremely necessary”.  “Places like America and Europe need to realise they are going to have to start recycling their own electronic waste and stop sweeping the negative effects from north to south,” he said.“If a crisis does hit, hopefully this will make these countries think hard about how to be cleaner and more efficient about this waste we are producing on such an enormous scale, and finally take some responsibility.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/362677ffcbb8e867abbac72227ea191ecdb7aca5/0_0_5022_3013/master/5022.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=46950a6202af93b210dbed70ed69361d","title":"future of eu hinges on solving migration issue says merkel","story":"Chancellor says leaders should be ‘rooting for multilateralism rather than unilateralism’Angela Merkel has said the future of the European Union hinges on whether it can find answers to the “vital questions” posed by migration.Addressing the Bundestag before heading to Brussels for a European summit that is likely to determine the future of her fraying coalition government, the German chancellor said European leaders should find a solution to asylum challenges “by allowing ourselves to be guided by values and rooting for multilateralism rather than unilateralism”.If the heads of government gathering in Brussels failed to do so, Merkel said, they risked creating a situation where “no one believes in the value system that has made us so strong”.Merkel will be going to Brussels under immense pressure from her interior minister, Horst Seehofer, who is threatening to unilaterally turn away at German borders any migrants who have already registered in another EU country, unless the chancellor can come up with a European solution to the problem by 1 July.In a 26-minute speech to the German parliament, notably in Seehofer’s absence, Merkel sounded a note of pessimism about the chances of striking an EU-wide deal on migration by Friday morning. “We are not yet where we want to be,” she said, adding that EU leaders remained at odds on two out of seven key questions relating to common standards for asylum procedures across the EU and a quota system for redistributing asylum seekers – a proposal that has proved a contentious issue across Europe for the last two years.Merkel defended her decision to keep open German borders to refugees at the height of the crisis in September 2015, saying: “I still believe it was right.”But she also said it was time to return to practices before 2015 now that asylum requests had gone down, and to seek conversations with African states about deals to return migrants “who absolutely have no right to stay”, modelled on a 2016 agreement between Turkey and the EU.Other European leaders such as Austria’s chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, have proposed deals to set up “secure zones” for refugees in north African states such as Libya.Throughout Merkel’s speech she was heckled by delegates of the rightwing populist party Alternative für Deutschland. At one point she interrupted her own speech with the words “My God, seriously now”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2e111040b98b36e60c412c6e0a33d6905583b47/0_22_640_384/master/640.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dbabafe0b64d49e8862c7fc3e3748ff5","title":"giulio regeni unexplained gaps in cctv tapes","story":"Footage from where Cambridge academic was last seen is missing, say Italian prosecutorsThe investigation into the torture and murder of Giulio Regeni, the Cambridge doctoral student who was killed in Cairo more than two years ago, faced another setback this week after prosecutors said video surveillance of the metro station where he was last seen contained unexplained gaps and no images of the Italian student.Italian prosecutors leading the investigation said in a statement on Wednesday that “further investigations were needed to ascertain the causes” of the gaps in the surveillance footage from 25 January 2016. Italian authorities had demanded the surveillance tapes for more than two years from Egyptian authorities, who have been accused of stonewalling the investigation. Regeni, 28, was conducting sensitive research into labour unions at the time of his death. He is widely believed to have been killed by forces within Egypt’s security services, although the precise nature of why he was targeted, and who was responsible for his murder, have remained a mystery.His tortured and mutilated body was found in a roadside ditch near Cairo on 3 February 2016, eight days after he disappeared. Egypt has denied any involvement in his murder.The tapes have been seen as a vital piece of evidence of where Regeni was going and who might have abducted him. Egyptian authorities reportedly secured the videos one week after they were initially requested. They were deemed useless by the Egyptian authorities, who said the critical footage had already been erased. It nevertheless took more than two years to negotiate the handover of the footage from Egypt to Italy, where investigators were disappointed with what they found.The case has been at the centre of intense diplomatic tension, not only because of the alleged involvement of the government of the Egyptian president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, but because Egyptian authorities have failed to offer adequate assistance to Italian investigators.Italy sought to improve diplomatic relations with Egypt last year, and reinstated its ambassador there after tensions over the Regeni investigation prompted the former centre-left government to remove its top diplomat from Cairo. At the time of the reinstatement of the ambassador, the then-foreign minister, Angelino Alfano, called Egypt an “unavoidable partner”, but Regeni’s parents criticised the move, calling it a “dressed-up surrender”.The new populist government appears ready to forge an even closer relationship, despite the ongoing questions over Regeni’s murder. Matteo Salvini, the interior minister, said earlier this month that he understood the desire of Regeni’s family to seek justice “but for us, having a good relationship with an important country like Egypt is fundamental”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b429cfb112151594e438b6e172716649aee14d64/72_0_2855_1715/master/2855.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e296c89c91b088de66572ae9f1c5df2f","title":"mexico election the candidates the stakes and the key issues","story":"Voters will choose their next president Sunday at a time of disillusionment at unchecked corruption, poverty and violenceLatin America’s second largest economy will go to the polls on Sunday to choose its next president and a new congress at a time of widespread disillusionment at unchecked corruption, poverty and violence that has claimed at least 200,000 lives since 2007. The presidential front-runner, a 64-year-old leftist called Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has claimed his widely anticipated landslide victory will represent the fourth great sea change in Mexican history after independence in 1821, the 1857-1860 War of the Reform and the Mexican Revolution of 1910.“It seems like a dream but we are just a few days away from achieving Mexico’s transformation,” López Obrador, or Amlo as he is best known, told flag-waving supporters during a recent rally in the rundown satellite city of Ecatepec. Amlo’s foes beg to differ, painting him as a democracy-allergic, Hugo Chávez-style demagogue who will indeed transform Mexico – by crashing its economy. But many on Mexico’s left are not convinced Amlo will be much of a radical once in power, and analysts say that a better comparison is with Brazil’s former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who oversaw a period of economic growth even as he battled inequality.Amlo’s consistent dominance in the polls has been such that his opponents have often seemed an irrelevance.Perhaps the only man capable of spoiling his party on Sunday is Ricardo Anaya, a shaven-headed 39-year-old lawyer from the National Action Party (Pan) who profilers have described as a curious mix of yoga fanatic and cut-throat political operator. Voters seem unsure, however. In recent weeks the campaign of Anaya’s left-right coalition appears to have stalled amid corruption allegations he has denied and questions over his supposedly Machiavellian bent. Behind Anaya is José Antonio Meade, a career civil servant standing for the now widely loathed Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, to which Mexico’s equally unpopular current president, Enrique Peña Nieto, belongs. Meade’s efforts to project himself as a likeable everyman have also failed to impress voters. Bringing up the rear is Jaime “El Bronco” Rodríguez, an eccentric former governor who is running as an independent and boasts the support of just three per cent of voters, according to the latest polls. His main contribution to the presidential race has been an incendiary pledge to tackle corruption by chopping the hands off criminals. Some analysts have attributed Amlo’s runaway lead to Donald Trump’s attempts to browbeat Mexico’s leaders over immigration and trade. According to that version, Mexican voters are now intent on electing a strongman leader capable of hitting back at Trump’s bullying.But this year’s election is far more about domestic issues than foreign policy: primarily the rampant corruption and crime that have left Mexico’s 88 million registered voters furious and afraid. On 10 December 2006, president Felipe Calderón, launched Mexico’s war on drugs by sending 6,500 troops into his home state of Michoacán, where rival cartels were engaged in tit-for-tat massacres.Calderón declared war eight days after taking power – a move widely seen as an attempt to boost his own legitimacy after a bitterly contested election victory. Within two months, around 20,000 troops were involved in operations across the country.The US has donated at least $1.5bn through the Merida Initiative since 2008, while Mexico has spent at least $54bn on security and defence since 2007. Critics say that this influx of cash has helped create an opaque security industry open to corruption at every level.But the biggest costs have been human: since 2007, around 230,000 people have been murdered and more than 28,000 reported as disappeared. Human rights groups have also detailed a vast rise in human rights abuses by security forces.As the cartels have fractured and ersified, other violent crimes such as kidnapping and extortion have also surged. In addition, hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced by violence.\u0026nbspImproved collaboration between the US and Mexico has resulted in numerous high-profile arrests and drug busts. Officials say 25 of the 37 drug traffickers on Calderón’s most-wanted list have been jailed, extradited to the US or killed, although not all of these actions have been independently corroborated.The biggest victory – and most embarrassing blunder – under Peña Nieto’s leadership was the recapture, escape and another recapture of Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán, leader of the Sinaloa cartel.While the crackdown and capture of kingpins has won praise from the media and US, it has done little to reduce the violence.Mexico’s decade-long war on drugs would never have been possible without the huge injection of American cash and military cooperation under the Merida Initiative. The funds have continued to flow despite growing evidence of serious human rights violations.\u0026nbspIn May, Mexico suffered nearly 2,900 murders, its most violent month in two decades. More than 120 political candidates have been killed since campaigning for this weekend’s election officially which began last September. Meanwhile the country has been rocked by a succession of eye-watering corruption scandals, including that of Javier Duarte, a PRI governor who went AWOL in a government helicopter in 2016 after being accused of corruption and whose wife recently turned up living in luxurious exile in one of London’s poshest boroughs.On the campaign trail, Amlo has hammered home his determination to end the bloodshed and theft that have come rampant under the PRI and the PAN, the only parties to have held Mexico’s presidency since its democratic transition in 2000. “This isn’t any old election,” he told the Ecatepec rally. “It’s a vote for more of the same, or for genuine change ... It’s change, yes or change, no.”Alan Riding, author of a seminal book on Mexican politics and society called Distant Neighbors: A Portrait of the Mexicans, described Amlo’s success as “a product of total disenchantment” with the Mexico’s ruling elite. “The PRI and the PAN have had their turn and they have failed, time and time again.” Amlo was born in the Tabasco river town of Tepetitán, in November 1953, the first of seven children. He became politically active in the late 1970s, working with local indigenous populations, and later moved to Mexico’s capital where he was elected mayor in 2000. Friends and supporters describe Amlo as a taco-loving baseball enthusiast and bookworm who is happier with his head in a book or out enjoying nature than socializing. “He’s a monastic man,” says Azucena Cisneros, a candidate for Amlo’s party in the State of Mexico. “Marvelously disciplined but monastic. He has no social life.” He is also a friend of Jeremy Corbyn and his Mexican wife, Laura Álvarez.Critics cast Amlo as a Mexican Chávez or even a Mexican Trump. Some detractors have even accused him of posing as “a tropical messiah”. But many experts believe a better, if still imperfect comparison, might be Brazil’s former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, a one-time union firebrand who was elected on his fourth attempt, in 2002. Fears over Lula’s election sent stocks tumbling and had investors in a sweat. But he ruled for two terms as a pragmatic centrist credited with slashing poverty in one of the world’s most unequal societies.Like Lula, Amlo has tempered his discourse in what is his third bid for the presidency (he ran unsuccessfully in 2006 and 2012) and has vowed to rule for the poor. “We will care for everyone. We will listen to everyone. We will respect everyone,” he told the crowds in Ecatepec, home to nearly 790,000 of the 53 million Mexicans stuck below the poverty line. “But we will give preference to the humble. For everyone’s well-being, the poor will come first.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d53a99011dc83c965c1fddf64ccbebbc8632092a/0_1411_3196_1917/master/3196.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fe8304ac15c76412b4ed180296776d4d","title":"uk criticised refusing extradite briton myanmar harris binotti","story":"Authorities accused of failing judicial obligations over murder suspect Harris Binotti The UK has been accused of failing in its judicial obligations after refusing to extradite a Briton wanted in Myanmar on suspicion of murdering a friend and colleague in his Yangon apartment.The Home Office said it declined to extradite Harris Binotti, a Scottish teacher, because of the lack of an extradition treaty, adding that such a move would breach its human rights obligations.Binotti, 27, is wanted in Myanmar on suspicion of murdering his fellow British national Gary Ferguson, 47, in 2016. He remains at large, with reports that he may be in Scotland.Zar Li Aye, a national legal adviser for the International Commission of Jurists, said under the legal principle of aut dedere aut judicare (either extradite or prosecute), the obligation fell to British authorities to prosecute Binotti at home. By not prosecuting him, she argued, the UK was enforcing a jurisdictional gap.“Why haven’t they opened a case in the UK? Do they not have a law that protects their citizens abroad? Do they not have a law that permits them to prosecute their own citizens for felonies committed on foreign soil? What is important for us right now is to hold them accountable after their decision to not extradite an accused murderer,” Zar Li Aye said.The two men taught English at Horizon International school in Yangon. Ferguson, who was married and had a four-year-old son, had worked there for a year, and Binotti for three months.Martin Ferguson, the victim’s brother, said in a Facebook group for supporters of the family: “We will never give up. No matter what.”He said he was informed by email of the Home Office’s decision not to extradite Binotti.“The request was refused due to there being no extradition treaty in place between the UK and Burma. In addition, to extradite Mr Binotti, the UK would violate several human rights obligations,” the email said.Yangon police discovered Ferguson’s body with fatal head and chest wounds on 6 November 2016 after breaking the lock to Binotti’s apartment with the help of a neighbour.According to the police statement, Binotti and Ferguson went to the apartment together after a night out. Neighbours said they heard fighting at midnight and 4am on 5 November, and a woman and two men screaming. Though Binotti, from Dumfries, remains on Interpol’s red notice database, which allows law enforcement authorities beyond Myanmar to arrest him, there is little pressure from Myanmar to do so. Myo Thant Pe, the director general of the consular and legal affairs department under Myanmar’s ministry of foreign affairs, said: “Normally, if someone committed a crime, he should meet justice where he committed it … But for this case, I don’t know.”Myanmar’s lack of urgency to extradite is compounded by pressure within the UK against extradition. After Myanmar filed its extradition request last year, Amnesty International reportedly urged the British government to deny it on the grounds that Myanmar still has the death penalty.Additional reporting by Nay Paing"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Minister for Finance calls for more accountability among senior health service staffDubliner Jason O\u0026rsquoDriscoll (35) on trial for murder of two men in Co Louth in 2012An Board Plean\u0026aacutela agrees to quash approval for over 530 homes next to north Dublin parkPublic Accounts Committee discusses process to recruit successor to Tony O\u0026rsquoBrienClosing submissions at tribunal examining alleged smear campaign against Sgt Maurice McCabeRaymond McCord claimed the current criteria for calling a referendum on Irish unity is too vagueCourt of Justice in Luxembourg hears case over man fighting extradition from IrelandThe series of interviews are to be made available to the public next monthHeat causing problems for water supplies, transport links\u0026lsquoNewbridge or Nowhere\u0026rsquo one of the biggest GAA controversies to hit the organisation in recent yearsDelays on expected on inbound N4 because of oil spill following Kilmainham collisionPSNI Deputy Chief Constable Drew Harris will take up the new role in SeptemberEmployed people will be expected to make contribution to direct provision centrePaleobiologist Dr Maria McNamara loves fossils for the fascinating insights they can yield about ancient lifeRapid changes in farming have sounded the death knell for many of our 21 species of bumblebees and 75 species of \u0026lsquosolitary\u0026rsquo beesCo Meath native sues in US claiming Anglo fraudulently induced \u0026euro10m guaranteeFianna F\u0026aacuteil leader claims party will not discuss renewing confidence and supply agreementSafeguarding board told Government it had no central database of priests facing allegations"},{"url":null,"title":"children heard crying and calling for parents in border facility recording","story":"Read and listen to the full story at:-  June 19, 2018Trump administration policy labelled \u0026lsquoinhumane\u0026rsquo and \u0026lsquoheartbreaking\u0026rsquo   June 19, 2018President blames Congress and loopholes in the law for \u0026lsquoillegal immigration crisis\u0026rsquo   June 20, 2018President tells Republicans he is \u0026lsquo1,000 per cent\u0026rsquo behind immigration reform efforts   June 20, 2018Word of Trump\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquozero tolerance\u0026rsquo border policy has sowed confusion on migrant trail "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3546742.1530187125!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"record temperatures set to continue with 30 degrees in store","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAlicia McKiernan from Gorey at  Aras an Uachtarain in Dublin’s Phoenix Park on Wednesday. Photograph: Dara Mac Dónaill Many parts of the country could see record-breaking temperatures as the extremely hot weather continues for another two days at least.Parts of north Munster and Connacht will see another day of 30 degrees plus temperatures. Other places will have temperatures in the high 20s with a welcome breeze along the coast.It has become so hot that the AA has issued a warning to motorists to take care on teritary roads became of melting tarmac.AA Roadwatch editor Arwen Foley said melting tar can stick to the wheels and attract a lot of debris which make it hazardous for driving. Several local authorities including Sligo and Donegal have issued warnings about melting tar.However, he added that temperatures will get close to that in many places on Thursday and Friday.Temperatures soared on Wednesday afternoon, hitting 30.8 degrees by 4.30pm at Shannon Airport. Mount Dillon in Co Roscommon and Athenry in Co Galway also recorded temperatures over 30 degrees but that figure may be surpassed on Thursday.“Records will be broken for different weather stations. We have over 30 degrees in the past and we will get into the low 30s today (Thursday) and tomorrow (Friday),” he said.The long spell of good weather is set to continue though there is a possibility of thunderstorms breaking out over the weekend as a result of the high temperatures and humidity.“There is no obvious sign of a break in the weather at such,” Mr Clarke said. “Overall the temperature regime is going to stay well above normal. There is no obvious signs of a change to an Atlantic regime with temperatures below 20 degrees and rain from time to time.“If we do get a showers it will be because of the heat and the humidity but they will be very hit and miss.”It is already shaping up to be one of the sunniest months on record. On Wednesday Malin Head recorded 16.4 hours of sunshine.Irish Water said it was operating on a “knife edge” to keep supplies flowing during the prolonged dry weather and have urged the country to “pull together” to prevent taps running dry.Eamon Gallen, general manager of the utility, said demand in Dublin earlier this week reached a “very concerning” peak while Donegal, Galway, Limerick and Mullingar have been deemed as “high risk”.About 10,000 households are coping with restrictions or no water at all for periods, mostly in the Bennettsbridge area of Co Kilkenny while supplies are also being interrupted in parts of Granard, Co Longford, and Kinnegad, Co Westmeath.Mr Gallen said the water supply was already under pressure and the dry spell has exacerbated the problem.Demand has been so high it reached close to capacity in Dublin earlier in the week.Homes and businesses in the capital use on average 565 million litres a day, based on last year’s figures. The maximum amount Irish Water can supply to the city is 610 million litres.Mr Gallen said on Tuesday night demand reached 603 million and that was down from the previous 24 hours when demand was “a very concerning” 609 million litres.“The conservation message is having an impact, we can see that in demand,” he said, appealing to the population to conserve where possible so as supply isn’t shut off for friends, family and neighbours.In particular, he urged people not to be using hoses or power washers, watering gardens , washing cars or filling paddling pools. Mr Gallen said people should have shorter showers rather than a bath and not run the tap when brushing teeth.Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed said State and private advisory services are working with farmers threatened with fodder shortages because of drought conditions in some parts of the country.“The solution to this is rain, and unfortunately I’m not in a position to deliver that,” he said. “It is difficult, that is undoubtedly the case.”Mr Creed told RTE Radio One issues related to the extended dry spell were not uniform around the country . “We have farmers on heavier soils where grass growth is exceptionally good this year, but we do have situations - particularly in the south and east on gravelly soil - where we have real problems now with soil moisture.”Mr Creed said: “The ultimate solution in many respects is a break in the weather and some rain, but we will continue to monitor this and advise farmers to bring them through as best we can.”Iarnród Éireann has advised customers to stay hydrated when travelling during the hot weather spell, and are distributing 50,000 bottles of water to customers free of charge at major stations over the coming days around the network.Iarnród Éireann has also put into operation a series of hot weather protocols to ensure services run without disruption. Fleet maintenance will focus on cooling systems on board, and on ensuring air-conditioning is operating well on equipped fleets, with fleets being monitored remotely and in maintenance centres.Some track maintenance works are being deferred, as unsettling the track bed can increase the risk of rail buckling in the heat. However, engineers say that rail heat levels have not approached levels to cause concern or to require speed restrictions yet.It has become so hot that members of the the normally stuffy Barristers Tea Room Restaurant in the Four Courts can remove their jackets.The notice was pinned to the door of the restaurant with the caveat in small print that the recommendation came from the Health Service Executive (HSE).There was good news for bathers in the north Dublin area. Fingal County Council has lifted the temporary ‘do not swim’ notice for Rush south beach which was issed last Friday due to the risk of deterioration in water quality following an emergency sewage overflow at Rush east shore.Samples of the water were taken on Monday and the results were excellent.Samples were also taken on Monday at all other designated beaches in Fingal and all achieved excellent water quality results.Conor Faughnan, of the Automobile Association, said its breakdown service has been very busy because of hot weather problems. These include vehicles overheating and “lots and lots of tyre problems”.“In very hot weather if your tyre is weak, if it is under-inflated, has any blisters on it, if the tread is worn out, weather like this will find it out,” he told RTE Radio One. “The hot weather causes the tyre to expand and that exacerbates wear and tear. We’ve had a lot of call outs for tyres over the past few days.”Mr Faugnan said while major routes were bearing up against the heat, some 90,000 kilometres of secondary roads around the country are “still basically chip and tar.”In very hot weather they need treatment, and motorists should not assume driving conditions are necessarily good because it is sunny weather as “roads can get a little slippery.”Drivers are also being warned not to throw cigarettes out windows, as the fire hazard in dry weather is more severe.Five-day nationwide forecasts, weather warnings and rainfall maps "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3546718.1530172152!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"is uk stalling on brexit a tactic","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDemonstrators participate in a march demanding a people’s vote on the final Brexit deal in central London on June 23rd, 2018.

The issue could not be allowed to drift because he claimed the British government was prevaricating and “running down the clock” and that Ireland was playing into its hands.But the Tánaiste insisted that there would be no withdrawal treaty if there was no legal text on the backstop.“The treaty will not happen if that doesn’t happen,” Mr Coveney said.Mr Coveney insisted that Brexit was Ireland’s top priority, adding that “Ireland needs to hold its nerve” in the intensifying negotiations over the summer to protect Irish interests.“That is what we will do, I assure you,” he told Mr Doherty.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

I am clear that if we are going to be putting in place a framework like Sláintecare, it has to be accompanied by a higher level of personal accountability in relation to health expenditure.”Mr Donohoe said he had put in place increased levels of investment for the health service in order to deliver better outcomes for patients .“What we have seen accompanying that over the last two years in particular is the HSE in the course of the year moving ahead of that budget,” he said.“What I am indicating now is,as we work on how we deal with the health service now and into the future coming years, that as we put new people in place to run the HSE and a strengthened board a key element of the conditions they have will be how they manage their budget. “The HSE has recorded a deficit of €101.5 million in the first two months of the year and the overrun by the end of June could be between €200 million and €300 million.On Wednesday, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar also criticised the health service in his address to the National Economic Dialogue and said it was not working well. He said healthcare reform was the biggest challenge in the public service.Mr Varadkar suggested the €15 billion health budget - one of the highest levels of expenditure per head anywhere in the world - was “hard to justify” given Ireland’s relatively youthful population.He said the education system, while not perfect, did largely work well, unlike the health service. He suggested one reason was that all schools and universities had their own boards and there were people in charge who were accountable. “That is something we do not have in the health service.”Mr Donohoe also told the conference in Dublin Castle on Thursday he was committed to tax reform. He indicated a priority would be to address the situation where a person on an average income could be paying the higher rate of tax.He said the budget deficit next year would be no larger than 0.1 per cent but if opportunities presented themselves later in the year to go beyond that, this was something the Government could consider.-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3543097.1529936231!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"a third of all bee species in ireland could be extinct by 2030","story":"In 2004, two scientists took on a mammoth task: to systematically survey every county in Ireland for bees. They figured it would take them two years, but within months they realised that something was terribly wrong.The scientists, Dr Úna Fitzpatrick and Dr Tomás Murray, were new to the subject, and the idea of taking on an all-Ireland bee census was pioneering. They searched the historical data on Irish bees and two names cropped up: Arthur Stelfox and Prof John Breen, now retired from the University of Limerick.Stelfox worked in the National Museum of Ireland in the 1920s, and he was the first person to scientifically record bees in Ireland. When Stelfox died in the early 1970s, a Cork man called John Breen was studying wood ants in Tipperary. Breen was mad about bees. He would travel the hedgerow-dense roads on a Yamaha 50 motorbike if he spotted a bee, he’d pull over. “I was collecting bees everywhere, putting them in boxes and recording where I found them,” he says. “I’d stop at the side of the road and find nine species on one patch.” Today, he adds, he’d be lucky to find two or three.Breen built a valuable record. In 2004, Murray and Fitzpatrick went through his boxes and extracted the data. Armed with Stelfox’s and Breen’s records, they got to work. Fitzpatrick would survey the south and east of Ireland Murray would take the rest. What emerged was a sorry tale of decline and loss.Fitzpatrick went to the Clare coast to search for the Great Yellow Bumblebee, a remarkable species which Breen had regularly spotted. “I was shocked,” she says. “We expected to find it, but the habitat had gone because of urbanisation and the development of golf courses.” Fitzpatrick mentions six other species that Stelfox and Breen had commonly seen. “We barely saw them at all,” she notes.Murray was having similar problems in Roscommon. Bee numbers were low. It was as if he had stumbled into a rural village after a wave of emigration, only to find a handful of people left. He looked for the little Shrill Carder Bee, which makes a loud, soprano buzz –“you hear it before you see it”. Stelfox had recorded it in many areas. Murray found it once.In 2006, Fitzpatrick and Murray published their findings. Half of all species were in decline.Today they sum it up in a sentence: a third of all bee species in Ireland will be extinct by 2030.Some bees are declining so rapidly that Prof Jane Stout of Trinity College fears we are facing a “silent spring” of loss. It’s a staggering prospect as we are only beginning to grasp the consequences. They are our great unpaid pollinators. If they go missing, then what?We have just one honeybee species in Ireland, and it’s doing okay. Scientists say it’s more like livestock than wildlife farmed in hives, it will be fine as long as beekeepers are around. It’s the decline of our other bees – we have 21 species of bumblebees and 75 species of “solitary” bees – that’s so dramatic.These bees inhabit an astonishing world of complex behaviours. Consider the bumblebees. They beat their wings 8,000 times a minute. They can fly when loaded down with pollen and nectar that doubles their body weight. One species has gravity-defying swoops of orange hair on the top of its face, a bit like Donald Trump. Another has a long, horse-like face. The Aran Islands has its own bespoke bumblebee found nowhere else in the world.These sociable and hairy bees live a short life. They hibernate over winter in the soil scientists think they prefer cool north-facing banks, but they aren’t sure. The bumblebee queen emerges in spring to build a nest in the ground. She produces sterile female workers who live for the common good and keep the colony fed. Her second load of offspring, male drones, have one purpose: to mate with virgin queens. Then they die.So-called solitary bees pack a wallop when it comes to pollination one bee does the work of hundreds of honeybees. Many of these species are in decline and some, like the Dark Nomad Bee, are extinct. It was last seen on a summer’s day in Dublin in 1902.New species of solitary bees have appeared. The dark blue Violet Carpenter bee arrived in Waterford in 2007 but the reason it’s here is because temperatures are increasing a vivid example, scientists say, of climate change in action.The same is true of the Wool Carder bee, first seen in 2015. It’s unique among solitary bees for having a rampant sex life males are at it every 35 seconds. He ferociously patrols his flower-rich territory, armed with spikes on his body to tear intruders apart. He will make an exception when a female Wool Carder flits in, but there can be a whiff of #metoo in his approach – he will grab her and have his way, whether she wants it or not.Theories abound to explain the decline of our bees: urbanisation the intensification of agriculture the toxic impact of pesticides our “tidiness” culture which has caused the disappearance of flowers and weeds. Bees are hungry and homeless, starved of protein-rich pollen and sugary nectar. The flowers just aren’t there the bees are exhausted from trying to find them.The rapid changes in farming – from extensive to intensive, mixed to monoculture – have sounded the death knell for many species. Ireland’s grass-based farming system is a problem. Seven million cows graze on thick swards of shiny ryegrass, but according to Breen it’s useless for bees. “Intensification of our farming is the key issue,” he says. “It has taken a toll.”There are glimmers of hope. The “Ginger Spice” of the bee world is the Tawny Mining Bee which has a mass of bright red hair. It was presumed extinct until a few years ago when it was spotted in Kilkenny. It nests in gardens and feeds on flowering hedgerows, and scientists hope that this ginger bombshell will be found elsewhere. Could it be that if we all look we will find other long-lost species along the way?We know that bees are moving westwards to the flower-rich grasslands and bogs. They do well in the Burren, where farmers are paid to produce bioersity as well as food. But land in the west is under pressure from a publicly-funded scheme which has kick-started a forestry boom in places like Leitrim. Farmland which would be great for bees is being planted up with sitka spruce, a tree which is terrible for bees, says Fitzpatrick.Ireland has long had a network of native hedgerows they are the thick green veins of our country-side. Bees love them. Tipperary dairy farmer John Fogarty, who is a near-expert on wild bees, is alarmed by the pace at which they’re being cut down. “If I look out my window I can see a man working on the land 10 miles away. Years ago, when the hedgerows were high, you just wouldn’t see that.”It’s a death by a thousand cuts. Take pesticides. When bees drink low levels of pesticides in nectar they behave like a drunken uncle at a late-night party. They go missing, and take ages to do simple tasks like eating. Pesticides leave them out of their minds.Dr Dara Stanley is an international bee expert who runs her eponymous lab in NUI Galway. She attached radio tags to the backs of bumblebees and fed half of them low levels of pesticides. She found that bees exposed to pesticides were going on longer foraging trips than those not exposed, and were bringing back pollen less often. “Whatever they were doing, they were not foraging,” she adds.There is evidence organic agriculture can have benefits for bees, while “we need to find ways to use chemicals more sustainably and more carefully”.What can be done? In 2015 officials in the Department of Agriculture told farmers they would pay them if they left a tonne of sand in the corner of a field, and also put up bee boxes around the farm – actions they said would help solitary bees. The department has spent over €1.6 million of public money on these actions. Will it make any difference? Scientists doubt it – some are privately scathing about the measures.In 2015, the All-Ireland Pollinator Plan was set up by Dr Fitzpatrick and Prof Stout. They have come up with 81 evidence-based actions they say will benefit bees. For example, Waterford City and County Council sowed a meadow in the city and the Larger Carder Bee, which had not been seen in years, appeared. The scientists said they’re “overwhelmed” by the positive response from the public. But their €15,000 grant from the Department of Agriculture has long been spent.It’s a common theme. Fitzpatrick and Murray now work in the National Bioersity Data Centre in Waterford. It’s in desperate need of secure, long-term funding. There’s an urgency to this – the latest data shows bumblebee numbers have fallen 14 per cent since 2012.Bees are clinging on but they face a barrage of man-made hazards. They have no protection under Irish or EU law. They are not on anyone’s political agenda. But the evidence is clear: we need to step back from the chemicals and respect our hedgerows re-wild our spaces and stop killing every weed we see.Bring back the flowers, say scientists, and the bees will return. Sounds utopian?"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3546858.1530183908!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"future of eu hinges on solving migration issue says merkel","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGerman chancellor Angela Merkel after her speech to the German Bundestag in Berlin. Photograph: Clemens BilanEPAGerman chancellor Angela Merkel has said the future of the European Union hinges on whether it can find answers to the “vital questions” posed by migration.Addressing the Bundestag before heading to Brussels for a European summit that is likely to determine the future of her fraying coalition government, the Ms Merkel said European leaders should find a solution to asylum challenges “by allowing ourselves to be guided by values and rooting for multilateralism rather than unilateralism”.If the heads of government gathering in Brussels failed to do so, she said, they risked creating a situation where “no one believes in the value system that has made us so strong”.Ms Merkel heads to Brussels under immense pressure from her interior minister, Horst Seehofer, who is threatening to unilaterally turn away at German borders any migrants who have already registered in another EU country, unless the chancellor can come up with a European solution to the problem by July 1st.In a 26-minute speech to the German parliament, notably in Mr Seehofer’s absence, Ms Merkel sounded a note of pessimism about the chances of striking an EU-wide deal on migration by Friday morning. “We are not yet where we want to be,” she said, adding that EU leaders remained at odds on two out of seven key questions relating to common standards for asylum procedures across the EU and a quota system for redistributing asylum seekers - a proposal that has proved a contentious issue across Europe for the last two years.Ms Merkel defended her decision to keep open German borders to refugees at the height of the crisis in September 2015, saying: “I still believe it was right.”But she also said it was time to return to practices before 2015 now that asylum requests had gone down, and to seek conversations with African states about deals to return migrants “who absolutely have no right to stay”, modelled on a 2016 agreement between Turkey and the EU.Other European leaders such as Austria’s chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, have proposed deals to set up “secure zones” for refugees in north African states such as Libya. Throughout Ms Merkel’s speech she was heckled by delegates of the rightwing populist party Alternative fur Deutschland. At one point she interrupted her own speech with the words “My god, seriously now”.According to a survey by the German broadcaster ARD, 75 per cent of Germans support the chancellor’s call for a European solution on migration. Only 36 per cent of those questioned believed she would be able to secure such a deal in the near future. - "},{"url":null,"title":"day 1914 archduke franz ferdinand assassinated sarajevo","story":"digitalservices@telegraphdigitalservices@telegraphOn Sunday 28 June 1914, Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife Sophie were travelling in a car through Sarajevo in Bosnia.

She is understood to be travelling to Windsor for the weekend as planned this afternoon and her itinerary in Scotland is scheduled to go ahead unhinged. A spokeswoman for Buckingham Palace said: The Queen is feeling under the weather today and has decided not to attend this morning\u0027s service at St Paul\u0027s Cathedral marking the 200th anniversary of the Order of Michael and St George.Her Majesty will be represented by the Duke of Kent as the grand master of the order. The event was attended by Hollywood star Angelina Jolie, who was invited as a recipient of an honour from the Order, which is granted by the Queen on the advice of the Prime Minister.Angelina Jolie arrives at St Paul\u0026#39s CathedralIt is for distinguished services in connection with foreign affairs and service overseas.Ms Jolie, who wore a simple and fitted stone-coloured mid-calf dress with matching gloves and hat, was seen chatting to former Labour Defence Secretary and Nato secretary general Lord Robertson, admiring his ceremonial robes.At the beginning of the month, it was revealed the Queen had undergone eye surgery to remove a cataract, but wore sunglasses in public rather than cancel her long-planned engagements.The Queen wears sunglasses during the Royal Windsor Horse Show at Windsor Castle on May 13The 92-year-old monarch underwent the successful procedure in May, Buckingham Palace confirmed, and in the following weeks the Queen has been seen wearing sunglasses at a number of events including the Royal Windsor Horse Show and Buckingham Palace garden parties.It was business as usual for the head of state, who did not cancel or postpone any engagements.The Court Circular, the public record of the working life of the Royal family, shows no major break in the Queen\u0027s work in May, from receiving official visitors at Buckingham Palace to attending the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle with the Duke of Edinburgh, who had recovered from a hip replacement operation.The Queen at the wheel - Her MajestyThere was a short gap between May 4, when she held an investiture, and May 15 when she undertook a series of jobs including hosting a garden party and welcoming the President of the Republic of Turkey and Mrs. Erdogan to the palace. The Queen, who is in good health, is known for her robust constitution. In 2013, she had her first hospital stay in 10 years when, at the age of 86, she suffered symptoms of gastroenteritis and missed an engagement in Swansea.A week of engagements, including a two-day trip to Rome, was cancelled and the Queen spent one night in hospital. She usually attends hospital for an annual routine check-up.The Queen is known for her robust health. Her son the Duke of York once described her as being incredibly fit for her age, and the 92-year-old monarch still rides her Fell ponies at Windsor, and drives, mainly around her private estates.She has called time on her overseas travels, leaving long-haul destinations to the younger members of her family. But she still has a busy diary of events, and in 2017 carried out 296 engagements.In November 2017, the Prince of Wales led the nation in honouring the country\u0027s war dead on Remembrance Sunday at the Cenotaph.It was the first time that the Queen, as head of state, had watched the ceremony from a nearby balcony, and was seen as a sign of the royal family in transition and an acknowledgement of her age.Just before Christmas 2016, the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh both fell ill with heavy colds, forcing them to delay their trip to Sandringham by a day.The Queen watched the 2017 Remembrance Sunday service from a balconyThe Queen was not well enough to attend the Christmas Day service at St Mary Magdalene church and also missed the New Year\u0027s Day one. She later described it as a particularly grisly mixture of cold and flu.She turned 90 in 2016 and, the same year, used the lift rather than stairs to enter Parliament for the State Opening, avoiding the 26 steps of the royal staircase at the Sovereign\u0027s Entrance.Buckingham Palace said the modest adjustment to arrangements were made for the Queen\u0027s comfort. The decision was attributed to the Queen suffering from knee pain.In 2014, the Prince of Wales stood in for the Queen for part of the Order of the Bath service to avoid her having to make an extra journey up and down some steep steps in full regalia.In November 2013, the Duke of Cambridge stepped in to represent the Queen at an investiture ceremony after she suffered some mild discomfort with her ankle after a busy weekend of engagements including the service of remembrance at the Cenotaph.Video: The Queen\u0027s life on screenHer first hospital stay in 10 years came in 2013 when she was 86 after she suffered symptoms of gastroenteritis and missed an engagement in Swansea when she was due to present St David\u0027s Day leeks to the 3rd Battalion The Royal Welsh.On March 3 2013, she was admitted to King Edward VII\u0027s Hospital to be assessed. A week of engagements, including a two-day trip to Rome, was cancelled.The Queen spent one night in hospital and left thanking staff and smiling before being driven to Buckingham Palace to rest.It was thought her public appearances were back on track until Buckingham Palace announced on the morning of the Commonwealth Day Observance service on March 11 that she regrettably could no longer attend as she continues to recover following her recent illness.It was the first Commonwealth Day Observance service she had missed in 20 years, the last occasion being when she had flu in 1993.The Queen leaves the King Edward VII hospital in March 2013 following a short stayThe Queen, who placed great importance to her role as Head of the Commonwealth, did however attend the Commonwealth Reception at Marlborough House on the evening of March 11 to sign the new Commonwealth Charter.Buckingham Palace insisted it was just the tail end of the symptoms and that her condition had not worsened.But the next day she cancelled her engagements for the rest of the week, with her son, the Duke of York, saying later that it was sensible not to risk her coming out, but that she was not ill.Her illnesses have been few and far between over the years. She has suffered from back pain, and also had operations to remove torn cartilage from both knees.She caught measles when Prince Charles was two months old in 1949 and had to be separated from her baby son.Queen Elizabeth II: Our monarch in picturesThe first time the Queen was actually admitted to hospital was in July 1982 when she had a wisdom tooth extracted at the King Edward VII Hospital in central London.The Queen\u0027s no-fuss approach to injury and illness was perfectly illustrated in 1994. She broke her left wrist when her horse tripped during a ride on the Sandringham estate in Norfolk.The break was not diagnosed until almost 24 hours later when her arm was X-rayed and set in plaster at a hospital.It was the first time she had fallen in many years and the Queen had simply brushed herself down, remounted her horse and trotted on back to Sandringham.Italy\u0026#39s upmarket resort of Portofino introduces laws to crack down on uncouth behaviour by touristsSummit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin to be held in Helsinki on July 16Saddleworth Moor fire: 100 soldiers arrive to help tackle vast blaze \u0026#39that will last for weeks\u0026#39Parents suing NHS after newborn suffocated during breast feed due to \u0026#39negligent\u0026#39 midwife, court hearsUK weather: Heatwave could give way to thunderstorms this weekendComment: Oh, the schadenfreude: why does Germany crashing out of the World Cup feel so good?British ers join rescue effort at Thai cave for football teamLondon to New York in an hour by hypersonic jet?

Chargemaster, which was founded in 2008, operates the UK’s largest network of EV charging points, with 6,500 in total. It also designs, builds, sells and maintains the units. The deal signals BP’s intent to add electric vehicle drivers to its customer base in the UK.According to the oil firm, developing convenient and innovative EV charging technologies and networks “is a key part of BP’s strategy to advance the energy transition”. The company expects to launch the chargers at BP forecourts over the next year. It also plans to roll out ultra-fast charging equipment, which will include 150kW rapid chargers, which will take just 10 minutes to give cars enough energy to drive 100 miles.

The vote for Brexit was a cry for greater opportunity from those who feel that they and their children are mired in lives that offer little hope. \u0026nbspBrexit is a done deal, and the exact parameters of exit from the European Union will have limited and short-term bearing on the UK’s economic performance.The basic facts are uncontroversial. Britain will trade somewhat less than before, at least until British businesses redirect some of their trade away from the EU to more dynamic Asian and US economies.The expected decline in the extent of international trade will, for a while, reduce Britain’s overall economic welfare. But, as the Harvard economist Dani Rodrik has repeatedly emphasized, citizens’ economic welfare changes only modestly when countries with extensive trade relationships increase or decrease the extent of their international trade.Estimates of large (sometimes very large) costs of Brexit rely on the wildly unreasonable assumption that British productivity will decline precipitously and permanently.True, the UK\u0026nbsphas been growing slower than other advanced economies since the Brexit vote but that slower growth is almost entirely explained by senseless fiscal austerity being pursued by Prime Minister Theresa May’s government while other countries have neutral or even expansionary fiscal policy.There has been much handwringing about the depreciation of the pound triggered by the Brexit vote. Currency depreciation normally makes citizens poorer: they pay more for foreign products and receive reduced prices for their exports. But the UK was running a large (and growing) current account deficit.Put simply, the UK was not richer it was living beyond its means. Prolonged current account deficits would eventually have caused a sharper and, therefore, potentially more disruptive exchange rate depreciation. For now, the depreciation has helped narrow the deficit (precisely by making British exports less expensive for trading partners – stimulating demand for British goods – and making imports dearer for British consumers). Britain is on a more sustainable growth path.Moreover, as I noted at the time, the pound’s depreciation reflected an abrupt decline in “hot money flows” into the UK\u0026nbspThese foreign funds were being used by Russian oligarchs and Indian billionaires to bid up prices of property in London. After the Brexit decision, the rate of rise in London property price increases slowed markedly recently prices have actually dropped.Since the modest trade costs of Brexit are at least partially offset by favourable developments, it is crucial to recognise what is really at stake. The Brexit vote expressed the anxiety of those who felt that their prospects of rising up the income ladder were vanishing. In her October 2016 address to the Tory party conference in Birmingham, Theresa May seemed to understand that the vote was a plea for greater opportunity and fairness. But she seems to have lost track of that insight.As my student Rachel Lurie and I find in ongoing research, those who voted against Brexit were predominantly low-skilled workers stuck in dead-end jobs or unemployed in Britain’s rust-belt areas. As former Prime Minister Gordon Brown wrote in the days after the Brexit referendum, unable to face Asian competition, British manufacturing “collapsed,” and industrial towns “hollowed out,” leaving semi-skilled workers “on the wrong side of globalisation.”But rust-belt parents had a deeper reason to worry. They were bequeathing poor education and work opportunities to their children. Thus, not only were they themselves stuck, they also felt powerless to create more opportunities for their children and grandchildren.The children, for their part, are as dispirited as their parents. Commentators commonly point out that young British citizens voted more so than their elders to remain in the EU. This ignores the large numbers who did not vote: these were young citizens typically unemployed in socially dysfunctional urban communities.For example, in Greater London, the voter turnout was 79 percent in affluent Kingston upon Thames borough but only 65 percent in Hackney, where large pockets of deep poverty and alienation persist. The non-vote of the young living in bleak urban areas was as much a sign of hopelessness as the exit vote of older rust-belt citizens.Theresa May’s early reading was right: UK\u0026nbspcitizens were indeed pleading through their vote (and non-vote) for a fair shot at the future. They were urgently calling on British leaders to revitalize decaying industrial areas and bring hope to failing urban communities in which they were trapped.The message of the Brexit vote – and of similar protest votes in other western democracies since – was that if citizens do not feel economically secure at home, they will reject international commitments.That crucial message has been lost amid the frenzied Brexit negotiations. Until it is heard, it will continue to haunt, and be repeated again and again.Ashoka Mody\u0026nbspis Visiting Professor of International Economic Policy at Princeton University and former deputy director of the International Monetary Fund’s European and Research Departments.

Despite what Kanye claimed, Pusha\u0027s last diss track was A LOT, and even took aim at Drake\u0027s longtime collaborator and friend Noah 40 Shebib and his MS diagnosis, which even Pusha\u0027s\u0026nbspfriends suggested was a bit harsh.Pusha\u0026nbspalso made references to rumours of Drake fathering an illegitimate child on The Story of Adidon, and featured artwork which showed Drake in blackface, which forced him to address the controversy in a public statement.\u0026nbspWill Drake go on tour?Which rock have you been hiding under? Drake has already announced a major North American tour with Migos which kicks off in July, and is called - rather wonderfully - The Aubrey and the Three Amigos tour.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Previously we’d only identified the simplest organic molecules containing a few carbon atoms, but even that was very intriguing.”The new discovery is the culmination of years of data gleaned by Cassini as it flew close by Saturn’s moons, collecting information as it went.Nasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of space130 Earth from the ISSFrom the International Space Station, Expedition 42 Flight Engineer Terry W.

reports, the committee said the government must learn from the lessons of the past 10 years and commit to tough new regulations and strict enforcement.CCC chairman Lord Deben said housing and car companies “should be ashamed of themselves”, and accused construction companies of “cheating” their customers by not providing effective insulation for homes.The report noted the absence of the Department for Transport’s long-awaited strategy to deal with car emissions, and Lord Deben said the government needed to “get on with it”.“People need to get a sense of urgency, not just because climate change won’t wait, but because the less urgent you are the more expensive it will be to do the things we are going to have to do anyway,” he said.The committee also called for an end to “chopping and changing” of policies that have caused confusion and led to the demise of successful green measures like onshore wind power.\u0026nbspUnless action is taken, the UK will not meet either the fourth or fifth carbon budgets the government has set in order to reduce overall emissions by 80 per cent by 2050.“This is a really strongly worded warning and a wake-up call to the government to say they need to take swift action to get back on course and meet their climate obligations,” said Green co-leader Caroline Lucas.Legal \u0026amp General right to tell big companies to act on climate change Scotland \u0027not doing enough\u0027 to fight climate change despite new targetWorst-case climate change scenario could be more extreme than thought“The government seems to be very good at setting targets and very bad at actually ever meeting any of them”The nation’s carbon emissions are down 43 per cent compared to the 1990 levels the climate change act is based on, and the economy has grown significantly over that period.However, nearly all of this progress has come from the country’s shift to wind, solar and other forms of renewable energy.While the committee welcomed the government’s clean growth strategy, which was supposed to bring together every sector to tackle climate change, there have been no policies announced to implement it.“Today’s report shows how the Tories are failing to meet our climate change commitments and how they have made little to no progress in the six months since the last report,” said Dr Alan Whitehead, Labour\u0027s shadow minister for energy and climate change.“Just this week they scrapped support for Swansea Bay tidal lagoon whilst supporting a third runway at Heathrow which shows how empty their green rhetoric is.”Paul Morozzo, clean air campaigner at Greenpeace, said: “This government can’t live up to its claims to climate leadership as long as it backs and new Heathrow runway and stalls action on cleaning up our road transport.”Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said the industry recognised that more needs to be done, but they have “some of the most challenging carbon dioxide reduction targets of any sector and a record of delivering on them”.“We need a strategy with realistic ambition levels that supports industry’s efforts, allows manufacturers time to invest, innovate and sell competitively, and which provides the right incentives to take the consumer with us.”Though the CCC declined to judge how sensible a new runway at Heathrow would be, they noted there would not be room for any more aviation growth if there is any chance of meeting emission targets.“It is for the government to decide whether it wants to use up the elbow room it has got by having a new Heathrow runway,” said Lord Deben.He noted that if the plans go ahead the expansion will drain virtually all the “generous” amount of carbon emissions that are allowed in the emissions framework.It will also require other sectors to make even greater reductions in their emissions to make up for the uptick from planes.Emission cuts from aviation and other sectors will need to be even greater if the government commits to the stricter targets suggested by the Paris climate agreement, and the CCC said preparations must be made for this possibility.A government spokesperson said the UK has proven itself to be a “world leader” in tackling climate change since the introduction of the climate change act.“As the CCC has recognised, we’ve made huge progress in cleaning up the power and waste sectors and through our ambitious clean growth strategy we’re confident of cutting emissions across the wider economy to meet our carbon budgets while seizing the economic opportunities of clean growth,” they said.Committee on Climate ChangeEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

‘crypto-communists’\u0026nbspand ‘fellow travellers’ –\u0026nbspa revelation that has given rise to a peculiar revisionism of his legacyClick to followThe Independent OnlineGeorge Orwell’s cooperation with the government’s Information Research Department has led to some on the hard left branding him a ‘reactionary snitch’To many, he came close to being a secular saint.George Orwell, born 115 years ago on Monday, was the writer who challenged the iniquities of imperialism and capitalism, who took a bullet in the throat fighting fascism, and who taught a Western audience about the horrors of Stalinist communism.That he died young, of tuberculosis at the age of 46, in 1950, served only to enhance his posthumous reputation.\u0026nbspHe became, in the words of one astute critic, “the James Dean of the Cold War,\u0026nbspthe John F\u0026nbspKennedy of English letters”.Death may also have saved him from curdling into the kind of bitter, contrarian conservatism that seems to have been the fate awaiting many a one-time youthful socialist.Instead, Orwell is often remembered as a man of “genius”, the “greatest political writer of the 20th\u0026nbspcentury”.The commonly accepted view of the man is encapsulated in the aims of the foundation bearing his name.\u0026nbspThrough the coveted Orwell Prize, the Orwell Foundation seeks “to celebrate honest writing and reporting, to uncover hidden lives, to confront uncomfortable truths, to promote Orwell’s values of integrity, decency and fidelity to truth”.And yet there is one blemish – or complication – in the reputation of St George.It lay hidden until 1996 when Foreign Office file FO 111189 was made public under the 30-year rule.The hitherto secret file revealed that in 1949 the great writer had, via his friend Celia Kirwan, given a semi-secret government propaganda unit called the Information Research Department\u0026nbsp(IRD) what became known as “Orwell’s List”.Orwell effectively handed over to the British authorities the names of 38 public figures whom he thought should be treated with suspicion as secret communists or “fellow travellers” who sympathised with the aims of Stalin’s Russia.When the existence of Orwell’s List was revealed in 1996, and when the Foreign Office finally ulged who was on it in 2003, the initial reactions seemed tinged with sadness and hedged about with qualifications.But the internet was young then.Now it has grown into a giant bristling with social media channels and anger\u0026nbspswift to judge, slow to reflect.And so George Orwell, a hero to so many, is now demonised online as a “fake socialist”, a “reactionary snitch”, a traitor, a McCarthyite “weasel”.“Orwell’s List is a term that should be known by anyone who claims to be a person of the left,” declares one fairly widely circulated condemnation.\u0026nbsp“At the end of his life, he was an outright counter-revolutionary snitch, spying on leftists on behalf of the imperialist British government.”“He was an anti-socialist,” asserts another indictment, “corresponding with British secret services and keeping a blacklist of writers.”So widespread has the vilification become,\u0026nbspthat “Orwell as snitch”\u0026nbspis sometimes played with – not entirely seriously – as an internet meme.“I can’t get very worked up about the list,” he says mildly.\u0026nbsp“I don’t see it particularly as a mistake. \u0026nbsp“You just have to see it in the context of the time.”And that context, reveals Taylor, was explained to him by the left wing former Labour leader Michael Foot.Taylor recalls: “Foot told me that the great difficulty if you were a left wing Labour MP in the 1940s was working out exactly where your friends stood.\u0026nbspYou didn’t know whether some were listening to you and agreeing, and then going straight to the British Communist Party’s headquarters in King Street and telling them everything.”“Another example of the kind of thing they were facing,” says Taylor, “was the man who worked in the Foreign Office in the room next to Orwell’s IRD friend Celia.\u0026nbspHis name was Guy Burgess.“There were at least a dozen elected parliamentarians taking their orders from a foreign country,” adds Taylor.\u0026nbsp“What could be more traitorous than that?”Years after Orwell listed him as giving the “strong impression of being some kind of Russian agent”, the Mitrokhin Archive of KGB documents revealed that journalist Peter Smollett had indeed been a Russian agent.Driberg, who was\u0026nbspnamed on Orwell’s List as well as the KGB papers (Getty)Also listed by Orwell, and as a KGB agent by Mitrokhin, was the leading Labour MP Tom Driberg.Laying aside the irony that Michael Foot was himself once falsely accused of being a KGB agent, it is, then, perhaps no coincidence that the IRD was in fact set up, not by a headbanging Tory, but by Labour foreign secretary Ernest Bevin.“This was at a time when the Soviet Union was swallowing up what had previously been independent East European states,” says Taylor. “The IRD was producing reasoned expositions, pamphlet literature, telling people on the ground in Eastern Europe why they should resist this kind of stuff. \u0026nbsp“But a lot of British people were still seduced by the idea of our ally ‘good old Uncle Joe Stalin’, when in fact the bloke was a mass murdering psychopath.\u0026nbspAnd you were also dealing with some really hardline ideologues.“So Orwell’s idea was, if you are going to get somebody to write these kinds of pamphlets, they have to be genuine democrats.“He was a democratic socialist who wanted democratic socialists, not right wingers, to be writing this propaganda.\u0026nbspBut he wanted them to be people who had seen through the Soviet illusion, not covert stooges for Stalin’s Russia.”And so Taylor’s anger – such as it is – is reserved, not for Orwell, but for those like the late Labour MP Gerald Kaufman, who greeted the revelation of the list with the “pathetic” remark: “Orwell was a Big Brother too”.“This wasn’t Orwell denouncing anybody,” says Taylor.\u0026nbsp“He wasn’t writing public articles in the press saying ‘these people are evil’.It should perhaps be noted that Celia Kirwan was a bit more than just a friend.\u0026nbspThree years earlier, Orwell had actually proposed marriage to her in the emotional turmoil that followed the death of his first wife Eileen.Kirwan rebuffed his advances, but some have suggested that Orwell, aware of his failing health, might have been seeking the comfort of a beautiful woman when\u0026nbspon 6 April 1949\u0026nbsphe wrote offering to name those who “should not be trusted as propagandists”. \u0026nbspHe certainly knew the list was not for Kirwan’s eyes only.\u0026nbspAs noted by Timothy Garton Ash, the historian who persuaded the Foreign Office to reveal the document in 2003, Orwell sent his list to Kirwan with a reference to “your friends” who would read it.And as Garton Ash also noted, the IRD did not confine itself to relatively innocuous pamphleteering.In the New York Review of Books article that formed the first detailed analysis of the list’s contents, Garton Ash wrote: “By the late 1950s, IRD had a reputation as ‘the dirty tricks department’ of the Foreign Office, indulging in character assassination, false telegrams, putting itching powder on lavatory seats\u0026nbspand other such Cold War pranks”.When he sent his list to Celia Kirwan in 1949, Orwell might not have known that this was the IRD’s direction of travel, but of all people, the author of 1984, who envisaged the Ministry of Truth, should surely have been aware of the possibility.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspThat said, as Garton Ash also wrote, not much seemed to have happened to the people on Orwell’s List (apart from missing out on the IRD pamphlet-writing gig).\u0026nbspIt seems their names weren’t even passed to MI5 or MI6.In America, Hollywood actors blacklisted during the McCarthy era\u0026nbsphad their careers and lives ruined.\u0026nbspIn England, Michael Redgrave appeared on Orwell’s List in 1949 and starred in the film adaptation of Orwell’s novel 1984 seven years later.Peter Smollett, named by Orwell as a likely Russian agent, got an OBE.2017 isn’t ‘1984’ – it’s stranger than Orwell imaginedREAR WINDOW: COLD WAR:The British Ministry of PropagandaBig Brother with a high moral senseIn other words, what happened to those on Orwell’s List seems to have borne no comparison to the fate of Big Brother’s fictional victims or the real millions who died in the purges and repression ordered by Stalin.What if Orwell had given the government a list of closet Nazis, he wondered.\u0026nbsp“Would anyone be objecting?”And in truth, there does seem a certain asymmetry in the online articles of denunciation.Indeed it is hard not to sense the inspiration of Private Eye’s (fictional) veteran class warrior Dave Spart in some of the articles condemning Orwell as “a social democratic traitor collaborating with the capitalist state against revolutionaries trying to create socialism.”“Sure, the USSR did a lot of objectionable things,” says one writer.\u0026nbsp“But … Western imperialist countries commit much more heinous crimes throughout the world every day.”Which is one way to gloss over the Gulag.The 15 best opening

It’s likely that thousands of tribespeople in what is now Scotland (mainly from the Caledonian and Maeatae tribal confederations) were killed.The Romans claimed that the native chieftains had reneged on a peace agreement – and were therefore rebels, not just ordinary enemies. It is likely that the sacred bronze hand was ritually buried by one of the Roman commanders who had taken part in the conflict.Rome’s indignation (feigned or real), over the natives reneging on the peace agreement, was particularly acute because the 50,000 strong invasion had been led by none other than the reigning emperor himself – an ex-general called Septimius Severus. His personal political credibility was therefore very much at stake. The war, associated with the newly discovered bronze “hand of god”, was therefore a particularly bitter one.To evoke the anger apparently felt by the Romans, a famous Roman writer of the time, Cassius Dio, when writing his account of the conflict, put a particularly bloodcurdling speech (borrowed from the Iliad – the epic ancient Greek tale of the Trojan War, traditionally ascribed to Homer) into the mouth of the Emperor.In Dio’s account, the borrowed speech instructs the Roman army to annihilate the Scottish tribes. “We are not going to leave a single one of them alive, down to the babies in their mothers’ wombs – not even they must live. The whole people must be wiped out of existence, with none to shed a tear for them, leaving no trace.”Ancient Roman tablets discovered in LondonExceptional presevation of wood owing to the wet ground of the lost Walbrook riverExcavating a Roman building where many tablets were disocveredArchaeologist with a tablet just discovered at the Bloomberg siteRoman barrel found nearby.

His bronze hand was often mounted on the top of a pole\u0026nbsp– and used to bless or sanctify his followers during religious rituals inside his temples.Dolichenus, before conservation (Vindolanda Trust)It had been deposited in a small bog almost certainly as part of a religious ritual to mark the completion of a temple dedicated to the god just 15m\u0026nbspaway.The cult must have been particularly important to the regiment based at Vindolanda or its commander – because the temple was very unusually built inside the fort. It is the only example of such a phenomenon known from anywhere in the Roman empire.The regiment based there was a Gaulish (French) originating unit of auxiliary infantry and cavalry – known as the fourth\u0026nbspcohort of Gauls.\u0026nbspIts commanding officer, a wealthy upper-class Roman called Sulpicius Pudens (potentially the one in post when the temple was constructed and the bronze hand deposited) appears to have been a particularly devoted follower of the cult. He personally funded one of the two main altars inside the Vindolanda Fort temple and another altar (probably also associated with Jupiter Dolichenus) at a nearby sulphur spring.The unique decision (possibly by Sulpicius Pudens himself) to build the temple inside the fort and the associated ritual deposition of the god’s bronze hand – both immediately following the end of the largest military combat operation ever to take place in Britain – was almost certainly not a coincidence.Vindolanda Trust)As probable thanksgivings for survival and victory, they represent additional evidence of the epic and almost certainly particularly brutal nature of the military campaign.Roman military operations varied considerably in terms of their treatment of rebel and other populations.Occasionally, they were particularly brutal and more rarely downright genocidal. The most lethal campaigns in Roman history included the siege and complete destruction of Carthage (146 BC) in which 200,000 people died, the mass crucifixion of 6,000 captured slaves at the end of Spartacus’ war (71 BC), Julius Caesar ‘s massacre of the Rhineland tribes (55 BC) in which up to 400,000 were killed, the Jewish revolt of 70 AD\u0026nbspin which hundreds of thousands died (including thousands of prisoners who were crucified) and the second Jewish revolt of 132-135 AD\u0026nbspin which up to 600,000 died.The campaign in Scotland was unusually massive, emperor-led and probably very aggressive and brutal – but no credible figures on casualties on either side have survived and may indeed never even have been aggregated and recorded.Certainly, just prior to the main huge invasion, the Romans switched tactics from paying diplomatic bribes and sweeteners to Scotland’s tribes to carrying out overt military actions. Some of the diplomatic bribes – hoards of Roman silver coins – are on show at the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh.Vindolanda. It features a portrait of the Roman emperor Septimius Severus – the man who ordered and led the invasion (Vindolanda Trust)Archaeological evidence (the locations of diplomatic gifts of silver coinage pre-and post invasion) also suggests that the war permanently altered the geopolitical tribal balance – so it is therefore likely that specific tribal groups were at least politically (and possibly physically) neutralised from the regions geopolitical equations.“It was almost certainly one of the most brutal military campaigns ever fought on British soil. It’s likely that future archaeological investigations over the coming years will reveal the full horror of this long-forgotten conflict,” said archaeologist and historian Dr Simon Elliott, author of a new book on the war,\u0026nbspSeptimius Severus in Scotland: the Northern Campaigns of the First Hammer of the Scots.Fascinatingly and ironically, it is likely that the Roman invasion of Scotland which was meant to solve military and political problems (and partially succeeded in doing so for several decades) destabilised and destroyed the Scottish geopolitical status quo and ultimately helped lead to the rise of the Picts who in the end constituted a much greater threat to Roman Britain and ultimately helped destroy it. Although the invasion and its consequences occurred more than 1500 years ago, they demonstrate how military actions that may appear logical at the time often end up having longer term implications that the politicians (in this case a Roman emperor) had not envisaged or prepared for.Why ancient Roman vineyards are reopening in eastern GaliciaRoman mosaics ruined in botched restoration jobTourists caught carving initials onto walls of ancient Roman Colosseum before taking a selfieIn this case, Septimius Severus\u0026nbspdied before the conflict had been fully resolved – and his sons, who succeeded him, had absolutely no interest in Britain and quickly returned to the fraught political rather than military fray in Rome (the elder son murdering his younger brother just 11 months after their father’s death).“The discovery of Jupiter Dolichenus’ bronze hand, deposited as a thanksgiving offering, demonstrates just how serious the conflict was and how relieved the Roman soldiers were that it had ended,” says\u0026nbspDr Andrew Birley, director of the Vindolanda excavations.“It is further evidence illustrating how deeply religious they were and how seriously they took their relationship with their god,” he says.The bronze hand will be on permanent display at Vindolanda Museum as from today.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

British diplomats familiar with preparations for the summit were cagey about whether the PM would be watching the game with the other leaders.The UK Government has promised to come up with a workable plan for the Northern Ireland border part-way through next month after the EU said the previous one would not work. Ms May’s Cabinet is ided on the issue and is expected to retire to Chequers for a lock-in debate on the subject.Ahead of Thursday’s summit, one senior EU official said: “I’m afraid that when it comes to key elements, including on the withdrawal agreement, that is the Irish backstop, frankly speaking there is no progress. It is a reason to express concern.“We would also encourage our colleagues in the UK that they work on their vision on the future framework of EU-UK relationship.”A leaked draft of the summit’s conclusions suggests EU leaders may fire a warning shot over the PM’s bow and pledge to step up preparations for a no deal Brexit.While Ms May is expected to update leaders over dinner, EU officials were emphatic that there would be no debate, in keeping with the bloc’s policy of the European Commission’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier being the only point of contact for the UK.Brexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

It\u0027s about ensuring that we have a partnership that works for us and I believe a partnership that works for us will work for the EU as well.Theresa May has arrived in Brussels and she spoke to reporters on her way into the summit.\u0026nbspThe PM praised the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons result\u0026nbspas an example of strong cooperation between the EU and the UK.\u0026nbspOn Brexit, she said: I look forward to talking with\u0026nbspfellow leaders about\u0026nbspthe very good progress we\u0027ve made on the withdrawal agreement and looking forward to securing our strong future partnership which I believe is in the interests of the EU and the UK.\u0026nbspI think both sides are keen to continue that work at a faster pace than we have done up until now, and certainly we would welcome that.\u0026nbspAsked about her cabinet disagreements on Brexit, Ms May said: We have been setting out throughout these negotiations, our position and of course at every stage, last December and in March, we have come to agreement with the EU\u0026nbspon the issues that we had discussed and agreed we would be talking about.\u0026nbspShe said there would be a white paper setting out more detail on the future partnership after the cabinet away day to Chequers next week.\u0026nbspThe PM added: That is a partnership which I believe is not just about the interests of the UK, it\u0027s about the wider interests of the European Union as well.\u0026nbspThat\u0027s why I\u0027m confident we can sit down and discuss that at pace and ensure that we can achieve what we want, which is that continuing partnership with the European Union on economic and security matters.Key Brexit legislation appears stuck in a logjam as the government failed to confirm the dates for two vital bills to return to parliament, Labour said.Commons leader Andrea Leadsom did not confirm when the Trade Bill and the Taxation (Cross-border) Trade Bill -\u0026nbspalso referred to as the Customs Bill\u0026nbsp- will come before MPs as she updated them on future business.Minister may\u0026nbspsuffer further defeats when the trade legislation returns to the House for further scrutiny, particularly with Tory MPs threatening to rebel over seeking a customs union with the EU post-Brexit.Pressed for detail by shadow commons leader Valerie Vaz, Ms Leadsom\u0026nbspsaid: She asks about the legislative programme and she claims there is no progress being made.What I can say to her again, as I often do, is 36 very important Bills have been produced so far this session.That is absolutely in line with other parliamentary sessions. Nineteen Bills have already been sent for royal assent, hundreds of statutory instruments have been passed by each House and seven draft Bills have been published.Jack Straw has responded\u0026nbspto a parliamentary committee report that found it was beyond doubt\u0026nbspUK intelligence agencies knew the US had mistreated\u0026nbspterror suspects.\u0026nbspThe former foreign secretary said:\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspAlthough I was formally responsible for both SIS and GCHQ during my period as Foreign Secretary (June 2001 to May 2006) I have today learnt much about the activities and the approach of these agencies of which I was not aware before.He insisted he had\u0026nbsp consistently sought to ensure that the United Kingdom did act in accordance with its long-stated policies, and international norms and added:I made repeated representations about the British detainees in Guantanamo Bay, which in the end were successful in securing their release.Many lessons, including about the operation of the agencies and their relationship with ministers and their officials have since been learnt there are more which should follow this report.\u0026nbspAlmost 200 women have had to declare they are rape victims to qualify for additional child tax credits since a controversial welfare reform was introduced, MPs have heard.The SNP\u0027s Neil Gray\u0026nbspsaid the benefit changes\u0026nbsphad a devastating impact on women, as he urged ministers to review the abhorrent and disgusting policy.Mr Gray, speaking during Women and Equalities questions, said a report into the benefit reforms - which limit families to claiming tax credits for their first two children - showed that 190 women have been forced to declare they are rape survivors.One of the exemptions to the policy is the so-called rape clause, which requires women to prove a child was conceived through rape or during an abusive relationship to qualify for the benefit.He told MPs: Just this morning the government has published its report into the first year of the two-child policy restriction and rape clause to child tax credits, and, as we predicted, the impact on women has been devastating.Three thousand families denied and 190 women have had to declare the fact that they are survivors of rape in order to obtain support.How can this Government continue to defend this abhorrent and disgusting policy, and will they finally review it?Work and Pensions Minister Kit Malthouse said no-one needs to make a specific declaration.He replied: As I have said in the past, we keep all our policies under constant review, but I would just say to him that one of the fundamental tenets of welfare reform is that the world of welfare should reflect the world of work and that the people on welfare should have to take the same decisions as those that are in work, and that includes making decisions about the number of children that they may or may not have.He went on: At the moment no-one needs to make a specific declaration - we can signpost and assist with people getting the support they need in those circumstances and we are obviously very keen to hear from third-party organisations who have been working with those women who are subject to that appalling situation to make sure they get the support that they need.The St George\u0027s flag will fly over the Commons for England\u0027s next World Cup game.John Bercow told MPs: I am keen that the House shows its support for the team in the World Cup, as I would be if any of the other home nations were competing - as I hope they will be in 2022.I\u0027ve therefore decided that the Commons will indeed fly the St George\u0027s flag for the next England game, which will be on Monday July 2 or Tuesday July 3 - dependent on the outcome of today\u0027s match against Belgium.I know I speak for the whole House in wishing the Three Lions the best of luck tonight.Sketchwriter Tom Peck has looked at\u0026nbspLiz Truss\u0027 attacks on cabinet colleague Michael Gove, in the latest round of infighting in Ms May\u0027s top team.\u0026nbspIn a speech last night, Truss had planned to take all the piss out of Michael\u0026nbspGove, but at the last minute decided to leave some of the piss in.

ACOBA is not fit for purpose and there is no sign that the government is going to toughen up the rules any time soon.“The current system is toothless, lacking powers or the will to tackle non-compliance and corroding public trust in our democracy.”UK news in picturesThe full moon rises behind burning moorland as a large wildfire sweeps across the moors between Dovestones and Buckton Vale in Stalybridge, Greater Manchester on June 26.

Ministers and special advisers are able to take up jobs in the private sector lobbying on behalf of firms and sectors they used to be responsible for regulating and overseeing, and the culture of second jobs in Westminster is wholly incompatible with the role of Members of Parliament as representatives of their constituents.“We need a radical overhaul of the system to break open the cosy club of the British elite. Members of parliament and special advisers should not be profiting from the expertise built up whilst working in government and must concentrate on their jobs as public servants.”MPs are set to discuss the matter during\u0026nbspa debate on a motion tabled by Conservative, Labour and SNP backbenchers. It calls ACOBA an “ineffectual regulator which fails to inspire public confidence or respect”, saying there are “numerous gaps” in the organisation’s processes and claims\u0026nbspfailure to reform the body has\u0026nbsp“damaged public trust in politics and public institutions and led to repeated scandals”.It follows a report by the Commons Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee, which made a series of recommendations for changing how former ministers’ appointments are approved.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspOther appointments Labour raised concerns over include Michael Gove, now the environment secretary,\u0026nbsptaking a £150,000 job as a columnist at The Times shortly after he was sacked as justice secretary when Theresa May become prime minister in 2016.And it suggested ACOBA was wrong to approve former Northern Ireland secretary Owen Patterson’s role as president of a company he dealt with while a minister.Another of David Cameron’s\u0026nbspministers also took a job linked to their former ministerial brief after leaving office. Eric Pickles, the former communities and local government secretary, was appointed as a director of\u0026nbsprecycling and waste management company Leo Group, despite his ministerial role having given him influence over local council bin collections.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The public just want politicians to get on with delivering a clean Brexit.Blair would do well to respect the votes of 17.4 million people, rather than have the arrogance to believe their democratic wish should be overturned.NCTony Blair said the UK could negotiate a new membership deal with a reformed EUPeter Bone, another Tory MP, said: Tony Blair is on another planet. What he is saying is anti-democratic - he needs to understand that the people have spoken.People who keep talking about new negotiations for an improved membership deal need to remember that David Cameron tried that and didn\u0027t get very far.We had a referendum and we voted to come out.Mr Blair thinks that the elite like him know better than the British public but that is not how democracy works.The Prime Minister will be in Brussels tomorrow furthering the cause of Brexit and we now have an Act of Parliament ensuring we will come out.Blair will just not give up.

He should accept that he is partly responsible for Britain voting the way it did in 2016.Mr Blair is earning millions of pounds travelling the world and giving advice - but we\u0027re not paying and we won\u0027t be listening to him.Mr Blair\u0027s inflammatory remarks came in a speech at the Chatham House foreign affairs think tank in London yesterday.Leave-backing Tory MP Nigel EvansThe former prime minister suggested that Mrs May should start planning to delay the March 2019 deadline for Brexit as a result of the political deadlock over the kind of deal the UK wants with Europe.He argued there was still the chance for Britain and Europe to strike a bargain which could see the UK staying in.We should plan now for the possibility we need to extend the March 2019 deadline, he said.Presently, we are drifting towards March 2019 with no clear negotiating position, no resolution of the Northern Ireland question, still vaguely hoping Europe will allow us access to the single market without abiding by its rules which it will never do, and with senior Cabinet members openly debating the merits of a negotiating position which \u0027threatens\u0027 Europe with a no-deal Brexit.This is the equivalent of holding a negotiation on the top floor of a high-rise building and \u0027threatening\u0027 to jump out of the window if our demands are not met.The whole thing has become so protracted that it has numbed our outrage.Mr Blair acknowledged that supporters of globalisation were under pressure from outspoken political groupings on the Right and Left campaigning against free trade, open-door migration and international cooperation.Once it is clear the populism isn\u0027t working because, ultimately, it offers only expressions of anger and not effective answers, the populists may double down, alleging that failure is the result of half-heartedness and that only more of the same will work, he said.Who knows where the dynamic of that scenario takes us. Then the comparisons with the 1930s no longer seem far-fetched.He added: We are losing sight of the values which brought the West together, saw it through the menace of fascism and communism and, for all our justifiable grievances, have wrought immense progress.The whole thing has become so protracted that it has numbed our outrage, says Tony BlairThe former prime minister continued: Brexit has become a metaphor for the debate around globalisation.The only way out of the cul-de-sac of populism is to understand that the case for globalisation will not succeed unless we deal with the underlying grievances of that part of the population for whom globalisation holds more fear than hope.Europe and Britain could strike a bargain which would see Europe reforming, which the European people plainly by their votes are demanding, and Britain staying in such a Europe.For Europe as well as for Britain, this means dealing with the issue of immigration decisively.For all nations, it will require more active government intervention, helping people and communities \u0027left behind\u0027.The Conservative MP is known for his upper-class mannerisms and traditionalist views                    AFPGetty Images1 of 10In a BBC interview ahead of his speech yesterday, Mr Blair said it was a huge myth the he had allowed uncontrolled immigration while prime minister but conceded he would take a tougher approach to movement within the EU.It\u0027s true we were in favour of freedom of movement within the European Union, though again, if I was back in office today I would be arguing we apply those rules much more toughly, he told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme.Jacob Rees-Mogg, chairman of the European Reform Group of Brexit-supporting Tory backbenchers, said: \u0026ldquoIt would be a very expensive bargain, if we were foolish enough to listen to Mr Blair and re-join then we would lose our remaining rebate.\u0026ldquoThe other half he gave away for a phantasmagorical reform of the Common Agricultural Policy but he has always been better at husbanding his own resources than those of taxpayers."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/1/590x/may-980864.jpg","title":"brexit news date delay theresa may hilary benn brexit select committee EU summit","story":"The Brexit Committee warned that, even under the most optimistic scenario, there may not be enough time to complete all the necessary work by next March when the UK is scheduled to leave the EU.In a report, they repeated calls for an extension to the exit timetable if an agreement has not been finalised and called for the Government to secure a mechanism which would also allow for any transition period to be extended.The Brexit Committee also said it did not accept Britain would leave without a deal if the Commons rejected the agreement secured by Theresa May.Theresa May is coming under yet more pressure over Brexit                EU SUMMIT LIVE: FURY at May\u0027s Brexit inaction ahead of Brussels talks                \u0027It\u0027s make or break\u0026rsquo Merkel warns migrant crisis could DESTROY EUIt called for the Government to allow a second parliamentary vote on a renegotiated settlement and said MPs and peers must be able to have a say on how the Government proceeds.Mrs May saw off a threatened rebellion earlier this month that would have given MPs the chance to block a no-deal Brexit.Committee chairman Hilary Benn said: It is now more than two years since the referendum and the Government has yet to agree on the customs arrangements it wants with our biggest, nearest and most important trading partner.We are told that most of the work on the withdrawal agreement is done, but the remaining issues represent some of the toughest questions the Prime Minister must grasp, and negotiations on the future partnership have yet to start in earnest.PABrexit Committee chairman Hilary BennThe Brexit Committee said Parliament should have at least five days to debate the draft withdrawal agreement and the Speaker should be able to select a series of different amendments.Mr Benn said: Time is not on our side.

Here is the lowdown...The throne will pass to Prince Charles if the Queen abdicates, retires or dies – and according to reports, abdication could be a real possibility.Her Majesty is said to have told her inner circle that if she is still on the throne at the age of 95, she will ask for a piece of legislation to grant her eldest son full power to reign while she is alive.Royal commentator Robert Jobson told the Mail On Sunday he has spoken to a number of high-ranking courtiers who say preparations for the transition of the Crown are gaining pace.And at this years Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting, The Queen said she wished for Charles to succeed her as head of the group of countries.Next in line after Charles is eldest son Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, and then his children Prince George, Princess Charlotte and the new baby boy, Prince Louis.Prince Harry - who was third in line to the throne in 2013 - is now sixth in line.Following his wedding to Meghan Markle, any children that they produce would come after him in the line of succession.The rules of Royal succession have changed significantly in recent years.Leaders of 16 British Commonwealth countries (including Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Jamaica) voted in 2011 to alter the centuries-old tradition to include daughters as well as sons.Previously daughters could only inherit the throne if there were no living sons.This system, which dated back 300 years, is based on the rules of primogeniture which gives preference to the firstborn male heirs of a king or queen.This change in royal succession means Princess Charlotte, as William and Kates daughter, is ahead of her younger brother.Previously if the third child was male he would leap the princess in the line of succession.This new rule only takes into account children born after 2011, meaning Prince Edwards youngest child, James, born in 2007, is ahead of his older sister, Louise, born in 2003.Commonwealth leaders also decided in 2011 to remove the rule that no heir could assume the throne if he or she married a Roman Catholic.Then Prime Minister David Cameron said at the time: “The idea that a younger son should become monarch instead of an elder daughter, simply because he is a man just isn’t acceptable anymore.Nor does it make any sense that a potential monarch can marry someone of any faith other than Catholic.“The thinking behind these rules is wrong.The Roman Catholic rule can be traced to the 16th-century reign of Henry VIII.The King broke with the Roman Catholic Church to divorce his wife, Queen Catherine, and marry Anne Boleyn.The changes, under the Succession to the Crown Act 2013, came into force in March 2015 but apply to people born after October 28, 2011.Live Science reported that because one of the duties of the British monarch is to head the Church of England, no Roman Catholic can hold the crown.The basis for the succession was determined in the 17th century.When James II fled the country in 1688, Parliament held that he had abdicated the government and that the throne was vacant.The throne was then offered, not to Jamess young son, but to his daughter Mary and her husband William of Orange, as joint rulers, following the Glorious Revolution.At 69-years-old, Prince Charles is the longest-serving heir in UK history - having been first in line from the age of three - and would become the oldest ever British monarch to take the throne.Some royalists have argued that Prince Charles should step aside to allow Prince William to become King because he enjoys better approval ratings with the public based on a poll last year.Prince Charles has faced controversy over his divorce from Princess Diana and his affair during their marriage with wife Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall.He has also been accused of “meddling” in politics by stating his opinion on issues like the environment and farming, alternative medicine and architecture in private letters to Government ministers.In 1936, Edward VIII - the Queens uncle - famously abdicated after less than a year on the throne so he could marry divorcee Wallis Simpson.Prince Harry says no Royal wants to be King or Queen — but they would do it for “the greater good”.The 33-year-old said: “Is there any one of the Royal Family who wants to be king or queen?I don’t think so, but we will carry out our duties at the right time.”He told Newsweek magazine: “We are involved in modernising the British monarchy.We are not doing this for ourselves but for the greater good of the people.”And he insisted the Royals were still vital, adding: “We don’t want to dilute the magic.“The British public and the whole world need institutions like it.”The long-serving royal is stepping back from a public role after 65 years of Royal duties.His final solo engagement was The Captain General’s Parade in August 2017, when he saluted the Royal Marines at Buckingham Palace.Due to English common laws, he cannot become king.The wife of a king is known as a Queen Consort, and takes the title of Queen – although she doesn’t rule as the monarch.But if a female royal marries a man with a title below her own - as in the case of Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip - she will retain the title while her husband will not be entitled to it.He is known as Prince Consort.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Definitely, a real connection.”Who, of course, apart from Adam, who was going to be trouble from the moment he introduced himself as: “Not the serious man you see on Instagram.”A personal trainer unencumbered then by the flab of self-doubt who’s got a hint of the Blutos about him and flags up the moments he’s about to be cocky by ­saying: “Not being cocky but . . .”You can’t argue with the female ­reaction, though. Kendall, Megan, Rosie and Zara have all fallen for the swaggering great berk and Adam’s dumped all but the last of them with a smirk of self-satisfaction.As a way of endearing yourself to the core audience, it’s not good. As reality TV baddies go, however, he’s gold.It was inevitable then, I suppose, the fun police would also start taking an interest in him.Sure enough, there they were above the caption “Is Adam’s behaviour unacceptable?” on Thursday’s This Morning, where Katie Ghose, from Women’s Aid — who you’d hope had better stuff to do — was claiming: “Adam’s behaviour is a form of emotional abuse.”It didn’t take a genius to make the obvious point here. It took Towie’s Lauren Goodger, who said: “It’s just a TV show” and Adam’s merely taken the ­multiple dating rules at face value.So, if you have a genuine moral objection, take it up with ITV rather than feeding their publicity machine.Personally, I don’t. I have, though, had a nagging sense something was missing from this year’s run and it wasn’t until last week I worked out what it was either. The opposition.Big Brother, which is normally, head-to-head with Love Island, has disappeared and, I can almost guarantee, none of you have noticed or regretted its absence either.So not only has Love Island been funny, entertaining, immune to political correctness and proved a point, it’s removed the pox of Big Brother in the process.And if that isn’t public service broadcasting of the highest order and worthy of a plug, I dunno what is, frankly.The BBC failing to put Mark Lawrenson out of his obvious misery. Gary Lineker using apparently random World Cup trivia to draw attention to his goal-scoring exploits.The main BBC News actually doorstepping Lord Sugar over one stupid bladdy Tweet.This Morning’s Russell Grant spraying his astrological BS all over Love Island with the claim: “Rosie gave way to Adam too quickly ’cos of Mars in Venus and Venus and Leo.”And host Phillip Schofield failing to deliver the very obvious response: “Your head in Uranus.” TIME was, BBC comedy would make fun of Rick from The Young Ones, and all his ridiculous right-on pretensions.These days he’s running the show, in the guise of a man called Shane Allen who, not withstanding a thousand layers of state bureaucracy, has the easiest mission statement in television – make the viewers laugh.Apparently not, though. According to Shane, running BBC comedy these days is about finding “the diversity story”.Which sounds a bit like awarding the World Cup trophy to Switzerland, on the grounds of the squad’s ethnic mix.Except he doesn’t really mean diversity. It’s just those groups the BBC likes that Shane wants to employ, having made it abundantly clear “Oxbridge white blokes”, who’ve punched well above their weight, historically, are no longer required.So, at a stroke, you deny yourself any chance of finding talents and shows as brilliant, era-defining and clever as Sacha Baron Cohen (Ali G/Borat), Pete and Dud, Python, Fawlty Towers, Jimmy Carr, Fry \u0026amp Laurie, The Goodies and Not The Nine O’Clock News, while still very much lumbering us with the likes of Mel \u0026amp Sue, Famalam and Tittybangbang.For the privilege of institutionalising this failure and replacing an imagined prejudice with a very real one, I’ve also just learned we pay the BBC’s Head of Comedy £208,000 a year.Laugh?I didn’t.The Chase USA, Brooke Burns: “What South American country comes first alphabetically?”Mark: “Zimbabwe.”The Chase Australia, Andrew O’Keefe: “Beginning with the letter J, what word means liquid extracted from fruit?”Carroll: “Glucose.”Andrew O’Keefe: “What sedimentary rock is an anagram of the word leash?”Karen: “Coal.”And Andrew O’Keefe: “Which wig-shaped New York building was ­constructed in 1902?”Hat: “Trump Tower.”No, but I like the way you’re thinking, Hat.NEXT up from BBC2’s department of really dumb ideas?You take two of the greatest and most original comic talents of the last 30 years, Bob Mortimer and Paul Whitehouse.And send them bloody fishing.A combination which, in terms of things I don’t want to watch, is right up there with Vic Reeves \u0026amp Harry Enfield restoring vintage cars and Mel \u0026amp Sue attempting stand-up comedy.Mind you, the point of Gone Fishing also seemed lost on Bob Mortimer, as he trudged off to a Norfolk lake, angling for tench and asking his new mate: “What do we hope to achieve by the end of this, Paul?”Long pause.“A bit of inner peace?”What’s in it for the viewers became less and less clear as the silent pauses became longer.To the extent that, if you were lucky, Gone Fishing may just have been television to fall asleep to.If you weren’t, the last thing you may ever have heard was Bob asking: “Anything, Paul?”“No. Nothing.”On the plus side, though, corpses will have missed the moment where the BBC suddenly abandoned the fishing trip and, genuinely (I’m not making this bit up) sent Bob and Paul to a local micro-brewery.The resulting p***-up, you might not be wholly surprised to learn, wasn’t particularly well organised.Lee Dixon: “It’s a must-win game and Germany need at least a draw.”Phil Neville: “Mexico thoroughly deserve their 1-0 victory at half time.”Pablo Zabaleta: “At 3-1 down Tunisia need a goal to equalise the game.”Jason Mohammad: “One of the impressive things about Germany, the whole tournament, they were just so German-like.” Compiled by Graham Wray.THIS week’s winner is Sir Reg Holdsworth, in a wig, and Sir Reg Dwight (Elton), in a wig.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And, indeed, free trade is what most people thought they were ­voting for in the 2016 referendum.Free trade, cunningly styled “no deal” by pro-Remain spin doctors, has always been the best option, but has become even more attractive, now that the intransigence and arrogance of EU ­negotiators has become clear.Fair play, Theresa May and David Davis — you gave the negotiations with the EU your best shot but it’s now time to take the road to freedom.Carping critics say they could have done better, but the public instinctively knows that you’ve tried hard and that it takes two to tango.So, let’s be bold and scrap all tariffs on Brexit day, March 29, 2019.It will immediately boost living ­standards, by reducing prices, and will be especially beneficial for the less well-off. Juncker will cry into his claret at the new, competitive UK.Even companies such as BMW and Airbus, which urged us to join the euro and asked their workers to vote Remain, will benefit.Their engines, and other components imported from the EU, would continue to be free of tariffs. However, ­components from outside the EU would also become tariff-free, which is not usually the case today. Not only that, but their workers would be better off too, which is a plus for any business.And instead of sending £39billion into Brussels’ unaudited coffers, let’s invest the money here.Dividing it equally among our 650 MPs would allow each one to spend £60million in their constituency, on local projects. If MPs don’t like that suggestion, the £39billion could instead be used to reduce taxes or government debt. Our democratically elected Parliament can debate the best approach and decide.Most of us understand Chancellor Philip Hammond’s dogged attempts to get public expenditure under control, after the trauma of the credit crunch.But, it must make sense to invest this money in the UK, rather than the EU.Finally, free of Juncker’s shackles, we can regain control of our fishing waters, boosting the morale and income of our beleaguered coastal communities.No longer will 60 per cent of fish in UK waters be landed by EU boats.The public, too, has its role to play now. Project Fear, promoted by the CBI, the Financial Times and big businesses, has tried to frighten us with threats of gridlocked Channel ports and lorry parks across Kent when we leave the EU.Few believe them, but let’s call their bluff. UK consumers and businesses should now start to favour and prefer non-EU and British products wherever possible, dramatically reducing pressure on those ports.Wetherspoon has started by swapping champagne for UK and Aussie sparkling wine, and German wheat beer for the English and Welsh equivalent.As a result of this tactic, the public is benefitting from equal or better quality and lower prices. And there are a large number of other EU products that can be replaced in all pubs and supermarkets in the next year or two.The public instinctively understands the benefits of world trade, so let’s make buying non-EU a national goal for the next few years.It’s tough on our excellent EU ­suppliers, of course, but that’s the price the continent is paying, unfortunately, for a failing and undemocratic system, with unelected apparatchiks like Juncker and Barnier in charge.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Should any new information come to light, this will be explored.”Olivier said the woman - who has chosen to remain anonymous - was screaming “why me?” after she was shoved into the path of the bus.About 15 minutes after the incident, the jogger came back the other way across the bridge.The victim tried to speak to him but he did not acknowledge her and carried on running towards the north side of the river.Responding to the news the notorious Putney Pusher had walked free, Olivier, 45 — commended at the UK Bus Awards for his life-saving reactions — told the Sun: “I think the police have done all they can do, but it’s sad he will not be caught.“He should hand himself in. He needs to face up to what he’s done. What made him do what he did?”Colin Sutton, a retired detective chief inspector who solved some of the Mets most notorious crimes, said little could be done with limited money and resources.He said: “Something that high profile and potentially as dangerous as this, ten years ago, would have had a different level of attention.Roy Ramm, a former Scotland Yard commander, added: “Somebody will know who this jogger is and perhaps one or two years down the line circumstances might change and they will come forward, but that’s the only remaining possibility that this case will be solved.”- The woman was pushed into the path of an oncoming bus by the jogger in Putney Bridge on May 5 last year – yet the politan Police only launched an appeal for information regarding the identity of the middle-aged man THREE MONTHS after the incident.- In August, two 41-year-old men were arrested in connection with the investigation but were both released without charge. One of the men, millionaire banker Eric Bellquist, hit out at cops for implicating him in the “abhorrent” crime when he was 5,000 miles away in California.- He was forced into hiding and was under the protection of ex-SAS veterans after becoming a figure of hate when he was implicated in the crime.- A third man, aged 49, was arrested in Aberdeen in October but was also released with no further action.Do YOU know who the Putney Pusher is?

And for the sake of society, it is absolutely right that this twisted soul was sentenced to life and should remain behind bars for decades.But the truth is that Kouider is not your average female inmate. In fact, she’s almost one of a kind.In the age of “equality”, it’s not fashionable to say that men and women are ­different. But when it comes to ­criminality, there can be no argument.Women make up a ­vanishingly small minority of those in the criminal justice system, representing less than five per cent — and in all but the most exceptional of ­circumstances, the crimes that get them incarcerated are, to put it plainly, petty.In 2016, more women were sent to prison to serve a sentence for theft than for violence against the person, robbery, sexual offences, fraud, drugs and ­motoring offences combined — and 80 per cent of those locked up for theft were shoplifters.In the past decade, the number of ­community sentences for women has fallen by nearly half. In 2016 alone, 8,447 women were put behind bars, depriving around 20,000 children of their mothers.These children will now be shunted around family members or placed in care, eating up even more limited resources than the £36,000 it costs to imprison someone for a year.And they will be stigmatised, probably for life, through no fault of their own. Whatever the macho “tough on crime” politicians say, it is plain that nothing is achieved by locking up women for minor offences.If we want to avoid pouring more of taxpayers’ hard-earned cash down the black hole of the broken prison ­system, we need to stop lumping ­vulnerable women in with violent men and start confronting the complex ­reasons behind their rare appearances in the ­justice system.Research shows that women in prison have often been victims of much more serious offences than the ones they are accused of committing.More than half report having experienced emotional, physical or sexual abuse as a child compared to under a third of men behind bars — and 57 per cent report having been ­victims of domestic violence.Depressingly, because many women fear disclosing abuse, both figures are likely to be an underestimate.The abusers, it would seem, are also the ones pushing their female partners into a life of crime.Nearly half of women in prison (48 per cent) questioned for the Surveying ­Prisoner Crime Reduction survey reported having ­committed offences to support someone else’s drug use, ­compared to just 22 per cent of men.Manipulated, under-educated and all but broken, these women suddenly ­surface in the criminal justice system, ­desperate for the help which would enable them to put their lives back on track.But instead of offering it, we treat them just the same as the low-lives who ground them down in the first place.And it’s creating a cycle of crime.Overall, 48 per cent of women leaving prison are reconvicted within one year.For those serving sentences of less than 12 months, the reconviction rate rises to 61 per cent.This statistic is hardly surprising when you bear in mind that many women lose everything as a result of imprisonment, and 60 per cent of them don’t have homes to go to on release.Without accommodation, it is much harder to get a job or training ­placement, or arrange benefits or care for children so, understandably, they turn back to petty crime.Women like Kouider must always be locked away and no one is suggesting for one moment that serious crimes should go unpunished. But when you have nearly half of all women in jail to support the drug use of someone else and nearly half having attempted suicide at some point in their lifetime — a figure more than seven times higher than that of the general population — it would very much suggest that ­incarceration is not the wisest response.And at last, the Government is latching on. Justice Secretary David Gauke has now abandoned plans for five community prisons for women in England and Wales. Instead, the Ministry of Justice will trial five residential centres to help offenders with issues such as finding work and drug rehabilitation.It may be a small step — vulnerable men are still at risk of falling through the net and Gauke must address that, too — but it’s in the right direction.If we are to stop our shuddering prison system from imploding entirely, we must start by separating the victims from the criminals.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Here, and across the globe. Pourquoi? (That means “why” and is usually accompanied by a shrug and slightly hysterical hand gestures.)Fewer and fewer British kids are learning French in school. The number studying this absurd language has dropped by 30,000 in the past seven years. Instead, our children are learning languages which might actually prove to be useful later on in life.French is useful only if you visit France — and even then they’ll pretend not to understand you.Oh, and a small bunch of arid and desolate African countries which — trust me on this — you are never going to visit. Unless you want a dose of the Ebola virus or your head chopped off. French does not make the top ten of languages spoken worldwide.It only just crawls into the top 20 — between Marathi and Korean, since you asked. Marathi is spoken by some people in India. Not a huge amount of people, frankly. Nice people though, I’m sure.The Africans have learned the utter uselessness of French.In the past few years two countries from that continent have ditched French as the second language and replaced it with — of course — English. That’s Rwanda and Gabon. The switch has proved very popular indeed. More countries are set to follow suit.Do you know where else they don’t speak French any more? France. Well, in French universities. Science subjects such as physics and maths are taught in English.This is because foreign students coming to France don’t want to have to encumber themselves by learning a new language which will be of less use to them later than Swahili or Gaelic.This has been too long in coming. Right now, more and more British schools are switching to Spanish.This makes sense because while 437million people in the world speak Spanish as a first language — i.e. Spain, Central and most of South America — only about 75million speak French.That’s France, half of Belgium and about nine people in Switzerland.But never mind Spanish, important though it is. Foreign languages are too often neglected by British students.And yet we need them to compete in the world. English is the international language of commerce and culture, sure.I would make it compulsory for kids to learn Mandarin from the age of five. And as a second choice, Spanish — which we’re getting good at — or Arabic.Hell, we could do with knowing what that lot are up to. Our security services have struggled because too few English people have any knowledge of Arabic.And how about Russian?We need a bit of a revolution in the way we teach foreign languages here.For too long we have glided by thinking we need to learn nothing. Just a verse or two of Frere Jacques, that’ll do.But the world is changing and our schools need to change with it.Right now they are beginning to do so, but too slowly.Get the kids learning stuff which will help them compete in the world. And shove French in the trash can of history.Ding dang dong, indeed.THE wags seem to have had a nice night out in St Petersburg.Good for them.I do miss Abbey Clancy from the line-up, though.I suppose it would be a bit much to put Peter Crouch up front just so we got a chance to see her again.JUST as the England team looks like it’s going places and everyone’s happy, there’s a beer shortage.This is because of a national shortage of carbon dioxide.How the hell can we have a shortage of THAT?Your average human breathes out almost three pounds of the stuff every day.This is a national crisis and I think I have the answer.We need to get some people who are of no other use to the world to sit in vast vats of flat lager, belching continuously.Diane Abbott, for example.Humans involved in strenuous exercise exhale even more CO2 – maybe 12 pounds a day. So, Diane, on a treadmill, in a vast vat of lager, belching continuously. Yum.SO, the adolescent, unemployable liberal scumbags are still trying to get Donald Trump’s visit to the UK cancelled.Lefties who cannot bear to hear people express different views to their own will be staging infantile protests across London.There are even plans to have a giant blimp of the US president flying across the capital.A typically nasty and childish little prank by people who cannot abide democracy.And who do not care that the US is our major ally – and especially important once we have left the European Union.The protests are being supported by such organisations as ActionAid, which calls itself a charity.Make sure you never give those people any of your money.And one more thing, you protestors. You think Trump is only in power for four years? Think again. He will win again.Just as other populists are winning elections across Europe.The liberals have lost the argument and they are losing at the polls.NOTHING has given me as much pleasure during the World Cup as watching that fat, cheating coke-head Diego Maradona being hauled out of his seat, drunk out of his skull and incapable of standing.Hand of God – yeah. And the septum of Danniella Westbrook.The only downside was that the Argies won their game against Nigeria, undeservedly. They now face France in the next round.Argentina versus France. Like deciding who you want to win in a fist fight between Jeremy Corbyn and Nick Clegg. You kind of hope they’ll annihilate each other and no team goes through.It’s been a great World Cup so far, and very well run by the Russians. Best teams? Croatia, certainly.

No-one could possibly think that’s right.“Those who have served our nation deserve our support and protection in their twilight years.So, I am therefore pleased to announce that DFID is designing a bespoke program for Commonwealth veterans living below the poverty line.“We’re working with the veterans’ charities to ensure that those who have given so much are looked after to ensure they can live in dignity… It is a win for the developing world and is a win for the UK on an issue the public care passionately about: the welfare of veterans.”Ms Mordaunt will also set out how British aid money will better prepare Caribbean nations for the hurricane season this year.Britain was barred from using its £14billion aid budget to help the British overseas territories destroyed by Hurricane Irma last year due to bizarre international rules that deemed the nations too wealthy to receive aid.But the UK Government forced a change in the rules, set by the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

known as Lola - tries several times seeks to kiss a young girl.Her nervous mother is seen clutching her tight before the beast is pulled away with his bare hands by world famous lion whisperer Oleg Zubkov, 50, owner of the park.The lioness also sought to cuddle a young woman who moved away as Zubkov - in a green shirt - pulled her off.The untethered animal - rescued two years ago from being put down by a private zoo in Russia - was reportedly “purring like a cat” although this is something lions are supposed not to be able to do.Two other unchained male lions are nearby as the video was shot.The astonishing scene is from the Taigan Safari Park in Crimea, annexed by Russia from Ukraine in 2014.Zubkov allows visitors to mix with big cats in scenes that defy normal health and safety rules and would be forbidden elsewhere.“If a giant lioness jumps into your arms while you drive around Safari park, and purrs like a cat, then you can be sure that this is Lola from Chelyabinsk,” said Safari park director Tatiana Aleksagina.“Life in the park has transformed her into one of the kindest wild animals we’ve seen.“She just gave birth to her first cub, a lioness we called Lilu, and she loves coming to say hello to tourists.“In fact, she is so passionate in jumping into safari bus with kisses and hugs that many tourists can’t handle it.They can’t believe that all Lola wants to do is kiss and hug.”Yet when she arrived at the park after being neglected at the zoo which was poised to put her down - because they couldn’t afford to feed her - she was hostile to people.But she was tamed by Zubkov, who insists his animals will not harm tourists and that they are safe if accompanying him.The lioness was rescued by Karen Dallakyan, a vet and animal shelter owner in Chelyabinsk.“Lola was in horrible condition after being fed with too much cheap cooked meals like porridge,” he said.“A huge tummy didn’t let her jump, and her joints ached from carrying extra weight.“She had to go through a strict diet and in a matter of weeks she started to move around and jump, like any young animal is supposed to do.“We knew from the start that Lola could not stay with us, as our open air shelter in Chelyabinsk was too cold for her.“We got in touch to lions shelters around the world in Mexico, Sochi and Crimea.“Taigan Safari Park was the first one to respond.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000195929468.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"missiles carriers jets waste of cash","story":"It is not important whether this latest story is true in detail, because the fundamentals have been plain for months: Britain’s defences are grossly underfunded, and the responsible minister is attempting to raise dust about it.Williamson is unlikely to secure a boost to match that promised to the NHS last week, for the good reason that nobody likes him, and the bad one that voters care hugely about health, scarcely at all about defence.If the mad idea of hypothecated taxes — money raised to fulfil explicit purposes — ever catches on, nurses will be ­driving Jaguars while generals ride bicycles.As the last of the generation that fought the Second World War dies off, and those who remember the Cold War qualify for pensions, younger British people display little interest in the Armed Forces, save to add colour to royal weddings.They would need a lot of convincing that any war is worth fighting, anywhere.Money spent on defence quickly adds up to eye-watering sums.Threats changing at awesome speedPhilip Hammond, characteristically of a top-class accountant, during his tenure as Defence Secretary achieved miracles in concealing from the nation the desperate financial plight of the Armed Forces, while making little attempt to remedy it.Sir Michael Fallon, his ­successor, subjected senior ­officers to a reign of terror to prevent them from admitting any portion of the truth to ­Parliament or the media, but declined to extend his remit to intimidating the Queen’s ­enemies.Gavin Williamson has become the first Defence Secretary for decades with aspirations to use the post as a springboard to Downing Street. These are likely to go unfulfilled, because he flaunts them so crassly.Yet before acknowledging that the Armed Forces need more money, which they do, we should recognise how hard it is to configure Britain’s defence and security posture at a time when threats and the means to address them are changing at awesome speed.Countering terrorism in some ways represents the least ­difficult element, because it is the only peril the public really cares about.It is evident to all save ­disciples of Julian Assange that electronic surveillance through GCHQ, supported by the intelligence services, armed police and military special forces, deserves generous funding, which it nowadays receives.It is much more difficult to identify the appropriate tools with which to equip the Armed Forces to meet the strategic threats, of which Russia ­represents the most obvious.When President Putin favours hybrid warfare embracing covert special forces, fake news, cyber attacks and subversion, are tanks and infantry battalions the appropriate responses?When US backing for Nato is wavering and key nations such as Germany forswear a serious combat capability, alongside what allies can we hope to present a common front?These are big and hard ­questions.A couple of months ago at a round-table dinner, some of Britain’s top generals and ­strategic gurus held forth about the threats as they see them.Afterwards, the former Defence Secretary Michael Heseltine, who was among the guests, told me that he had been disappointed by the ­unoriginality of the ideas expressed.Here were the brightest and best in the war studies ­universe, he suggested, still thinking inside the parameters of the familiar, when much that is unfamiliar is evolving all around us.In planning for the future, Army commanders deserve sympathy, because they are compelled to observe ­constraints imposed by public sentimentality, to which ­ministers make obeisance.For instance, the chronically under-recruited Scottish regiments should be reduced, instead of having their ranks filled with Fijians (yes, really), but that is politically unthinkable.Nobody dares to axe a foot guards battalion, because the Guards Division remains a powerful trades union.The Gurkhas, whose infrastructure and dependants’ costs now make them uneconomic, cannot be touched because no minister will risk Joanna ­Lumley once more taking to the streets on their behalf. ­Politicians, in their own defence, are entitled to point out that the leaders of the Armed Forces are often poor judges of strategic planning.The admirals of two decades ago begged, fought and pleaded for the Navy’s two preposterous carriers, which I have compared to the Egyptian pyramids — huge consumers of resources for negligible practical utility.It was always obvious that the F-35 aircraft for which they were designed are properly unaffordable by modern Britain.Beyond being described by Americans as “the planes that ate the Pentagon” because of their fantastic cost, recent assessments show them ­performing poorly in the key ground attack role, as do the RAF’s Typhoons, conceived as high-altitude interceptors.Moreover, it was always plain that almost the entire Royal Navy’s residual strength will be required to escort the carriers on active service, while they are incapable of inshore operation.A strong government and Defence Secretary would mothball the behemoths in a display of courage such as was last shown by Denis Healey in 1968 when he decided to withdraw British forces from east of Suez.Forces need more of almost everythingThey would also scrap the Trident deterrent replacement, again a big willy gesture for a little willy nation, inappropriate to our diminished status in the world.I know almost no one whom I respect in the defence loop — military or civilian — who favours trying to sustain a nuclear capability on the ­Trident scale.More money must be found to recruit, train and exercise a credible Army.The only certainty about ­Britain’s defence needs is that more soldiers are wanted, to meet a range of future threats.Something much more serious than the fanatics of IS could well confront Britain in the coming decades.American military friends often remind me that Britain’s Armed Forces today command respect neither from friends nor foes.I remember General Sir Mike Jackson saying ­ruefully, as head of the Army 12 years ago: “Mass matters, and we don’t have it.”Our rulers may sometimes be forgiven for lying to us, but should never be forgiven for lying to themselves, as ­members of this Government do repeatedly.Bits of Britain’s Armed Forces are still superb, but it will not do for ministers merely to keep reciting the tired mantra about how terrific the SAS is.This is a niche force, no more capable of frightening Russia or China than the England cricket team.Gavin Williamson is dead right, that our Armed Forces need more of almost everything.Such a pity, then, that he himself has no more credibility at Westminster than an England cricket coach.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And this MP\u0027s refreshingly personal speech is certainly that. Danielle Rowley, Labour MP for Midlothian, today may have just become the first ever woman to talk about her period in the House of Commons chamber. It was part of a bid to highlight the poverty of girls who can\u0027t afford sanitary products, and are left so worried they miss school. Ms Rowley said: I would like to announce to you today, and to the House, and perhaps you\u0027ll excuse me for my lateness, that today I\u0027m on my period.  It\u0027s cost me this week, already, \u0026pound25. The average cost of a period in the UK over a year is \u0026pound500. Many women can\u0027t afford this. What is the minister doing to address period poverty? One in 10 girls in the UK cannot afford sanitary products, according to a study by UK Plan International.  Some go without sanitary products, while others risk their health by using socks or old dirty rags to stuff their underwear. Women\u0027s Minister Victoria Atkins highlighted the government\u0027s tampon tax fund, which helps period poverty charities using the equivalent of the 5% in VAT charged on sanitary products. After being congratulated for her speech, Ms Rowley - who buys sanitary products out of her own money to give to women who come to her office - tweeted light-heartedly: My cramps are pretty epic to be fair. The MP told the Mirror her speech was quite spontaneous but something I\u0027ve wanted to raise for a while.

The small canine was spotted apparently locked in the truck amid 27C temperatures outside the fast food restaurant on Monday.  In footage captured by a teenager, it could be seen looking upwards, with its mouth open, from inside the vehicle in Somerset. Gabrielle Dart, 17, who filmed the dog, noticed a horn repeatedly sounding while visiting the chain\u0027s Frome branch with her mum.  She raised the alarm and claims that the animal was left inside the truck for about 40 minutes in the heat, Somerset Live reports.   The teenager, who lives in Bruton, said: “We heard a car horn which kept going off and realised it was the dog honking the horn. “So I took some photos, got the manager and alerted them.” Gabrielle and the restaurant manager apparently decided to report the \u0027trapped\u0027 dog to the police, while hoping its owner quickly returned. They went indoors to call officers, but it is claimed that when the teenager next checked the car park, the truck with the dog had gone. Gabrielle posted about the incident on social media, alleging that an open crack had been left in the window of the vehicle.   She claimed on Facebook : “Hello everyone, can someone please tell me who owns this vehicle as they left there dog in there car for around 40mins in 27 degrees heat! (sic) This is unacceptable!   Do people not understand dogs are incapable of sweating. But people think this is okay because they left a crack in the window.”  Gabrielle said she believes the McDonald’s manager reported the incident to the police after she raised the alarm. Somerset Live contacted the Frome branch, but staff on duty yesterday were not aware of the incident two days earlier. Gabrielle’s photos and video of the dog come after several reports of dogs being left inside cars in the West Country.

But whether it’s a one-way road in London, roadworks in Birmingham or a newly-closed road in Newcastle, traffic has a funny way of surprising us – especially if your sat nav isn’t up to date.  A TomTom GO 6200 , \u0026pound270, (was \u0026pound339.99, save \u0026pound69) could be just the answer. Add real-time traffic information to the navigational benefits of a sat nav (smartphone required for this feature), and you\u0027re going to get home quickly, without getting lost and without being stuck in traffic while you listen to the match on the radio.  Don’t be left feeling flat   A rogue nail or piece of glass in the road is about as unwelcome as a power cut during a penalty shootout. These days a lot of cars don\u0027t have spare tyres in order to save weight and space so carry a can of Holts Tyreweld , above, to fix sudden problems.  Simply attach the can to your tyre valve and it pumps in clever liquid that can repair small punctures in an instant. You won\u0027t need to jack up the car and it\u0027s a tool-free process. Stay pumped  Not all flat tyres are caused by punctures. You might find that you\u0027ve returned to your car after an extended period and some of the pressure is missing from one or more wheels. You might be in a rush to get home in time for kick off, but you also know that properly inflated tyres are as important as a properly inflated football.

The rewards of getting your tyres to the right pressure are not just lower fuel consumption but better braking, too.  Keep in shape  What’s a less welcome sight than a red card?

After noticing what he thought was a stubborn pimple on his forehead, Colin Davies, 66, was diagnosed with an aggressive form of skin cancer .  Despite starting at the size of a grape, Colin\u0027s skin cancer \u0027spot\u0027 continued to grow and eventually took over his head - spreading to his neck, jaw, ear and right shoulder with the deadly cancer. Colin, from Hartlepool, County Durham, underwent 13-hour surgery to remove three large tumours, and had his left ear, ear canal, part of his lower jaw, neck and shoulder muscle removed.  He also needed part of his scalp removed and replaced with an acrylic plate and a skin graft from his leg, alongside rotating his scalp by 180 degrees and then underwent six weeks of intensive radiotherapy to eradicate the cancer. Colin is speaking out about his ordeal with the disease to encourage people to stay protected and out of the sun this summer. Thankfully the doting granddad is now cancer-free and looking forward to the future with his family. Pensioner Colin said: If the spot hadn\u0027t of been in the middle of my forehead, it could\u0027ve gone unnoticed and it probably would\u0027ve killed me. I\u0027ve had to battle with the cancer for over 25 years as almost every year another cancerous tumour develops, which has resulted in intensive surgery.  I\u0027ve had to have my body completely changed - I\u0027ve lost my ear, part of my jaw and my scalp has been completely stripped and given new skin. I only spent my younger years in the sun, but the skin cancer still ravaged me - which is why I am issuing this warning so people realise they\u0027re not invincible. Despite only having spent time in the sun when he would go on fishing trips as a child, Colin\u0027s skin cancer wasn\u0027t diagnosed until he was 41 years old. Now Colin will be spending his summer inside, as going outside in the sun could cause his cancer to return or his skin graft to burn through to the bone.  My doctor told me that he believes it was my years as a child going fishing in the sun that\u0027s caused the cancer, he said. I had continual checks on the spot for two years before I was diagnosed, but when it was tough, sore and itchy I knew that it was cancer. So that\u0027s when I went to the doctor and had the spot removed, but the cancer was growing fast and soon took over my entire head. As the cancer continued to move I had to have more of my body removed - including an amputation on my ear, which has now been replaced by a prosthetic, and part of my skull being replaced by an acrylic plate. After spending 25 years of my life in and out of hospital, getting the all clear and then the cancer coming back, I won\u0027t even risk going out in the sun now.

The man on the phone, who doesn’t realise he is leaving a voicemail, comments: “That will wind him up” and “That will f***ing rile him”.  The caller then starts joking with a colleague, talking about how the Green Cross Code Man was the voice of Darth Vader in Star Wars. Kirklees Council has denied the offensive comments were directed at James. However, James disagrees as he says he had told a manager in the department to email him during a previous call, as he cannot break off from his work to answer the phone. James said: “All I was complaining about was roadworks. Instead of an apology I got that. “I just wanted to know why they’d done them both at the same time as it seems pretty inconsiderate to residents, but receiving that voicemail took my frustration to the next level.” James said all he wanted from council chiefs now was an apology and an explanation to his two month old inquiry.  Karl Battersby, Strategic Director for Economy and Infrastructure said: “Unfortunately on this occasion the council failed to deliver the level of customer service that our residents deserve. “Prior to the phone call, the customer had contacted the council to report concerns over the number of roadworks undertaken by utility companies in the Cross Lane/Primrose Hill area. “The customer had requested a call back from the council and this didn’t take place. “When the call was passed through, an officer called back to get some more information. “When the call ended he failed to close the call correctly and conversations in the office were recorded.

Reservoirs dried up, water supply was cut off, schools shut and flames tore through mountains and forests. In the 1976 heatwave, camels even rode through Welsh reservoirs and children rode their bikes on empty river beds. For many people, memories of the drought that year centre around the water shortages caused by dried up reserves. But it was a summer holiday like no other for others, where public fountains became swimming pools and every day was spent at the beach.    This is the story of the summer when Wales ran dry, Wales Online reports.   For a year before the big drought temperatures started to rise. The winter before, the UK received less than half of its average rainfall, while at the start of 1976 there were months which saw no rain at all. By April alarm bells started to ring - particularly for Wales\u0027 biggest industry bosses whose factories used million upon million of gallons of water each day. Every day between June 23 to July 7 the temperature in Wales reached 32.2C, with five of those days going above 35C. The hottest day of all was July 3, with temperatures topping 35.9C. With no clouds in the sky, by July 14, 1976, it was time for action.  Taking the lead Welsh National Water Development Authority announced that 400,000 people would have their water supply cut off at night. It also ordered an end to washing cars and the watering of flower beds, tennis courts, bowling greens and golf courses. A week later, Dennis Bowden, the water authority\u0027s senior civil engineer, said the country could be facing a three-day working week. The situation is critical, he said. We are doing everything we can to avoid further cuts, but people are not saving enough and the reservoirs are very low. To help cut any frivolous use of water no shortage of advice was offered to the average Welsh family. The South Wales Echo ran a front page with the headline Water - here\u0027s how YOUR family can save 632 gallons in a week, with a picture of a young family next to a sea of buckets. Suggestions included taking showers instead of baths and watering the garden with dirty dishwater. At the time it became patriotic to have a dirty car, billions of ladybirds swarmed southern England and the only way to flush a toilet was with dirty dish-wash water.  Meanwhile, the South Glamorgan area health authority took a more unusual approach by urging people to use their imagination. It said: People should pretend they are camping or visiting relatives in some part of the country not directly connected to the main water system. The smell of effluent which can\u0027t be flushed away overnight might be awful, but unless there\u0027s a bug already in the house it won\u0027t make any difference to the health situation. By August the number of houses without water at night grew to up to one million, with residents warned it could last for a horrifying 12 weeks. Schools were shut due to health concerns, with no water flowing during the 17-hour cut off period. As the start of the month headlines from the time read like a quaint British comedy.  The drought brought about the advent of the midnight gardener, with families like the Willoughbys of Radyr spotted watering their beds in the dead of night. What they were doing was perfectly legal, taking advantage of a burst main in their road. Children spent every day outside, including those who used Lido in Briton Ferry, the nickname given to a feeder canal. Despite their advice South Glamorgan Health Authority also came under fire after sprayers were spotted in use on Glossop Terrace Maternity Hospital in Cardiff, in defiance of a hosepipe ban. The authority blamed maintenance contractors. Meanwhile, river bailiffs were kept busy by poachers who took advantage of low levels on the Wye to catch salmon left lethargic by a lack of oxygen. For business, however, it was no laughing matter. In Gwent a total of 70 companies were ordered to halve their water consumption, including coal mines and works owned by British Steel. Warnings of a vegetable famine dominated the headlines, while the National Farmers\u0027 Union described the heat as a dust bowl situation in Wales . The National Coal Board chipped in with some support in August, providing an additional three-quarters of a million gallons a day from an underground source at Llanover, near Blackwood. But it came too late for the BP Chemicals plant in Barry, where 1,800 people worked, which was forced to shut down operations after a 50% cut in supplies.

However, there is a risk of thunderstorms as the weather starts to break by the end of the weekend. Yesterday, temperatures peaked at 31.9C in Wales making it the hottest day of the year so far but that record could be beaten today. The high temperatures look set to continue as the Met Office warns that the mercury is still rising. A spokesman for the Met Office said: Over the next few days the high pressure will remain so there will be blue skies across the UK and that will last certainly into the weekend.  Wednesday was the hottest day of the year so far and Scotland’s hottest day for five years - Thursday could beat that once again. “There will be a warm start across much of Scotland and Northern Ireland. “Much of England and Wales as well, there is just some low cloud and mistiness flirting with these east coasts. “It is not a great deal and any low cloud in land will evaporate very quickly through the morning.  “The majority once again seeing a blue sky day.” We may see some thunderstorms on Sunday or Monday but nothing\u0027s certain. But we can expect these sorts of high temperatures to be reached certainly until Saturday. London will see highs on 29C on Friday, 27C on Saturday and 28C on Sunday.  Similar temperatures are forecast for Birmingham and Cardiff with highs of 27C. The bright sunshine means there are extremely high UV levels and people are being warned to wear sun cream. There is a risk of thunderstorms from Sunday caused by the hot, humid conditions with rain forecast in the South West, West England, Wales and parts of Scotland. But it is expected to remain sunny and dry in the south of England.  Aside from the potential thunderstorms there is no rain on the horizon which is bad news for those fighting the epic blaze at Saddleworth Moor in Manchester.

Cindie Allen-Stewart, from Texas, would slather herself in sunscreen only to find she was still getting burnt. She tried numerous methods to ease the pain and redness with no luck, until finally trying one her mother-in-law suggested - and now she swears by it. The home remedy treatment, which she has been using for the past 10 years and takes just minutes, involves shaving cream and she says \u0027works wonders\u0027.  In a Facebook post which has since gone viral, Cindie wrote: It takes the heat out of it fast and makes it more comfortable on you. First, buy some Menthol foam shaving cream. It has to be the foam and it has to have menthol in it. We found Gillette shaving cream on Amazon since we had problems finding menthol foam in stores. We ended up buying 6 cans of it, but it works out because we live in Texas and sunburns happen a lot. (Plus, we have given a couple cans to friends.) Next, apply the shaving cream on the burn. It may seem like it\u0027s a strange shaving ritual, but trust me! Don\u0027t rub it in, just let it sit on your skin. It will start bringing all that heat out (you\u0027ll be able to feel it). You may feel like you are itchy too, but that\u0027s a good thing! Itching means healing.  Cindie says after 30 minutes, the shaving cream should have dissolved into spots and feel dried out. You will feel as if you\u0027re becoming a little cold, she added. At least on the sunburned part of your body. THAT IS A GOOD SIGN! Next, rinse it off in a lukewarm or cool shower or bath. It\u0027s just to get the residue off. Finally, if you still need it, do it again the next day. Usually after that second treatment, the sunburn disappears. I use this on my kids too!  Cindie\u0027s mother-in-law learned the method from a doctor 40 years ago and thought it was crazy then too until she saw it in action. Stay-at-home mum Cindie has tried aloe vera in the past but finds the shaving cream works a lot better. She added: I\u0027m not saying to go out and do this, I was just showing my friends what I do. Please remember to always use sunscreen! Too much sun exposure can be dangerous and lead to cancer. By no means am I endorsing going out without sunscreen! I burn with sunscreen as well and know of the hassle, but it is worth it to wear it!

The little boy, Anthony Avalos, was found unresponsive at his home in Lancaster, California, last Wednesday and died the next day. His stepfather Kareem Leiva, 32, was arrested on Wednesday on suspicion of murder. Sheriff Jim McDonnell said in a press conference: I can tell you that what the investigators learned led them to believe they could file for charges of murder, which he is going to be booked on.  Levia will be on a \u0026pound1.5million ($2million) bond. Authorities revealed Anthony came out as gay to his family just weeks before his death. Brandon Nichols, deputy director of the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services told the Los Angeles Times that Anthony told his family that he liked boys before he died. DCFS director, Bobby Cagle told ABC 7 News that his department is investigating allegations that Anthony was abused because of his sexuality. He said: One of the things that we have heard is that there may have been a motivation on the part of the man in the household regarding to the sexuality of the child, and so we’re looking into that in a very deep way.  It was initially reported that Anthony had suffered severe head injuries and had cigarette burns all over his body but police now say this wasn\u0027t the case and that he died of abuse. McDonnell also said homophobia has not come up so far in their investigation. The other children found at the home are now in the care of the DCFS. Anthony\u0027s mother, Heather Barron, was also interviewed by investigators but has now been arrested or charged. Barron called 911 at 12.15pm on Wednesday and said her son was unresponsive. She also said his injuries came from a fall.

It\u0027s all part of giving them a well-rounded education.  However as one parent has recently discovered, art teachers should put a lot of consideration into the subjects they ask kids to paint - or face rather rude consequences.  The parent, going by the name jjustjjoseph, shared an amusing image in an online discussion forum showing a gallery wall of paintings by a class of children.  Each child had been asked to produce an image of candlelight - but the end result held a striking resemblance to something else entirely.  Dirty-minded commenters were quick to share their thoughts on the Reddit post , with many comparing the work to that of Georgia O\u0027Keeffe.  One said: Georgia O\u0027Keeffe would be proud. Another added: Haha! Got some regular Georgia O\u0027keeffe\u0027s here.  O\u0027Keeffe was an American artist, best known for her paintings of enlarged flowers - which some people also think look rather rude. Most Reddit users were merely entertained by the artwork. This is why I can\u0027t be a parent, I would laugh so hard I\u0027d be a spectacle and have to awkwardly try to dodge explaining what was so funny, one wrote. There\u0027s something oddly familiar about these paintings, said a second. Unsurprisingly there was also a lot of scepticism about the subject of the art. I think one of those kids knew exactly what they were doing, read one comment.

US forces are also assisting the operation as rescuers prepared to drill a shaft into the cave on the fifth day of the search. Major Buncha Duriyapan, commander of the 37th Military District in Chiang Rai, said workers would drill down from the top of the Tham Luang cave complex in northern Chiang Rai province to create an alternative entrance for rescue workers. We will drill down from one of the chimneys, Buncha told reporters on Thursday.  The expert divers went straight from the plane into the cave to make an assessment, he said, referring to the three British divers who landed in the country on Wednesday. Deputy Prime Minister Prawit Wongsuwan said 30 members of the United States Pacific Command (USPACOM) have joined the search operation with equipment to help penetrate the cave walls.

Rescue workers on Thursday scoured the top of the mountain looking for alternative entrances to the cave, according to a Reuters reporter at the scene. Thai National Deputy Police Chief Wirachai Songmetta said police officers would explore a one kms path to the right of the cave on Thursday.  So far, rescue teams have been focusing on a seven kilometre (four mile) long route to the left of the cave\u0027s entrance which they believe the boys and their coach took.

Natalya Nemchinova has denied she previously worked as a porn actress despite X-rated videos and photos of her being uncovered.  And a man some claim is her husband - despite his denial of any romantic relationship with her - has told how she has “cried her eyes out” at the reports. Sergey Roschupkin, 46, said the claims in Moscow were “tearing her apart”. He echoed her denial this week that she had made adult movies, despite apparently clear evidence to the contrary, but admitted she had been involved in explicit photoshoots. Roschupkin also said two years ago she was Russian Playboy’s playmate of the year.  The owner of a chain of fitness clubs where Nemchinova also works said: “Yes, she did work as a model. “She took part in some rather explicit photo-sessions, but you do know the difference between nude and porn, don’t you? “Some (of) our people do not distinguish striptease and prostitution. “In 2016 Natasha (Natalya) became the girl of the year in Playboy and it is a great achievement for her. “We should be proud of such beautiful girls. “She was not looking for any scandalous popularity, she was just attending sports events. “But her beauty was seen as an eyesore, and the bloggers rushed to search for dirty linen. “Natasha is in great stress, she has cried out her eyes because of all she has faced recently. “And they keep tearing her apart.” Natalya also once featured naked in a video for Russian Maxim.  Roschupkin today denied being her husband or lover, but a top celebrity news source contradicted this and claimed the pair are deliberately masking their relationship. He told Komsomolskaya Pravda (KP) newspaper that she was “like a family member to me”. Roschupkin also spoke of his admiration for her after she was caught “in the middle” of the notorious Battle of Marseilles hooligan outrage two years ago. He said: “For six years, she has covered the whole (of) Europe, following our national football team. “And she had such a tough experience when two years ago in Marseilles fans ruined everything at the Euro championships. “She happened to be in the middle of this horror. Hundreds of fans were throwing bottles, breaking shop windows, the police were shocked. “And even after that, this tender girl did not stop going to games.  He added: “I have known Natasha for so many years, she is like a family member for me. “You can’t stop admiring her, she is a fantastic girl. “Some papers write that she is my wife, others – my lover. But all is wrong. “I am not commenting on this, why should I? “It has no affect on my private life, so it’s ok.” But celebrity blog Varvara Info claimed: “Natalya Nemchinova is known not only in Russia but abroad. “She became famous because of acting in adult films. “There are many photographs online where Natalya Nemchinova is pictured in explicit poses and now this girl is the face of World Cup 2018. Everyone knows she is a porno actress. “Bloggers have already investigated it and found out that most likely her husband is the one who is pushing her towards publicity. “The man in the pictures is Natalya Nemchinova’s husband, called Sergey Roschupkin. “He owns the chain of Zebra fitness centres. “They are always together but Nemchinova and Roschupkin are hiding the fact of their relationship, because otherwise the owner of the fitness clubs will be banned in the homes of celebrities.” "},{"url":null,"title":"saudi tv presenter investigated over","story":"NewsSaudi female TV presenter is investigated for indecency after wind blows her robe openShireen al-Rifaie was reporting on the end of Saudi Arabia\u0027s ban on women driving when her abaya blew open, revealing a white top and trousers underneath\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsBySophie Evans09:08, 28 JUN 2018Updated09:16, 28 JUN 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA Saudi TV presenter whose robe was blown open by the wind during a report is being investigated over her \u0027indecent\u0027 clothing.  Shireen al-Rifaie was reporting on the end of Saudi Arabia\u0027s ban on women driving when her abaya - a loose-fitting robe - blew open.  As she spoke to the camera, the item moved to the side, revealing her clothing underneath including a white top and trousers. Moments later, Shireen was filmed touching her \u0027loose\u0027 headscarf.  Now, the TV anchor is being investigated by Saudi officials - with some critics claiming she was \u0027naked\u0027 in the report, according to the BBC .   The hashtag “naked woman driving in Riyadh” has been used online, although many Saudis have mocked hardliners over their claims. Shireen was accused of \u0027indecent\u0027 clothing after she was filmed wearing the \u0027loose\u0027 headscarf and open gown in the middle of a street. The presenter, of the Dubai-based Al Aan TV, denies any wrongdoing and told the news site Ajel that she was wearing “decent clothes”. Earlier this week, the kingdom’s General Authority for Audiovisual Media said it had opened an investigation into a video. It said the footage appeared to show a TV presenter in clothing which was indecent, in violation of regulations and instructions.    According to Ajel, Shireen left the kingdom amid the outrage. Earlier this year, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said that, in accordance with the laws, women must wear respectful attire. But he said they do not necessarily need to wear black head covers or abayas - with the decision entirely left for them to make.  He told CBS: The laws are very clear and stipulated in the laws of Sharia: that women wear decent, respectful clothing, like men.

Mihir Jain, 14, was addicted to fried food and his mum says he used to sit in bed all day eating. He lost the ability to walk properly and was house-bound, even having to drop out of school for a while. A doctor said he couldn\u0027t even open his eyes as he reached an extreme stage of obesity. Mihir\u0027s situation made him feel frustrated and angry, and his family decided something needed to change. He has now started to shed the pounds after having a gastric bypass in India, and he\u0027s thought to be one of the youngest people in the world to have had the procedure.  Mihir has already dropped to 27 stone (172kg), just two months after the operation at Max Hospital, in Delhi, northern India. The Marvel comics fan says he feels wonderful. He said: I used to get very angry and I was aggressive all the time, I had many problems. I couldn’t do normal every day things but I used to say to myself: don’t worry, you’ll do it some day. I used to tell myself to stay calm, you’ll get there some day. And I have reached that some day. Mihir weighed a normal 5lbs 5oz when he was born in November, 2003. But by the time he reached his fifth birthday he had already grown to a whopping 12 and a half stone (80kg). His mother, Puja Jain, 35, from Delhi, said: We first realised he had a problem when he was five and the doctor told us he was obese and needed surgery. But he was too young so he gave him some medicine. That medicine had side effects which meant he lost energy and he became weak on his legs. As the years passed he just used to sit in his bed all day, eating. So he just kept gaining and gaining more weight.  Even though Puja admits Mihir was always addicted to fried food she believes the medicine he was taking made him even more bed-bound than usual and consequently he gained even more weight. He dropped out of school and was home-tutored, while his younger sister Nandani, 13, carried on with life. Eventually Mihir lost touch with all his friends. His typical vegetarian high-carbohydrate diet was full fat milk, fried potato and vegetable cutlets, rice and vegetable curry, lots of potato, ice cream, milky coffee and fizzy drinks. Puja said: He was very angry sitting in one place all the time. Every child wants to go here and there and spend time with friends, he was sitting in one place all the time so he was very frustrated. It was hard for me watching other children playing outside and going to school and my child was not. I had one child going out and one not, it made me feel very sad and useless.  Eventually in 2013, Puja and her husband Rajesh, 37, went to see Dr Pradeep Chowbey at Max Hospital in Delhi, after her sister had successful bariatric surgery. I finally went to see the doctor in 2013 but Mihir was so big he couldn’t walk properly so I had to go without him, she recalled. The doctor said he needed to see him but we couldn’t get Mihir out of the house at the time. Finally, five years later, Mihir made it to see Dr Chowbey in December 2017. By that time he had reached an astounding 37 stone (237kg), with a height of 5ft 2ins (161cms), and suffered with diabetes, breathing issues and high blood pressure. The doctor assured Mihir he could help him but he had to lose a little bit of weight on his own first. Mihir was put on a high protein diet for three months and in April this year he had dropped to 197kg. He said: I was determined to do what the doctor suggested. And when I lost weight on my own it gave me the determination to keep going. I wasn’t even scared about surgery, I just wanted to do what was needed to get better.

She is a spirit medium full time.From her studio, Sacred Spirit in Carnoustie, she is able to give messages from those who have passed away to those who were closest to them.Karen has been able to connect to the spirit world her whole life but only began developing the skill about seven years ago.She said: “I really began my development seven years ago when I travelled down south to meet with Tony Stockwell.“He noticed straight away that I had the ability to be a great medium so he became my first teacher.“I then became a guest on the Scottish dates of his tour.“People think that you can either talk to the spirit or you can’t – and while not everyone has the ability to, if you can connect with the spirit world you need to develop your skills and gain understanding of what they are communicating to you.“For instance if a spirit shows me a sandcastle I know that means someone has been married in a castle. However, you need to work at it to be able to gain that understanding.”Whilst Karen appreciates there is now a greater understanding and interest in mediumship, there are people who see it as a “circus act”.Mediums are especially in the spotlight now as it is portrayed on a bigger platform with TV programmes dedicated to the skill.“There is such a big interest in this kind of work that it has become incredibly accessible with people even going live on social media, but I feel that takes away the personal aspect of it.“I try to give very personal details to people so they know I am telling the truth and I am reputable.“I have even been featured in magazines who have done “psychic under the spotlight” tests and gave me full marks for accuracy.“I feel incredibly lucky that I am able to do this job. I get really emotional but you can’t not get emotional!“I have ladies who sit opposite me in a state of grief and I feel anyone who comes to my events or for a one-to-one session is hurting or grieving and I am able to help those people. I am doing this to bring comfort to people and to help heal them and that is really important to me.“I wouldn’t change my ability at all, I love it.”As well as providing spiritual readings Karen also teaches mediumship to those who have the ability.She said: “I can instantly tell if someone is a medium or has the ability to be, I don’t know why, it’s just a connection.“I travel the world teaching mediums and also have regular students here in the studio. About 80% of those students are here because I have picked up that they have the ability.“I also do online teaching, so if anyone believes they could have the ability to reach the spirit world they should get in contact to develop their skill further.”Karen will be on stage at the Whitehall Theatre on Wednesday June 27.Tickets are priced at £16 and can be purchased from the box office.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b2cf8557f688-848x564.jpg ","title":"dundee people student jim 73 gets third degree","story":"\t\t\t\t\tStudents of all ages packed out City Square as the Caird Hall hosted the  University of Dundee’s graduation ceremonies.Among those receiving a degree was 73-year-old Dundonian Jim Ashwood, who picked up his MA(Hons) in American History.Lifelong learner Jim was born on Small’s Wynd, which now forms part of the university campus itself.He said he was “absolutely chuffed” to be picking up his third degree.Hilltown mum Fiona Dixon, 47, is one of the university’s first part-time students to graduate with honours after collecting her First Class MA in English and History.Fiona said: “It’s been a brilliant experience.

It is all about them.”When it comes to her job Christine is positive she wouldn’t want to work anywhere else.“It really makes my day when you see someone who has came in with low self confidence and after their skin peel or botox you can see how happy they are and how much confidence they have gained.“A lot of our clients have acne and after they have had their skin peel treatments you can just see the change in them, its amazing.

armstrong cash boost from celtic transfer to southampton","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United won’t get their Stuart Armstrong windfall straight away but that will not affect their summer signing programme.The Tangerines are in line to receive six figures from Celtic when Armstrong completes an expected £6 million switch to English Premier League outfit Southampton this week.It’s because of a sell-on clause from the deal when the Scottish international left Tannadice for Parkhead back at the end of January 2015.Once the £1m plus the Hoops paid for him then is deducted, the cash heading to Tannadice is likely to be between £400,000 and half a million.While that will be more than welcome as United prepare for another money-losing season in the Championship, with the player’s likely move to England coming out of the blue, it is not something they budgeted for.That means the further signings being planned will not be hit by the fact Celtic do not have to pay up straight away and, if they choose, could stagger the payments over two or three years.What the money could become is a nice extra for manager Csaba Laszlo if he makes moves in the transfer market during the January window.Right now he is looking to put the finishing touches to rebuilding a squad that’s already seen eight new first-team players fixed up.He remains in the market for another striker and a central defender, in particular.Potential target Callum Morris completed a moved to second-tier rivals Ross County at the weekend – along with former Tannadice team-mate Keith Watson.Morris was still on a list of possible signings but after securing stopper Frederic Frans earlier this month, a footballing defender is being sought.Former striker David Goodwillie could complete a move from Clyde to Premiership new boys Livingston this week if the clubs can agree a fee.United were aware of his likely availability during the close season but, given his off-field issues, there was no chance of him being handed a third spell at Tannadice.Monday saw the players start their first full week of pre-season training at their St Andrews base.They are due to see action for the first time tomorrow week in a friendly at Brechin and more games are set to be pencilled in.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/07/image.jpg@1.126288.jpg ","title":"dundee united to get six figure sum as stuart armstrong completes move from celtic to southampton","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United are now guaranteed a six-figure windfall after former star Stuart Armstrong signed for Southampton.The Scotland midfielder has penned a four-year deal after completing his £7 million switch from Celtic.Under the terms of his 2015 moved from Tannadice to Parkhead, the Tangerines are due a chunk of that fee.That’s likely to see them land somewhere between £400,000 and £500,00, though the details of over what period that money comes in will have to be thrashed out with the Hoops.Armstrong’s future at Celtic Park had been in doubt after negotiations over a new contract had stalled, leaving Brendan Rodgers to cash in with just a year to run on his current deal.He was part of the side that won the ‘double treble’ under Rodgers and won a total of eight major trophies during his time at the club.He scored 17 times in 2016-17 and forced his way into the Scotland setup but struggled to replicate that form last season after an injury.Armstrong is manager Mark Hughes’ first signing of the summer window after Southampton narrowly survived relegation from the top flight of English football, and the former Stoke boss was keen to add the Scot’s creativity to a squad that scored just 37 goals last season.Hughes said: “Stuart is a player who we have admired for some time, and I am delighted we have been able to bring him here, especially given the competition we faced to sign him.“We have strong players in the squad and it is important we build on that by adding different qualities.“It is important we add a greater goal threat to the team as a whole, and to our midfield specifically, and Stuart’s record of scoring and creating makes him an extremely exciting addition in that area.“He brings with him extensive experience of European football and has developed his game impressively over the past few seasons at a major club in Celtic, where there is a demand not only to perform but also to win. Stuart has done both during his time there.”Armstrong added: “Southampton seems a really good fit for me. Watching from afar, I really enjoy the attractive football that they play and I’m very happy to be here.“Every season, I put demands on myself to create and score goals. I hope going forwards from here that it will be the same this term at St Mary’s.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b32069b78095-490x564.jpg ","title":"football is a labour of love for refreshed dundee united coach craig easton","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAnyone who’s come across him down the years will testify enthusiasm has never been an issue with new Dundee United reserve team manager Craig Easton.As far back as when he was part of the youth system he’s now spearheading, Craig’s huge appetite for the game was always apparent.Even he, though, admits a spell out of the game a couple of years back was a perfect reminder of just how good life in football is.It came when financial problems at Torquay United forced him into an unexpected move back to Scotland and left him searching for work.Not content to sit around waiting for his next job, Eastie ended up working in the building trade and admits it was one of the best moves he’s ever made.“I was in England for 12 years and I didn’t even think of coming back up to Scotland to be honest,” he said.“But in football you can’t plan what’s going to happen, especially as a player and then, when I was coaching, I found things could change as well.“I was with Torquay working with the U/19s and college kids. It was my first real job in coaching and their academy was doing well but the club got relegated to the Conference and couldn’t afford to run their academy.“It’s a big outlay and, unfortunately, it folded and jobs went with it. I would have loved to have stayed, it was a great job and I had an excellent lifestyle.“The job wasn’t there so I came back up the road and there wasn’t much happening. I applied for jobs and I got close to a couple.“I ended up doing a bit of labouring and it was great, it was the best thing for me. I kept myself busy.“I was taking down cabins, near St Andrews funnily enough, and then building. I’d never had any experience of it but enjoyed it. Every day was different and the guys were brilliant. A lot of good people – I still keep in touch.“I always appreciated what I had as a footballer but sometimes you need to go out of it and get back in just to be reminded what you have.“So getting out for a bit was good, it got my appetite back without me realising I’d lost it. And just doing something different, seeing another side of life, meant I learned a lot.”His return to football came at Raith where an excellent record with the youths sparked interest from others.Determined to repay the faith Raith showed in him, he rebuffed the chance of a quick move but when United came calling he admits his affection for the place where his career started made it an offer he couldn’t refuse.“I enjoyed Raith, there were good people, a good club and it was tough to leave but I couldn’t turn this job down.“This is a big responsibility because United have produced some great players over the years. There’s a lot of good players come through and a lot of good people looked after the kids here, so there’s a lot to live up to. I was lucky to work with a lot of those people.”In recent years, the conveyor belt of young talent at Tannadice has slowed but Craig’s confident, along with assistant Scott Robertson, talent will flow.That’s in no small part because the mechanism required to produce players is still in place.“We know how important it is to keep bringing players through at this football club and there is talent here.“There is so much that goes on before us to get it to the stage where we take the players. It’s not about us, it’s about everything that goes before that to get them to the point where Scott and I take them.“Brian Grant (academy head) is on top of that and making it better all the time.

One thing I like about him as well is that he’s got a very good work ethic because we are not the kind of team who can let people stand about.“There are a lot of strikers who bang in goals but I am not sure whether they have the work ethic to be my kind of player.“Jean ticked that box for me, he’s got good English and has played in a few countries so I think he will settle easily.”Meanwhile, young Dundee midfielder Jesse Curran has signed up for another year at Dens Park.The 21-year-old Australian has been in talks over a new deal for some time.He made eight top team appearances last term and manager Neil McCann was keen to hang on to him.Along with striker Matty Henvey, who penned a similar contract at the beginning of this week, the Dark Blues are looking for Curran to push for more game time in the coming campaign.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b2a29a52ebfe-668x564.jpg ","title":"paralympian cyclist hannah thanks all who contributed to championship funds","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA Paralympic cyclist, who found her passion while studying in Dundee, has crowd-funded enough money to enable her to compete – and also a surplus to help other cyclists.Hannah Dines, 25, who has cerebral palsy, was recently chosen for the Paracycling Road World Championships.

I said ‘if you can do it, sign’.“It’s a really good club – even if it’s the rival of my team! I’d prefer if he signed for Dundee but it’s still a good club.“United have got a good goalkeeper in him. He’s massive, really tall and his English is perfect so that won’t be a problem.“He’s good on the ball and can pass well. Even under pressure you can pass him the ball and he can deal with it, he’s calm and experienced. He’s dominant in the box, too, and comes for crosses.“At Vaduz there were two goalkeepers and they switched all the time but I really enjoyed playing when Benjamin was in goal.”Konrad is considering offers from Holland and Germany but says he’d be happy to return to Scotland.“I would go back to Scotland, I really enjoyed my two years there, though I’ve not had any options there. If there was a good offer I would go back.“A year ago at Vaduz we were relegated and weren’t able to go back up last campaign.“We had a poor start to the season with basically a new team. You could compare it to Dundee United’s season in the Championship. There was one team that had a good start and just kept winning.“It was nice in Vaduz, a good place to play. I can’t compare it to Scotland, though.“The fans in Dundee were mad for football and the stadiums were great. I don’t know if the fans in Vaduz and Switzerland don’t like football much but it isn’t the No 1 sport and it was really calm in the stadiums.”That’s something he couldn’t say about derby days in Dundee – some of his best memories of his time at Dens Park.“I had the two best years of my career at Dundee.“The derby win after 10 or 11 years and beating them at home was great.“The first game at Celtic Park was also a good memory. It is a really famous stadium, even in Germany.“All the derby wins were really good experiences and I feel really proud to have been a part of those games.“I like the rivalry in Dundee. It’s not a nasty rivalry compared with some places in Germany, there’s no fighting, but a lot of banter and people have a bit of a laugh about it.“I still keep an eye on Dundee. Unfortunately there are not many players left from when I was there.“Maybe Gowser, Cammy and Craig Wighton. I still speak to Scott Bain and Nick Ross, too.”It was a mixed experience for Konrad working under manager Paul Hartley at Dens Park, however.“Paul Hartley was hard but fair, I would say.“He had his players, his top players who he would speak to all the time.“He wasn’t always easy, sometimes he would shout at me and Luka Tankulic for no reason but it was football, you live with that.\u0026#8220He played me 69 times in two years so I can’t complain.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7486028.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th\u0026nbspAcademy Awards."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7590066.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"11 things you d only hear in Glasgow","story":"                          There are some things you will only ever hear in Glasgow or Glesga, as us locals call it,\u0026nbspand this is our definitive list of the best."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7608211.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"cheeky-punter-caught-trying-to-get-served-at-beer-festival-using-little-britain-driving-licence","story":"                          A CHEEKY punter was caught trying to use this fake driving licence featuring the face of Little Britain\u0027s Andy Pipkin to get served booze at a beer festival."},{"url":null,"title":"astonishing-moment-six-year-old-produces-inch-perfect-strike-in-top-bin","story":"                          THIS is the astonishing moment a six-year-old produces an inch-perfect wonder strike while brushing up on her shooting skills in her back garden at home."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7883429.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"adorable-moment-young-boy-realises-animals-go-into-meat-and-turns-vegetarian","story":"                          THIS adorable video shows the moment a five-year-old boy realises that animals are turned into meat -

learning disabilities and autism.The health board faced a storm of criticism over its decision to withdraw a \u0026pound23,000 grant for the Highland One Stop Shop (HOSS) autism support service last year and it was subsequently criticised by autism expert Dr Sue Fletcher-Watson, of Edinburgh University\u0027s Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences, regarding an equality impact document that showed \"total ignorance\".Ms Johnstone says she is now keen to move on from the past, bringing a determinedly inclusive approach to her work.Acting as an advocate within the health service for autistic people and those with learning disabilities has already seen her challenging NHS colleagues drawing up policy in a range of areas to make sure their needs are properly considered.Beyond what is happening internally within the NHS she says she is also keen to reach out to partners in both the third sector and business.\"I think it is easy to say \u0027the NHS has to change\u0027 and there are things we have to change, absolutely, but there is also lots of things that have to change outside of the health service and the social care world,\" she said.Listing banks, bus companies, cafes and shopping centres as the kinds of private organisations she would like to talk to about boosting their autism-friendly credentials she added: \"I think it is crucial, because most people\u0027s quality of life is not about when they visit the GP it is when they go out with their pals socialising.\"A spokeswoman for Autism Rights Group Highland has given a cautious welcome to Ms Johnstone\u0027s

It will recover the costs later.In March it also ordered building owners with glazed canopies to check they had adequate inspection and maintenance arrangements in place.This followed incidents at both the Inverness and Inshes retail parks in 2017 and earlier this year where panels fell from their fixings, in one case resulting in a shopper having stitches to his head after being hit with broken glass.Mr Stewart said: \"Although councils can act if buildings are deemed dangerous and go on to recoup money from owners if they carry out work, there\u0027 more that can be done to bring in more preventative measures.\"Businesses are under severe pressure at the moment with rising city centre costs.

Grampian Motorbike Convention, which although won’t include the same speed aspect as before, will bring back the delegated machines being allowed to drive straight into the event – a format that was used previously and will excite veteran convention attendees.Other notable events include Big Stuff Rides on July 19, which involves large commercial vehicles offering trips around the outdoor circuit, Blue Light Rides on August 2, which includes a similar set-up but with emergency service vehicles and the ALLFORD 2018 celebration on August 19, which is an exhibition of a range of Ford vehicles.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"plans for new two storey mcdonalds drive thru in north east town approved","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA new two-storey McDonald’s drive-thru has been given the go-ahead.The Portlethen Retail Park will now see the fast food giant’s new premises built on part of the site.Asda had submitted plans to develop the supermarket with the addition of the McDonald’s, a new six-pump petrol station and click-and-collect lockers.Members of Aberdeenshire Council’s Kincardine and Mearns area committee discussed the proposals at Viewmount, in Stonehaven, yesterday.A McDonald’s spokeswoman had previously said the eatery would create 65 full and part-time jobs.Councillor Colin Pike had moved to accept officer recommendations of a delegated grant for the McDonald’s – meaning planning officials at Aberdeenshire Council have been given the power to officially sign-off finalised proposals subject to planning conditions being agreed.Portlethen and District Community Council had raised concerns about pedestrian safety at the site with an increase in people visiting.Mr Pike said: “I think it is important the concerns of the community council are addressed in any planning conditions.“What we have also seen is there hasn’t been any major objections from members of the public and I am happy to support the officer’s recommendation of a delegated grant.”Councillors Alison Evison and Ian Mollison also agreed with their North Kincardine colleague.Ms Evison said: “I believe we can address the issues of the community council via planning conditions and I think the report in front of us addresses those issues.”The project would mean removing 80 parking spaces at the Asda site.The area is currently served by a number of food establishments including Domino’s, Ashvale and Subway.Concerns had been raised by the nearby Matalan that the drive-thru would lead to an increase in litter and anti-social behaviour.An Asda spokesman said: “We’re delighted with the decision by the Kincardine and Mearns area committee and look forward to investing further in Portlethen.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"watch tutorial shows aberdeen

seven matches they played across the league and cup competitions, battling Torry didn’t manage a win. but Owen, 13, impressed with several good saves.He earned the praise of every opposing coach with his performances.Owen, whose shot-stopping is more admirable given he is now tending a full-sized goal, said: “We didn’t win a game, but we did always try to win.“We had good spirit in the team – sometimes there was arguing, but we did do well.“I look really small in the goals.“But when someone takes a shot if I save it, I save it, and if I don’t, I don’t – at least I’ve tried.“I sometimes pretend I’m going to one side so the striker shoots the other way.”When asked whether he’d been the hero for Torry, with his goalkeeping sometimes keeping the team in games, Owen was reluctant to call himself that, but admitted some people have said it.Either way, Owen will be the academy’s last recipient of the award – as next term Torry and Kincorth academies’ pupils will move into the new Lochside Academy.However, he plans to play for the school’s second-year team.Owen also plays for Dee Boys Club in the juvenile leagues and used to be a striker, before he realised his ability with the

to Robert Wakeham, writing in last week’s Advertiser, for his questions regarding the nesting colony and status of common gulls within the former oil depot, currently the Mid Argyll hub and museum construction site.I am happy to address these questions.Historically, this species was first named in the 1700s and thought by many to come from their association with grazing or ‘common land’ and in the more recent past the name ‘uncommon gull’ may be more apt.In the UK they are essentially restricted as a breeding species to Scotland where numbers continue to decline, with this being reflected in Argyll, principally due to predation by the American mink, as pointed out.Studies at the Lingerton landfill site have shown that, unlike the larger gull species at the tip, Common Gulls do not scavenge there, as was perhaps claimed, but use the tidal mud flats of Loch Gilp and surrounding fields to find invertebrates, fish and vegetarian foodstuffs. As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity. Their dedication enabled Cats Protection to help around 200,000 cats and kittens nationwide.Cats Protection is always on the lookout for new volunteers to join the UK’s biggest cat community. Though a large part of our work is helping cats, through fostering and rehoming, our volunteers have the opportunity to become involved with a range of interesting activities such as organising fundraising events, helping with publicity or managing funds and resources to benefit the greatest amount of cats.Volunteering can offer the chance to develop skills such as time management, interpersonal skills and teamwork, making CVs much more attractive and, of course, helping cats.Anyone who is interested in becoming a volunteer can go to our website www.cats.org.uk/get- involved/volunteering  to find out more.Julie Meredith, head of volunteering development, Cats Protection,Sir,I really love being active, especially the feeling after and that’s why I’m supporting Bowel Cancer UK and Beating Bowel Cancer’s latest fundraising campaign to get sponsored to do 30 minutes of physical activity for 30 days in June.Step up for 30 is a fantastic way for you to be more physically active to reduce your risk of bowel cancer – the UK’s second biggest cancer killer. This can be anything from yoga, walking in the sunshine (I walk everywhere) or taking your favourite class at the gym.While you’re getting fitter and feeling healthier, you’ll be raising money to fund the highest quality research and essential information and support services that will save lives from bowel cancer.Take on the challenge and sign up at bowelcanceruk.org.uk/stepupfor30.Gaby Roslin, TV and radio presenterPICS:The common gull has been seen nesting at the disused oil depot. no_a21Gleanergull01Gulls at the former Gleaner site. no_a21Gleanergull02\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week june 1 2018","story":"\t\tHannah O\u0027HanlonUpdated: 30/05/18, 11:35 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThere are certain moments that just simply enchant us.One such moment happened this week when we were holidaying in Dunkeld.Almost every day we visited the wildlife centre at the Loch of the Lowes and delighted in our times watching the osprey.From the webcam we could see every detail.We watched with great anticipation to see when the chicks would emerge from their eggs, of which there were three.One of the days we went to the centre there was great excitement as one of the eggs was about to hatch.The staff there are dedicated volunteers who love sharing their knowledge of these wonderful birds.To our total delight we witnessed the birth first-hand as the shell cracked open and out struggled a tiny little chick as the mother bird looked on anxiously.I could hardly believe that this tiny scrap of life would be strong enough to fly to Africa in just a few months.Shortly, the father bird arrived with a very large fish and I was amazed at the tenderness of this great strong bird as he gently fed his baby.Since then we have been \u0026#8216hooked\u0026#8217 as we follow this wee family at the beginning of their journey of life.Soon the chicks will be given flying and fishing lessons and will leave the safety of the nest.My prayer is that they will all safely complete their long journey to Africa and that they will come back next year to enchant people once again.When they go, sometime in September, I fear that I will suffer from \u0026#8217empty nest syndrome\u0026#8217 till they come back again next spring.Scripture tells us: \u0026#8216Seek information from the birds of the air.\u0026#8217\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 22","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 31/05/18, 11:50 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.CalMac management’s shocking handling of our ferry service is taking its toll on local businesses which depend on Islay’s growing tourist trade.We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.Also, I have been unimpressed with our roads department management’s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from residents and myself about the potholes across Islay.Councillor Alastair Redman, IslaySir,I\u0026#8217m inviting your readers to get their walking boots or trainers on for the Stroke Association and sign up to the summer marathon challenge, Walk Your Way.In April 2013, a year after my own stroke, I took on​ the London Marathon.

After a pit stop in the Royal Burgh it was on to Fort William, then Inverness and back home again- all to raise money for Cancer Research UK and Target Ovarian Cancer.Spokesperson for Breast Way Round, Laura White, said: ‘This year was full of fun, laughter, meeting new family members and although the daily miles are hard going, the weather and the beauty of the Scottish scenery made it that little bit easier.’As well as the sponsored trek, the bikers raised money in more traditional ways, such as bucket shaking (the men wearing bras) and hosting a raffle and auction in Caol Community Centre. The most coveted item, a patchwork quilt made by rider Cathy Anderson, went for a whopping £700.The annual trip was started in 2008 by Shirley-Ann McKnight as a last tour of Scotland for fellow biker and close friend, Alyson Porter, who was suffering from cancer. Sadly, Alyson never made it to her trip and now each year the journey is retraced in celebration of her life and all those affected by cancer.Since 2008, more than 600 riders have participated, each clad with a pink mohawk courtesy of Hairy-RS, and the team has raised £347,000 for Macmillan Cancer Support.

The pair were seeded car 30 in the two wheel drive section, run first on the day in a new schedule being piloted by the rally, the two wheel drive cars covering the stages before the four wheel drive cars followed in the afternoon.With the dry conditions in the weeks running up to the event dust would be the main problem for those running further down the field. Douglas attacked the first stage, Twiglees, and was catching the car in front when, unfortunately due to the dust being created by that car, came out of a 90 degree corner with zero visibility and connected heavily with a rock, damaging the suspension and forcing his early retirement.The car, and the driver, are noticeably quicker  each event they compete in and it\u0026#8217s only a matter of time before the results are there.The other Argyll car out on the stages was Ally Currie from Mull and Grant McNiven in the Ford Fiesta ST picking up 9th overall and 1st in Class 6.The next round of the Scottish Championship is Argyll Rally, based in Dunoon on June 23 \u0026#8211 the closest round for most Argyll rally enthusiasts and one not to be missed. The stages look absolutely breathtaking this year and well worth a watch.The Scottish Tarmac Rally Championship continues as well with round three being the Granite at Leuchars Stages hosted by Aberdeen and District Motor Club at the MOD base in Leuchars, Fife.Argyll was well represented both in the drivers seat and the co-drivers. All Argyll crew Willie and Steven Beattie were out in the newly finished and beautifully finished Escort MkII. They were absolutely flying and really getting to grips with the car when a sixth gear lock-up threw them into a spin and off the stage, clouting a fairly substantial fence post in the process.The navigators side now looks decidedly second hand, but nothing a few hours in the workshop won\u0026#8217t sort. A bent bottom suspension arm put paid to them re-joining but they will take the positives and the blistering pace into the next round for sure.Willie Beattie Snr in his equally exquisite Escort was also beginning to get the hang of the car, with some more seat time this year, not to mention experienced co-driver, Phil Sandham, pushing him on. He, after making sure his boys were okay when they didn\u0026#8217t show up at service after their spin, continued on to secure 12th overall and second in class: his first honours since building the car.The next round may see some family ties severely stretched, at least until the final results are announced.Ian Parker was also out in familiar machinery, co-driving for Fraser Smith in his Canal Garage-prepared Honda Civic. The pair were also making good progress up the class rankings until the diff decided to implode and finished their rally on Stage six.The drive of the day was not in question. Alan Kirkaldy led from start to finish despite some interesting issues in the first test. His door came loose after about a third of stage and he continued, holding the door shut by the open window whilst steering, changing gear and waving with the other.Astonishingly he still managed quickest stage time by five seconds. His co-driver for the day could forgive himself for being a little green about the gills after that.Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan was lucky enough to win the seat in a charity auction at the Annual STRC Dinner earlier in the year. An experience he is unlikely to forget in a hurry, although some of the memories may be a little bit blurry and perhaps just a little sideways. The top three were rounded out by Ian Forgan, ably guided round in his Subaru by his daughter in her first rally and the final position on the podium went to Ian and Allan Paterson, also in a Subaru.The next round is this weekend at Crail where the Beattie boys will be back out, Ian Parker swaps a Civic for an Escort MKII and Donald Bowness is set to get back out in the Nova.PICS:Photos: Gavin Brown, West Coast PhotosRed Escort (Car 1) Alan Kirkaldy/Eoghan Anderson (first overall) no_a24rally01\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"high tech preparation for mid argyll art show","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 14/06/18, 7:45 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThis year has seen a lot of preparatory work ahead of the 2018 Mid Argyll Art Society exhibition in August.The popular show will again be held in the Drill Hall, Lochgilphead and will run from August 6-11.As in the last few years, the Mid Argyll Camera Club will have photos on display.The society is harnessing modern technology in a campaign to raise the profile of this year\u0026#8217s event.There is now a Mid Argyll Art Society Facebook page that can be used to get updates on what is happening.There will shortly be a website giving details about the art society, its history, information on the exhibition and how to participate, and photos of past exhibits to give a flavour of what the event is like.A lot of work has been done on modernising the entry process. There will be the option of pre-registration for exhibits the automatic production of labelling for the paintings and photos instant printing of receipts and immediate production of a list of entries to guide visitors.As in past years, people who come to view the exhibition will have free entry, with the option of making a suitable donation to the funds of the society. There is also a small fee to be paid by each exhibitor for every painting or photo that is hung, and this goes to help to cover running expenses.With over 500 people having visited the exhibition in 2017, organisers hope this excellent support from the community will continue. Both professional and amateur artists in the area are encouraged to make use of the exhibition to display their work.The overriding aim of the exhibition, since its beginning in 1967, has always been to foster interest in locally-produced art and to give people from the community the opportunity to let others see, appreciate, and maybe buy their works.Organisers wish to thank the Army Cadet Force for permission to use their building.Details about how to enter exhibits will appear in adverts in the Argyllshire Advertiser, Facebook and on the exhibition website.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"a poignant prizegiving for tarbert afc","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 20/06/18, 6:08 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowTarbert AFC’s annual football dance was held on Saturday June 16 in the Islay Frigate Hotel.Players and their partners were joined by the wider circle of people who are involved with the club.This annual dinner dance is also the end of season awards presentation.Nikki MacDougall took home awards for Top Goal Scorer and Referees\u0026#8217 Player of the Year.

This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

Sheryl is a Lochgilphead woman \u0026#8211 middle-aged, celibate without choice and with plummeting self-confidence and a loathing for her body shape. Belly dancing appears to let Sheryl, and Kerrie, rediscover a love of their own body.\u0026#8216You’re using parts of your body, probably out of commission for a while, like the pelvis and it makes a part of the body, you’re maybe not keen on, sexy.\u0026#8217The female characters in the book get up to what loud ladies in a small town would enjoy gossip and drama.\u0026#8216There is an element of bitchiness about it, which I exaggerated in the book. Or maybe it was just me that was bitching.\u0026#8217But two books later in the series, Kerrie is changing direction. Her new book, Rebel Without A Clue, is a sci-fi dystopian novel about a male alien from a female-dominated planet landing in Glasgow.\u0026#8216There’s actually not a lot of sex in my books,\u0026#8217 says Kerrie. \u0026#8216Except maybe nobody having any.\u0026#8217The story starts out as a reversal of The Handmaid’s Tale, with women of this planet no longer needing men to reproduce and evolves, through a plot described as \u0026#8216mad\u0026#8217, into an outsiders perspective of Glasgow.\u0026#8216The male alien Legless goes down to earth and goes around fertilising all these women, and doesn’t understand this world where he’s in charge.\u0026#8216Most of the time I was the only woman living in a culture different from my own. I began to see stories in outsiders.\u0026#8217Being an Australian in Scotland \u0026#8211 and on top of that marrying into a Bangladeshi family \u0026#8211 would give that outlook, of everything being familiar but just off a little. The language is the same, with the accents different. The rural community is the same, only with less terrifying monsters to deal with in Argyll. This is the outlook Legless finds himself in as a dominated man in a world of dominant men.Such an off-the-wall plot with no clear message makes the book an ink blot test \u0026#8211 you take what you’re looking for from it. Maybe you even see something else with another look.Kerrie explained: \u0026#8216Originally I wanted it to be all humour. I suppose I’m driven about power and control and it’s really fascinating when you start to think about it because people dominate in quite small ways.\u0026#8217So maybe the point was to gain the women’s perspective for men to relate to?Kerrie is currently working on her fifth book, the sequel to her dystopian sci-fi named Rebel Without A Bra, and she will keep belly dancing around Lochgilphead.\u0026#8216At the beginning you just write, and you just open up your mind and stuff comes out and you’ll find that all this stuff comes out that you didn’t realise you were thinking about. It’s amazing. You actually discover so much about yourself.\u0026#8217Author and Ardrishaig resident Kerrie Noor entertained a library full of book lovers on Wednesday June 20.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"russell handed brexit role in new cabinet","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 28/06/18, 6:34 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowArgyll and Bute MSP Michael Russell is back in the Scottish Government Cabinet after a reshuffle earlier this week.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon appointed a new Cabinet in a series of moves which began on Monday June 26.Five new Cabinet Secretaries have been appointed, with the overall size of the Cabinet increasing to 12 to reflect the increasing impact of Brexit on Scottish Government business, and to ensure direct Cabinet oversight of the operational delivery of a new social security system.Michael Russell will have responsibility for Government Business and Constitutional Relations, overseeing the necessary preparations for the UK’s exit from the EU in a way that \u0026#8216protects Scotland’s interests\u0026#8217.The new appointments were put to parliament for approval on Thursday June 28.Unveiling the new Cabinet line-up, the First Minister said: \u0026#8216The new Cabinet I am announcing today brings fresh talent to the Scottish Government and ensures that we are fully equipped to meet the challenges and opportunities facing the country in the months and years ahead.\u0026#8217Another change with particular significance for Argyll and Bute is the departure of Humza Yousaf from the Transport brief, to be replaced by Michael Matheson, who will quickly need to get to grips with the unique transport infrastructure demands in  Argyll and Bute.Ms Sturgeon added: \u0026#8216People already have high trust in the Scottish Government to look after their interests, and I am determined that this new, refreshed Cabinet will continue to repay that trust.\u0026#8217PIC:Michael Russell MSP. 06_a18hustings_russell01\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12802034.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/swr_ayp_270318esther.jpg","title":"claims south ayrshire council poised","story":"NewsClaims that South Ayrshire Council poised to swoop on crumbling hotelCollapsing ceilings and water leakage have led to a further deterioration in the fabric of the Victorian pile.\u0026nbspShareBySarah Hilley11:31, 27 JUN 2018NewsAyr\u0027s Station Hotel (Image: ayrshire post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email The council is poised to swoop on the Station Hotel to undertake emergency repairs it is claimed.  Collapsing ceilings and water leakage have led to a further deterioration in the fabric of the Victorian pile.  Now it is understood South Ayrshire Council bosses want to step in before it is too late. It is believed a last minute paper may go before councillors at full council in County Buildings on Thursday. The paper would ask politicians to approve the repair work. The council slapped a Dangerous Building Notice on the hotel in March, which gave the owners 21 days to respond. There are fears Ayr train station could end up shut if no action is taken. And it has been slammed a risk to the public. The Post revealed earlier this month how the hotel has been bought by new Malaysian owners from Eng Huat Ung.  Station Hotel Action Group founder Esther Clark believes the hotel could be turned into a community centre and accomodation. She said it should be “split up and dispersed” but must generate an income. She has uncovered research, which reveals the hotel was built to a “high standard” with luxurious materials. One idea mooted by Ayr Renaissance is for a part of the building to be demolished and a new train station built. Others folk have called for the council to adopt the landmark for offices. It was hoped a big hotel group would step in and carry out refurbishment but it has failed to attract interest so far. Network Rail carried out scaffolding work on the building to safeguard the operation of the station and line in 2015. The hotel, a Grade 2 listed building, has remained shut since it closed suddenly in 2013. Glasgow and South-Western Railway Company built the hotel, designed in the style of a French chateau, at a cost of \u0026pound50,000.

It is the latest diversification at Corton Farm, just outside Ayr. Customers can buy a litre glass bottle for \u0026pound2 and use it again and again at the milk machine. And farmer Alison Kerr said: “You cannot get any fresher. “We’re really hoping it catches on so we can sell more and more directly to local people.” The Kerrs – five generations at Corton since 1925 – have constructed The Milk Hoose and the Milkbot vending machines providing “untampered, non-homogenised” milk from the Corton herd.  Customers on Friday gushed praise on the creamy taste, saying it is nothing like mass-produced products. The Kerrs are charging \u0026pound1.50 per litre and say it cuts out plastic waste from supermarket bottles. Although it is more expensive than supermarket pricing, they say their milk compares favourably to speciality gold top products. Willie and Alison, both 46, have been joined working the farm by son David,19, and are being helped by daughter Joanne,16, when she is not at Belmont Academy. Willie said: “It would be a dream to sell every litre we produce right here. “But we have had a great start and it has been so well received.” The farm produces between 5000 and 6000 litres of milk a day, depending on the time of year.  That is courtesy of the 220 Friesian-Holstein milkers. The Kerrs own 260 acres and rent another 250. Fourteen years ago they expanded into the Corton Plants nursery and 14 months ago the Coo Shed coffee shop. But Alison said: “The Milkbot really completes the story of selling your own product. “We siphon off what we need into churns to be pasteurised and it is put into the Milkbot. “I guarantee it tastes completely different as all the fats and proteins have not been stripped out. “It is non-homogenised and the cream settles on top like the the old-fashioned milk.” At the moment it is thought only three farms in Scotland are selling direct via a vending machine.  Alison added: “People now are so detached from where the food comes from and I think supermarkets are to blame for that. “Some kids think milk comes from a bottle in a supermarket. “Plastic has just become a huge issue and it has been good timing for us. “People are loving our branded glass bottles.” Peak time for the new vended milk is between 5pm and 7pm and there can be 20 cars in the car park at a time with people leaving work keen to top up their supply. Alison added: “Hopefully this continues to grow. Milk is sold too cheaply in supermarkets and farmers have been down-trodden for a long time. “We have just had to take what we can get and be paid sub-30p a litre. At the moment the Milkbot is doing a couple of hundred litres a day so we have a long way to go to reach 5000 a day.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12804773.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/emp_ayp_220618vanessa_03JPG.jpg","title":"hundreds pay tribute celebration vanessa","story":"NewsHundreds pay tribute at celebration of Vanessa Riddle\u0027s lifeAnd one glance around a packed Troon Town Hall said everything about the young woman Vanessa Riddle had become.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson16:31, 27 JUN 2018NewsVanessa Riddle\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailHundreds came to say goodbye on a day to celebrate a remarkable life. And one glance around a packed Troon Town Hall said everything about the young woman Vanessa Riddle had become. Her impact was deep, her reach was far. “Vanessa would wonder why everyone was here for her,” said dad Chris. “That’s just the kind of person she was.” Friends, family, school pals and members of the community all touched by Vanessa’s courage joined for the special service.  Her battle with neuroblastoma had been one that ensured she will never be forgotten by all lucky enough to know her. Speaking to more than 400 people at her memorial service, Chris said: “She lit up our world. “And in her short life, she packed in so much happiness. “Vanessa was a thrillseeker with a soft side – great with old and young alike. “She had the Midas touch.” And he added: “No words can describe how utterly proud we are to have been your father, mother and sister.  “This is not the end for you, you have now moved on to something new.” The emotional speech came as the Town Hall paid tribute to Vanessa, of Loans, who lost her brave battle just days short of her 18th birthday. Some of Vanessa’s closest childhood friends took their feet to recount memories of happy times of the girl with a smile for everyone. And Vanessa’s infamous parking skills and ability to make everyone laugh were just two of the themes to strike a chord. Graham Hobson, deputy head at Marr College, was another to speak warmly of an immensely popular pupil. Chris said afterwards: “I thought the speeches were great, especially Vanessa’s friends, who at only 18 spoke so eloquently and passionately about Vanessa - they belied their age doing this.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12713526.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/emp_ayp_070618ecrepont_10JPG.jpg","title":"talented youngster finn ecrepont walking","story":"NewsTalented youngster Finn Ecrepont is walking on AyrDubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet12:00, 18 JUN 2018NewsAyr United\u0027s Finn Ecrepont (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMost success stories in football start with a rejection somewhere along the line. And 15-year-old Ayr United starlet Finn Ecrepont is no different. Dubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football. The Kilmarnock school has dedicated facilities for bright talents in the footballing world. And after leaving Alloway Primary, Ecrepont’s aim was to join the set-up at the Grange - but he was told he wasn’t good enough at his trial for the performance school. But the left-back, who also went to Glenburn Primary, refused to give up on his dream. Ecrepont, who has played with Ayr United since he was nine, said: “Getting that knock back is key to where I am today, because that has made me realise it’s not as easy as just walking into a team. “I didn’t get through the first trial so that made me focus and I knew I had to work hard. “I guess there was choices to make and sacrifices to make, but I was willing to make these changes for my football.  “I had training at Ayr the night after I got my knock back so I went to ask my coach Ross Armour for advice, so that’s when the work began. “I went away and worked on my game and a year later I got into the performance school at the Grange, which is one of the best things that has ever happened to me.” Ecrepont worked his way up through the ranks at Ayr and has now signed a three year deal with the first team. Just last season he was training with the under 17s, but his progress has been off the scale and he is now training with the senior side. He has been getting day release from school on a Thursday to train with the first team, but after signing his new deal he will train four mornings a week with Ian McCall’s side. And despite most schools refusing to take him in due to his football commitments, Ayr Academy were good enough to take him in. And dad Eddy, who runs Cafe Ginger in Ayr, claims teachers from Ayr Academy have offered to work overtime to help Ecrepont through his studies. Ecrepont is delighted to get his chance so early with Ayr.  He said: “The coaches thought I was playing well so I got more of a chance through my training and playing more with the under 20s last season. “I just love being in and around the first team, and the boys have been great with me so I am happy to be where I’m at at the moment. “Everyone at the club has been brilliant with me, through all the age groups. All the senior players and coaches have been really accepting of me and I couldn’t have asked for anything more. “Ian McCall and all of the other coaches are great because they always give me feedback. “Whether it’s positive or negative they are always keeping me right. That has been key to my progression. “If I was to ask anyone a question at Ayr they would answer it no problem, and that’s exactly what I look for and it’s why I’m here.” Despite the gruelling schedule of being a footballer, Ecrepont claims he is still fully focused on his school work.  He said: “Adapting to be a footballer hasn’t been much different as I enjoy it and it’s more like a hobby. I play football for fun and that’s what’s most important to me, so I guess it’s just normal. “It can take a lot out of me, but again because I enjoy football so much I don’t really realise how much I am doing. “I don’t think it’s had an effect on my school and I think it’s going good. Hopefully I have done well in my exams which I’ll find out in August. “I’ll get a Wednesday off from training so I can hopefully work towards getting my highers. “This year I’m studying higher English and PE, next year I’ll do something like Chemistry and Biology. And despite his age, Ecrepont has already been involved in a number of big games. He scored for Scotland under 16s against England, but for Ayr under 20s he was involved in a league decider last season against Morton. He said: “Unfortunately we lost the game 1-0 from a penalty, but I played the full game and it was a great experience and the boys played really well.  “There was quite a few Ayr United fans there so they gave us a great support.” But Ecrepont refuses to forget where he came from, he is sure to consistently help his dad Eddy in Cafe Ginger. Ecrepont said: “I signed for Ayr on the Tuesday, I was washing dishes for my dad on the Friday and on the Monday I was training with Scotland. “I work with my dad at the cafe which has been key to keeping me grounded.

InChorus subsequently performed with Dougie at the Amber Festival in Perth.\nThe trip to New York was hugely memorable with the choir singing on the Red Steps in Times Square, at the annual NYPD concert, at various September Concerts in the city, and, most poignantly, at the British Memorial Garden to the relatives of the British people who had died on 9/11.\nMoira Pearson, who is one of the founding members and choir manager from 2009 to 2012, told us: \" When the advert for a New Peebles Choir was placed in the Peeblesshire News in September 2008 no-one could have imagined just how important InChorus would become to so many people.\n\"It was a great privilege to be the choir manager for three years, during which time we travelled to New York to support and sing at commemorative events for the 10th Anniversary of 9/11.\n\"The fundraising effort to enable the journey was immense but made much easier by the unstinting support of the Peebles community.\"\nAlthough the 9/11 concert will remain a highlight of the InChorus story, the successes and landmark achievements continued after they came home.\nThe next year, 2012, saw the choir performing to another full house at the Festival Theatre, this time raising funds for other charities which is what InChorus likes to do.\nThe following year they embarked upon their \u0026lsquoChoirathon\u0026rsquo in aid of Comic Relief, when they sang from 9.30am to 9.30pm in the sleet, but raised \u0026pound3,500 in the process.\nIn 2013 they also had their first foray to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in what was to be come a biennial venture, winning the covered sell-out laurels in 2013, 2015 and 2017.\nIn 2014 the choir decided to try its hand at competition winning themselves a \u0026lsquoChoir of the Day\u0026rsquo award at the Scottish auditions of Choir of the Year, proving that even a very large choir can be sufficiently disciplined in all the nuances of choral singing to make a good impression.\nOver the years InChorus members discovered they rather liked performing at music festivals and have sung at T in the Park, Meadows Festival, Fringe by the Sea at North Berwick, Big Burns Supper in Dumfries, Eden Festival, Lindisfarne, and last year on the main stage between Texas and the Manic Street Preachers, at the BBC Children in Need\u0026rsquos Carfest in front of an audience of 20,000 people. How do they top that?\nThey also love weddings and travelled to Dublin in 2016 to sing at the wedding of a choir member\u0026rsquos son. While there, they performed on the bandstand in St Stephen\u0026rsquos Green and at the famous Cobblestone pub, as well as appearing as a flash mob all over the city.\nAly Skidmore, herself a long serving choir member, took over as Musical Director in 2014. Aly was responsible for the huge flash mob \u0026lsquoDancing in the Street\u0026rsquo event last year, involving the whole community.\nShe told us: \"Whilst singing is at the heart of everything that InChorus has achieved over the last 10 years, it\u0026rsquos never been only that.\n\"Through this organisation we have seen people\u0026rsquos friendships, confidence, skills, self-esteem and both emotional and physical health all flourish and grow over the years.\n\"In return the members give their time freely and generously to learn, rehearse and perform music for the benefit of others.\n\"In its time InChorus has achieved and given so much more than any of us really ever anticipated at the outset and I think every member feels so proud about that.\nIt\u0026rsquos amazing what a community can achieve when they group together, take a collective breath and burst into song.\"\nThey say that into every life a little rain must fall, and InChorus has not escaped, losing three much loved ladies to cancer.\nIn 2016 it was founder members Kitty Lyle and Celia Hayton and, just a few weeks ago, Bernice Brown - all are missed greatly.\nThroughout its 10 years the choir has raised over \u0026pound60,000 for other charities, both through its own concerts and through specific charity events.\nThis is something that is at the core of InChorus, something of which they are proud, and something which will continue in the years to come.\nAt one charity dinner they even put up an InChorus performance as an auction prize and were \u0026lsquosold\u0026rsquo for over \u0026pound1100. This, in turn, led to a performance at a very prestigious charity dinner in aid of breast cancer.\nTo celebrate its 10th birthday, the choir will be travelling to Barcelona in October for a long weekend of performances.\nBut before that they have a bit of a party planned in Peebles.\nOn September 1, the actual birthday weekend, they have organised their \u0026lsquoTen out of Ten\u0026rsquo day - when they will sing throughout the day from a list of at least ten different favourite songs, at ten different locations in Peebles.\nAlthough the earlier locations have yet to be revealed the finale will take place at the Eastgate Theatre, where it all started ten years ago, for an evening concert.\nThis will also be the final event of the 2018 Creative Peebles Festival.\nThe choir hopes you will join them or, at least, come and say hello.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"united-front-to-boost-the-borderlands","story":"HUNDREDS of stakeholders had their say on proposals to transform the Borderlands economy at a special conference in Dumfries on Monday.\nLeader of Dumfries and Galloway Council, Elaine Murray, welcomed more than 370 business representatives, public sector organisations and individuals to the first Borderlands conference.\nShe said: \u0026ldquoI am delighted that so many people attended on the day, this shows what an important project the Borderlands Inclusive Growth Deal is.\n\"One attendee described the conference as an \u0026lsquoIlluminating and fantastic event\u0026rsquo, which reflected the enthusiasm I perceived on the day, that this is a once in a generation opportunity which must be seized.\nFive local authorities from north and south of the border are working in partnership to put together a proposal that should have huge implications for those who live, work and visit the area.\nIt was the first opportunity for interested parties to hear about the themes that are being developed to underpin the Borderlands Inclusive Growth Deal \u0026ndash and to give their views on the major projects they believe would kickstart transformation.\nThe conference was held at a key time for the partnership, made up of Carlisle City, Cumbria County, Dumfries and Galloway, Northumberland County and Scottish Borders Councils.\nResponses from the conference will help the partnership to build a case to present to both the UK and Scottish Governments later this year.

Before that, in December 1828, Peebles Town Council had agreed that if a gas company was set up, it would be allowed to open up and lay pipes in the streets and if that proved successful, it would then have the street lamps lit by gas.\nInitially a site for a gasworks on the Old Town Green (now Greenside) was chosen, but it proved to be unsuitable. A site was found on the area of ground lying to the west of the Parish Church. Today the site is still visible and forms part of the parkland and walkways close to the modern swimming pool.\nOne of the factors which made the development of a gasworks feasible was the great improvement in major roads serving the town following the Turnpike Acts. That allowed coking coal to be brought to the town from the coalfields of Lanarkshire and Midlothian.\nTo begin with gas was produced for only ten months of the year and the street lights were lit for only about a third of the year, during the darkest winter months.\nBy the end of the 19th century, the demand for gas had greatly increased and as well as street lighting, was beginning to be used for household appliances such as gas cookers. In 1898 the assets of the Peebles Gas Company were acquired by the Town Council. Within a few years demand was outstripping supply and in 1905 it was decided to build a new gas works at Eshiels as the existing site, which also served as the council yard, was too restricted to allow for expansion. By then the existence of railways made it possible to import coal directly to the Eshiels site.\nIn 1948 the Town Council starting converting all street lighting to electricity. The gas works at Eshiels became part of the national system and continued in operation until the advent of North Sea gas in the late 1960s.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"were-so-proud-of-him-parents-of-galashiels-scout-with-adhd-hope-to-inspire-others-to-join-group","story":"THE parents of a Galashiels Scout with ADHD hope others will be inspired after the youngster won a prestigious award.\nAfter weeks of working hard to complete an array of challenges and tasks, Blair Valentine took home the Reiver Award at the Gala Scout Group annual general meeting last month.\nThe 10-year-old, who attends St Peter\u0026rsquos Primary School in Galashiels, received the award in recognition of his hard work after being nominated by numerous members of the Scouts.\nProud parents Dave and Mandy now hope their son\u0026rsquos success story will inspire other parents of children with ADHD.\nThe youngster was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in July 2013 at the age of six.\nBlair\u0026rsquos mum Mandy told the Border : \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore so proud of him, Blair has worked very hard to get where he is, and we want others to know that just because a child has ADHD, it shouldn\u0026rsquot hold them back from going on to do great things.\n\u0026ldquoBlair gets especially inspired when hearing that celebrities have the same condition as him.\n\u0026ldquoUntil we looked into it, we had no idea just how many well-known people were also affected by it.

SS took his portion of fish after his family were fed and satisfied.\nLater that same day, SS returned with more fish and he was certainly making up for lost time.\nHe began to feed the youngsters himself while Mrs O was preening. The chicks were visibly stronger and more energised than the day before when they were hungry.\nAfter the first chick was full it lay down on its side while the other chick fed and when it had had enough to eat, chick number one would get up and come back over for seconds.\nThe week progressed into warm weather and scorching sunshine and the chicks ranged from being sleepy and still, to being far too adventurous, toddling about the nest using their budding wings as little stilts to enable them to clamber around.\nThese little excursions led them to venture too far to the edges and the parent birds used distraction with fish to bring them away and back into the middle.\nThey also began to pay more attention to the nest construction, by moving sticks around and building up the edges, like little safety barriers to prevent any toppling over the edge.\nSadly, for one osprey family in the Borders, two chicks did fall to their death from the nest during the recent high winds.\nBut the attentive Mrs O and SS seem to have metaphorically red taped the danger zone by building stick walls just high enough to prevent any earnest climbing from a curious young osprey wanting to peer over the side.\nvar panels = panels || []var panel = {    name: \u0027RelatedArticles\u0027,    target: \u0027related-articles\u0027,    params: {ns: \u0027redesign\u0027, \u0027article_ids\u0027: \u002716320757,16320674,16320502,16320330,16320246\u0027, \u0027more_articles_heading\u0027: \u0027More articles\u0027}}panels.push(panel)\nBy now, the young ospreys have grown stronger and the fluffy down is spotted with the onset of growing feathers.\nThey no longer look feeble and weak and their fortunes have rapidly turned around since the fish supply has picked up.\nWe finally have news of PX1 (Paxman\u0027s bird) whose satellite tracker alerted us to the fact that he had died in the north of Scotland near to the Helmsdale River.\nThe carcass and tag have been recovered and it seems that his neck was broken, we believe, from colliding into newly erected deer fencing along the side of a forestry plantation.\nIt is such a terrible shame to lose this wonderful, healthy, two-year-old male osprey.\nJeremy Paxman was very saddened to hear of the loss of this bird and we are very grateful to him for his interest and support for the Tweed Valley Osprey Project.\nHe has agreed that his involvement will continue in the future, through the tracking of further ospreys.\nThe volunteers for the osprey project were invited to attend the ringing of goshawk chicks this week in Tweed Valley Forest Park and they were privileged to witness them being fitted with red darvic rings with white letters of JP and PL, by Tony Lightley, after Eve Schulte climbed the fir tree to lower them to the forest floor.\nRhona Anderson took some great photos of these magnificent birds and she has also been filming pine martens in the forest.\nThe captured footage of the whole pine marten family together and the antics of the three little kits with their mum and dad can be viewed in the video above or at \nhttps://www.flickr/photos/borderslass/28099626057/in/photostream/\nRead the latest Tweed Valley Osprey News every week throughout the summer in the Border  and Peeblesshire News newspapers\n"},{"url":null,"title":"500-mile-cycle-across-scotland-raises-20k-for-charity","story":"AN INNERLEITHEN man has cycled 516 miles in five days \u0026ndash raising \u0026pound21,000 for charity.\nMountain biker Kevin Marshall recently completed the mammoth challenge around the north Scottish coastline \u0026ndash all in aid of a cause close to his heart.\nThe idea to take on the challenge originated during a mountain biking trip to Glencoe last August, when Kevin, and his friend Steve, both agreed they wanted to do something to support the charities Macmillan and Friends of Anchor, who helped Steve\u0026rsquos mum and dad, and Kevin\u0026rsquos mum, before they passed away.\nKevin said: \u0026ldquoWe agreed that the North Coast 500 (NC500) was a suitably tough challenge, both to raise awareness and hopefully raise a reasonable amount of cash.\n\u0026ldquoThe team that completed the ride with me are all very close friends, the majority of us met when we were 18 when we started university in Aberdeen and have been close friends ever since. A number of the team are very familiar with spending time on bikes, however others in the group perhaps less so.\n\u0026ldquoEither way this was a physical and emotional challenge for each and every one of us.\nDescribed as an \u0026ldquoincredibly tough ride by Kevin, the North Coast 500 spans 516 miles across roads around the coastline in the Highlands. The route starts in Inverness, weaves along the west coast to Applecross and then northwards towards the towns of Torridon and Ullapool.\nFrom there, the team ventured to some of the most northerly coastal points in Scotland, passing by Caithness and John o\u0026rsquo Groats before heading south again through Dingwall and back to Inverness.\n\u0026ldquoDay one was probably the most challenging followed closely by day three, Kevin added.\n\u0026ldquoIt included 2,200 metres of climbing, eight hours of riding, and a top temperature of 27 degrees. However, the highlight was riding up the Bealach na B\u0026agrave. This is every road biker\u0026rsquos dream climb, and to be able to ride it in the heat was a treat.\n\u0026ldquoThe Bealach na B\u0026agrave is a notorious mountain pass to Applecross. This twisting, single-track mountain road is the third highest road in Scotland rising up to 626 metres (2,054 ft) above the sea level. It\u0026rsquos one of the most scenic rides in the world, very similar to the great mountain passes in the Alps, with very tight hairpin bends which switch back and forth up the hillside, with gradients approaching 20 percent.\n\u0026ldquoThe biggest highlight however, and by far the most humbling, has been the generosity of people from far and wide.\n\u0026ldquoWe knew that setting a \u0026pound25,000 fundraising target was ambitious, however we never imagined we would get so close to it, with funds currently around \u0026pound21,000.\n\u0026ldquoEqually the generosity of people along the way and the support they afforded us was incredible.\n\u0026ldquoOn our last day whilst cycling down the A9 towards Inverness we were flagged down as we passed a layby by the owner of the Golspie fish and chip shop with 10 chip suppers to fuel us on our last 50 miles.\nTo donate, go to: https://bit.ly/2y4NauJ\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch-galashiels-braw-lads-gathering-2018-highlights-wednesday-night","story":"MISSED any of the action from the festivities for the 2018 Galashiels Braw Lads Gathering?\nWatch our coverage of the events across the town on Wednesday evening (June 27) below...\nDon\u0027t forget to buy next week\u0027s Border  newspaper for photos and\u0026nbspfull reports\n"},{"url":null,"title":"post-office-launches-six-week-consultation-on-new-innerleithen-branch","story":"POST Office bosses have launched a six-week consultation on the new Innerleithen branch.\nThe move follows a confirmation of opening times for customers when the concession opens within The Allotment grocery store on Innerleithen High Street on Wednesday, August 29.\nUpon opening, the branch will open from 10am to 5pm between Monday to Friday, and from 9.30am to 1pm on Saturday.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.

A pressure group called \u0026lsquoBowls for Gullane\u0026rsquo was established on Facebook in the wake of concerns that the village\u0026rsquos bowling club \u0026ndash with a membership of only about 30 \u0026ndash was to be sold to developers.  Councillor Jeremy Findlay, ward member and former chairman of Gullane Area Community Council, said: \u0026ldquoAll three ward councillors are behind the campaign to save the club and we hope that the members understand the feeling in the village.  \u0026ldquoI understand that the committee own the club and it would be the members who benefit from any potential sale.  About 50 residents gathered outside the bowling club on Monday evening to show their displeasure at the possible loss of the club.  The group told the Courier they had had hundreds of offers of support.  Catherine MacKenzie said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove had people phone up, email and text us \u0026ndash and face-to-face \u0026ndash to tell us that they\u0026rsquore willing to become a member.  \u0026ldquoSome of them don\u0026rsquot live locally, or won\u0026rsquot be able to bowl, but they are willing to pay the membership fees. People do not want to see the club close.  Gordon McLelland, a local resident and member of the community council, added: \u0026ldquoThe community council want to save the club for the community.  \u0026ldquoWe have tried hard to offer the club our support to work with them but so far they have turned that down.  Billy Mellors, the county\u0026rsquos bowls development officer, said: \u0026ldquoThe overwhelming support from the local community indicates to me the future of Gullane Bowling Club can be sustained if the current members accept it.  Many locals have tried to sign up as members but have been turned away by the club, it has been claimed.  Another member of the group said: \u0026ldquoWhat has shocked us as a group is how many people have been refused membership in recent years \u0026ndash young and old have come forward with their personal experience of being turned away.  Mr Mellors added: \u0026ldquoTime will tell on the way the club want to go but we all hope a common sense approach is taken to preserve this community facility.  East Lothian MSP Iain Gray met representatives of the Bowls for Gullane group last week and is keen to find a solution to ensure the club\u0026rsquos survival.  He said: \u0026ldquoThis is an unfortunate situation Gullane has lost too many local assets recently, so every effort should be made to avoid losing another. I did meet with representatives of the campaign and have said that I will support them in trying to find a way the land, and preferably bowling too, can remain part of the village community.  Ian McMillan, CEO of Bowls Scotland, said that he was \u0026ldquodelighted to see local residents lend their support to the campaign to save the 116-year-old club.  He added: \u0026ldquoI would encourage all in the village to support their historic club, get on the green, enjoy the great game of bowls and ensure future generations can benefit from the opportunity to play an accessible, inclusive sport. Bowls Scotland fully supports the work being undertaken to keep bowls an important part of Gullane\u0026rsquos community fabric.  Les Ritchie, secretary of East Lothian Bowling Association, told the group: \u0026ldquoWe are ready to support you and the community in whatever steps might secure a future for bowling in Gullane.  Attempts by the Courier to speak to Michael Baxter, vice-president and secretary at the bowling club, were unsuccessful this week. In April, Mr Baxter told us: \u0026ldquoThere are not enough members to support the running of the club.  He had said then that the club was \u0026ldquotrying to find a solution but that it was not viable to continue with a dwindling membership.  A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council confirmed the land was earmarked for leisure and recreation use in the Local Development Plan and any deviation from that would require planning permission for a potential change of use."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7297144.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"haddington-hosts-world-record-attempt-for-the-slosh-dance","story":"              HUNDREDS of people are set to lace up their dancing shoes in a bid to break a world record.

They are one of four one-act plays that will take part in the Scottish Community Drama\u0026rsquos National Youth Drama final in Plockton on Saturday.  The group, who meet in North Berwick\u0027s St Andrew Blackadder Church every Friday, will be performing Evan Placey\u0026rsquos powerful play Girls Like That, which explores the consequences of a naked photo being sent round a school and how this affects, not only the girl in the photo, but the way in which girls react and respond.  Indelible Arts director Linda Grant told the Courier: \"I am so delighted that our talented cast have made it to the SCDA one act festival.  \"It really is a joy to bring all these young people together who have a love of the performing arts and support each other in a very nurturing environment.

S6 pupil Ella Higgins said: \"When I first read the script, I immediately loved it and was desperate to perform it.  \"I\u0026rsquove never read or seen anything that fully demonstrates how much resilience is needed to survive in high school as a teenage girl to the extent that this play does and it covers so many issues and scenarios that many girls do experience in real life.  \"This play is such an important and well written piece. I feel so proud to be performing it at the final and I hope we do it justice and get it the recognition it deserves.\"  Holly Edwards, another S6 pupil, said: \"The play is extremely relevant and gives a taste of real life and what really goes on at schools that have such a large social media influence.  \"The competition means a lot to us as a group and the thought of getting to the final is so exciting, we want to show people what this play is all about. After all our hard work we are all so happy to be in the final!  Heather Fortune, also S6, added: \"Life today as a high school student is displayed perfectly through the contrast between the boys\u0026rsquo reaction to the photo and the girls\u0026rsquo reaction to it.\"  And S4 pupil Abbey Greenwood: \"I have really enjoyed working on this play, I think it really brings people together and opens up discussions on how we treat each other in society.\""},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7930043.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"calls-to-tackle-edinburgh-bypass-gridlock-as-tram-system-to-musselburgh-mooted","story":"              MUSSELBURGH\u0026rsquoS MSP has backed calls for improvements to the Edinburgh City Bypass \u0026ndash while suggesting extending a tram or light rail system to the Honest Toun.  Colin Beattie stressed that \u0026ldquoradical thinking needed to be done to create a solution, highlighting a possible extension of a tram or light rail system out to Musselburgh.  During a recent Holyrood debate, he said: \u0026ldquoPeople meet the queues of traffic heading on to the bypass on the main roads around my constituency before they are even near the bypass. This causes more congestion and more air pollution.  Mr Beattie later said: \u0026ldquoYou can go along the road at any time of the day and there are queues of traffic, mainly at Sheriffhall Roundabout.  \u0026ldquoIt is important that when the Government are looking at all the possible changes required to the bypass, all options are considered. The main priority should be that it is cost-efficient and done as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoIt may be that it is more economic to extend a tram or light rail system out to the main population centres such as Musselburgh than to take on the eye-watering cost of enlarging the A720. This would also benefit the environment and be much faster than using road transport.  \u0026ldquoClearly more radical thinking needs to be done on creating a sustainable solution. I am not convinced that simply replicating a system which moves traffic speedily and efficiently into new choke points is the answer.  Miles Briggs, Lothian region MSP who led the Parliamentary debate, said: \u0026ldquoThe transport information company Inrix in late 2016 identified the bypass as the most congested trunk road outside London, with four of the UK\u0026rsquos worst bottlenecks.  \u0026ldquoI continue to be contacted by frustrated constituents and businesspeople who face frequent delays when using the bypass to commute or transport goods, especially but not exclusively at peak times or when there is an accident on the route. Many drivers tell me their experience is that these tailbacks and traffic jams are becoming more and more regular.  He said that while proposed work at Sheriffhall would be an important improvement, he added: \u0026ldquoIt is only one part of what needs to be a far broader, long-term and coordinated programme of improvements to the bypass which will ensure traffic can keep moving in the decades ahead.  \u0026ldquoThis means looking at innovative solutions, assessing whether extra lanes will be needed, looking at the possible use of hard shoulders in some situations and utilising technology so the bypass can become a smart motorway.  Mr Briggs called on the Scottish Government to take forward a feasibility study into widening the city bypass and new options to address the growing congestion.  A Transport Scotland spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe Edinburgh and South East Scotland City Region Deal includes investment of up to \u0026pound120m in the A720 city bypass for the grade separation of Sheriffhall Roundabout and \u0026pound20 million investment in public transport infrastructure in west Edinburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis investment will improve journey reliability and safety for all users and support significant planned investment in Edinburgh and South East Scotland.  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government remains committed to undertaking the improvements at the Sheriffhall junction at the earliest opportunity. We are continuing to progress the detailed design development and assessment of the preferred option and expect to publish draft orders in 2019."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7930076.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"haddington-pub-seeking-new-owners","story":"              A TOWN centre pub which changed its name less than a year ago is on the lookout for new people to run it.

Inspectors found the following strengths in the school\u0027s work:  - Strong relationships exist between staff and children across the school and nursery which are based on shared values  - In the nursery, children are motivated and confident, and are able to make choices about their play, particularly outdoors. Across the primary stages, children are committed to and proud of being part of their school community  - The committed staff team, led by the headteacher, work well together in their goal to secure positive outcomes for children.

Brave Ruth Quilietti-Bird \u0026ndash who at one point was the most ill person \u0026ldquoin the whole of the UK, according to her husband \u0026ndash moved hospital several times to receive specialist treatment for multiple organ failure, spending her 40th birthday in intensive care rather than on a planned holiday.  She has had both her feet amputated after they suffered tissue damage due to sepsis \u0026ndash a serious complication of an infection.\u0026nbsp It was also feared that Ruth, who taught art at Knox Academy in Haddington and Preston Lodge High School, Prestonpans, might also lose her hands.  She is recovering at the Astley Ainslie Hospital in Edinburgh, where she is getting used to her newly-fitted prosthetic legs with the aid of physiotherapists.  The health of her hands improved and she is keeping them busy by resuming her love of creative activities such as drawing, weaving and needlework.  Ruth is now looking forward to getting out of hospital to rejoin her family: husband Mark, 47, and their daughters, seven-year-old Lucia and Isabella, five.    But she can\u0026rsquot return to her New Street home in Musselburgh as it has an outdoor staircase and is no longer suitable, so the search for a new home is under way.  Now her friend Jacqueline Campbell has launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise \u0026pound20,000 to help fund a mobility scooter and adapt a new property.  In March, Ruth suddenly started to have breathing problems along with vomiting and diarrhoea.  Mark, a nurse at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh, said she was rushed to the accident and emergency unit at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh by paramedics who assessed that she was suffering from sepsis, which can be triggered by an infection and affected her immune system.  He said: \u0026ldquoHer health deteriorated more and more and she was taken to the high dependency unit. They said they needed to ventilate Ruth and that was the last time I spoke to her for two-and-a-half weeks. She went into a medicalised coma.  Mark said it was still unknown what was causing the infection, so Ruth received multiple antibiotics.  \u0026ldquoThe consultant told me to prepare myself because we were losing Ruth, he said.  The medical team decided to take Ruth into theatre to connect an ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) circuit to help her breathing.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoThey managed to stabilise her but her vital organs were failing. Her respiratory had already failed and her kidneys had failed.  \u0026ldquoThere was no one as ill as Ruth in the whole of the UK at that time, receiving that amount of support to keep her alive.  Ruth was then transferred to a specialist ECMO unit at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoHer liver was failing and her heart was beginning to fail.  \u0026ldquoThey said again that they were losing Ruth and she wouldn\u0026rsquot last the in-patient stay.  \u0026ldquoThey made the decision to fit a second ECMO circuit to support her heart and this stabilised her.  \u0026ldquoI was told several times I might be potentially losing Ruth. Then things started improving and they were able to withdraw some of the support and her blood tests were showing very small improvements.  \u0026ldquoRuth was infected with group \u0026lsquoA\u0026rsquo streptococcal, a very aggressive bacteria which is around us all the time.  \u0026ldquoRuth\u0026rsquos immune system was already affected, so it was able to take over very quickly, causing failure to the vital organs. She was diagnosed with sepsis and pneumonia.  Ruth began to make progress with her breathing, her heart started to stabilise and her kidneys started to improve. Doctors felt they could remove the ECMO circuit for the heart and rescind the \u0026lsquodo not resuscitate\u0026rsquo notice.  As doctors brought Ruth out of sedation, she faced the risk of haemorrhaging throughout the body because of blood thinning and medications.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoI remember her opening her eyes and looking at me.  \u0026ldquoWe put our foreheads together and looked into each others\u0026rsquo eyes. I knew that Ruth was back.  \u0026ldquoHow close she was to dying on several occasions is still difficult to comprehend.  A special moment for Ruth was a visit by her daughters for her birthday when they took her cuddly toys and held her hand. Her mum and dad were also at her bedside.  Ruth was moved back to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, where her ventilator was removed and she was able to start to speak.  But as she got better, she was to face a huge decision as a result of the tissue damage, caused by the lack of blood flow, which had turned her feet black.  She was told she would have to lose her right foot and possibly half of her left foot, with surgery carried out at St John\u0026rsquos Hospital in Livingston.  But Ruth, determined to get the best quality of life, made the decision to lose both feet below the knee, which would give her more choices in terms of prosthetics and improve her recovery.    Mark paid tribute to the \u0026ldquowonderful hospital staff who had \u0026ldquogiven everything for Ruth.  He highlighted the help he had received from friends and family over the past few months, including the network of \u0026lsquoSupermums\u0026rsquo who looked after Lucia and Isabella, friends, neighbours and colleagues at the Western General.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe kindness of people has been overwhelming. They want to help so much.

Two of the school\u0026rsquos four P6 classes had already taken part in the one-night camp last month.  In total, 54 youngsters were expected to camp out this week.  However, Jill Wareham, the school\u0026rsquos headteacher, contacted parents on Monday to say that a decision had been taken to cancel the overnight stays after \u0026ldquoa group of people camped near the field they use.  The school is still going ahead with the daytime activities planned as part of the camp but asked parents to pick up their children from Yellowcraig at 7pm.  Mrs Wareham told parents in an email: \u0026ldquoYou may be aware that there is a group of people camped near the field at Yellowcraig where we usually hold our camp out. This has various implications for our risk assessments for the trip and, having taken advice from a number of sources, we have decided not to stay overnight at the site this week.  \u0026ldquoWe realise this will be disappointing news and apologise for any inconvenience, but we will look into the possibility of the pupils having a night in tents at another venue after the summer.  The camping trip is usually held in a field on the left of the road leading into the car parks at Yellowcraig.  An East Lothian Council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoWhile the pupils will be taking part in all of the planned activities, arrangements are being made for them to be picked up at 7pm instead of camping overnight.  \u0026ldquoThis decision has been taken as the school understands there may be a number of people already using the area.  One parent said: \u0026ldquoThe children are really disappointed but it\u0026rsquos the correct decision."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/5296837.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"common-school-day-across-east-lothian-proposed","story":"              A COMMON secondary school day could be introduced in East Lothian in an effort to ensure pupils have equal access to education.  A study is being launched to examine how the six secondary schools could work together to ensure they all start and end at the same time and follow a common timetable.  A meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos cabinet heard that high schools had historically been given considerable autonomy in planning their school days and \u0026ldquocurricular arrangements. But this had resulted in \u0026ldquosix different structures, length of the school day and different levels of access in terms of experience and opportunity. And there was \u0026ldquosignificant variation throughout East Lothian in the range of Advanced Higher and Higher courses offered and the number of qualifications available in S4.  The report, backed by councillors, said the feasibility study would aim to lead to the creation of \u0026ldquoa common secondary school day and a common curricular structure.  The move would also see a change in hours for primary schools to match the new secondary day, with proposals to extend P1 and P2 pupils\u0026rsquo week from 22.5 hours to the same 25 hours that their older school-mates follow. A failure to synchronise primary school start and finish times to match the high school changes would cost the council an estimated \u0026pound190,000 in additional transport costs.  A public consultation will now be launched with the schools to establish the best standard timetable, with options for a 27, 32 or 33-period week. A 33-period week, for instance, could see secondary students\u0026rsquo first period of the day start at 8.30am, with a finish time of 3.40pm Monday to Thursday and 12.55pm on Fridays.  The council said a common school day would lead to joint delivery, mutual support, sharing of best practice and collaborative professional development opportunities, as well as meaning greater equity of resource and opportunity for young people across East Lothian and barriers to travel would be reduced.  Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet spokesperson for education, said: \u0026ldquoThese proposals are all about improving inclusion, wellbeing and equality. We\u0026rsquore always keen to look for new ways of raising attainment and improving positive destinations for our children and young people.  \u0026ldquoThere are a number of potential practical benefits associated with such changes. It\u0026rsquos important that we listen to the views of staff, pupils, parents, carers and other stakeholders. That\u0026rsquos why I\u0026rsquom pleased cabinet has agreed that the council will hold a consultation and carry out a feasibility study. This will be launched in due course.  Current school times: Dunbar Grammar School starts at 8.40am with a home time of 3.50pm Monday to Thursday and 12.30pm on Fridays Preston Lodge High School starts at 8.40am and finishes at 3.40pm Monday to Thursday and 12.25pm on Fridays Knox Academy is 8.44am to 4pm Monday to Thursday, finishing at 12.05pm on Fridays Musselburgh Grammar School starts at 8.45am, finishing at 3.50pm and 12.30pm on Fridays North Berwick High School starts at 8.39am and finishes at 3.50pm \u0026ndash noon on Fridays Ross High School starts at 8.30am, finishing at 3.35pm \u0026ndash 11.55am on Fridays."},{"url":null,"title":"ormiston-park-formally-opens-after-years-of-refurbishment-work","story":"              SUPPORTERS of Ormiston Park celebrated its official opening on Saturday following four years of hard work.

They say they are being overlooked by customers at the supermarket car park who can see through the fence into the communal garden area in front of their ground-floor properties at Mill House on Eskmills Road, which is managed by Dunedin Canmore Housing Association.  Margaret and Keith Morris moved from a Dunedin Canmore property in Bathgate last September into the phase two of Mill House \u0026ndash an amenity housing development for residents aged 55 and over.  Mrs Morris said: \u0026ldquoThere is no privacy whatsoever.  \u0026ldquoPeople who park in the car park have been waving in.  \u0026ldquoThere were two young guys in a van and I was hanging out my washing and one was nudging the other.

They were sitting lined up in their cars looking to see what was going on.  \u0026ldquoI have sat outside with my breakfast some mornings and have had to lift my bowl of cereal and walk back in the house.  Mrs Morris said that although there were some trees along the boundary, they shed their leaves in the autumn, leaving the area bare.  She claimed that she and her husband had called on the housing association for permission to fill in the gaps in the fence to allow more privacy but claimed they had been told they couldn\u0026rsquot as another resident liked it that way.  \u0026ldquoWe wanted to get these slats which are only 94p. We would pay for them and fill in the spaces, she added.  She said they also called for a fence to be installed to stop people using an area past their flats as a shortcut to Tesco, claiming they were dumping rubbish including cans and bottles en route.  Neighbour Fiona Wilson said that motorists ate and slept in their vehicles and let their dogs out of cars.  \u0026ldquoWe are entitled to some sort of privacy, she added.  \u0026ldquoWe can\u0026rsquot go out \u0026ndash everybody\u0026rsquos looking at us.  \u0026ldquoMy bedroom is also to the front.  Another resident, who declined to be named agreed, saying: \u0026ldquoWe are getting no privacy and I can\u0026rsquot even sit out in the back garden for people looking in.  Alan Glasgow, Dunedin Canmore housing director, said: \u0026ldquoWe are aware there are a small number of residents at Eskmills Road who have concerns about the garden fence.  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquoll continue to work with the community and local partners to see what can be done to help further increase privacy when people are using the nearby car park.

The operation at the site off Edinburgh Road took place last Thursday.  Sculptor Michael Johnson\u0026rsquos work, called \u0026lsquoMemory and Reflection\u0026rsquo, is 12ft high and 6ft feet wide.  The stainless steel sculpture depicts aspects of Musselburgh\u0026rsquos history with images of agriculture, people, connections to the sea, the river and the Romans. The face of the sculpture is mirror polished and reflects whatever stands before it.  Mr Johnson, from Nottinghamshire, sees these two aspects of the shell, the memory and reflection, as metaphors for a work which interprets the history of the town and offers a reflection of how the town is viewed now.  A working group made up of community representatives selected the mussel shell for the commission. Mr Johnson undertook activities with local groups and schoolchildren to create designs for bronze inserts incorporated onto the main sculpture.  The fisherfolk stone sculpture at Murdoch Green will be moved to a seating area in front of the Shell petrol station, also off Edinburgh Road.  The mussel shell is one of two works of art funded by Tesco at a cost of \u0026pound76,000 as part of the council\u0026rsquos Percent for Art policy, which was a condition of planning consent for the company\u0026rsquos present store.  The other is an archer planned for the banks of the River Esk, with its installation expected to be next week.

These machines reward people for recycling by providing money or vouchers in return for empty containers.  Iceland\u0026rsquos reverse vending machine will accept Iceland\u0026rsquos empty plastic beverage bottles and repay customers with a 10p voucher for each recycled bottle to be used in store.  The Musselburgh installation follows Iceland\u0026rsquos industry-first trial in London last month.  The six-month trials are designed to help the company better understand consumer perceptions and appetite for plastics-recycling technology across the UK.  They come ahead of the expected launch of a national deposit return scheme to which the Scottish, UK and Welsh Governments have all announced their commitment in principle.  The trials will help Iceland to provide government and industry with insights that might support the creation of a national scheme.  Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham MSP said: \u0026ldquoThis reverse vending machine will provide valuable evidence on how to help reduce single-use plastic waste and encourage customers to change their own behaviour as we look to end Scotland\u0026rsquos throwaway culture.  \u0026ldquoI would urge all manufactures and retailers to follow Iceland\u0026rsquos example and consider what action they can take to reduce the use of single-use plastics.  \u0026ldquoIn the coming months the Scottish Government will be consulting on a new deposit return scheme for drinks containers that will be one step to increase recycling rates right across Scotland.  \u0026ldquoAs part of our action to reduce the blight of waste littering our communities and polluting our seas we are also consulting on proposals to ban the manufacture and sale of plastic-stemmed cotton buds and have appointed an expert panel to consider what further steps can be taken on items like plastic straws and disposable cups."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7959630.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"future-of-the-hollies-day-centre-safeguarded","story":"              THE future of the Hollies Day Centre at its present location in Musselburgh has been safeguarded.  It has been confirmed that the much-loved facility for older people will continue as it is in its High Street home.  Fears were raised back in 2016 that the day centre might be forced to relocate or even cease to exist in its present form because a new day centre facility could not be accommodated within the current building.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership needed to provide at least 18 places of registered day care for people with complex care needs in Musselburgh given that it was the largest town in East Lothian. This was in line with need identified as part of a wider review of older people\u0026rsquos day centres.  This led to the partnership and the Hollies exploring the options available, which ranged from potentially adapting the current building to accommodate 18 people through to looking at possible other buildings if the Hollies couldn\u0026rsquot be adapted.  After nearly two years of talks, and Care Inspectorate and architects\u0026rsquo input, it was found that, in order to adapt the Hollies premises, the lunch club and public cafe would be lost at the expense of more than 100 users.  A joint decision remains to be made about the eight day care places already in existence at the Hollies current premises but, at present, there is agreement that these places will continue.  The health and social care partnership is now looking for somewhere else in Musselburgh to accommodate the other 10 places.  Following a meeting this month, the Hollies trustees have confirmed that agreement has been reached with the health and social care partnership that the status quo will remain at the day centre.  In a joint statement, the trustees said: \u0026ldquoThe Hollies distributed a consultation paper to service users and had 271 responses completed in two weeks. The overwhelming consensus of the people consulted is for the Hollies to continue providing the service it does now for the people of Musselburgh and surrounding areas. We have also received positive feedback on our proposed expansion of activities in the hall in the afternoons.  \u0026ldquoWe have agreed with the health and social care partnership that the Hollies should remain as it is. We are looking forward to continuing to work as before and to embark on exciting new projects to meet the wishes of all those who attend the Hollies.  Liz Shannon, centre manager, said: \u0026ldquoFunding is a constant battle for us all at the Hollies and we have been in limbo whilst these talks were taking place and have been unable to approach funders as we were unclear what funding we were asking for.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership has assured us they will continue to give funding at the current level for this financial year which is \u0026pound82,000 to continue to fund the eight registered places which we are grateful for in this transition period. However, that is less than a third of what it costs to run all our services and maintain the building.  \u0026ldquoThings are going to be very tight for the near future while we submit funding applications to funders like the lottery however, we are very excited at the prospect of moving forward and very grateful for the support from the people of Musselburgh and beyond.  Councillor Fiona O\u0026rsquoDonnell, health and social care spokesperson, said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that the Hollies will continue to provide a wide range of services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis was a really positive meeting and the plans to provide more activities in the Hollies are good news for local people.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership will continue its work to increase the amount of day support in Musselburgh for older people with complex care needs."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7959839.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"phonebox-removed-from-centre-of-haddington","story":"              A TRADITIONAL red phonebox has been removed from the centre of Haddington after it was used just once in a year.

Despite knowing of this conclusion by the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) \u0026ndash which had been investigating the council\u0027s pay policy since 2009 \u0026ndash the city continued to fight its female employees, discriminate against them, and rack up costs as it defended the controversial Workplace Pay and Benefits Review (WPBR) which had been put in place to stave off equal pay claims.  The public sector union Unison has now written to current Glasgow councillors, briefing them on the findings of the EHRC investigation ahead of a meeting of the City Administration Committee on Thursday where councillors are expected to confirm the scrapping of the existing pay policy.  Both Glasgow City Council and the EHRC had refused to make the watchdog\u0027s conclusions public, despite freedom of information requests from campaigners. However council leader Susan Aitken is understood to have insisted the findings be released as part of her commitment to negotiate a settlement and end the council\u0027s legal battle with 6,000 of its female workers who have brought equal pay claims.  Read more:\u0026nbspCouncils face paying millions extra to female staff pensions  Glasgow only conceded the claims were valid after a series of reversals in the courts in February this year.  But Scotland\u0027s statutory equalities body, after a detailed, independent investigation, had told the council in 2010 that the pay scheme was invalid and discriminatory.  Part of the investigation looked at the WPBR and whether the council\u0027s scheme breached the 1970 Equal Pay Act.  In reports to the council in January and February 2010, the EHRC said that both the design and the implementation of the pay structure appeared to be unfair to women workers.  The first concluded \u0026ldquoThere must therefore be considerable doubt as to whether the design of the job evaluation system used by Glasgow City Council to underpin its Workforce Pay and Benefits Review complies with equal pay legislative requirements generally but also specifically in relation to Pupil Support Assistants employed by the Council\".  The second report, agreed and went further, stating: \"It is difficult to escape the conclusion that ... payments, which are paid disproportionately to men, are offsetting the loss of bonuses\"  Although the pay review had improved the lot of women workers, it still left them earning less than men in similar roles, and denied them access to supplementary payments which were largely on offer only to men. However Glasgow officials continued to insist the pay scheme treated people equally.  Read more:\u0026nbspGlasgow City Council accused of perpetuating equal-pay discrimination  It is not clear whether the elected council members at the time were informed of the outcome of the 2009 investigation or its potential financial implications.  Unison claims the council should have recognised the Commission\u0027s expertise and worked with it to fix the policy.  Peter Hunter, Unison regional manager for Scotland, said: \"The implications of the EHRC papers are very clear. WPBR is invalid, discriminatory and unsuitable to be relied on. The fact that elected members are only now considering the major implications of an investigation from 2009 to 2011 suggest that governance arrangements have failed.\"  \"Why was the litigation allowed to continue for so many years when the council knew that several independent experts had made such critical findings about the merit of the scheme?\"  GMB Scotland Branch Secretary Rhea Wolfson said: \"The level of knowledge someone at the council had, and did nothing with, is enough to take your breath away. Eight years later here we are, women are still working under this scheme while the council has known for nearly a decade it was discriminatory. It is unbelievable.\"  A spokesman for Glasgow City Council said: \u0026ldquoIn 2009 the EHRC had a concern about the terms and conditions of Pupil Support Assistants. This report set out their concerns. After a period of negotiation we reviewed the terms and conditions of PSAs and ensured that they were being paid fairly. The EHRC wrote to us in 2013 confirming they were content with the new arrangements and closing their investigation.  \u0026ldquoEarlier this year, the council\u0026rsquos City Administration Committee took a decision not to continue with litigation and we expect to begin the process of implementing a new pay and grading structure in the coming weeks.  Council leader Susan Aitken said: \"Today, I am bringing forward another paper to the Council to abandon the WPBR, the pay scheme within which discrimination was embedded. I want a commitment from the Council to implement a fair and just pay and grading scheme which pays equally for equal work and which our employees have confidence in.  \"The City Government will continue to work with employee representatives to ensure we do not repeat the mistakes of a decade ago and expose ourselves to fresh inequalities.\""},{"url":null,"title":"headteachers-disappointed-after-ditching-of-legislation-to-give-them-more-power","story":"              HEADTEACHERS have hit out over a government decision to shelve legislation that would have given them more power.  School Leaders Scotland (SLS), which represents the secondary sector, said an opportunity to drive \u0026ldquosignificant positive change had been lost.  And the Association of Headteachers and Deputes in Scotland (AHDS) warned the move to a negotiated future structure \"lacked clarity\"  On Tuesday, Education Secretary John Swinney was accused of the \u0026ldquomother of all climbdowns after shelving his flagship school legislation.  Mr Swinney decided to put his controversial Education (Scotland) Bill on hold because of a lack of parliamentary support.  The Bill was intended to introduce a new Headteachers\u0026rsquo Charter giving school leaders power to set the curriculum, hire staff and control their own finances.  It was also brought forward to underpin new regional bodies set up to support school improvement.  Mr Swinney told the Scottish Parliament he no longer intended to proceed with the Bill for at least a year and instead would \u0026ldquofast-track change in collaboration with local authorities.  However, the agreement with council umbrella body Cosla means there is less certainty over what changes will be made and how the new structures will work.  Jim Thewliss, general secretary of SLS, said: \"We are disappointed in the decision not to legislate in regard of the Headteachers Charter.  \"We felt that empowering headteachers to address issues and opportunities in a manner best suited to the specific circumstances of their school was a powerful way to improve the life chances of Scotland\u0026rsquos young people.  \"We feel that by having proportionate access to the appropriate levers of power headteachers could have driven significant positive change.\"  Greg Dempster, general secretary of AHDS, added: \"There were concerns from primary headteachers about some of the proposals, but it was felt that at least legislation would have given some clarity.  He said: \"The crucial factor as negotiations continue with councils is that we do not add to the burden of bureaucracy facing headteachers because it is already impacting on interest in the job.\"  Joanna Murphy, chairwoman of the National Parent Forum Scotland, also expressed concern.  She said: \"I have received Mr Swinney\u0027s personal reassurance that parental engagement remains a priority for the Scottish Government.  \"While we are disappointed that the parental involvement legislation will not be strengthened and modernised as our review found to be necessary we are hopeful the ongoing local government discussions will incorporate what would have been part of the legislation.\"  A Cosla spokesman said: \"We are pleased that the important role local authorities play has been recognised and that we will retain a central role in the design and development of the curriculum and ultimately the delivery of every aspect of education.\"  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has already made education her top priority and the Education Bill was described as the \u0026ldquocentrepiece of their legislative programme."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/848394.jpg?type=article-full","title":"how-a-co2-shortage-could-burst-the-bubble-on-scotlands-summer-events","story":"              IT\u0027S the shortage that has had most people baffled - and yet threatens to burst the bubble on summer events, barbecues and parties.  While we produce CO2 when we exhale, the gas used in the food processing and drinks industries is produced as a by-product of the fertiliser industry.  It puts the fizz in beer, cider and soft drinks, helps prolong the shelf life of meat and is seen by some as the most humane way to stun animals before slaughter.  But there is a shortage as a number of European fertiliser plans closed down for routine maintenance while only two of five UK plans are operating and this is having its effect in the food and drink industry.    Ei Group, Britain\u0027s biggest pub group that formerly traded as Enterprise Inns says some outlets are running out of certain beer brands.  And the Glasgow Science Centre has had to cancel its summer show because they cannot get dry ice.  Roger White, chief executive of Irn-Bru maker AG Barr said they were \"very concerned about the supply challenges\" while it had invested in additional CO2 storage last year.    \"That having been said, we are working to maintain and maximise our supply, and as we speak we are taking the steps to ensure we have all the products in the right place,\" said Mr Barr, whose company also produces Strathmore spring water, Rockstar energy drinks and its own brand lemonade, limeade, cherryade and cream soda.  Pig processing plant to suspend production amid CO2 shortage  \"Obviously if the difficulties were to become more acute, or circumstances change it would have a significant affect on our ability to produce. But at the minute with a lot of hard work we are getting through okay and we don\u0027t have any availability issues for customers.\"  Heineken said its CO2 supplier is \u0026ldquofacing a major issue with supply availability in the UK.  \u0026ldquoLike many other businesses in the food and drinks industry, we are affected by this shortage, said the Amstel, Foster\u0026rsquos and Strongbow parent company .    C\u0026ampC Group, owner of Tennent\u0026rsquos and Magners, said the company has reassured its customers that availability of its brands is \u0026ldquocurrently unaffected.  The food wholesaler Booker said it was limiting sales of some lines to 10 cases per customer per day to prevent \u0026ldquosub-wholesaling.  The Tesco-owned retailer, which is used by bars, restaurants and traders, said the move was to preserve availability and satisfied the \u0026ldquovast majority of Booker customers.  Tesco said the CO2 shortage had not resulted in any availability issues on any product lines.  However, Booker\u0026rsquos move follows Scotland\u0026rsquos largest pig processing plant, Quality Pork in Brechin, Angus, suspending its slaughtering process. It carried out its last slaughter on Tuesday due to a lack of the gas used to stun animals before they are killed.    Pete Cheema, chief executive of the Scottish Grocers\u0026rsquo Federation said they were \"concerned\" to hear about the impact of the shortage but that despite that they hoped manufacturers \"will be fair\" with the distribution of any remaining stocks of products such beers, ciders and soft drinks.  The British Soft Drinks Association (BSDA) said the shortage of CO2 across northern Europe is \u0026ldquoimpacting a wide range of businesses across the food and drink sector.  \u0026ldquoSoft drinks producers in the UK are taking active steps to maintain their service to customers including working with their suppliers to mitigate the impact as well as looking at alternative sources, said BSDA director general Gavin Partington.  The National Farmers\u0027 Union Scotland last week said six days ago that the CO2 issue was not something that had been raised by poultry members.  Now NFUS has called for CO2 supplies to be redirected to abbatoirs to avoid animal welfare issues.  NFUS\u0026rsquos pigs and poultry, and animal health and welfare policy manager Penny Middleton said: \u0026ldquoThe shortage of CO2 is having a critical impact on the slaughter of pigs and poultry, where gas stunning is the preferred method of slaughter for welfare reasons.  \u0026ldquoThe processing plant at Brechin has already announced that it will not be able to take any more pigs from today, a decision that will impact heavily on pig units reliant on being able to get pigs away.  \u0026ldquoAny disruption to that flow can result in welfare issues and overcrowding.  \u0026ldquoGiven the expectation of animal welfare problems on pig and poultry units NFUS feels that it is vital that CO2 supplies are reserved and directed to those plants in need.  According to the British Meat Processors Association (BMPA) the hot weather is exacerbating the issue and could have a \u0026ldquopotentially huge effect on British food production.  \u0026ldquoThings are getting pretty tight and this hot weather won\u0026rsquot be helping, BMPA\u0026rsquos chief executive Nick Allen said.  The British Retail Consortium (BRC) added: \u0026ldquoWe are aware of specific pressures in some areas such as carbonated soft drinks, beer, British chicken and British pork but the majority of food products are unaffected and retailers do not anticipate food shortages.  \u0026ldquoHowever, it is likely that the mix of products available may be affected."},{"url":null,"title":"england-flag-to-fly-over-no-10-and-scotland-office-for-world-cup","story":"              The Cross of St George will fly over Downing Street \u0026ndash and the Scotland Office in Whitehall \u0026ndash when England take on Belgium in the World Cup this evening.

It would be a mistake to underestimate quite how serious this is: not only is education one of the Government\u0026rsquos biggest weak spots, but First Minister Nicola Sturgeon even publicly requested that her time and record in office be judged on it. When she appointed a political big hitter like Swinney to the post of Education Secretary two years ago, it was a statement of intent. As recently as September last year, Sturgeon was still promising new legislation on education when she outlined her programme for government.  Problems in Scottish education have been thoroughly and robustly debated in recent years. The attainment gap, which is the gulf in performance between pupils from richer and poorer backgrounds, has been well documented. The end of 2016 provided a notable low point, however, when international figures revealed that Scotland\u0026rsquos standards in maths, reading and science were classed as average, which represented further decline. It was disastrous news for the Scottish Government, and demoralising for the nation. It felt like something of a rock bottom it was painful to have confirmation of such a falling performance, and it intensified fears about the future of Scotland\u0026rsquos children.  However, much of the Government\u0026rsquos proposed solutions in recent years for improving matters have been met with dismay. Take standardised testing, for instance. The measure was introduced last year in an effort to assess pupil performance in numeracy and literacy, and mostly tests primary school children. However, critics fear that it could cause undue pressure on pupils and introduce a mood of short-term competition between schools rather than a focus on long term development, despite promises from Swinney that school-by-school data would not be published.  A key part of the currently ditched Education Bill was to give far more power to headteachers over teacher recruitment and budgets instead of local authorities. Again, the Government was met with a barrage of concerns. Teaching union the EIS called for a period of \u0026ldquostability and consolidation and more support for teachers and schools following the introduction of the Curriculum for Excellence in 2010. The programme was developed after a consultation in 2002, and new qualifications were later introduced to work more comfortably alongside it. This was a big change to the delivery of education, and the prospect of further dramatic changes after such a short time, at a point where schools are already under substantial pressure, was met with grave warnings by many in the sector.  But the Government wasn\u0026rsquot entirely without support. The Scottish Conservatives became the only party willing to get on board with it in principle \u0026ndash the prospect of transferring control from local government directly to schools is more ideologically in tune with the Tories\u0026rsquo way of thinking \u0026ndash which was never a comfortable position for the SNP. When the SNP is battering the Tories at Westminster at every opportunity, it was always going to be politically problematic to rely on the party in Scotland to get through its flagship education reforms. If Sturgeon\u0026rsquos legacy is resting on education, it\u0026rsquos unlikely she\u0026rsquod be keen on thanking the Tories for helping to shape it.  And so here we are. Swinney hopes the public will believe that the Government doesn\u0026rsquot really need the legislation anymore because he\u0026rsquos had a word with local authorities and they\u0026rsquove decided between them that they can just \u0026ldquofast track a number of changes without the need for all that parliamentary time wasting. That\u0026rsquos only credible if he really expects people to believe that Sturgeon installed one of her top people in one of the most important roles of her Government only in order to have a word with local councils.  What it really means is that the Government, at least to some extent, is going back to the drawing board. While this is politically humiliating, it will be met with a sigh of relief from campaigners and others opposed to the approach, who will now hope that the Scottish Government has a radical rethink about how to fix its education nightmare.  But it\u0026rsquos halfway through 2018 and the Scottish Parliament goes into recess this week. Time is running out for the SNP to demonstrate enough visible progress in education before the next Scottish elections, and make no mistake: if Nicola Sturgeon wants to be judged on education, her opponents at the ballot box will be relentless in attacking her over a failure to deliver results.  So it was interesting, this week, to see Sturgeon make such sweeping changes to her Cabinet while Swinney tried to quietly retire one of the biggest legislative priorities of the Government. It\u0026rsquos not only in education that Sturgeon\u0026rsquos Government has problems the now former health secretary Shona Robison, for example, had been tipped for some time to be on the way out following criticisms of NHS performance. She\u0026rsquoll be replaced by Jeane Freeman, a rising star of the party who was previously trusted with the social security brief despite only being elected in 2016. Indeed, it was a good day for rising stars, including big names like Humza Yousaf, who found themselves promoted.  Sturgeon may be hoping that a shake up of the Cabinet will play well for the party as it gears up for Brexit and the next Scottish elections in 2021, although it did come as a surprise to see the newly elected deputy leader of the party, Keith Brown, leave his post as Economy Secretary \u0026ndash it seems peculiar, despite the official line that he needs to focus his efforts on party business.  Swinney, however, remains in his brief. To move him out of education, effectively admitting a massive failure, would have been unthinkable. It would have been humiliating for the Government, and it would have caused real damage to Sturgeon\u0026rsquos leadership.  The SNP hierarchy may be hoping they get away with their big education climb down, but it\u0026rsquos an open goal for the opposition unless the Government can pull something amazing out of the bag in a short time. If not, Sturgeon\u0026rsquos 2015 plea to be judged on education may severely haunt her at the ballot box. Be careful what you wish for."},{"url":null,"title":"ken-smiths-diary-cant-lick-it-taking-the-hat-and-winging-it","story":"              Can\u0027t lick it  WHO doesn\u0027t want an ice cream in this sunny weather?

Says Mike McGeachy: \"I was at a function where Dunfermline stalwart Jim Leishman was a guest speaker, and he recounted the tale of a Pars game against Rangers at East End Park. Jim was given the unenviable task of man marking Gers legend and captain John Greig by manager Harry Melrose. \u0027Gie him a kick whenever ye can, Jim\u0027 said Melrose, \u0027and if ye can get him carried off, so much the better\u0027. Jim said, \u0027Boss, but whit if I get sent aff?\u0027 Melrose replied, \u0027Dinna worry about that son, they\u0027ll miss him mer than we\u0027ll miss you\u0027.\"  Seeing red  OUR gag about colour blindness reminds Stephen in Erskine: \"Sitting at traffic lights, my wife asked, \u0027How would you know whether or not to stop if you were colour blind? How would you know the red light was on?\u0027 I explained that everyone knew the top light was the red light so if the top light is lit then you need to stop. A few moments silence. \u0027But what if you couldn\u0026rsquot tell if the light was lit or not?\u0027 \u0027Well,\u0027 says I, \u0027then you\u0026rsquod actually be blind and you shouldn\u0026rsquot be driving\u0027.\"  Fringe benefit  THE curiosities of social media. Someone asked online about mundane meeting with celebrities, and a Peter Gravestone replied: \"A drunk I stopped falling in the road in Edinburgh insisted on introducing me to comedian Jasper Carrot saying repeatedly, \u0026lsquoJasper, this man just saved my life.\u0026rsquo I was mortified. And it was Frank Skinner.\"  Bottled it  AFTER the news story about police officers being taken to the island of Lismore after the first housebreaking in living memory, reader John Marshall in Auchtermuchty recalls: \"In the early-1960s we spent a long day on Lismore, and my Father went into the phone box to contact the Appin ferryman to get an earlier crossing. He came out to say there was a full bottle of whisky on the shelf. When he quizzed the ferryman he was told that when a local ran dry he would phone the mainland, the ferryman left the bottle and he would collect and pay later. \u0027We are all honest here,\u0027 he said. \u0027There is no thieving on Lismore\u0027.\""},{"url":null,"title":"brian-beacom-as-melvyn-bragg-suggests-if-were-not-clever-were-going-to-end-up-stupid","story":"              WE have become a nation of airheads. Round up any cross section of our younger population and you\u0026rsquoll discover an IQ just a little higher than that of a council wheely bin. Who says so? Well, Melvyn Bragg, (not in so many words) in declaring Britain to be \u0026ldquoa stupid country.  Now, should we believe the Radio 4 presenter simply because he can leap from talking about the ceremonial capital of the Achaemenid Empire one minute to the understanding of the proton in a heartbeat? You bet. Because Bragg isn\u0026rsquot bragging from the vantage point of a higher intellect. He\u0026rsquos summing up the growing fear of a growing nation of non-thinkers.  The evidence is in our faces and Facebook pages. We used to ridicule the Santa Ponsa restaurants which put pictures of food in their windows. Now we live in a world of posing, pouting young people who take pictures of their dinner.  We live in a world where 25 per cent of young Scots are classed as \"extreme users of social media,\" which the Government\u0027s Information Commissioner is now investigating.  Meanwhile, video games are shrinking their brains. A new study by the University of California reveals the impulsive part of the brain (the amygdala-striatal system) which video games rely upon, is not only more sensitive but also smaller in excessive users.  Koko the gorilla died last week in California, and decades-long studies revealed he had an IQ of around 90, which is close to some humans. But it\u0026rsquos not surprising the primates are catching up when you learn one-in-five young Scots wake up during the night to check their phone.  One study by British scientists found IQs have started to fall by seven points per generation after having risen every decade since the Second World War. And technology is one of the reasons why.  Clever people are continually coming up with ways to make the rest of us dafter. The more we ask Alexis and co to play us a song, the less we have to think.  Smart gadgets mean we don\u0026rsquot need to switch on the light, or use a map to find our way around. We can ask Google almost anything. We love Twitter because it\u0026rsquos brief and we even text less now. We send emojis. Pretty soon we\u0026rsquoll go back to communicating in sign language. But by that time, the apes will be using our iPads.  Soon we won\u0026rsquot need to think to drive cars. We have Fitbits to tell us how many steps we need to take to lose weight, but the truth is all we have to do is look in the mirror. (Here\u0026rsquos a general rule of thumb if you have breasts, and you\u0026rsquore a man, pull on the trainers and T-shirt.)  Writer/historian/former editor of the New Internationalist, Graham Hancock has long argued we have devolved over the years, given less need to think on our feet. Where man once built perfectly measured pyramids with keen eye and sharp imagination, we can\u0026rsquot get the same results today even with a theodolite.  Devolution seems to be evidenced in our TV output and while Melvyn Bragg points out there has been some great TV this year, including Patrick Melrose (Sky) and A Very English Scandal (BBC1). (And he\u0026rsquos correct populist entertainment can also be very clever. ) But he points out little else matches up. The correlation of this is the recognition of the inane predictability of drama such as Dr Foster or recent divorce series The Split. (Both insulting to women.)  Lord Bragg does say he\u0026rsquos yet to watch Love Island but when he does view this Bikini and Budgie Smugglers Show it will indeed highlight the vacuity of the format and those who take part. Yes, it\u0026rsquos can be fun, and when one young lady said she didn\u0026rsquot know what Brexit actually meant, that was understandable given Theresa May doesn\u0026rsquot either. But what\u0026rsquos tragic is the most popular programme in the country right now mostly features the hard of thinking. And watching the show suggests we\u0026rsquore becoming as dim-witted as them.  There\u0026rsquos also an argument we\u0026rsquore producing more clever young people given the huge rise in Firsts handed out by universities this year. But as Herald writer Rosemary Goring pointed out this is a deliberate strategy by universities to manipulate results to make their courses more attractive.  The reality is Bragg is right. For \u0026ldquostupid you can also read \u0026ldquofrivolous or \u0026ldquofatuous. That\u0026rsquos why we need to encourage learning. We need to encourage discussion, and not by text or Snapchat. School children need to be given books, taken to films that may make them think and encouraged to read newspapers. We need to switch on our own lights.

I like you even less now."},{"url":null,"title":"influential-new-culture-czar-position-is-proposed-by-scottish-governments-culture-strategy","story":"              SCOTLAND is set to have a major new cultural power-broker at the heart of government to help boost the arts.  A new \u0027Culture Czar\u0027 position, proposed in the Scottish Government\u0027s new Culture Strategy, would be one of the most powerful and influential cultural figures in the nation.  The \"cultural leadership post\" would advise ministers on cultural matters, as well as guide the strategy plan to see culture as a \"central consideration across all policy areas\".  The role, yet to be officially titled nor its parameters detailed, will be comparable to the Chief Medical Offer in health policy, or the Lord Advocate to the courts, insiders said.  The position would be \"supported by strategic thinkers from across the culture sectors\".  One senior source said: \"This position will help ensure that culture is embedded in all policies.  \"There is a role for a senior role advocating for culture - just as there are similar roles elsewhere in government.\"  It is unclear how this post would interact with the Culture Secretary - a position currently held by Fiona Hyslop - or the senior management of Creative Scotland, which is the nation\u0027s main arts funder.  Creative Scotland was set up as an \"arms length\" body, so that Government would have no role in individual funding decisions.  The new role is a key part of the new Cultural Strategy, which its authors hope will mean culture is considered a key and pervasive part of Government decision making in the future.  The strategy document has now been published and a public consultation will run for 12 weeks until September 19.  This is not the first National Cultural Strategy published in Scotland.  In 2000 the then-Scottish Executive launched a strategy which \"celebrated excellence\" and also emphasised the social benefits of cultural funding.  In 2003, the First Minister Jack McConnell also set out an \"arts for all\" vision in a St Andrew\u0027s Day address, in which he said culture was \"pervasive and fundamental\" to society.  Some artists and others within the cultural world have expressed unease over a direct government intervention in culture in the form of a strategy.  It is also understood that there were initial misgivings in government over how a culture strategy could have concrete recommendations, when the Scottish Government is keen to not give the impression of meddling with artists and their work.  The document says it believes culture should be \"free to be inspiring, disruptive and plural.\"  The strategy has already had a long period of consultation, including with cultural figures at a meeting in Glasgow.  The draft says that the Scottish Government \"has levers and responsibilities that it can deploy to support culture, such as: taking an overview of national ambitions, outcomes and priorities and working towards an overall vision for society in Scotland\" as well as \"articulating a national and international outlook which has the ability to influence.\"  Sir James MacMillan, the Scottish composer, said on Twitter: \"A cultural leadership role in Government is not required and smacks of one voice nationalism.\"  He also said the cultural strategy was \"facile and pointless\".  The Scottish Government document says the strategy will lead to \"long term change through greater collaboration and integration across culture, communities and policy development.\"  The document says that culture is \"central to Scotland\u0026rsquos cultural, social and economic prosperity.\"  It also details how the government will commit to \"exploring new funding models to support the culture sector and to develop the creative economy that includes new partnerships and examining the potential of Scottish Government powers such as budgets, Scottish National Investment Bank, devolved tax and legislative powers that will generate a collective responsibility to supporting culture in the long term.\"  The strategy document also looks at the issues facing the largely freelance \"cultural workforce\".  A statement by Creative Scotland said: \"We are particularly pleased to see an emphasis on achieving long term change through collaboration across different areas of society and different areas of Government policy.  \"The emphasis on equalities, diversity and inclusion is also significant in terms of how we all provide support for artists, cultural organisations and communities in order to see Scotland\u0026rsquos culture continue to thrive.  \"Creative Scotland will consider the draft strategy and respond.\""},{"url":null,"title":"msps-seek-views-on-opt-out-organ-donation","story":"              A Holyrood committee is seeking views on plans to introduce an opt-out system of organ donation in Scotland.

The change would mean people would be assumed to have consented to their organs being used to help others unless they had signed an opt-out, potentially increasing the number of organ transplants that can take place in Scotland each year.  The proposed new system also includes protection for adults without capacity to understand, adults residing in Scotland for less than 12 months and children under 16, who will only be able to donate if they, or someone on their behalf, explicitly authorises it.  The Scottish Government announced plans for the new \"soft opt-out\" system last year after a public consultation revealed 82% backing for the change.  Committee convener Lewis Macdonald MSP said: \"There is no doubt that increasing the number of organ donations and having fewer people dying whilst waiting for a transplant is something we all want to see happen.  \"However, this is a complex and difficult issue and there has been much debate and discussion about the most appropriate system for organ donation in Scotland and indeed the rest of the world.

Sue Ryder launched an appeal in June 2017 to double the size of its local neurological care centre, which cares for people living with long-term neurological conditions including Huntington’s disease, multiple sclerosis and acquired brain injuries.                                                    The expansion project was introduced in response to the growing demand for neurological care in the North East of Scotland. Sue Ryder Dee View Court is currently home to 24 people living with complex and long-term conditions, with a waiting list double this amount.        The appeal has already reached £2.2million, with the charity now encouraging community fundraisers to set their targets in £1,000 segments, or ‘bricks’ as part of the Brick by Brick campaign - each £1,000 raised equates to one brick in the new centre. Emma Leiper Finlayson, Capital Appeal Manager for Sue Ryder Dee View Court said: “There’s a desperate need for unified neurological care in Scotland and our waiting list increases all the time.  We urgently need to expand, and our Dee View appeal is the first step in Sue Ryder’s strategy to care for more people who need help to live well and thrive across Scotland.“Since launching the appeal, we have been overwhelmed and delighted with the response from the community. In particular, the Brick by Brick initiative, which has been a fantastic platform to engage local companies and schools in some fun and creative fundraising. By buying a brick for the extension they are quite literally helping us build brighter futures for people in their community.“Of course, our residents have been involved in the appeal too, with one recently taking part in the Aberdeen Kiltwalk with her family, whilst other residents have encouraged their friends and family to undertake challenges, such as the Great Aberdeen Run. We regularly get our residents together to brainstorm fundraising ideas and they have been tracking progress there’s a real buzz each time we reach a new milestone.”                                                                                                        To support the Sue Ryder Dee View Court Appeal visit www.sueryder.org/deeviewappeal or send a cheque made out to ‘Sue Ryder’ to: Sue Ryder Dee View Court, Caiesdykes Road, Kincorth, Aberdeen, AB12 5JY.For more information on how to involved with Brick by Brick, visit: www.sueryder.org/brickbybrick.

And from today, people who would previously have made a claim to Income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance, Employment and Support Allowance, Income support, Working and Child Tax Credit and Housing Benefit will instead claim Universal Credit.        A £1.5bn package of improvements making it easier for people moving onto Universal Credit was announced in the Budget. People applying to Universal Credit can now receive a 100% advance on their first payment and the 7-day waiting period for new claimants was removed earlier this year. Among other improvements, from April 2018 the Government also continues to pay Housing Benefit claimants’ rent for two weeks - which is non-recoverable - when moving onto Universal Credit.Minister for Employment Alok Sharma said: “Universal Credit is central to our commitment to help families improve their lives by moving into work. We know it’s working – with Universal Credit people are moving into work faster and staying in work longer than under the old system. “And now we are rolling it out to a wider range of people in a safe and controlled way. From today, more people, including families and disabled people, can claim Universal Credit and access the extra help it provides.”Single jobseekers are already receiving support from their dedicated work coach to find employment or increase their hours and earnings. Now, all types of claimants will be able to benefit from the improved, personalised, one-to-one support that Universal Credit offers.

We’d encourage anyone who needs extra help or information to come and talk to their work coach.”Those on Universal Credit will now have 24-hour access to an online account that they can use to manage their claim, including reporting changes of circumstances, checking the details of their claim and date of their next Universal Credit payment.

It will provide on-board workshops, spare parts storage, crane and office facilities but will get supplies from another large vessel. By contrast the BOWL project will use smaller crew transfer vessels on a daily basis to provide crew and supplies.\u0026ldquoIt is just a different strategy being used at MORL and we could not accommodate that size of vessel at Wick as we do not have the shelter and water depth required, he said. \u0026ldquoIf we had our new quay at Shaltigoe we would have been able to accommodate it.But Mr Watt is confident the harbour will still play a part in servicing the MORL project and in other renewable projects in the Moray Firth basin.

It is a testament to the capabilities of the people and the product that major companies keep coming back to us.The confirmation of the latest contract comes just months after Subsea 7 won an order from Statoil for its Snorre oil and gas field in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea. Its total value was said to be between \u0026pound150 million and \u0026pound300m.Work on that contract is expected to get under way in September with three launches due to be completed by November next year.The orders will see the company\u0026rsquos local workforce increase from around 30, at present, to up to 160.\u0026ldquoThis will give us continual work in Caithness until 2020, although there will be peaks and troughs along the way \u0026ndash but this is great news all round, Mr Watt added.Jonathan Tame, company vice president for the UK and Canada, said: \u0026ldquoWe are pleased to have the opportunity to bring our extensive expertise to a project of this importance.\u0026ldquoIn doing so it demonstrates Shell\u0026rsquos confidence in our value-adding solutions, and continues a successful North Sea collaboration that has been in place since 1984.The Penguins field was discovered in 1974 and first developed in 2002.The three pipeline bundles for Statoil will involve the largest diameter pipe assembled in the far north.The bulk of the fabrication will be done in Caithness, with design and project management work due to be undertaken at Subsea7\u0026rsquos premises in Aberdeen and at Stavanger in Norway.At the time that order was announced in December last year, Mr Watt said: \u0026ldquoIt is good to have Statoil back.

The crew also carried out maintenance work on lights and lanterns.As time went by the vessel was employed in the conversion of automated lighthouses to solar panel operation.

His first order of priority, however, must be the unfinished business of implementing cheaper ferry fares on ferry routes serving Orkney and Shetland.“Having already waited a decade since the government first introduced RET on west coast routes, people in the Northern Isles should not have to wait any longer.“The First Minister promised RET in the first half of 2018. That means Michael Matheson must deliver before parliament rises for the summer recess at the end of this week.”Mr Halcro Johnston says that the Northern Isles have been left in limbo by the RET uncertainties, adding that he has written to Mr Matheson in a bid to see the RET commitment delivered.He said: “The new transport secretary has just days to implement RET for ferry fares to Orkney and Shetland, in line with commitment made by his predecessor and after years of promises from the SNP.“The constant delays we have seen regarding RET have caused real uncertainty in the Northern Isles and have left residents and visitors unable to plan journeys knowing what the eventual costs will be.\u0026#8221\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

I came here in 2016 and part of what drew me was the juxtaposition of a cultural and natural heritage site. Inverewe House was always a Gaelic-speaking place and there\u0026rsquos something about the spirit of the place which is inspirational.\"I\u0026rsquove always wanted this place to help grow the community and be part of it and we have a number of other events planned.\"The festival commemorates Iain \"Dall\" MacAoidh (1656-1754), piper to Mackenzie of Gairloch. Blind from the age of seven as the result of smallpox, the legendary Blind Piper was a pupil of the great MacCrimmon of Skye, going on to compose perhaps the finest piobaireachd ever.The aim of the festival is to encourage pipers under the age of 18 to participate in friendly and relaxing competitions. Chairman Ian Blake of Aultgrishan said it was an exciting setting for competitors and \"will provide visitors to the gardens with a unique opportunity to hear some of the most gifted young inheritors of our much cherished Highland heritage\". Entries are now open in a variety of classes. He can be contacted at emailing mackenzie@iambik.orgMeanwhile Inverewe is anticipating the bursting into colour of a Puya alpestris, which resembles a giant asparagus, for the first time in seven years.Thursday 28 Jun 2018 2:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Dingwall were named runners-up with Alness third and Invergordon fifth.

It also found that 62 per cent of posts are in professional occupations.Eilean Siar, Glasgow and Highland are the three areas with the highest number of jobs in which Gaelic is considered essential, together accounting for 93 per cent of the Scottish total.The study was welcomed by Deputy First Minister, John Swinney, who commented that the growth in desirable and essential jobs making use of Gaelic language would provide young people with a wealth of exciting career choices.\"I hope that this report will encourage more people to consider learning Gaelic,\" he added.As well as looking at the demand for Gaelic language skills, the report looks at Gaelic education, analyses the opportunities and challenges, and suggests future action.Damien Yeates, chief Executive of SDS, said: \"Developing a detailed evidence base of current and future skills demand is essential for all parts of our economy, and the Gaelic language labour market is no exception.\"Last year SDS published the second edition of its Gaelic language plan, and this study was one of the key commitments contained in that plan.\"The evidence will help inform future investment aimed at promoting the Gaelic language and culture.\"Shona MacLennan, chief executive of B\u0026ograverd na G\u0026agraveidhlig, commented: \"B\u0026ograverd na G\u0026agraveidhlig is clear that growing the number of Gaelic-essential jobs and jobs which use Gaelic is important in ensuring that Gaelic is used more often, by more people and in a wider range of situations.\"The key challenge is to ensure that the flow of people with high quality Gaelic language skills entering the labour market is matched to the demand from employers across the public, private and third sectors, and from across Scotland.\"\u0026nbspFuture actions proposed in the report include forming a national group with responsibility for Gaelic language skills, and increased monitoring and evaluation of the activities supporting the language.Charlotte Wright, Chief Executive of Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE), said: \"Gaelic is fundamental to HIE\u0026rsquos unique remit which integrates economic and community development throughout the Highlands and Islands.\"Our support has helped numerous organisations which enable Gaelic to flourish, and we look forward to continuing to work with businesses, social enterprises and community organisations that can add value through using Gaelic to help realise its full potential.\"Thursday 28 Jun 2018 2:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

However as soon as he was able, he was back in the saddle.The supermarket worker was delighted with his recent racing success followed by his selection for the GB squad for the world championships at the end of July and beginning of August.\"I really wanted to retain the national title but this year I knew I had my work cut out as I was up against my friend and main competitor Ben Watson who is a full time GB rider,\" he said.\"It was a great race. I felt good going into it and was able to counter any attacks and came down to a sprint where I was able to take the win.\"The news got better when British Cycling announced the world championship squad for this year with my name on it.

The project also details Avoch\u0026rsquos fishing heritage, and more information on this can be found on panels at the harbour and among the \"streeties\" \u0026ndash the rows of old fishermen\u0026rsquos cottages.Funding for the new project was provided by Avoch Heritage Association in recognition of the work AKCC is doing to promote the village and its historical significance.The community council\u0026rsquos chairwoman Sarah Dunton said: \"Volunteers from AKCC carried out the restoration work on the wooden frame and also created the updated information panel.\u0026nbsp\"It is a testament to the great team spirit existing within AKCC.\u0026nbsp\"We are very grateful to Avoch Heritage Association for generously funding this project.\u0026nbsp\"It will encourage not just residents of Avoch and Killen but also visitors to the Black Isle to enjoy the beautiful scenery and wildlife surrounding us.\"Thursday 28 Jun 2018 2:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Most damaging of all, Loganair noted, was the announcement by Flybe that it was entering a new franchise agreement with Eastern Airways and would compete head-to-head on six routes.            Despite the turbulence, Loganair booked record turnover of £110.7m, a rise of 7 per cent. Passenger numbers were up 6.2 per cent to an all-time high of 812,541, but the load factor – the percentage of seats filled on scheduled flights – fell from 62.8 per cent to 59.8 per cent, due to the overcapacity on routes with Flybe competition. Just under 78 per cent of flights ran on time.Chairman David Harrison said: “This year’s results bring to an end 17 consecutive years in profit for Loganair, and the fact that we forecast last year that we would be loss-making in 2017/18 makes it no less painful.“The extent of the loss is a direct result of competition on six of our eight largest routes, and from the outset we maintained that the markets on these routes were simply not big enough to sustain the level of seat capacity being introduced. This indeed proved to the case.“However, these costs are non-recurring, and Loganair is now on the front foot and ready for a successful year ahead.”Managing director Jonathan Hinkles added: “In a challenging year, I’m delighted to say that the transition from franchise partner to an airline operating in its own right was completed on schedule.            “In the last 12 months we have transformed our operation with wholesale changes to our reservations, revenue accounting and check-in systems.“We have carried out a full rebrand, repainted our aircraft in tartan livery, introduced new crew and ground staff uniform, brought in a comprehensive system of service improvements for our customers and launched a significant sales and marketing programme.“I’m equally pleased to be able to report that the response from our customers to these developments has been extremely positive.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4754753.1528987528!/image/image.jpg","title":"in pictures how to make your own scottish morning rolls","story":"\t\tMorning rolls are one of Scotland\u0026#8217s best loved foods, Scottish food writer Fraser Wright provides a recipe on how to make your own.\t\t\t\tYou need to start these the night before you want to eat them, however they last well and toast very well too.            What you’ll need:              • 500g Canadian strong white bread flour (or a flour with a high gluten content, i.e. at least 14 per cent) • 30g lard or vegetable shortening • 10g sugar • 10g salt • 5g fast action yeast             • 400ml cold water For the Coating • 50g plain flour • 50g rice cones/flourView our STEP BY STEP GALLERY HERE            Method: 1 Rub the fat into the flour in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the sugar, salt and yeast. 2 Now pour in the water and mix until it is all incorporated. This is a wet dough but when you are using bread flour with such a high gluten content it can easily take that much water without becoming sloppy. 3 Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it for 1 minute until the dough has just become smooth with all the ingredients thoroughly combined. 4 With such a long ferment you don’t need to knead it too much. Put the dough back into the bowl and cover loosely with cling film. Put the bowl in the refrigerator to leave it to ferment for 12 – 16 hours.             5 The next morning combine the rice cones and plain flour for the coating. Take a large baking sheet and dust it liberally with the coating mixture (make sure to leave enough to coat the rolls). 6 Empty the dough on to a work surface which has been liberally dusted with the rice/flour coating mixture. This is where a large silicone spatula or scraper is useful. 7 Now using a dough scraper divide the dough into 8 pieces. Don’t worry if it is sticky or messy as these rolls aren’t supposed to look perfect. 8 Dust your fingers with the coating mixture and take each piece of dough, one at a time, and dip it into the coating mixture and place it on the baking sheet. They don’t need to be in the shape of a roll but try to keep in the air that is inside the dough. 9 Do this with each piece, placing them near to each other so that when they rise they will bake together. Despite the stickiness of this dough the coating mixture works wonders for stopping the dough from sticking to everything. Leave them to rise for 1 – 2 hours or until doubled in size. 10 Bake in a 250˚C preheated oven on a high shelf for 15 – 20 minutes or until the tops are dark. The rolls should be well fired for the right flavour.• Recipe submitted by Fraser Wright Read more: The history of morning rolls, including a recipe for making your ownRead more: A history of the square sausage, including a recipe for making your own"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4760987.1530170445!/image/image.jpg","title":"snp put indyref2 ahead of vote on brexit deal","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...\t\tThe SNP has put securing a second independence referendum ahead of supporting a vote on the terms of the UK\u0026#8217s Brexit deal in the clearest signal yet that a hard Brexit would trigger a new bid to break up the UK.\t\t\t\tWestminster leader Ian Blackford said the Nationalists would insist on the right to another independence referendum if one was held on the terms of the UK’s Brexit deal, amid growing pressure for a so-called ‘People’s Vote’.            Former Prime Minister Tony Blair and the British Medical Association yesterday issued new calls for a referendum that supporters claim could keep the UK in the EU.            READ MORE: Kezia Dugdale: ‘I bought flat with I’m a Celeb earnings’On Saturday, 100,000 people protested outside Westminster to demand a vote on the Brexit deal, despite the Government’s insistence that it will not allow one to take place.READ MORE: Scotland Office to fly England flag for World CupMr Blackford suggested any ‘People’s Vote’ would have to be tied to a second independence referendum in case the rest of the UK chose for a second time to leave the EU, taking Britain out of the single market and customs union.He said securing indyref2 came ahead of any vote on the terms of Brexit in the “ranking choice in terms of what our preference would be”.            And as Nicola Sturgeon assembled a new government in Edinburgh, her leader at Westminster said: “We must not lose sight of the option of having an independence referendum.”Mr Blackford said: “What we’ve said is that if there was a proposition for a [second EU] vote, of course we wouldn’t stand in the way of that.“What I would say, though is that we already have a mandate from the people of Scotland and the Scottish Parliament, if there is a change in circumstances, that we should have a discussion with the people of Scotland and a vote on independence.“If we were talking about a ranking choice in terms of what our preference would be, it would very much be a decision of the Scottish people on our constitutional future, rather than anything else.            “If we are faced with a second EU vote, it’s about how Scotland’s position is respected within that. For example, if we end up in a situation where the rest of the UK voted no again, but Scotland voted to Remain, how is our position respected?”The SNP MP added: “In a situation where we were dragged out of the single market and the customs union against our will – and we’re talking about a material change in circumstances, the phrase that was used in the manifesto in 2016 – then we must not lose sight of the option of having an independence referendum.”At the weekend, Mr Blackford said the SNP had an “open ear” to calls for a referendum on the UK’s Brexit deal.Ms Sturgeon has said she will reveal whether the Scottish Government will restart demands for a second independence referendum “once we get some clarity” on the detail of the UK’s exit deal, likely in the autumn.Her cabinet reshuffle this week saw newly-elected SNP deputy leader Keith Brown leave the government to focus on preparing for a future independence campaign.            Supporters of the People’s Vote campaign believe momentum is growing for the public to have the final say on the deal Theresa May brings back from Brussels.Labour MP Ian Murray said Mr Blackford’s comment “exposes the SNP for what they are”.Mr Murray said: “They would rather a Tory Brexit so they can break their promise of a once in a generation independence vote than give the public a democratic vote on the Brexit deal.\u2028“They are as bad as the Tories at putting their narrow ideological party interests before the interests of the country.“Supporters of a People’s Vote will see that they did nothing to stop this act of self harm for the country.”In a speech at the Chatham House foreign affairs think tank on Wednesday, Mr Blair warned that paralysis over the type of Brexit the UK should seek risked plunging Britain into the politics of the 1930s.“Parliament must assert itself because neither government nor opposition can or will,” Mr Blair said. “Then the people must make the final decision because only they have the right to decide what version of Brexit they want or whether in the light of all they now know they prefer to remain.” He suggested the Brexit date should be delayed.Also on Wednesday, the BMA passed a motion at its UK annual conference warning Britain’s departure from the EU poses a “major threat” to health and calling for a referendum on the terms of Brexit.The Royal College of Nursing and Royal College of Midwives have also recently supported calls for the public to have a final say on the Brexit deal.Meanwhile, at Prime Minister’s Questions, Mrs May came under fresh pressure over Cabinet battles on Brexit that have increasingly moved into the open.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn claimed the Prime Minister was having to “negotiate round the clock” with her own ministers to prevent the government from collapsing.Today’s European Council summit in Brussels is expected to give little time to Brexit, with EU states focusing on migration and Russia, though leaders of the remaining 27 members will receive an update on negotiations in Mrs May’s absence tomorrow.All eyes are now on a Cabinet awayday at Chequers at the end of next week, at which the Prime Minister aims to finally secure Cabinet backing for her vision of the UK’s future relations with the EU.The plans, covering issues such as trade and security, are due to be set out in a long-awaited white paper next month, which is expected to outline in detail how the Prime Minister sees the UK engaging with the single market and customs union.Fresh from having his job beefed up with a seat around the Cabinet table, the Scottish Government minister responsible for the constitution and Brexit, Michael Russell arrived in London for talks between the UK and devolved governments about the white paper, but said the meeting was a “deeply unsatisfactory experience”.Mr Russell suggested the trip had been a waste of time, telling journalists: “I don’t know much more now than I did when I got out of my bed this morning.” He said: “I have to report that we have not seen a single word of the white paper today. If you have a ministerial forum to discuss the white paper, you would expect there would be a piece of paper.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4760309.1530088555!/image/image.jpg","title":"tom peterkin reshuffle was long overdue but when it came it was dramatic","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...\t\tNicola Sturgeon\u0026#8217s reshuffle may have been a long time coming, but when it did come it was nothing if not dramatic, writes Tom Peterkin\t\t\t\tSix ministers have gone and there is the possibility of more casualties tomorrow when the First Minister finalises her junior ministerial team.            In the relatively brief history of devolution, one has to go back to Jack McConnell’s reshuffle of November 2001 to find one of comparable ferocity. Then, five senior and two junior ministers went in a reshuffle that earned the then Labour first minister the nickname “Jack the Knife”. Mr (now Lord) McConnell wielded the axe within hours of taking the top job. In contrast, it has taken Ms Sturgeon months, if not years, to carry out a similar exercise.            Yesterday’s reshuffle was long overdue. For many months now a somewhat tired-looking ministerial team had seemed to struggle to get a grip on domestic issues. In some ways that feeling of drift was typified yesterday with the Scottish Government having to deal with news on cancer waiting times and Education Secretary John Swinney shelving key education legislation.As Ms Sturgeon’s right hand man, Mr Swinney was always going to be safe from yesterday’s blood-letting. The same was not true of her good friend, Health Secretary Shona Robison. Ms Robison has been a lame duck struggling to swim against a tide of poor NHS performance indicators. As was clear from her resignation letter, Ms Robison has also had some very difficult personal issues to contend with. In those circumstances, it is perhaps easy to understand why she would want some time away from the pressure cooker environment of Cabinet politics. Ms Sturgeon will be sad to see the departure of one of her oldest friends in politics. But the truth is a fresh face is desperately needed at what is always one of the trickiest portfolios for a government.• READ MORE: Scottish Government Cabinet Reshuffle: Who’s in and Who’s out?            All sorts of spin can be spun about Keith Brown moving into an enhanced depute role with the SNP, but the reality is that Scotland’s economic growth is still lagging behind the rest of the UK. Mr Brown is a casualty of the decision to put his brief under Finance Secretary Derek Mackay’s umbrella – a change that seems entirely sensible. Angela Constance’s departure is perhaps not unexpected with her post going to former public health minister Aileen Campbell. Of the promotions, Humza Yousaf faces a tough job as Justice Secretary. That is clear given the challenges that Michael Matheson has faced, having to get to grips with the dysfunctional nature of Police Scotland. Mr Yousaf has shown himself to be a politician of determination in his handling of the notoriously tricky transport brief – which now goes to Mr Matheson, who remains in the Cabinet. Jeane Freeman, who in a previous life was a Labour adviser, has long been seen as a politician destined for the Cabinet. She has the unenviable task of taking over the health brief that always proves so difficult no matter who is in charge.             So far Ms Freeman has proved herself relatively sure-footed, aside from an episode last year when she was accused of making a clumsy attempt at smearing a nurse in a TV debate.The return of Michael Russell is an indication of Brexit looming on the horizon, while Shirley Anne Somerville faces the intimidating task of setting up Scotland’s social security system."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4760978.1530177430!/image/image.jpg","title":"scotland set for hottest day on record","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...\t\tScotland could set a new record temperature today after the sunshine yesterday smashed statistics that have stood for a quarter of a century.\t\t\t\tThe mercury hit a sweltering 31.3C in Aviemore in the Highlands, making it the warmest day of the year so far and the hottest June day since 1995.window.twttr = (function(d, s, id) {            Aboyne, in Aberdeenshire, was almost as hot, with a high of 30.1C.

At Luss beach, Loch Lomond, the sizzling temperature saw beachgoers sunbathing and taking a dip in its waters.Karalee Conboy, 35, who travelled from Glasgow, said: “I often come here with my children when the weather is good. It’s good – as long as they are happy, I am happy. We’ll have a picnic and build some sandcastles.“We were going to go abroad but then I thought why go away when we’ve got this on our own doorstep, it’s a lovely place. Scotland is definitely underestimated but it really is one of the nicest places.”Iain Elliot, 47, from Bristol, who towed his boat north last Saturday to enjoy the Scottish sun, said: “It’s something special and we’ve been lucky with the weather.            “I come up every year and it’s a special place. I love the scenery so much and you are never disappointed.”Restaurant worker Marta Garcia, 26, from Spain, said: “I have lived here for three years now and love it. The weather today is so good and I’m really just sad that I have to go to work at 5pm. “This is the first time I’ve been out here in ages when the sun is out and I just want to stay.”It was also the hottest day of the year so far across the UK, with thermometers peaking at 31.9C in Porthmadog in Wales.But with the heatwave expected to continue today, meteorologists said temperatures in Scotland could even go on to break the June record of 32.2C, measured in 1893 at Ochtertyre in Perthshire.            Met Office forecaster Mark Wilson said: “We’re keeping a close eye on temperatures, as highs of around 31C or 32C are expected in some places on Thursday. At this point it looks unlikely to beat 32.2C, but it’s not out of the question.”But not everyone has been basking in tropical heat.Shetland, though warmer than it has been for the previous couple of days, saw a much chillier 11C in the coolest parts.However, Scots are being asked not to waste water during the dry weather due to concerns that reservoirs are running low.Scottish Water has issued warnings over supplies in Elgin, Forres, Kinloss and Stornoway, asking customers to “use water wisely”.The firm said the heatwave coupled with increased demand means “efficiency measures” are needed, such as turning taps off while brushing teeth, taking shorter showers, not over-filling kettles and using watering cans instead of hosepipes outdoors. People also warned people to take care at quarries. Police issued a warning on Twitter, saying: “Some quarry lakes may look inviting on a hot summer’s day like today, but there are a number of hidden dangers: Deep water, submerged abandoned machinery and car wrecks, underwater recesses, hidden currents, dead animals, pollution.“More dangers of quarry swimming are sheer faces, falling rocks, quick sand, and believe it or not hypothermia.”"}]
