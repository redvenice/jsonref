This would be a version of the kind of ‘indicative votes’ that MPs have been conducting under a process run by Sir Oliver Letwin. So expect them to vote on Brexit with a permanent customs union attached, on Labour’s deal, on No Deal, and on a second referendum. But there would be one crucial difference: the Government would be bound by the outcome. Whatever Parliament agrees (if anything), Mrs May would enact, with the exception of Revoking Article 50 to stop Brexit entirely.Why has she done it?She didn’t really have any other option. Since her deal first went down, Mrs May has made several moves. She went back to the EU to secure more legal assurances on the backstop, a process which No 10 believes, and the EU states emphatically, has been exhausted. She threatened No Deal, she threatened an election. Neither worked. She tried to win over the DUP, but failed. She tried to get the deal through twice more, but was scuppered last Friday. What other choice did she have?         After a marathon seven-hour Cabinet meeting, the Prime Minister made a major shift of policy in an attempt, as she put it, to ‘break the log-jam’ over BrexitWhat about No Deal?On principle, Mrs May didn’t think it was in the national interest. The economic damage, even in the short term, could be significant. She was also warned by Cabinet Secretary Sir Mark Sedwill that No Deal would do significant harm to UK security, an issue which would weigh heavily with a former Home Secretary. But most significantly, Mrs May has become gripped by the fear that No Deal could lead to the break-up of the Union with a border poll in Northern Ireland and possibly an independence referendum in Scotland. But there was also a more pragmatic reason: Parliament could, and in all likelihood will, stop No Deal and secure a much longer delay to Brexit with the danger that it could never happen at all.What will Labour demand?A permanent customs union, and that’s just the start. Labour also wants a ‘close single market relationship’ – whatever that means – and a guarantee that UK employment rules would keep pace with those issued by Brussels. Mr Corbyn could also – in line with Labour’s conference policy but not its manifesto – try to demand a second referendum. "},{"url":null,"title":"SEBASTIAN SHAKESPEARE Ambitious Prince Andrew grease wheels Chinas getters","story":"Share this article   When model Lily Cole is not on the catwalk, she is busy saving the Amazon rainforest. Visting Brazil this week, the 31-year-old Cambridge graduate decorated her face with Yawanawa tribal paint made from local seeds and plant dye.Sharing this snap online, she writes: ‘I had the privilege to spend time with the Yawanawa indigenous tribe, who I’ve known for nearly five years.

Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WireSport Ireland will tell an Oireachtas committee on Wednesday that the FAI has not sufficiently explained the circumstances of a €100,000 loan given by John Delaney to the organisation in 2017.An opening statement to the committee from John Treacy, the chief executive of Sport Ireland, reveals that the FAI responded to a letter from the organisation which was sent after the loan was revealed in recent weeks.“However, the contents of the FAI letter did not sufficiently explain the circumstances of this loan and its repayment, nor fully address the matter of compliance with Sport Ireland’s Terms and Conditions of Grant Approval.”Under these conditions, the FAI was obliged to notify Sport Ireland in writing of any material deterioration in its financial position, or any other matter which could jeopardise the its overall financial viability.Sport Ireland has again written to the FAI “re-seeking clarification on the circumstances of this loan”.“More detail was also requested by Sport Ireland in order to assess compliance with the terms and conditions of grant approval. Sport Ireland also sought re-confirmation that all state funding provided to the FAI has been spent for the purposes intended and in accordance with approved submissions”.The FAI is yet to reply to the second letter, Mr Treacy will tell the committee.Sport Ireland will also flag that it was not told in advance about the “structural changes” at the FAI which centred on John Delaney’s resignation as chief executive and re-assignment as executive vice-president and the appointment of Rea Walshe as interim chief executive. It was not consulted in the preparation of a report on governance by Jonathan Hall \u0026amp Associates which informed the changes, and has not yet received a copy of the report. Mr Treacy’s opening statement also reveals that Sport Ireland last year raised questions with the FAI about their 2017 liquidity position. This was brought about after the FAI introduced a €1.3 million bank overdraft facility, and an increase in its net debt position in 2017. Responding to the query, the FAI’s director of finance told Sport Ireland that the organisations net current liabilities position “is a common annual position” driven by deferred income from grants, sponsorship and commercial agreements being released over the lifetime of the agreements.He said that the “the overdraft position at Dec 2017 was within our overdraft facility with our banking partners and was a matter of timing rather than a liquidity concern - the balance has been in credit for the majority of 2018 to date”. Sport Ireland will also tell the committee that it is satisfied that “effective control mechanisms and frameworks are in place with regard to our investment in the FAI”. “Sport Ireland is satisfied that our funding invested in the FAI is fully accounted for and expended on the purpose for which it is intended”. The organisation’s grants to the FAI have been audited three times, which it says provided it with “the highest level of assurance that all funding is fully accounted for and expended for the purposes in which it was intended and that the Terms and Conditions of funding are being complied with”.

Photograph: Anthony DevlinPA WireThe Government is close to finalising a €200 million agreement with family doctors which would involve the introduction of new services for medical-card patients with chronic illnesses such as diabetes or cardiovascular conditions.It would also involve the restoration of funding, cut from general practice during the austerity years, in return for co-operation with reforms.The proposed accord would see the Irish Medical Organisation (IMO) dropping its objection in principle to the Government’s plans to extend free GP care to further cohorts of children, potentially up to age 12 . However the implementation of any such extension of free GP care beyond the existing cut-off point of age six would require further negotiations and the Government would have to pay GPs more money to put in place such services. The proposed agreement, which has been under negotiation between the IMO and health service management for the last year or so would, effectively, come in three separate parts.Close to collapseThe first element of the proposed deal would see the Government invest about €120 million up to 2022 to improve the financial stability of general practice which doctors have warned was close to collapse as a result of several rounds of cuts.This additional money would come as part of a productivity arrangement and, in essence, would equate to the total sum removed from general practice under these cuts over recent years. However under current proposals there would not be a “like-for-like” reversal of each inidual cutback introduced under financial emergency legislation over the last decade. It is understood the parties have been looking at increasing capitation payments paid to doctors for caring for each inidual patient on their list.In return for this investment to improve financial stability GPs would, under the new proposals, agree to co-operate with structural changes in the health services such as the new regional health organisations and the introduction of new ehealth initiatives such as the unique health identifier for all patients.It is understood the proposed agreement would not involve GPs providing additional hours of service for medical card patients.New structured care In addition, the proposed accord would also provide for the introduction of new structured care by GPs of patients with conditions such as diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cardiovascular conditions. This could involve GPs seeing patients with such illnesses on a set number of occasions per year. There would be additional funding to GPs for this initiative which could cost more than €70 million.The proposed deal would also see the IMO agreeing to enter talks with Ministers if they wanted to press ahead with its plans to extend existing arrangements for free GP care for children as is promised under the current programme for government. However, any such extension of free GP care would not be covered by the proposed new agreement. This would require further talks and the Government would have to pay more to GPs for taking on such services.Three elementsIt is understood that GPs would be free to accept any or all of the three elements of the proposed deal.Talks between Department of Health and Department of Public Expenditure representatives and the IMO are expected to continue this week. Government sources said the “back had been broken” on a number of key issues. It is understood a deal could be reached within the coming days or early next week.

Deike Potzel told The  that Chancellor Merkel would meet Taoiseach Leo Varadkar to “get a clearer picture” on various Brexit issues, as well as other EU matters. Mrs Potzel stressed that Dr Merkel’s visit, the first time she has held bilateral talks in Dublin with a Taoiseach since meeting with Enda Kenny in March 2014, is a show of solidarity with Ireland. That visit coincided with that year’s congress in Dublin of the European People’s Party, the centre-right European grouping to which Fine Gael and Dr Merkel’s CDU belong.The Government has rejected suggestions that Mr Varadkar’s two bilateral meetings this week – with French president Emmanuel Macron in Paris on Tuesday and with Dr Merkel in Dublin on Thursday – mean Ireland is coming under pressure to outline how it will deal with the Border in a no-deal Brexit scenario. Other sources, however, said there was “curiosity” about Dublin’s proposals to deal with the Border, but said the fact that Dr Merkel was coming to Dublin was a show of support and was not a warning to Mr Varadkar – which would not have to be delivered in person.“She really wants to listen, to show support and to listen, and to find out what is the current situation, what is the view of Ireland, and how can we proceed in different scenarios,” Mrs Potzel said. “The German government has always been in support of the Irish on the whole Brexit issue, and that we have been in 100 per cent solidarity with Ireland, especially on the Border issue and the backstop. Political agenda“With current developments the chancellor really wants to come here to get a clearer picture about the current situation, and to talk about current issues and the current European political agenda as well, and obviously about the current developments in Great Britain and with a view to the close relationship Ireland has always had with the United Kingdom. ”She expected this would include all preparations for a no-deal scenario, including with regards to the Border. She said she understood that methods of avoiding physical checks away from the Border were being discussed at present. “I think that is really up to the experts to say. And they, as I take it, are looking into that. I am not an expert on these issues. “For Germany, and for the rest of the EU, including Ireland, from what I hear here in Ireland, the integrity of the single market is an extremely important goal. We definitely want to protect the integrity of the single market because that is such a viable and such a means for us. “We have always said, and the chancellor has always said, that we will try everything to try and prevent a no-deal.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3847290.1554224298!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"uk immigration rules deny ni born irish citizens access to eu rights","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLes Allamby, chief commissioner of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission. File photograph: Dara Mac DonaillThe The UK government is under pressure to clarify immigration rules that human rights activists say undermine the rights of Northern Ireland-born Irish citizens under the Belfast Agreement.Les Allamby, chief commissioner of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, said changes in UK immigration laws treating people in Northern Ireland automatically as British citizens (or British subjects) “goes against the grain” of the 1998 agreement underpinning the Northern Irish peace process.He was referring to the changes to immigration rules published on March 7th but highlighted this week by citizens’ rights campaigner Emma DeSouza, a Northern Ireland-born Irish citizen embroiled in a lengthy appeals process after her US-born husband’s application for residence was rejected.The UK changed the definition of a European Economic Area national in the rules last month stipulating that dual British nationals who are British by birth will not be considered an EEA national in the UK.Ms DeSouza said the change reaffirmed “a worrying trend” of Northern Ireland-born Irish citizens are going to be “among the only EU citizens within the UK unable to access their EU rights and entitlements”.She argues that this is significant because the UK government has taken the position that all people of Northern Ireland are British by birth under the British Nationality Act 1981, a presupposition that, she says, “goes against the Good Friday Friday Agreement right to be Irish or British or both as you so choose”.The Co Derry woman says that Irish citizens or dual Irish-British citizens in Northern Ireland cannot apply for “settled status” as EU nationals in the UK after Brexit. If they could, this would, under the UK’s proposed orce deal, provide them with “a legal security blanket” to protect their rights.“So what is happening is the government is imposing blanket British citizenship on the people of Northern Ireland and removing our access to EU rights through this process,” she said.“This creates in essence two tiers of Irish citizens: those that can retain their EU rights and those that can’t.”‘Hiding contradictions’The Department of Foreign Affairs said the Government was continuing to engage with the UK Government “to ensure that the important citizenship and identity provisions of the Good Friday Agreement are upheld in all relevant policy areas and in all scenarios.”Ms DeSouza’s husband applied to live in Northern Ireland in 2015 as the family member of an EEA national living in the UK.The UK Home Office initially refused the application on the basis that his Co Derry-based wife applied for the visa as an Irish national, which as a dual citizen disqualified her.Her husband challenged the decision, arguing that his wife had the right to be treated as an Irish citizen under the 1998 agreement and was exercising her freedom-of-movement right as an EU citizen.The couple won but the Home Office is appealing the decision and a hearing has been delayed until the UK is due to leave the EU. Ms DeSouza fears further changes with Brexit, particularly in light of the trend reflected in the new immigration rules that she noticed in recent days.Mr Allamby called on the UK government to outline further details of the review British prime minister Theresa May promised on the identity rights of citizens when she visited Belfast in February.“We would call on the government to issue the terms of reference and a timetable for the review as quickly as possible in order to resolve questions of family reunion in Emma DeSouza and other cases,” he said.Brian Gormally, director of Northern Irish human rights group Committee on the Administration of Justice, said that Brexit has opened up “a legal reality” that the UK has not legislated to protect the rights of Northern Irish citizens under the Belfast Agreement.“Brexit has peeled away some things that have been hiding contradictions in British law relating to the Good Friday Agreement,” he said.Daniel McCrossan MLA, the SDLP’s Brexit spokesman, called on the UK government to address the immigration rules and “commit to conforming with the spirit and letter of the Good Friday Agreement”.“These rules, which redefine EEA citizenship as contradictory to British citizenship, and further define those born in the North as automatically British, fly in the face of the guarantee that all those born here can identify as Irish, British or both,” he said.Twenty years after Good Friday we examine the Belfast Agreement and ask is it still fit for purpose?"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3847546.1554239090!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord fianna f%C3%A1il wants in on big brexit plan that doesn t exist","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDara Calleary: “I presume, Tánaiste, the Taoiseach and President Macron aren’t discussing their Kylie collections”Brexit is all very fine, but the people of Belgooly are being held to ransom.The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs may be preoccupied with the multifaceted fiasco unfolding in Westminster, but some issues can never be ignored. With the Taoiseach in Paris on a Brexit-related mission, Simon Coveney stepped in on Tuesday to handle Leaders’ Questions and any exodus-related concerns the Dáil might have. He could have told TDs everything they wanted to know, but unfortunately would then have had to shoot them. Had he screwed on a silencer few would have noticed. “We need to be very careful about what we say here because accuracy is important,” Simon said carefully in his devil-may-care cautious Coveney kind of way. When it comes to ulging details of the Government’s post-Brexit plans, the Tánaiste adheres to the gospel according to Ronan Keating. He says it best when he says nothing at all. “I attended a meeting there on Friday night, and it was one of the main topics of conversation. Tánaiste, the people of Belgooly are being held to ransom waiting for a commencement date for this scheme” she told the Tánaiste, who represents the constituency next door. “They have to change their domestic appliances much more often than any of the rest of us, and it’s not fair.” As far as the village is concerned, all the preparations for the new water have been completed. Was there a reason why it was not up and running when “all ducks are now in a row”? Very familiarNo hesitation here from the Tánaiste. “I’ll certainly be checking to make sure all ducks are in a row. I know Belgooly very well – it’s right on the edge of my constituency. I’ll try get an answer for you, Deputy. It’s probably unreasonable to expect me to have a date in my head here on my feet, but I am very familiar with Belgooly, and I will certainly come back to you with an answer on that.”We thought of Michael Healy-Rae, and his oft-repeated gripe about what goes on in the Dáil chamber.“It’s all Dublin, Dublin, Dublin!” Simon wasn’t the only deputy on duty. Dara Calleary was deputising for the leader of Fianna Fáil, who wasn’t in Paris. We were told afterwards that Micheál Martin was otherwise occupied in Dublin at meetings and such-like. Looked like Micheál was doing a Seán Gallagher. Remember Seán, the second-time around candidate for the presidency who announced he would not attend any campaign debate unless Michael D Higgins, the second-time around winner, was also there.Pulling that old “do you not know who I’d like to think I’m going to be?” trick.Dara continued with the conspiracy line rolled out in the last few weeks by his boss. He greatly suspects, going on clues such as multiple mentions by the Taoiseach of meetings with European leaders and high-sourced officials in the EU Commission, that the Government has A Plan ready to go in the event of a hard Brexit. “We need to see, you need to share that detail, to involve us in the planning of that detail,” demanded the Fianna Fáil second in command of the Government’s commander of the contingency forces. To make things easier, he told Coveney that the Dáil doesn’t need to hear “your entire negotiating strategy”. Just the key principles would do. But Simon was determined to keep schtum. While the Government was working hard to be withdrawal-ready and was about to “intensity” discussions with its partners in Europe over how best to respond in the event of a hard Brexit, nothing has been decided. Preparations were at an advanced stage should the worst happen. “Of course, we hope that won’t be the case, but this country needs to be ready if it is.” InformationEveryone in Dáil Éireann wanted to help out with the withdrawal effort, but “we need the information”, argued Dara. “What’s the plan?” shouted Barry Cowen. Answer there came none. “Hope is not a strategy,” added Calleary, clearly forgetting that there is a general election sometime soon in the offing, and hope will be springing eternal in the ranks of Fianna Fáil.He wanted Coveney to come clean, say what’s going on and let the Irish people know the detail of the plan. “That detail is being discussed, I presume, in Paris today, will be discussed with Chancellor Merkel on Thursday, but is not being discussed in this House.”“It’s not,” insisted the Tánaiste. “Difficult conversations” were taking place, but that was all. They were working out a plan with the commission, which was a different thing. Dara was not convinced.“I presume, Tánaiste, the Taoiseach and President Macron aren’t discussing their Kylie collections.”Maybe they were, because they weren’t discussing what Fianna Fáil is insisting is being discussed above the heads of the Irish people. Simon was getting exasperated. How many times did he have to say it?“The Government is not hiding anything from anybody,” he insisted. “There isn’t a plan.”Barry Cowen looked around, shaking his head. “There. Is. No. Plan,” repeated Barry. Oh, but he’s heard it all now. It’s not what you usually hear from a politician in Leinster House – a frank admission they have no plan. But the Tánaiste needed to be very clear: the Irish Government was not going to Brussels as of now with a plan. In fact, the plan is that there is no plan. Simon assured everyone that as soon as one emerges, the Dáil would be the first to know. Broadband Later on Catherine Murphy of the Social Democrats wanted to talk about another plan. She reminded Coveney the Taoiseach warned that the National Broadband Plan might not proceed in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Has the Government factored this to its final bill for broadband, which is already expected to cost an arm and a leg? The Tánaiste declared the Government was leaving nothing to chance in this regard. “So we’ll be making a decision with our eyes wide open on cost.” Which is the truth. When that total is presented, eyes will most definitely be wide open."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3847222.1554232456!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"revolt hangs in the air in real life gentrification game","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe city sold Markthalle Neun (above)  in 2011 to new owners who promised to promote local retailers for people of “every age, all social classes and nationalities”. Eight years on, things look very different\u0026nbspI haven’t an entrepreneurial bone in my body but, if I had, I could get rich quick with my board-game idea.“Gentrification” is a mix of Monopoly and Go for Broke. You roll a dice, move around a board buying and selling residential and commercial property.As the game progresses, each player draws random cards that decide their fate. You might inherit a fortune or lose your job. A card might give you a pay rise or price you out of your neighbourhood. Behind everything: the invisible hand of gentrification.Whether Dublin’s Stoneybatter or Schöneberg in Berlin, the shadow of gentrification hangs over 21st-century urban living. But does anyone understand this game, and who determines the rules?My board game would remind players how many, in particular young urban city dwellers, view gentrification the way motorists view traffic jams: something caused by others, never themselves. It’s the way of the world when you’re pricing a pensioner out of their neighbourhood, but unfair when you’re being priced out of your flat by a digital nomad. “Gentrification” would present the phenomenon as a moving target, coloured by our personal perceptions and prejudices.Who decides?Roll the dice, draw a card: “A cheese shoptattoo parlourrecord store opens in your neighbourhood.” Good gentrification or bad gentrification? “The local bookshop has been been replaced with another cafe.” Good gentrification or bad gentrification? “An empty and derelict building has been renovated for privately-owned penthouses, but with a creche at street level.” Good gentrification or bad gentrification? Who decides? My game allows players to vote on whether to accept or reject a gentrification step. But such majority rule can cut both ways.\u0026nbspFor the last decade a real-life version of my Gentrification game has been playing out in Berlin’s Kreuzberg district. The one-time alternative neighbourhood is now the scene of a growing turf war. New arrivals and foreign capital have put the squeeze on long-term residents: German-Turkish families, artists, ageing student revolutionaries and draft dodgers. Now the battle for apartments and public spaces has pitched hipsters against helicopter parents.\u0026nbspThe latest battle is over Markthalle Neun, one of Berlin’s historic market halls. The city sold the hall in 2011 to new owners who promised to promote local retailers for people of “every age, all social classes and nationalities”.Eight years on, things look very different. One by one the old stands, selling cheap beer, sausages and filter coffee, have been replaced by new stands catering for a new crowd, selling smoked tofu, pricey cheese and organic ice-cream.Corporate eventsEach Thursday evening, the hall hosts a street-food event popular with foodies and start-up types who prefer speaking English to German.Locals who have lived here for decades say they now feel like extras, particularly when sections of the hall are closed for corporate events.All seems normal in the hall on Tuesday afternoon: green iron girders, wooden roof, concrete floor.\u0026nbspBut revolt hangs in the air, with older Kreuzberg residents up in arms at plans by the market hall owner to evict their Aldi supermarket.This is my board game come to life: is evicting a discount supermarket from a market hall good gentrification or bad gentrification?The market hall’s owners say they are anxious to support smaller traders and remind locals that even low prices come at a cost, somewhere along the supply chain.And so younger market customers back the plan to evict Aldi. In their eyes this is legitimate protest against exploitation of producers and animals worldwide.“I think food should be more expensive if it’s organic, but welfare payments should be increased, too,” said Moritz Fleischer, who is just finished a pine nut-spinach-goat’s cheese quiche.Angry and confusedMetres away, emerging from Aldi with two carrier bags, Lothar Hoffmann describes himself as a left-wing former draft dodger. He is angry and confused at the changes in his neighbourhood. Above all that he is now defending one of Germany’s largest retailers.“I’m a worker and can’t afford anything else here but Aldi,” he says, voice rising with emotion. “There used to be a mix here in the market but the new people are like an eco-caste of their own, squeezing out everyone who thinks and lives differently.”Rents in Kreuzberg have risen 117 per cent on average in the last decade, and long-term residents like Lothar say they have no time for philosophical questions. Whether good gentrification or bad gentrification, many Berliners can afford neither."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3847484.1554247388!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"hard brexiteers pour cold water on possible may corbyn compromise","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn in his office in the Houses of Parliament in London on Tuesday, with the Political Declaration setting out the framework for the future UK-EU relationship. Photograph: Stefan RousseauPA Wire Hardline Brexiteers have reacted angrily to Theresa May’s offer to seek a common approach to Brexit with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Jacob Rees-Mogg, who chairs the European Research Group (ERG) of backbench Conservative Brexiteers, condemned Mrs May’s seeking to pass a deal with “socialist” votes.“You do find that leaders who decide to go with the opposition rather than their own party find their own party doesn’t plainly follow. I’m not sure this is the way to conciliate people to persuade them if they haven’t moved already to move at this stage. I think getting the support of a known Marxist is not likely to instil confidence in Conservatives,” he said.No minister threatened to resign during Tuesday’s seven-hour British cabinet meeting and all but four agreed that the prime minister should seek a short extension rather than leaving the EU without a deal on April 12th. But Boris Johnson said their decision to give Mr Corbyn a say over Brexit meant that Britain’s trade policy and key law-making powers would be “handed over to Brussels” with no say for Westminster.‘Very bad deal’“The PM and cabinet have concluded that any deal is better than no deal, and this is truly a very bad deal indeed – one that leaves us being run by the EU. I can under no circumstances vote for a deal involving a customs union as I believe that does not deliver on the referendum,” he said.A cross-party group of MPs led by Labour’s Yvette Cooper and Conservative Oliver Letwin have put forward a Bill that would oblige the prime minister to seek a lengthy delay to Brexit. The MPs will attempt to complete all the Bill’s stages in the House of Commons on Wednesday before sending it to the Lords.The Bill does not specify how long the extension should be, but it allows for an amendable motion so that MPs can determine its length in a vote. This would be binding on the prime minister and if the EU were to propose a different length, MPs would be allowed to vote on that.MPs rejected four alternatives to the prime minister’s Brexit deal on Monday night, but they are expected to engage in a further round of indicative votes next Monday.Direct ruleCabinet secretary Mark Sedwill, who also serves as Mrs May’s national security adviser, has warned ministers of the consequences of a no-deal Brexit, including the return of direct rule to Northern Ireland. In a 14-page letter leaked to the Daily Mail, Sir Mark said leaving the EU without a deal would see food prices rise by 10 per cent and companies collapse or get bailed out by the government, and hamper the ability of police and security services to keep the country safe.“The UK would forfeit access to criminal justice levers. None of our mitigation measures would give the UK the same security capabilities as our current ones. A no-deal exit would enormously increase pressure on our law and security authorities and on our judicial system. The UK would be less safe as a result of this,” he wrote.The DUP in a statement said Mrs May’s “lamentable handling” of the negotiations with the EU meant she had failed to deliver a sensible Brexit deal that works for all parts of the UK. It said it remained “to be seen if sub-contracting out the future of Brexit to Jeremy Corbyn, someone whom the Conservatives have demonised for four years, will end happily”. “We want the result of the referendum respected, and just as we joined the common market as one country we must leave the EU as one country,” it added. The SDLP leader Colum Eastwood in a tweet said he was glad Ms May “has decided to ditch the ERG and DUP version of Brexit”. He said it was really important now that we see “real leadership” from across the Westminster parliament. “The bottom line is still clear – the Good Friday agreement and frictionless border needs to be protected,” said Mr Eastwood.

Photograph: BBC NewsPA Wire. British prime minister Theresa May has said she aims to ask for a further extension to the Brexit process to allow the UK to leave the European Union “in a timely and orderly way”.Mrs May offered to hold talks with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to agree a plan acceptable to both, which can be put to the House of Commons ahead of the April 10th summit of the European Council.The Labour leader said he would be “very happy” to meet the prime minister in a bid to offer “certainty and security” to the British people.Speaking in 10 Downing Street after a marathon session of Cabinet lasting more than seven hours, Mrs May said any further delay to Brexit should be “as short as possible”.She said a Bill to pave the way for departure would have to be in place by May 22nd to ensure the UK did not have to take part in European Parliament elections.Any new proposal would have to accept the Withdrawal Agreement — including its controversial backstop arrangement — and focus on amendments to the Political Declaration on the future EUUK relationship, she said.Setting out her plan for talks with Mr Corbyn, Mrs May said: “The ideal outcome of this process would be to agree an approach on a future relationship that delivers on the result of the referendum, that both the leader of the Opposition and I could put to the House for approval and which I could then take to next week’s European Council.“However, if we cannot agree on the single unified approach, then we would instead agree a number of options for the future relationship that we could put to the House in a series of votes to determine which course to pursue.“Crucially, the Government stands ready to abide by the decision of the House. But to make this process work, the opposition would need to agree to this too.”She added: “This is a decisive moment in the story of these islands and it will require national unity to deliver the national interest.”In response to the offer to hold talks, Mr Corbyn said: “We will meet the prime minister.”He said: “We recognise that she has made a move, I recognise my responsibility to represent the people that supported Labour in the last election and the people who didn’t support Labour but nevertheless want certainty and security for their own future and that’s the basis on which we will meet her and we will have those discussions.”‘Crashing out’Mr Corbyn said he would not set any “limits” ahead of the meeting, but that his principles ahead of it were to recognise the “needs of the people that elected all MPs to parliament and the need to avoid the dangers of crashing out”.He also warned that Labour would “hold in reserve” the option of tabling a confidence motion in the Government if it “proves it is incapable of commanding a majority in the House of Commons”.Ministers began their Cabinet meeting at 9.30am, initially sitting in “political” session in the absence of civil servants. The meeting finally wound up shortly before 5pm, but ministers were held inside without access to their mobile phones while Mrs May prepared her statement.In an instant response to the statement, European Council president Donald Tusk tweeted: “Even if, after today, we don’t know what the end result will be, let us be patient. #Brexit.”Mrs May’s statement came after warnings from EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier that a no-deal departure on the deadline of April 12th was becoming “day after day more likely”.Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg responded to Mrs May’s statement by warning the prime minister that people did not vote for a Corbyn-May coalition.European Research Group (ERG) chairman Mr Rees-Mogg criticised Mrs May for planning to collaborate with “a known Marxist” in Mr Corbyn.The Conservative MP for North East Somerset said the move would lose Tory votes, and warned history did not show success for political leaders who tried to get policy through the Commons “on the back of Opposition votes”.Speaking after a meeting about Theresa May’s latest statement, Mr Rees-Mogg said: “I think getting the support of a known Marxist is not likely to instil confidence in Conservatives.“This approach to Government is an unsuccessful one and it also lacks democratic legitimacy.“People did not vote for a Corbyn-May coalition Government — they voted for a Conservative Government, which became a confidence and supply with the DUP.“This is a deeply unsatisfactory approach — it’s not in the interests of the country, it fails to deliver on the referendum result and history doesn’t bode well for it.”Mr Rees-Mogg claimed to still support Mrs May as leader and, although he “didn’t whoop and holler with delight”, neither did he expect “a glorious outcome” from the prime minister’s statement.He said he had been willing to accept a “second-rate” Brexit rather than to hold out for something “perfect” and end up with no Brexit.When asked if he could back a deal struck with Mr Corbyn, he told journalists: “Well, I wouldn’t hold your breath — I’m not a Marxist in case you hadn’t noticed.–PADeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

His sprawling Hudaibiah education complex three weeks ago became one of nearly 300 seminaries, schools, hospitals and dispensaries taken over for links to outlawed groups.“It\u0027s propaganda. Indian and US propaganda. Two or three times this has happened to us and then we go to court,” the school principal predicted confidently last week.The school principal has for 17 years been a member of Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD) which operates an estimated 300 madrassahs as well as a fleet of ambulances.JuD calls itself a humanitarian organisation, but both America, Britain and the United Nations instead recognise it as a front for the Laskhar-e-Taiba (LeT) terrorist group accused of the Mumbai attack that killed 166.Pakistan\u0027s powerful military has long been accused of sponsoring and harbouring militant groups to provide foreign policy muscle in Afghanistan, Kashmir and India.After years of demands it tackle militant-linked organisations waging jihad from its soil, Pakistanhas begun what observers say appears to be the biggest crackdown on proscribed groups in years.Children play at Hudaibiah Education Complex run by the newly banned group Jamaat-ud-DawaThe latest drive was launched soon after another banned group Pakistan-based group, Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) brought Pakistan and India to the brink of war when it claimed a suicide bombing killing 40 police.At least 121 people have been taken into “preventative detention”, the ministry of interior says. Yet there is doubt over whether this push is any more determined than a series of largely cosmetic prior crackdowns, or whether it is just a ploy to head off international sanctions.And if the purge is genuine, Pakistan also faces the dilemma of what to do with the thousands of members of these organisations. JuD was banned as part of the crackdown.Mr Rafi denied his 13-acre complex in Chakri on the outskirts of Rawalpindi was a madrassa and said his 300 students were taught the broad government syllabus of subjects.He also denied links to militants in Kashmir. “If India and America make these accusations, then they have to provide proof,” he said.The crackdown has meant the appointment of an administrator from the local education department and the resignation of a couple of teachers, but otherwise he said lessons continued.At the al-Quba mosque in Islamabad, also run by JuD, doors were last week again open for Friday prayers after it had been taken over and given a new imam. Posters said the mosque was now under government administration.The former preacher had delivered sermons “mostly about Kashmir and Kashmir jihad. There was nothing about violence in Pakistan,” said one worshipper, Riaz Bukhari.A dining hall for students in Hubaibiah Education Complex in ChakriA failure to follow through on previous promised crackdowns has bred widespread international scepticism about Pakistan\u0027s intentions.Islamabad promised to root out militants after Mumbai in 2008, and after the 2016 attack on India\u0027s Pathankot air base.Yet the most recent US State department of terrorism in the region said Pakistan “did not take sufficient action against other externally focused groups such as LeT and JeM” and they “continued to operate, train, organize, and fundraise in Pakistan”.A government ban on JuD\u0027s activities was overturned in court last year. The founder and leader of LeT, Hafiz Saeed, remains a free man despite a $10m US bounty on his head.Whether this crackdown is different depends on whether the military has decided the groups are still useful, or have become an international liability, analysts believe.Zahid Hussain, an analyst, said domestic political consensus and international pressure appeared to make this crackdown more serious.He said: “There\u0027s urgency because of what happened, the Indian and Pakistan stand off and also growing international pressure.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Please review our commenting policyComment: Having faith in honest radio matters as much as the storyIsambard Kingdom Brunel \u0026#39worried about pollution caused by Industrial Revolution\u0026#39Comment: Trump\u0026#39s regulatory bonfire has brought life to America.

No one should have to do that, and no health worker should have to provide care in those circumstances.”Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Water and sanitationComment: Having faith in honest radio matters as much as the story\u0026#39Better late than never\u0026#39: How Europe reacted to Theresa May\u0026#39s approach to Labour for Brexit compromiseToxic air lowers life expectancy by 20 monthsIsambard Kingdom Brunel \u0026#39worried about pollution caused by Industrial Revolution\u0026#39Comment: Trump\u0026#39s regulatory bonfire has brought life to America.

Show all 21Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.421 Avengers: Age of UltronJust in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 721 s of the Galaxy Vol 2The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1021 Ant-Man and the WaspWhile the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2021 s of the Galaxy Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke).

Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2021 s of the Galaxy Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.“I do,” Evan says before the two shake hands.Avengers: Endgame\u0026nbspis set to be released on 26 April.It follows up on\u0026nbspThe Avengers\u0026nbsp(2012),\u0026nbspAvengers: Age of Ultron\u0026nbsp(2015), and\u0026nbspAvengers: Infinity War\u0026nbsp(2018) and brings to an end a multi-year saga.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The client relationship, and the conflicts of interest which abound, undermine the professional scepticism needed to deliver reliable, high-quality audits. Splitting audit from non-audit business would be a big step to boosting the culture of challenge needed to deliver high-quality audits.We must not wait for the next corporate collapse. Government and regulators need to get on and legislate to deliver these reforms and ensure that audits deliver what businesses, investors, pension-holders and the public expect.Auditors have come in for criticism after a number of large companies have gone bust without the accountants who checked their books highlighting problems.The business committee also raised questions about the dominance of the big four which check the books of 97 per cent of Britain’s largest listed firms. The Business Committee recommends using joint audits for the most complicated cases. This would mean multiple accountants sharing work on a single company’s accounts.In addition, it wants to reduce the number of consecutive years a company can stay with the same auditor from 20 years to seven. After this there would be a cooling-off period of three years during which the auditor cannot offer consultancy services to the client. Some auditors have been accused of developing “cosy” relationships with certain clients that hampered their ability to properly scrutinise the management’s accounts. The committee also took aim at Britain’s fifth-largest accountancy firm Grant Thornton which audited cake chain Patisserie Valerie.Chief executive David Dunckley informed the Business Committee that it was not part of Grant Thornton’s role to look for fraud during its audit of the company.A £40m hole in Patisserie Valerie’s accounts was subsequently uncovered by forensic accountancy work carried out by a different firm.Ms Reeves said that “change in the audit market is long overdue”. The \u0027Big Four\u0027s\u0027 dominance has fostered a precarious market which shuts out challengers and delivers audits which investors and the public cannot rely on.Our report proposes a range of measures to boost competition, improve the audit product, and ensure that the UK continues to be a world leader in corporate governance.We’ll tell you what’s true.

But by the time that happened, the surge had already begun.The bitcoin price shot up by 20 per cent in less than an hour to $5,080\u0026nbspearly on 2 April, leading to speculation\u0026nbspthat the spike may have been caused by rogue bitcoin trading bots.Created with Sketch.Bitcoin\u0027s volatile history in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.18 Satoshi Nakamoto creates the first bitcoin block in 2009On 3 January, 2009, the genesis block of bitcoin appeared.

Some traders set up bots to\u0026nbspmonitor relevant news outlets and social media channels like Twitter for\u0026nbspkeywords and activity that might indicate a market shift may be about to occur.If relevant keywords appear – in this case\u0026nbsp\u0027bitcoin\u0027, \u0027ETF\u0027 and \u0027approved\u0027 – then these bots may autonomously make trades in anticipation of bitcoin\u0027s price moving in a positive direction.North Korea has amassed $670 million in bitcoin and other currenciesThe only problem is that the developers of these bot may not have allowed for the possibility that the news is the result of a prank.It\u0027s about getting there first. In this instance a trading bot cannot tell an April Fool\u0027s from a real thing, George McDonaugh, chief executive and co-founder of blockchain investment firm KR1, told\u0026nbspThe Independent.So if you have a system in place to recognise the words \u0027ETF\u0027 and \u0027approved\u0027 to immediately trigger large scale buys, then theoretically this could lead to a big move.iStockphoto)The timing of the initial price surge means it is far-fetched to attribute it to the article\u0027s publication, according to Mr McDonaugh, though this does not rule out the possibility that the April Fool\u0027s joke helped fuel the bitcoin price surge.Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are\u0026nbspnotoriously volatile and it is difficult to pinpoint price movements to one specific factor, meaning there is a myriad of possible reasons why bitcoin surged in price.Some analysts speculated the rally could also be the result of bitcoin breaking above $4,200, which was seen as a key testing point for the market as it was previously bitcoin\u0027s highest price of 2019.Other cryptocurrency experts suggested the jump could have come in anticipation of bitcoin\u0027s next \u0027halvening\u0027 – an event that sees the rewards for mining the virtual currency cut in half.

This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the yearOther cryptocurrency experts have urged caution over the sudden price surge, given the notorious price volatility associated with bitcoin.Bitcoin has shown, once again, its trading resilience and a potential to shake off the \u0027moderately bearish\u0027 tag some analysts had put on it at the start of 2019, said David Futter, a fintech partner at the law firm Ashurst.Nonetheless, substantial volatility remains in the crypto market generally, something which the increasing regulatory scrutiny from global governments is unlikely to dampen in the short term at least.CoinMarketCap)Bitcoin is currently trading at its highest value since November 2018, though it is still a long way off its late 2017 peak of $20,000.After its incredible price explosion 18 months ago bitcoin experienced a sudden price crash before months of steadily declining prices.Bitcoin trader brutally tortured with drill in cryptocurrency robberyCryptocurrency mystery deepens as $143m goes missingBitcoin\u0027s value has remained relatively stable in recent months, making its sudden price surge all the more notable.It is not yet clear what caused the market turnaround but it comes as several major technology companies are taking steps to either develop their own cryptocurrency or integrate bitcoin into their existing platforms.Bitcoin could be about to turn back up again in a more meaningful way, said Joel Kruger, a currency strategist at LMAX Exchange.At a time when central banks have exhausted themselves with the unprecedented printing of money to keep sentiment running high and the global economy afloat, over a decade after the crisis of 2008, it would seem a peer-to-peer decentralised currency, with limited suppply and an attractive technology that it rests on, could be a compelling alternative option.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s initial assessment recommended a functional split between accountants’ auditing and consultancy arms but the MPs recommendations go further.Committee chairwoman Rachel Reeves said: For the big firms, audits seem too often to be the route to milking the cash-cow of consultancy business.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Armathwaite Hall hotel in Keswick, Cumbria holds Lemoga classes with the lemurs from Lake District Wild Life Park, who were mingling with the class to create a personal yoga experience which aims to heighten the sense of wellbeing for both lemur and human.

The client relationship, and the conflicts of interest which abound, undermine the professional scepticism needed to deliver reliable, high-quality audits. Splitting audit from non-audit business would be a big step to boosting the culture of challenge needed to deliver high-quality audits.We must not wait for the next corporate collapse. Government and regulators need to get on and legislate to deliver these reforms and ensure that audits deliver what businesses, investors, pension-holders and the public expect.Auditors have come in for criticism after a number of large companies have gone bust without the accountants who checked their books highlighting problems.The business committee also raised questions about the dominance of the big four which check the books of 97 per cent of Britain’s largest listed firms. The Business Committee recommends using joint audits for the most complicated cases. This would mean multiple accountants sharing work on a single company’s accounts.In addition, it wants to reduce the number of consecutive years a company can stay with the same auditor from 20 years to seven. After this there would be a cooling-off period of three years during which the auditor cannot offer consultancy services to the client. Some auditors have been accused of developing “cosy” relationships with certain clients that hampered their ability to properly scrutinise the management’s accounts. The committee also took aim at Britain’s fifth-largest accountancy firm Grant Thornton which audited cake chain Patisserie Valerie.Chief executive David Dunckley informed the Business Committee that it was not part of Grant Thornton’s role to look for fraud during its audit of the company.A £40m hole in Patisserie Valerie’s accounts was subsequently uncovered by forensic accountancy work carried out by a different firm.Ms Reeves said that “change in the audit market is long overdue”. The \u0027Big Four\u0027s\u0027 dominance has fostered a precarious market which shuts out challengers and delivers audits which investors and the public cannot rely on.Our report proposes a range of measures to boost competition, improve the audit product, and ensure that the UK continues to be a world leader in corporate governance.We’ll tell you what’s true.

We\u0027ve been very clear in saying that could cost us up to a billion dollars a year.”\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

Juergen Ziegler, chief executive for Europe, said that while Brexit was not the only factor, it has brought forward the decision to relocateThe latest stark warning from Britain’s car industry came after MPs again failed to agree on a way forward for the Brexit process, voting down a series of alternatives to the prime minister’s deal.Mr Armstrong said Ford ahd spent tens of millions of dollars preparing for a no-deal Brexit. “The best case for me would be that that money is actually wasted because we actually reach a deal,” Armstrong said.\u0026nbsp“So I would encourage all parties concerned to figure out how to get us to a deal that guarantees frictionless trade because otherwise we will have to consider seriously the long-term future of our investments in the country.”\u0026nbspThe company has already laid out plans to cut thousands of jobs across Europe, including the UK, as it tries to boost profitability in a region where it has underperformed for years. The bulk of the redundancies are expected to affect Germany“Brexit is not the reason for that, but it clearly is another factor that if we were to get a hard Brexit we would have to think seriously about what further steps we\u0027d have to take,” Mr Armstrong said.\u0026nbspLast week the industry trade body said\u0026nbspcar\u0026nbspproduction in the UK fell by 15.3 per cent in the year to February, the ninth consecutive month of falls. Manufacturers built 123,203 cars in the UK over 12 months, down from 145,518 a year ago, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said.Declining demand in the UK and in key European and Asian export markets has hit carmakers hard, while continued uncertainty around Brexit is hurting investment in the sector.Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive, said the figures should provide additional impetus for MPs to avert a hard Brexit.\u0026nbsp“The ninth month of decline for UK car production should be a wake-up call for anyone who thinks this industry, already challenged by international trade hostilities, declining markets and technological disruption, could survive a ‘no deal’ Brexit without serious damage,” he said.“A managed no deal is a fantasy.\u0026nbspWe’ll tell you what’s true.

The event was organized Tuesday by For our Future\u0027s Sake (FFS), a nationwide group of students and young people working to stop Brexit, with the billboard provided by Led By Donkeys a remain supporting group using online crowd funding to pay for billboard space to put up posters highlighting quotes on Brexit made by politicians and organizations. “Brexit-related uncertainty continued to generate indecisiveness, ultimately hitting order book volumes,” Mr Hayes said.“Furthermore, strong competition for contracts was also reported by some panel members.“The outlook was subsequently underwhelming by historical standards, with the unsettled political and economic environment keeping business confidence below its long-run average.”The construction data is the latest in a\u0026nbspseries of negative economic indicators that will heap further pressure on MPs\u0026nbspto agree a way forward on Brexit.Theresa May summoned her cabinet for crisis talks on Tuesday after MPs once again failed to unite around any Brexit option during a late-night session of indicative votes.Commercial construction has been hit particularly hard as firms hold back on making decisions amid increasing uncertainty.\u0026nbspBusiness activity dropped more sharply than at any point in the last year.\u0026nbspResidential construction held up relatively well\u0026nbspbut a weakened pound and a shortage of products helped to push up prices.Mr Hayes added: “UK construction businesses ramped up their purchases of materials and other inputs, reflecting efforts to build safety stocks ahead of any potential Brexit-related disruptions.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

The meth maker believes his days of cooking are long over. Having lunch with his family, everything seems perfect. And then everything goes wrong. So, so wrong. Hank (Dean Norris) goes to use the toilet and picks up a copy of Walt Whitman\u0027s Leaves of Grass – a gift from Gale to Walter White. “To my other favorited WW. It\u0027s an honour working with you. Fondly, GB.” And with that, as Hank realises Walt’s true identity, the end of Heisenberg’s empire begins.The debate over whether certain final scenes of television shows are actually good will rage on and on. The Sopranos remains front and centre of the conversation. It\u0027s a seemingly banal occasion – a restaurant dinner scene. We watch on as Tony sits there, observing other customers. Carmela arrives, then AJ and Meadow, who the last we see, is parking her car outside. A bell rings, Tony looks up and the screen cuts to black. It’s an ending that’s inspired essays offering varied interpretations but ultimately, it remains a beautifully-executed few minutes of television – and a cliffhanger that’ll never have a resolution.337 EastEnders – The Kat and Zoe revelation (2001)“You can’t tell me what to do ‘cause you ain’t my muvva”  “YES I AM!” - not the work of Shakespeare, granted, but surely one of the biggest moments in soap history. The nation’s jaws collectively dropped as they learned that Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace) wasn’t Zoe’s sister at all, but her mum.  437 Game of Thrones – The Rains of Castamere (2013)Game of Thrones knew George RR Martin was willing to kill off leading characters, but nothing prepared non-book readers for The Red Wedding. Robb Stark (Richard Madden), Talisa Stark (Oona Chaplin) and Catelyn Stark (Michelle Fairley) are attending the wedding of Roslin Frey (Alexandra Dowling) and Edmure Tully (Tobias Menzies) when things go terribly, terribly wrong for the Starks. The Freys turn on them, killing Robb, Talisa and their unborn child. Then, as the blood spills everywhere, Catelyn’s throat is slit. Cut to black. Devastating.The cliffhanger that kickstarted the end of season cliffhanger trend. Larry Hagman’s oil baron JR Ewing had made plenty of enemies in Dallas. By the end of season three, one of them took justice into their own hands, shooting JR in the back twice. However, rather than reveal the culprit, the team behind Dallas left the case unsolved. And over the next eight months – the time between seasons – the whole world was asking “Who shot JR?” Unsurprisingly, considering the hysteria around the mystery, 350 million people tuned in to watch the revelatory episode “Who Done It”.Showrunner Matt Groening had long wanted to do an episode where Mr Burns was shot, and the culprit was not revealed until the next episode. Taking inspiration from Dallas, the animation concluded Part One with the nuclear power plant owner being shot by an unknown assailant. Then, after a Summer of waiting, fans were finally treated to the answer. The two-part episode has gone down as a classic and is often heralded as the series’ best.737 Doctor Who – The Parting of the Ways (2005)Choosing one standout Doctor Who cliffhanger is almost impossible – especially when you consider that all 37 (and counting) seasons have frequently used the plot device. While the introduction of John Hurt’s Doctor certainly ranks among them, one of best came at the end of the rebooted first series. Having absorbed a bunch of vortexes, the Doctor is struggling and on the verge of regenerating. Turning to Rose (Billie Piper), Christopher Eccleston’s incarnation of the iconic character utters the timeless lines: “Before I go, I just want to tell you, you were fantastic. Absolutely fantastic. And you know what – so was I.” Queue shoddy CGI and the introduction of the soon-to-be nation’s favourite Doctor, David Tennant. “So, where was I? That’s it – Barcelona.”Gale (David Costabile) is one of the nicest characters on Breaking Bad. He is not interested in wealth or fame, but in science. However, niceties and a good cup of coffee are not enough to stop him getting in Walter White’s (Bryan Cranston) way. When the choice between their lives has to be made, Walter chooses his own and sends Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) to do the dirty work. Season three ends with Jesse killing Gale – an incident that eventually brings down the drug kingpin Gus Fring.937 The West Wing – “What Kind of Day Has it Been” (2000)The West Wing’s biggest cliffhanger came in the season one finale. The episode works its way back from the beginning as we see a Secret Service Agent sense danger from a nearby window at a town hall meeting with the president in attendance. When the episode catches up, gunfire rings out and each member of his senior staff is thrown to the floor. Cut to black as we hear an agent ask over the radio: “Who’s been hit?”It wasn’t until the third season finale of Smallville that Superman fans’ patience was rewarded as viewers saw Clark (Tom Welling) appear naked in the middle of a Kryptonian symbol burned into the field of his family’s farm. “You shall be reborn,” Jor-El can be heard saying to Clark Kent, but he wasn’t the alone one the ending marked a radical turning point for the series.Twin Peaks’ season two finale – the mystery drama’s last episode for 27 years – may have featured the most chilling cliffhanger, but the biggest gasp of the series came at the end of season one as the seemingly untouchable Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) responds to a knock on his hotel room door, only to be gunned down by an unseen assailant.1237 Buffy the Vampire Slayer – The Gift (2001)The 100th episode of Buffy ended with one of the show’s most shocking moments (and no, we’re not talking about the musical episode). Season five concluded with the eponymous ass-kicker sacrificing herself to save the world by jumping into a demonic portal. The episode ends with a slow zoom onto Buffy’s tombstone, which reads: “Beloved sister. Devoted friend. She saved the world. A lot.“It\u0027s easy to forget that True Blood began life as an acclaimed Emmy-nominated drama, and it was a cliffhanger such as this that made it so: Sookie Stackhouse (Anna Paquin) falls asleep with the friendly neighbour dog Dean for company. Upon waking up, Dean is gone and in his place is local barman Sam Merlotte ( Sam Trammell). Turns out he\u0027s a shapeshifter.1437 The Walking Dead – Last Day on Earth (2016)After eight episodes of build-up, the comic book’s deadliest villain, Negan, reared his head in a scene fans were dreading. With the majority of the main cast lined up at his mercy, Negan – in retaliation for the death of one of his gang – decides which one to kill by using “Eeny Meeny Mino Moe”. After selecting his victim, the camera switches POV and Negan bludgeons the unseen character to death leaving fans with a six-month wait before finding out who had met their maker.Lost co-creator Damon Lindelof\u0027s HBO drama was set in a world that saw two per cent of the world’s population disappear into thin air during a tragic event known as the Sudden Departure. Season two presented an intriguing mystery: the disappearance of three teenage girls from a Texan town that nobody had vanished from. It was the season\u0027s penultimate episode that cleared up this plot line as Matt Garvey (Chris Zylka) breaks into a heavily-guarded trailer – only to be met with the three teenage girls staring back at him. What’s more is they’re dressed all in white, a callback to the disbanded cult from the first season.In episode 11, the writers had introduced a hatch buried underground and, week in week out, the fans waited patiently for any detail about the mysterious structure the writers were willing to give them. The end of episode 19 saw a desperate John Locke (Terry O’Quinn) banging on the door, just as desperate to get inside as the viewers were... only for a light to come on from within. This ending remains an unforgettable moment for those who watched it at the time of broadcast.1737 Lost – “Two for the Road” (2006)“I’m sorry.” “For what?” BANG. On paper, not so effective but on screen, it equated to one of Lost’s most gasp-inducing cliffhangers. Viewers watched behind their eyes as Michael (Harold Perrineau), desperate to save his son from the mysterious Others, shoots Ana-Lucia (Michelle Rodriguez) and, in a cruel twist, Libby (Cynthia Watros), who has accidentally stumbled upon the whole thing while looking for some blankets.1837 Lost - \u0027Through the Looking Glass – Part 2Whether you love or hate Lost, there’s no denying that the season three finale deployed one of the most breathtaking rug pulls in television history as writers Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse revealed a shake-up long in the running: flashbacks featuring a suicidal Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) were, in fact, flashforwards to the future. The Oceanic Flight 815 plane crash survivor made it off the island he’d been so desperate to get off for three whole seasons, but was, disturbingly, desperate to get back. The ending set the benchmark for all future finale and was so huge it made newspaper headlines.1937 Line of Duty – Series four premiere (2018)The fourth series of Line of Duty didn’t hold back on the shocks. In fact, its first episode featured a cliffhanger ending to rival the best of them. With DCI Roz Huntley (Thandie Newton) dead on his floor, her murderer – Forensic Coordinator Tim Ifield (Jason Watkins) – sets about dispatching her body, but as his chainsaw nears her face, Roz’s eyes suddenly open.After season one, Heroes became pretty dreadful television. But this cliffhanger looms in the memory for being so left-field it warrants applaud: having captured serial killer Sylar, Angela Petrelli – parent to superheroes Nathan and Peter – tells him she can provide him with the love and guidance he needs. Angry, Sylar tells her she’s not his mother to which Angela drops the bombshell: “But I am dear, I am.” A head-scratching mid-season reveal that had fans chomping at the bit for the next episode.After spending an entire season watching the blossoming romance between medical intern Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) and Dr Derek Shephard (Patrick Dempsey), the world of viewers was rocked upon discovering the shock revelation that Derek was married all along.Channel 4 sitcom Green Wing took the term “cliffhanger” quite literally for each finale of its two series. While it became a tad gimmicky the second time around, the first remained a genuinely surprising way for a comedy series to end: having discovered that the colleague he’d just slept with was his mother, drug-addled anaesthetist Guy Secretan (Stephen Mangan) steals an ambulance, drives it to the country and loses control. After crashing, the episode ends with Guy and several other characters dangling – you guessed it – off a cliff.A particularly nail-biting fourth season was shaping up to end well: after weeks of playing cat-and-mouse with the Trinity Killer (John Lithgow on Emmy-winning form), Dexter finally put an end to his murderous ways and returned home ready to pack up and join his wife Rita on their vacation. Only Rita’s still at home... dead in the bathtub. Trinity killed her before Dexter got to him. A heartbreaking end to a standout season.When things are going supremely well towards the end of a season finale, you know something big is about to go down. Battlestar Galactica proved no different. After destroying the Cylon Basestar – a warship belonging to the enemy – crew member Boomer, who viewers had learnt was a Cylon in the mini-series that aired the year before, fires a round into the chest of Commander Adama (Edward James Olmos), the show’s main character.Having been warned for two seasons that Z’ha’dum means death, fans expected big things from an episode called “Z’ha’dum”. They weren’t wrong. It ended with the show’s lead character jumping to his death. The episode was so big the episodes leading up to it teased “Z minus 14 days” and “Z minus 7 days.”24 was filled to the brim with huge cliffhangers, but this one – arriving at the 16 episode mark – stands out for sparking what would be the show’s best run of episodes. President Charles Logan (Gregory Itzin) is revealed to be the mastermind behind the shocking assassinations of David Palmer and Michelle Dessler, which kickstarted the season. And thus the show’s most memorable villain was born.2737 Friends – The One with Ross’s Wedding (1998)While Ross (David Schwimmer) and Rachel’s (Jennifer Aniston) “will they, won’t they” courtship arguably went on far too long, there was one moment during the season four finale that left fans with their jaws on the floor. Just after Rachel had accepted Ross was happy with fiancé Emily (Helen Baxendale), everything goes catastrophically wrong. Instead of saying Emily’s name during the wedding vows, Ross says the iconic line: “Take thee Rachel”. After the wedding, as the season finished, everyone was left wondering whether the pair would finally rekindle their romance for good.“I’m in a boxcar, buried inside a quarry, and there are bodies everywhere,” says Mulder to Scully during the season two finale. And just as Mulder solves the riddle of how those people died, the roof of the boxcar slams shut, trapping him inside. Worse still, the Smoking Man then arrives with a unit of soldiers. When they open the boxcar, Mulder’s somehow nowhere to be seen and they decide to blow the freight to smithereens. Did Mulder survive? Did he get away?2937 Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life – Fall (2016)“It certainly wasn\u0027t the ending I expected,” Rory Gilmore actor Alexis Bledel said of the finale. “Fitting but frustrating”, was how Vanity Fair referred to the episode. The Gilmore Girls sequel, A Year in the Life, concluded with a four-word exchange between Rory and her mother, Lorelai (Lauren Graham). “Mum”, the daughter says, sitting in a park’s bandstand. “Yeah”, she replies. “I’m pregnant,” Rory says. Queue hundreds of fans wanting more from the story, which had, ultimately, come full circle.3037 Star Trek: The Next Generation – Best of Both Worlds (1990)Another science fiction show filled to the brim with cliffhangers. Star Trek: The Next Generation had many, but few can measure up to Picard (Patrick Stewart) becoming a Borg. The season three finale sees the Enterprise’s crew having no choice but to turn on their former captain, with Riker (Jonathan Frakes) ordering Worf (Michael Dorn) to open fire on Picard’s Borg ship. Fans had to wait three months to discover whether Picard could be saved – and the fandom almost imploded in the meantime.Marissa Cooper (Mischa Barton) and Ryan Atwood (Benjamin McKenzie) would have done anything for each other. When Ryan’s brother Trey (Logan Marshall-Green) gets in the way, attacking Marissa, Ryan has no other course of action but to settle things “once and for all” between them. As the brawl ensues, Marissa somehow ends up shooting Trey. And as the bullet goes through him, Imogen Heap’s song “Hide and Seek” – AKA the “Mmmmh, what you say?” song – suddenly starts playing. It’s hard not to laugh. The pop song cuts through the scene, completely at odds with what’s happening on screen. No wonder, then, that Saturday Night Live famously parodied the scene in one of their most-beloved skits of all time.Jim (John Krasinski) and Pam (Jenna Fischer) were the ultimate “will they, won’t they” couple, their chemistry electrifying the early seasons of The Office. Things peaked for the first time during the season two finale. Following Casino Night at Dunder Mifflin, Jim finally takes Pam aside to reveal his true feelings, telling her: “I’m in love with you.” She is, at the time, engaged to Roy (David Denman), and decides to reply to Jim: “What are you doing?” While all hope for the pair seems lost, Jim finds Pam (calling her mother) before the episode’s end and kisses her. Cruelly, the showrunners decided to cut to black after the moment, leaving fans wondering for months whether the couple would return to screens happily together (spoiler: they do not).JJ Abrams loves ending things on a twist. Before creating the mystery-box filled Lost, the filmmaker created Alias, and the season two finale marks one the show’s greatest endings. The episode sees Sydney (Jennifer Garner) discover that Francie (Merrin Dungey) is not Francie at all, but a duplicate. The two then brawl, ending with Sydney shooting Francie and then collapsing due to exhaustion. We immediately jump to Sydney waking up in Hong Kong. After reuniting with her lover Michael Vaughn (Michael Vartan), Sydney realises things are amiss as Michael is wearing a wedding ring. Turns out, she has been missing for almost two years. Cut to black, and the world asking “What just happened?”3437 Spooks – Smoke and Mirrors (2003)The season two finale of Spooks shocked the nation. While the episode begins with the CIA taking on a seemingly straightforward mission – to prevent a member of the Cabinet being assassinated – we soon discover that everything’s not as it seems. The formerly-presumed dead Herman Joyce (Tomas Arana) is still alive and masquerading as Herb Zeigler. Not only that, but the villain has masterminded an elaborate plan to make it seem as if Tom (Matthew Macfadyen) has assassinated the Chief of the Defence Staff. With everything working against Tom, the agent finds himself backed into a corner. And when Harry (Peter Firth) loses faith, Tom decides to shoot Harry with his shotgun. Does Harry die? Will Tom ever be found innocent? The questions were many.3537 Dragon Ball Z – Next time on Dragon Ball ZThere’s really no definitive Dragon Ball Z cliffhanger, as almost every single episode in the series finishes with one. From Vegeta staring menacingly at the camera to the villainous Cell launching a deadline attack on Goku, the series leaves you anywhere and everywhere. When that voice-over comes in with “Next time on Dragon Ball Z”, you can guarantee any child watching will be hooked and instantly wanting to watch the next episode.Pushing Up Daisies was unceremoniously brought to an end after just two seasons, with showrunner Bryan Fuller having to quickly conclude the whimsical series with very little notice. The epilogue was added late into the writing process and sees the narrator offer some closure to each characters’ story. Yet, with Ned (Lee Pace) and Chuck (Anna Friel) standing on her aunts’ doorstep, waiting to finally reveal that she’s alive, fans could see that there were originally supposed to be many more seasons to come – and they still want them desperately.Following a war of words with Jim Moriarty (Andrew Scott) on the roof of a building (in which Moriarty shoots himself in the head), Sherlock (Benedict Cumberbatch) decides to seemingly commit suicide by jumping off the building. However, not all is at it seems, as Sherlock is seen alive before the episode end. Fans of the series – plus Martin Freeman’s Watson – were left questioning what exactly happened to Sherlock, with all being revealed in the following special.Karma for killing Gale comes for Walter White in season five. The meth maker believes his days of cooking are long over. Having lunch with his family, everything seems perfect. And then everything goes wrong. So, so wrong. Hank (Dean Norris) goes to use the toilet and picks up a copy of Walt Whitman\u0027s Leaves of Grass – a gift from Gale to Walter White. “To my other favorited WW. It\u0027s an honour working with you. Fondly, GB.” And with that, as Hank realises Walt’s true identity, the end of Heisenberg’s empire begins.The debate over whether certain final scenes of television shows are actually good will rage on and on. The Sopranos remains front and centre of the conversation. It\u0027s a seemingly banal occasion – a restaurant dinner scene. We watch on as Tony sits there, observing other customers. Carmela arrives, then AJ and Meadow, who the last we see, is parking her car outside. A bell rings, Tony looks up and the screen cuts to black. It’s an ending that’s inspired essays offering varied interpretations but ultimately, it remains a beautifully-executed few minutes of television – and a cliffhanger that’ll never have a resolution.337 EastEnders – The Kat and Zoe revelation (2001)“You can’t tell me what to do ‘cause you ain’t my muvva”  “YES I AM!” - not the work of Shakespeare, granted, but surely one of the biggest moments in soap history. The nation’s jaws collectively dropped as they learned that Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace) wasn’t Zoe’s sister at all, but her mum.  437 Game of Thrones – The Rains of Castamere (2013)Game of Thrones knew George RR Martin was willing to kill off leading characters, but nothing prepared non-book readers for The Red Wedding. Robb Stark (Richard Madden), Talisa Stark (Oona Chaplin) and Catelyn Stark (Michelle Fairley) are attending the wedding of Roslin Frey (Alexandra Dowling) and Edmure Tully (Tobias Menzies) when things go terribly, terribly wrong for the Starks. The Freys turn on them, killing Robb, Talisa and their unborn child. Then, as the blood spills everywhere, Catelyn’s throat is slit. Cut to black.

What’s more is they’re dressed all in white, a callback to the disbanded cult from the first season.In episode 11, the writers had introduced a hatch buried underground and, week in week out, the fans waited patiently for any detail about the mysterious structure the writers were willing to give them. The end of episode 19 saw a desperate John Locke (Terry O’Quinn) banging on the door, just as desperate to get inside as the viewers were... only for a light to come on from within. This ending remains an unforgettable moment for those who watched it at the time of broadcast.1737 Lost – “Two for the Road” (2006)“I’m sorry.” “For what?” BANG. On paper, not so effective but on screen, it equated to one of Lost’s most gasp-inducing cliffhangers. Viewers watched behind their eyes as Michael (Harold Perrineau), desperate to save his son from the mysterious Others, shoots Ana-Lucia (Michelle Rodriguez) and, in a cruel twist, Libby (Cynthia Watros), who has accidentally stumbled upon the whole thing while looking for some blankets.1837 Lost - \u0027Through the Looking Glass – Part 2Whether you love or hate Lost, there’s no denying that the season three finale deployed one of the most breathtaking rug pulls in television history as writers Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse revealed a shake-up long in the running: flashbacks featuring a suicidal Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) were, in fact, flashforwards to the future. The Oceanic Flight 815 plane crash survivor made it off the island he’d been so desperate to get off for three whole seasons, but was, disturbingly, desperate to get back. The ending set the benchmark for all future finale and was so huge it made newspaper headlines.1937 Line of Duty – Series four premiere (2018)The fourth series of Line of Duty didn’t hold back on the shocks. In fact, its first episode featured a cliffhanger ending to rival the best of them. With DCI Roz Huntley (Thandie Newton) dead on his floor, her murderer – Forensic Coordinator Tim Ifield (Jason Watkins) – sets about dispatching her body, but as his chainsaw nears her face, Roz’s eyes suddenly open.After season one, Heroes became pretty dreadful television. But this cliffhanger looms in the memory for being so left-field it warrants applaud: having captured serial killer Sylar, Angela Petrelli – parent to superheroes Nathan and Peter – tells him she can provide him with the love and guidance he needs. Angry, Sylar tells her she’s not his mother to which Angela drops the bombshell: “But I am dear, I am.” A head-scratching mid-season reveal that had fans chomping at the bit for the next episode.After spending an entire season watching the blossoming romance between medical intern Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) and Dr Derek Shephard (Patrick Dempsey), the world of viewers was rocked upon discovering the shock revelation that Derek was married all along.Channel 4 sitcom Green Wing took the term “cliffhanger” quite literally for each finale of its two series. While it became a tad gimmicky the second time around, the first remained a genuinely surprising way for a comedy series to end: having discovered that the colleague he’d just slept with was his mother, drug-addled anaesthetist Guy Secretan (Stephen Mangan) steals an ambulance, drives it to the country and loses control. After crashing, the episode ends with Guy and several other characters dangling – you guessed it – off a cliff.A particularly nail-biting fourth season was shaping up to end well: after weeks of playing cat-and-mouse with the Trinity Killer (John Lithgow on Emmy-winning form), Dexter finally put an end to his murderous ways and returned home ready to pack up and join his wife Rita on their vacation. Only Rita’s still at home... dead in the bathtub. Trinity killed her before Dexter got to him. A heartbreaking end to a standout season.When things are going supremely well towards the end of a season finale, you know something big is about to go down. Battlestar Galactica proved no different. After destroying the Cylon Basestar – a warship belonging to the enemy – crew member Boomer, who viewers had learnt was a Cylon in the mini-series that aired the year before, fires a round into the chest of Commander Adama (Edward James Olmos), the show’s main character.Having been warned for two seasons that Z’ha’dum means death, fans expected big things from an episode called “Z’ha’dum”. They weren’t wrong. It ended with the show’s lead character jumping to his death. The episode was so big the episodes leading up to it teased “Z minus 14 days” and “Z minus 7 days.”24 was filled to the brim with huge cliffhangers, but this one – arriving at the 16 episode mark – stands out for sparking what would be the show’s best run of episodes. President Charles Logan (Gregory Itzin) is revealed to be the mastermind behind the shocking assassinations of David Palmer and Michelle Dessler, which kickstarted the season. And thus the show’s most memorable villain was born.2737 Friends – The One with Ross’s Wedding (1998)While Ross (David Schwimmer) and Rachel’s (Jennifer Aniston) “will they, won’t they” courtship arguably went on far too long, there was one moment during the season four finale that left fans with their jaws on the floor. Just after Rachel had accepted Ross was happy with fiancé Emily (Helen Baxendale), everything goes catastrophically wrong. Instead of saying Emily’s name during the wedding vows, Ross says the iconic line: “Take thee Rachel”. After the wedding, as the season finished, everyone was left wondering whether the pair would finally rekindle their romance for good.“I’m in a boxcar, buried inside a quarry, and there are bodies everywhere,” says Mulder to Scully during the season two finale. And just as Mulder solves the riddle of how those people died, the roof of the boxcar slams shut, trapping him inside. Worse still, the Smoking Man then arrives with a unit of soldiers. When they open the boxcar, Mulder’s somehow nowhere to be seen and they decide to blow the freight to smithereens. Did Mulder survive? Did he get away?2937 Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life – Fall (2016)“It certainly wasn\u0027t the ending I expected,” Rory Gilmore actor Alexis Bledel said of the finale. “Fitting but frustrating”, was how Vanity Fair referred to the episode. The Gilmore Girls sequel, A Year in the Life, concluded with a four-word exchange between Rory and her mother, Lorelai (Lauren Graham). “Mum”, the daughter says, sitting in a park’s bandstand. “Yeah”, she replies. “I’m pregnant,” Rory says. Queue hundreds of fans wanting more from the story, which had, ultimately, come full circle.3037 Star Trek: The Next Generation – Best of Both Worlds (1990)Another science fiction show filled to the brim with cliffhangers. Star Trek: The Next Generation had many, but few can measure up to Picard (Patrick Stewart) becoming a Borg. The season three finale sees the Enterprise’s crew having no choice but to turn on their former captain, with Riker (Jonathan Frakes) ordering Worf (Michael Dorn) to open fire on Picard’s Borg ship. Fans had to wait three months to discover whether Picard could be saved – and the fandom almost imploded in the meantime.Marissa Cooper (Mischa Barton) and Ryan Atwood (Benjamin McKenzie) would have done anything for each other. When Ryan’s brother Trey (Logan Marshall-Green) gets in the way, attacking Marissa, Ryan has no other course of action but to settle things “once and for all” between them. As the brawl ensues, Marissa somehow ends up shooting Trey. And as the bullet goes through him, Imogen Heap’s song “Hide and Seek” – AKA the “Mmmmh, what you say?” song – suddenly starts playing. It’s hard not to laugh. The pop song cuts through the scene, completely at odds with what’s happening on screen. No wonder, then, that Saturday Night Live famously parodied the scene in one of their most-beloved skits of all time.Jim (John Krasinski) and Pam (Jenna Fischer) were the ultimate “will they, won’t they” couple, their chemistry electrifying the early seasons of The Office. Things peaked for the first time during the season two finale. Following Casino Night at Dunder Mifflin, Jim finally takes Pam aside to reveal his true feelings, telling her: “I’m in love with you.” She is, at the time, engaged to Roy (David Denman), and decides to reply to Jim: “What are you doing?” While all hope for the pair seems lost, Jim finds Pam (calling her mother) before the episode’s end and kisses her. Cruelly, the showrunners decided to cut to black after the moment, leaving fans wondering for months whether the couple would return to screens happily together (spoiler: they do not).JJ Abrams loves ending things on a twist. Before creating the mystery-box filled Lost, the filmmaker created Alias, and the season two finale marks one the show’s greatest endings. The episode sees Sydney (Jennifer Garner) discover that Francie (Merrin Dungey) is not Francie at all, but a duplicate. The two then brawl, ending with Sydney shooting Francie and then collapsing due to exhaustion. We immediately jump to Sydney waking up in Hong Kong. After reuniting with her lover Michael Vaughn (Michael Vartan), Sydney realises things are amiss as Michael is wearing a wedding ring. Turns out, she has been missing for almost two years. Cut to black, and the world asking “What just happened?”3437 Spooks – Smoke and Mirrors (2003)The season two finale of Spooks shocked the nation. While the episode begins with the CIA taking on a seemingly straightforward mission – to prevent a member of the Cabinet being assassinated – we soon discover that everything’s not as it seems. The formerly-presumed dead Herman Joyce (Tomas Arana) is still alive and masquerading as Herb Zeigler. Not only that, but the villain has masterminded an elaborate plan to make it seem as if Tom (Matthew Macfadyen) has assassinated the Chief of the Defence Staff. With everything working against Tom, the agent finds himself backed into a corner. And when Harry (Peter Firth) loses faith, Tom decides to shoot Harry with his shotgun. Does Harry die? Will Tom ever be found innocent? The questions were many.3537 Dragon Ball Z – Next time on Dragon Ball ZThere’s really no definitive Dragon Ball Z cliffhanger, as almost every single episode in the series finishes with one. From Vegeta staring menacingly at the camera to the villainous Cell launching a deadline attack on Goku, the series leaves you anywhere and everywhere. When that voice-over comes in with “Next time on Dragon Ball Z”, you can guarantee any child watching will be hooked and instantly wanting to watch the next episode.Pushing Up Daisies was unceremoniously brought to an end after just two seasons, with showrunner Bryan Fuller having to quickly conclude the whimsical series with very little notice. The epilogue was added late into the writing process and sees the narrator offer some closure to each characters’ story. Yet, with Ned (Lee Pace) and Chuck (Anna Friel) standing on her aunts’ doorstep, waiting to finally reveal that she’s alive, fans could see that there were originally supposed to be many more seasons to come – and they still want them desperately.Following a war of words with Jim Moriarty (Andrew Scott) on the roof of a building (in which Moriarty shoots himself in the head), Sherlock (Benedict Cumberbatch) decides to seemingly commit suicide by jumping off the building. However, not all is at it seems, as Sherlock is seen alive before the episode end. Fans of the series – plus Martin Freeman’s Watson – were left questioning what exactly happened to Sherlock, with all being revealed in the following special.Waters said: “Top Boy is a raw, real representation of street culture. It explores how these characters came to make the choices they\u0026nbspmake,\u0026nbspand gives the audience a behind-the-scenes look as to what is happening on our streets today. It needs to be talked about and the show doesn’t shy away from giving us the platform to tell our story. We can’t change things if we do not acknowledge it and understand it first. Netflix is the perfect platform for this show, there aren’t many networks who would be brave enough to keep it this real.”On the Assassination Vacation tour, Drake is his own worst enemyDrake pays tribute to Nipsey Hussle at O2 Arena showDrake drops Michael Jackson track from setlist as UK tour kicks offThe series also features musical artists\u0026nbspLittle Simz\u0026nbspand Dave, while Shone Romulus returns as Dris and Ashley Thomas returns as Jermaine.\u0026nbspNew cast members include Lisa\u0026nbspDwan, Jasmine\u0026nbspJobson,\u0026nbspKadeem\u0026nbspRamsay, Saffron Hocking, Kola\u0026nbspBokinni and Hope\u0026nbspIkpoku.The story will follow Dushane\u0026nbspas he returns from exile to his home in London to reclaim his throne in the drug market.\u0026nbspHe teams up with Sully, his\u0026nbsppartner and sometime rival, who has been released from prison.

This dramatic jump is likely to attract many investors who have been sitting on the sidelines. In addition, it can be expected to reignite institutional interest.Created with Sketch.Bitcoin\u0027s volatile history in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.18 Satoshi Nakamoto creates the first bitcoin block in 2009On 3 January, 2009, the genesis block of bitcoin appeared.

This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the yearSince launching in 2015, six years after bitcoin, Ethereum\u0026nbsphas seen remarkable growth due to its functionality, which extends beyond just being an alternative payment system.Like Bitcoin, Ethereum relies on the same underlying blockchain technology that means it is decentralised and does not rely on traditional financial institutions like banks to function.But beyond being a virtual currency,\u0026nbspEthereum\u0026nbspwas designed as a software platform that enables applications such as smart contracts\u0026nbsp– which are self-executing, secure contracts – to be built and run without the need of a third party.‘Bitcoin Jesus’ predicts ethereum will be most valuable cryptocurrencyThis means it aims to not just decentralise banks but decentralise the entire internet.Its utility has led some industry experts to speculate that Ethereum\u0026nbspcould one day surpass bitcoin as the world\u0027s leading cryptocurrency.Ethereum has the possibility to overtake the market capitalisation, and thus the value, of bitcoin, Hubert Olszewski, director of business development at Blockchain Board of Derivatives, told\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbsplast April. This is because from the get-go it was a more versatile tool.Ethereum\u0027s recent gains may give investors hope that it can fulfil such expectation,\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspthough it still remains a long way off bitcoin – and a long way down from its $1,400 peak from January 2018.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Juergen Ziegler, chief executive for Europe, said that while Brexit was not the only factor, it has brought forward the decision to relocateThe latest stark warning from Britain’s car industry came after MPs again failed to agree on a way forward for the Brexit process, voting down a series of alternatives to the prime minister’s deal.Mr Armstrong said Ford ahd spent tens of millions of dollars preparing for a no-deal Brexit. “The best case for me would be that that money is actually wasted because we actually reach a deal,” Armstrong said.\u0026nbsp“So I would encourage all parties concerned to figure out how to get us to a deal that guarantees frictionless trade because otherwise we will have to consider seriously the long-term future of our investments in the country.”\u0026nbspThe company has already laid out plans to cut thousands of jobs across Europe, including the UK, as it tries to boost profitability in a region where it has underperformed for years. The bulk of the redundancies are expected to affect Germany“Brexit is not the reason for that, but it clearly is another factor that if we were to get a hard Brexit we would have to think seriously about what further steps we\u0027d have to take,” Mr Armstrong said.\u0026nbspLast week the industry trade body said\u0026nbspcar\u0026nbspproduction in the UK fell by 15.3 per cent in the year to February, the ninth consecutive month of falls.

That collapse, unimpeded by Margaret Thatcher and the Conservative government, was devastating even by the standards of the time because of Birmingham’s over-dependence on the automobile industry.“This city lost more jobs in less than 10 years than any other part of the UK, including the whole of Scotland and Wales combined,” says Sir Albert Bore, a leading figure on Birmingham City Council. No less than 200,000 positions disappeared and unemployment averaged 25 per cent, climbing to 50 per cent in the worst-hit areas.“We realised the government was not going to help,” he adds, recalling that the city did not have at that time a single adequate hotel or restaurant in which to house and feed the potential investors it was hoping to attract.The refusal of the British state to provide funds as a catalyst for revival forced the council to look to Brussels for help in its renaissance.“The EU made it happen because theirs was the first big investment,” Bore says. Over the following years, the city received huge amounts of funding from the EU.Created with Sketch.Both sides of Brexit: Remain and Leave through a lens Show all 29Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Remain protesters with pro-EU banners sit next to a Leave campaigner in Trafalgar square during the People’s Vote march in London.

The city had boasted in the 19th century of being “the city of a thousand trades”, between them supplying the world with whatever merchandise it wanted. But many of these goods were made by a low- or semi-skilled workforce and a technology that\u0026nbspwas becoming obsolete. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspFormer chair of Vote Leave refuses to apologise for breaking lawThe problems the city wrestled with in the 1980s were the same seen in other urban centres in western Europe and the US, except that in Birmingham’s case the difficulties were worse because of its vast and vulnerable vehicle-making sector. The solutions adopted resembled those elsewhere too: reviving the city centre, attracting high-skilled industries and financial services, creating a highly skilled workforce with an emphasis on expanding higher education.The 1.1 million population today is younger than any similar city in Europe, largely because there are 80,000 students from the UK and abroad studying at high-prestige institutions such as Aston University, Birmingham City University and Birmingham University, the latter alone employing 10,000 people.Financial institutions have grown here, such as\u0026nbspDeutsche Bank, which once had only a back office in the city but\u0026nbspnow has a trading floor and employs 1,500 people. New foreign-owned automotive industries like Jaguar Land Rover have moved in or been revived. Against the odds, Birmingham pressed all the right buttons to move towards a high-skilled, high-technology economy operating across the boundaries of many nation states.Over the past year there have been investment decisions taken by a range of industries that we do not know about, but we will see their impact in five or six yearsPeople who masterminded the transition, however, now wonder if they are about to see Birmingham’s economy once again capsized, this time by the UK’s decision to leave the European Union. Among those most affected by Brexit are those enterprises and institutions which have been the wellsprings of Birmingham’s modern prosperity, uneven though the distributed of its benefits have been.Success stories that appeared assured are now in question. Will banks like Deutsche Bank and HSBC still be attracted to the same degree as before to Birmingham, or to any other city in the UK for that matter, if their ability to do business with the rest of the EU is curtailed or in doubt? Why should vehicle manufacturers, originally drawn to Britain as a platform to reach 500 million consumers in the EU, find post-Brexit Britain attractive? Will foreign staff and students at the universities be deterred by difficulties over visas, residency, qualifications and, in the case of researchers, a reduction in EU funding?Bore, credited by many with overseeing the renaissance of the city, believes that the Brexit effect will come in two stages. The short-term one will be (or already is) visible, affecting “just-in-time” deliveries of components, the financial services and all those trading with the EU. But what worries him most is the strategic long-term decisions now being taken by international companies regarding Birmingham that nobody knows about except the decision makers. He warns that “over the past year there have been investment decisions taken by a range of industries that we do not know about, but we will see their impact in five or six years”.Created with Sketch.

Eddy Moreton, a musician who owns a pub with a music venue in the town of Stourbridge west of Birmingham, says that over the past 15\u0026nbspyears he has travelled to cities and towns in Germany, Belgium, Netherlands and Denmark. He believes that leaving the EU will affect small businesses like his much more than big firms“I used to be able to get in the van and drive to Denmark, earn money, drive back – simple, but I won’t be able to do that anymore and that’s a great loss,” he says.Supporters of Remain in Birmingham are outraged by what they see as the misinformation, ignorance and xenophobia that typified the EU referendum campaign everywhere. \u0026nbspBrexit or no Brexit, for many in south Wales life offers few prospectsJon Bloomfield, a historian and urban policy specialist, is the author of Our City: Migrants and the Making of Modern Birmingham, a highly informed and eloquent account of life in a modern British city during a period of globalisation, austerity and mass migration.\u0026nbspAt its core are interviews with 50 migrants, illustrating the ersity of the immigrant communities in Birmingham, but Bloomfield also paints a picture of a city that responded energetically and successfully to the multiple challenges posed by radical economic change.Bloomfield was horrified by the way the Brexit campaign legitimised xenophobia and racism. He relates how he tried and failed to get Gisela Stuart, the Leave-supporting Labour MP for Birmingham Edgbaston, herself born and raised in Germany, to condemn Boris Johnson for demonising EU political leaders as the heirs of Hitler and Napoleon in trying to create a European superstate.I know someone who has moved into Northfield from Brixton and they couldn’t get over how white it was, as they had heard how Birmingham is this erse place -\u0026nbspbut if you go to the outer city it is just not there.“My mind almost explodes with rage,” says Bore when he hears the EU being scapegoated for miseries caused by domestically generated economic policies.“People feel left behind but that’s austerity for you: it drives despair, it drives unemployment. People have to have somebody to blame and they’ve blamed Europe,” he goes on.Local government in Birmingham is hampered in doing anything to alleviate the deprivation caused by austerity because its budget has been slashed by £750m\u0026nbspsince 2010 thanks to central government cuts. \u0026nbspMisinformation and austerity explain much, but they cannot explain everything when it comes to analysing why, despite many signs of economic success, Birmingham voted in the 2016 referendum to leave the EU by the slim margin of 50.4 per cent to 49.6. In the west midlands as a whole, the Leave majority was much higher at 59.3 per cent.Remain voters were aghast and baffled by the outcome, often reacting with derisive cliches about “turkeys voting for Christmas”, given that the economic arguments for staying in the EU seemed to them so overwhelming. The simple answer to this is that the turkeys in question never felt that they had much of a Christmas to celebrate at any time and were never likely to offer endorsement at the ballot box to anybody in charge of the festivities.The beneficiaries of Birmingham’s well-advertised economic renaissance included only a proportion of its inhabitants, in sharp contrast to the impression given by its bustling multiethnic city centre. Alex Aitken, a 25-year-old care worker and a Labour councillor representing a ward in the Northfield constituency, says that the city’s reputation for ethnic and social ersity is deceptive.“I know someone who has moved into Northfield from Brixton,” he says, “and they couldn’t get over how white it was, as they had heard how Birmingham is this erse place with multiple backgrounds, but if you go to the outer city it is just not there.”Tory isions deepen over Brexit amid warnings of a ‘national crisis’Aitkin says that districts in these areas are markedly different from inner-city Birmingham and much more like the northeast of England where there are “those old-school Labour seats that voted Leave”.The ision – essentially between those who benefited from globalisation and those who did not – is the same all over England and Wales. A breakdown of the referendum vote ward by ward in Birmingham shows that three decisive factors are educational qualifications, age and ethnicity. These explain more than\u0026nbsp90 per cent of the variation in voting and were a more accurate determinant of voting choice than poverty and social class. The lower the educational level, the higher the number of people voting Leave vote and vice versa. \u0026nbspMartin Rosenbaum, in a study of the ethnic dimension of the Birmingham vote, writes that Shard End ward, which is 82 per cent white, “had the highest Leave vote, at 76 per cent, and the lowest proportion of graduates, at 9 per cent. In contrast, Moseley and King’s Heath ward had the lowest Leave share, at 23 per cent, and consists of 46 percent graduates.” Only in the five wards where migrants are the majority did the less well educated and older voters chose Remain.Leave voters told pollsters that the priority issues for them were “immigration” and “sovereignty”, in contrast to Remainers who plumped for “the economy”.In Stourbridge, a town which voted Leave by 68 per cent, Eddy Moreton says that many there are “independent-minded people who work for themselves and see the world through a conservative prism of self-reliance”. He describes the town as being a very white place with few immigrants where xenophobia is common and there is an “I’m all right Jack” attitude. \u0026nbspThe DUP has put Northern Ireland’s future in peril over BrexitHow far have isions exposed by the referendum fuelled a real rise in ethnic isions in Birmingham and elsewhere? Some 44 per cent of the city population are first- or second-generation migrants and they will soon be in the majority.One needs to downplay a tendency since the referendum to see all toxic developments as somehow caused by the result. There was a widely reported hammer attack on the windows of five mosques in Birmingham in March but police concluded that they were not carried out by far-right extremists and detained a man under the Mental Health Act who handed himself in at a police station. Recent demonstrations in March by Muslim parents over teaching about LGBT+ relationships in primary schools are best explained by the growing conservatism of Muslim communities in Britain and not as collateral damage related to Brexit.Yet the political atmosphere is definitely becoming hotter and more poisonous. Moreton, who argues for better housing and cost-effective solar energy use in Stourbridge, is worried by a growing intolerance of contrary opinions.The short-term effect of a Brexit might be less significant than people fear, but the long-term impact – political, social and economic – will most likely be much greaterHe and his wife run a pub called the Katie Fitzgerald’s, named after his wife’s mother who came from Cork, though he says that it is not an Irish pub in the traditional sense. They had suspected even before the referendum that Ireland would eventually become an issue in Britain because of the border and this might make them vulnerable because of their Irish sympathies. Sure enough, during the campaign he found himself accused in public of being a supporter of the IRA. Nothing further happened, but he remains anxious because “none of us know how high the political temperature will go” and “many people blame Ireland because they think it stops them having the Brexit they want”.Above all other anxieties, there is the issue of “immigration”, which all polls and surveys say was the prime and determining issue in the referendum. Leading Brexiteers in parliament seldom speak of it, as if embarrassed by their exploitation of the issue, but it has not gone away or ceased to resonate. For decades the populist end of the mass media has drip-fed readers with stories of immigrants who are “spongers” on the welfare state, though figures show that they draw on it less than the non-immigrant population. The perception of migrants as parasites may be ebbing, but is not going to go away.Misperceptions are not all on the right. Bloomfield writes that people broadly supportive of immigration underestimate the impact of raw economic competition between different low-income communities for limited opportunities in jobs and housing. He quotes a successful entrepreneur born in China who gave an unsentimental summary of the forces shaping race relations.“It is much easier to get on if you live in wealthy St John’s Wood or Edgbaston,” he says. “When you have conflict for jobs, for survival, then it’s much harder. It depends what level you are at. If you are facing poverty, good race relations are much harder.”Overall, the big cities of Europe like Birmingham –\u0026nbspBarcelona, Munich and Milan\u0026nbsp– have done better than national governments in responding to the explosive impact of globalisation. The short-term effect of a Brexit might be less significant than people fear, but the long-term impact – political, social and economic – will most likely be much greater.Moreton, for instance, fears a slow slide from Britain as a European welfare state to something closer to the free-market American model. “But it won’t happen overnight so people will say the idea is just fearmongering,” he says.What is undeniable is that Brexit has already produced a crisis that has lasted three years and shows no sign of ending. The rebirth that Birmingham and other British cities once sought pre-Brexit may no longer be attainable in an era of instability and turmoil.We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write. That’s why, in an era of political lies and Brexit bias, more readers are turning to an independent source.

Struck by the extreme socioeconomic disparity, remnants of both the caste system and the impact of colonialism, I was fascinated by this rich, complex country.\u0026nbspIn particular, I was gripped by the plight of the Aasis, indigenous tribal communities which\u0026nbsplive on the outside, or on the margins, of Indian society.They have shirked India’s caste system, by opening a community where all group members are different, but equal. But in respect to the rest of the country, Aasis are exiled: separated and subordinated.\u0026nbspMoved by the Aasis’ plight, I began to direct an exciting art project that would open the Aasis’ culture and build an awareness of their ancient traditions and self-resilience. I wanted to stimulate and record Aasi art, performance and story-making. The aim was to share their narratives around the world, with audiences who did not even know they existed.\u0026nbspThis is the story of my utopian idea, and its sheer catastrophe in practice.​Gandhi’s influence in India diminishesI leave home gladly, excited to be on my intrepid voyage to the wilderness in India, my favourite country. It is snowing so hard as I make my way to the airport. England has ground to a complete standstill, while\u0026nbspeveryone complains about the weather. The roads are slushy but the taxi\u0026nbspeventually arrives. At the airport I I think, ‘Here I am –\u0026nbspat the start of my adventure!’The plane, of course, is delayed for hours\u0026nbspbut eventually makes it to\u0026nbspBombay\u0026nbspwhere I am to catch a flight the next day.\u0026nbspI step out of the terminal and into\u0026nbspthe hot wave of blurred air as smog hits me. Knocked for six, I try to breathe. I sniff. I cough, and blink. Quite a change from the bitter “Beast from the East”\u0026nbspblizzard paralysing Blighty.\u0026nbspI’m so late the driver sent by my hotel is nowhere to be seen.Can’t be that hard to find a taxi, I think.\u0026nbspI follow signs and, a disorientated while later, I find myself in a multistory car park trying to book an Uber. Eventually I find my taxi and show him the address of my hotel, which is supposed to be very near to the airport (according to TripAdvisor), and easy to find (hence my booking). The driver does not seem very confident, or much more clued in than me – though that may be because the language gap. Down the back streets of Bombay, he gets lost and can’t find the hotel. He drops me off at a hotel that isn’t the one I had booked. Unknowing, I get out, pay him, and he drives off. I go to this hotel\u0026nbspbut it isn’t mine. They direct me. Lost, unsettled, confused, eventually, I find the hotel I booked.When I arrive, the manager (who speaks Pidgin English, thank goodness) tells me that they already cancelled my booking, since I had not appeared at 12pm. I’m late. And there will be no refund. What to do.\u0026nbspI tell him that I did not cancel my booking, my flight was delayed. There was no way to inform him that I would be late, since I was on a plane. He just says I have no booking. Goodbye.What are the options… I have no idea where I am, I could go back to that other hotel, but I can’t remember how to get there. I ask the manager if I can book another room. He says I can, but for a price three times the price of the original booking I had made (which he had cancelled). Plus, the price of the previous room of\u0026nbspwhich they had cancelled the booking. SCAM! Welcome to India. I argue with him for a bit, and try to barter the price, without much success. There is very little I can do. I’m too tired. I book the room, go there and fall asleep (completely exhausted).I awake at 3.30am the following morning, after an unsettled night, and have a cold shower (no hot water), make myself a coffee with my travel kettle. Refreshed, I go downstairs. The hotel taxi costs 5 times what the Uber cost yesterday. I try to argue, but no one speaks English. It’s like arguing with a brick wall. I leave, cross, in a hurry.But I get to the airport in one piece, and in plenty of time for my flight. I try to get money out of the ATM. It does not accept my card. The second machine is broken. The third refuses to give me any money. Buzz. A text message from my bank. Apparently, a considerable amount of money has been withdrawn from my bank account. Not me! Fraud. My account is blocked.\u0026nbspI have no access to money.The bank puts me on hold (expensive minutes)\u0026nbspbut there isn’t time to wait. It is about 1am in the UK anyway. Bank closed. What to do?I need to concentrate on the next stage of my imminent adventure. Waiting for the next flight, I meet one of my collaborators, Krishna, an art therapy student, who has come from Singapore to join me on this trip. We have an Indian breakfast (a version of the Indian staple,\u0026nbspcurry), plus coffee, and board the flight to Raipur.​There we meet\u0026nbspJaya, also an art therapist. We also meet our\u0026nbsplocal guru\u0026nbspwho is to\u0026nbsptake us around the Aasi villages. Almost ready, I’ll just get my bag.\u0026nbspI realise that my baggage is lost. Oh dear! I ask my friends to talk to the Jet Airways team and raise this problem. What am I going to do without all my stuff?Onwards. Either I’ll never see any of it again, or else they might somehow find it, in which case it will have to wait here until I return to Raipur. Anyway, I have my medication, my phone, my bank card (which isn’t working). I’ll survive.We leave the airport and begin a five-hour cab journey\u0026nbspto Kondagaon, the town where we will base ourselves during our visits to five Aasi villages in this area. In Kondagaon, we stay in a hotel. I share a room with Jaya, who very kindly lends me some of her clothes. No matter that I resemble a mountain of lead beneath a corpuscular tent, these clothes are very pretty. Indian chic (if pasty, unkempt, above my white-cum-blue pallor).Practical difficulties arise: who pays the bills, when my card is blocked? What to do… I ring my bank\u0026nbspbut the problem of sourcing money persists.For dinner, us comrades go to the local restaurant (which we visit three times a day, every day, during our odyssey around Kondagaon). We always have the same thing: for dinner and lunch there is roti, or countless chapatis, with spicy sauce (how hot can you take it?) and vegetables, pulses, or meat, followed by a large dollop of rice to mop it all up. For breakfast there is dosa\u0026nbsp– the\u0026nbsplarge, thin, crispy (slightly greasy at the edges) curved pancake, dunked in a selection of spicy sauces and unknown concoctions. Some involve coconut, or chickpeas. Most are definitively hot. Curry for brekkie. Quite a wake-up call. This comes with short, very sweet, cups of coffee.I have a cold shower and potter about the area near the hotel. Lots of stray dogs and cows. Everyone stares at me. I stick out like a (sore) thumb. So white I’m china blue, remember, complete with permanent, haggard bags beneath my eyes. Namaste, I bow to every stranger.Five hours after I usually eat, I’m famished, and guzzle whatever there is. How unusual. I have a history of, to put it mildly, being fussy (or severely disordered eating). In India I eat whenever and whatever food is given. We discuss the plans for today.The guru will lead us to villages\u0026nbspwhere we will meet members of the Aasi people\u0026nbspand talk to them about the role that art and craft plays in their daily lives and traditions. We will ask if they would like to make art with us, and take part in creative workshops about storytelling, to hear and share their stories, about their lives, homes, culture and their spiritual beliefs.The first village we go to is laden with sense stimuli. I watch the ritualistic sacrifice of a cock and a boar. They squirm and twitch. Blood flows. Still, they convulse. Where is life? I think. Surely they’re dead? Why are they moving? The spirit doesn’t leave these bodies immediately. It is applauded, hallowed to the Aasis. Engrossing, revolting, captivating: a powerful ceremony.This is set within the deep, earthy chthonia (or the underworld) of the landscape around the village. A meeting is called, dominated by the men. They do all the talking. The women (who do all the work in the fields, and seem to run the economy and sub-structure of the working village) are silent. We decide that we would like to work with the women and the children, so we ask for permission to talk with them about our project. They are silent. The village meeting becomes “one for the lads”, and we make no headway with discussions or plans about the project.Dalit\u0026nbspwomen seek economic empowerment (Getty)There is apparently a school teacher who speaks English. I long to find him, so that I can have some kind of input, or understand the conversation, so far in Hindi. My inability to follow or make any sense whatsoever of the discussion (being left outside of all discussion) continues to be a huge problem.We find the teacher. He invites us into the shady classroom – a cool, airy, open space with mud walls and a roof. Relieved, I open a spiel about the aims and intentions of the project. The teacher interrupts me:“Yes, but what’s in it for us?”“We have you westerners come here often,” he continues. “I understand why you are here. The Aasis are very interesting to the west, as a self-contained, self-composed, self-reliant people. We are happy in ourselves, with ourselves. We don’t need you. What have you to give us that we don’t already have or want? No one will participate in August. We’re all busy in the fields. It’s impossible, then. Other times are difficult. You haven’t made it clear exactly what benefits you’re offering us, in any case.”The\u0026nbspAasis\u0026nbspare very interesting to the West, as a self-contained, self-composed, self-reliant people. We are happy in ourselves, with ourselves. We don’t need youThis is pertinent, practical and ontological criticism. It points towards serious flaws in the project, which need addressing. Urgently. What are we offering to or for the Aasis? Why would they need this project? Or is it just about me, my ideas, my project, my hopes? Except, by now the project is far larger than my own investment in it. It’s a global collaboration.The guru says this man is a case of “intellectual arrogance”, and we must continue, despite his claims. But we need to pause and reflect. The man was saying that I am arrogant the colonial coming over to instal her views – which suit my purposes\u0026nbspbut not the Aasis’. I do nothing for the Aasis.Downcast, I leave the village in sheer dismay. It seems the “untouchables”\u0026nbsp(rightly) don’t want to be touched and we have no right to do so.Bumpy journey on the way to the second village. We have lunch. There are eight of us, including our guru’s conglomeration of friends. I’m silent, exhausted, and thoughtful. A thousand and one (hundred) rupees later, I’m running out of money fast. Very bad mood. Off to village two, and I hope it’s more successful. But, doubtful, the whole plan’s in ruins.Eight of us journey, squeezed into the car, to the second village, which is a much more positive experience. When we arrive, we meet lots of children at the school and they seem subdued, reserved, silent, restrained. We later find out that their parents dope them with the local wine (made in each village) until they’re quiet and fall asleep, so the parents aren’t bothered by them.This village is much smaller and more remote. A different culture, a different dialect. We speak with the women, the schoolteacher, the chief. By the end of our visit, the women and children are following us around and invite us to have a drink of water and a private meeting (for and with the women), while\u0026nbspthe men are doing the same thing nearby.Then we are invited for sweet tea and some weird marzipan snack thing at the chief’s big house (outside the village). I am a sheer outsider because of the language barrier. I have no idea what anyone is saying.Fast-forward:\u0026nbspthe trip is now ON. After such a positive meeting with different members of the second village, we are formally invited to stay with them for a few days in August, and to collaborate artistically with the women and children.What can I offer this project? Here, I am the rich white woman who dishes out the money. I am expected to pay for everything, with no acknowledgement, just presumptionAfter the second village we go back to Kondagaon and I have a cold shower to refresh. Exhausted, yet again, always. Shortly, myself and my two colleagues go to the one restaurant in the region we’ve been going to, three times a day, every day. At last we can debrief and discuss what we’ve seen and learned in the villages. Our conversation restores (if momentarily) my hopes in the project. I go to bed full of hot, spicy stimuli, and fall straight to sleep (gratefully).In the morning, I awake promptly. I go for another walk in the streets, to talk to the lurking cows I have by now befriended. Pensive, I consider how the project is challenging all of my resources: ethically, linguistically, financially, corporeally, emotionally. I do not know if I could afford all these differing, demanding expenses.Soon it’s time for dosa, a shot of coffee, and onwards to village number three. We arrive. There is a Gond\u0026nbspreligious festival, which involves the selection of men to embody God. In the distance, I can see a man shaking and screaming, in a trance, as the spirit ascends into his body. His visionary ecstasy is pure, so powerful. He enters a trance, apparently to relieve suffering in the village.All the men are involved in this crucial meeting at the local temple. We watch from afar, and then go back to the village to talk to the women.This village is very spread out – quite a distance between houses. All the women are busy in the fields. Lots of buildings being erected, lots of development, brand new houses with\u0026nbsptelevision aerials. Government funding is marked by logo on each home. This is pure propaganda. They take the old tradition of building houses from mud and natural materials, with natural lighting, and replace it with cheap asbestos and electricity, branded with a political logo.Meanwhile, no one has turned up for our meeting. Eventually they arrive, but they are not interested in the project.Onwards with village four, which has a population of about 1,000. I can’t follow the conversation that evolves during our meeting with these people, due to the language barrier. They understand Hindi (partially)\u0026nbspbut can’t speak it. A long way off, I gain the impression that these people already have a powerful tradition of living artistically. Their main mediums are dancing and singing. They spend most days in the forests gathering flowers for wine, and wood. They are non-committal about whether our project will be useful to them, or not. Will you teach us a craft? They ask. Sure, we reply. Can we then learn a livelihood, to earn money?This is not our intention. The Aasis have no distinction between art and life. Art is intrinsic to and part of their daily living habits, their ontology, their traditions and ancient culture. They don’t really understand the way we determine or distinguish works of art. It’s fascinating to learn about the role art plays for Aasis.It may seem weird to them that we come over and talk about inventing a project to “do” art together, when they may not “do” art as such.\u0026nbspIn any case, they surely\u0026nbspdon’t want any white westerner to come and pollute this pure, beautiful world. I feel out of place, selfish, unneeded.So where is the project? At best, severely challenged. Where am I? Exhausted. Worried.Village five. This seems a very positive space. The people are generous with their innate creativity. As soon as we arrive, one of the women (clutching her baby on one hip) marks our foreheads with red pigment, to celebrate the religious festival “Holi”. I encourage her to put a little in my book, then I spit on the powder and we both shape and seal it onto the paper. Art!We go for a long walk around the village, meeting lots of children. We are invited to return, to fulfil our project and make art with them, in August. Excellent.How a charity uses photography to give Kenyan children a chanceWhat it’s like to walk through Kenya’s Maasai Mara with lionsProtests erupt in India after videos of sexual assaults go viralWhen is Holi, what is its significance and how is it celebrated?This is a very challenging trip, on many levels. It’s hard work. I love it here. But in India I feel like an outcast, never worthy of value, a sore thumb. Because of the colour of my skin. Because I can’t speak Hindi. Because I’m English. Because I haven’t trained as an art therapist (like my colleagues, who take over). Because I apparently don’t have anything to offer. Which simply isn’t true. If the Aasis are outsiders, I am outside their outside, as the white, mute, colonial invader. This is a distinctly uncomfortable, disorientating\u0026nbspscenario. I sit, like a (large, squatting) lemon, trying to follow what sounds like gibberish, with no success. I get distracted by all the wonderful animals (everywhere) and become besotted by the beautiful children. I gaze around me, taking in the earth, the jungle, the fields, the blue houses. It’s compelling. I can’t follow what’s being said, except for occasional translations so, in a selfish way, I feel left out. A waste of space.What can I offer this project? Here, I am the rich white woman who dishes out the money. I am expected to pay for everything, with no acknowledgement, just presumption. I can’t provide meaning or content (other than monetary) since I can’t speak Hindi. They waffle on and on and on and I just can’t understand a thing. An outsider. Pointless.Heated discussion in the car on the five-hour journey back to Raipur. I raise my dissatisfaction with how things are going, and tried to simplify matters: either this happens in August, when I can come (as planned), or you two take the project away and do it another time, when I cannot come. Then it’s your project and I play no part. We argue. My colleagues have very grave concerns about the direction the project is leading, which in their eyes, is unethical. It is fundamentally wrong to go in August, and impose ourselves on the Aasis at their busiest time, harvest. I say that we asked the Aasis about this, and whereas most villages said we must not come in August, two villages said that they would welcome us. The guru adds that there would always be a time available for an activity such as art-making – for example, between 5pm-9pm\u0026nbsp– even during harvest.My colleagues say that it is still intrinsically unethical to impose ourselves upon them. In addition, it’s wrong and scientifically unclinical to live with the Aasis during the project. “They eat cats!”I want to inhabit the project, and stay with the people, eat, sleep, make art, work with the people. This is crucial. Our guru concurs, you can’t do this without living with them, he says. It will only work if you stay with the Aasis.Krishna and Jaya are very unhappy with this idea, from a clinical perspective, which relies on having critical distance between oneself and one’s client.All my suggestions and all the project are unethical and complicated.F***\u0026nbspthat. It’s a simple decision: either it happens. And it happens in August, if it happens with me. Or it either doesn’t happen at all, or they take it away and do something very different.Jaya says that if there has to be a decision now, she and Krishna (with art therapy hats) will have to pull out. I retort: fine. I’ll do it with our guru. It’s on!My proposal: I will come out for two weeks in August and deliver the project, showing and sharing art with the intention of retaining social history. We want to open and share ancient cultures, storytelling, narratives, crystallised, composed, distributed, retained, made history. I will stay in the villages and our guru will collaborate and contribute as translator. Krishna and Jaya may decide to join me if they eventually deem what’s happening sufficiently “ethical”, whatever that means.In Raipur. A horrible situation last night. After a very difficult, tense journey here from Kondagaon, after the disintegration of the project, there is a heavy silence. We stop for fuel. I have to pay. My card won’t work. Blocked again. I have no idea how I’m going to pay for everything during the rest of this trip.We arrive at the hotel our guru had booked. Krishna and Jaya decide to share a room so they can discuss the project, and their reservations, without me. I have a room to myself. I get very excited because there is a kettle and a teacoffee-making facility. I accidentally turn on the kettle and it catches fire! Suddenly there is a fire in the room! F***! I hastily pick up the burning kettle, with flames everywhere, and I chuck it in the sink. Sheesh. Fire!\u0026nbspI turn on the tap and luckily it soon goes out. Smoke everywhere! Choke! Even worse than the polluted smog outside. I go downstairs and ask for another room. Drama.At 8pm two people whom I met and worked with on my last trip here, in Raigarh, turn up. These are genuine and committed political activists, well known for their dedicated work on human rights and the Aasi people. They showed me round villages during my previous visit to Korba, when I made a documentary film. I remember going to a Neo-Marxist (Naxalite) meeting with them. Though I had no idea what was being said, I sensed the fervour and passion, always uprising in their voices, in their lives, in their need. Something must be done! This had been one reason why I’d returned to India, to make art with the Aasis. But this time I’m in a different area, with different tribes, who have different problems. No mines here.The couple made a five-hour train journey to see me in Raipur. Wow! How nice, I think to myself. We can have dinner and chat. But they don’t speak English and expect me to put them up for the night here at this hotel. The white colonialist should pay for everything. They also think I have a serious political proposition and want to collaborate with their staunchly activist agenda.\u0026nbspInnocent, rather confused, I did not realise they were coming at all, let alone under these conditions.We go out for dinner to clear the air. More roti at a nearby restaurant. The couple ask pertinent questions for the project as a whole. They are coming from the perspective of the Aasis’ around Raigarh, who face the annihilation of their landscape, homes and livelihoods by mining. They say to us: we need political solutions, we need our homeland restored, we need jobs not art! What can art actually do\u0026nbspin times of severe turmoil and trouble? In practical terms, an artwork won’t save someone’s life, it won’t bring social, political or economic solutions.By now my project is in tatters. I can’t begin to retaliate to these crucial challenges. The couple say that my project, or any project with art, or art per se, cannot help the Aasi population anywhere in India. There are other, pressing, urgent demands that should take precedence over anything that wants to engage with art, craft, culture or cultural heritage. Art is a luxury, not a basic need.These ideas and criticisms are essential to face and focus on. I retreat and rethink everything. The couple return to Raigarh and I spend one last night in Raipur. In the morning, I go to the airport and they have found my luggage! It went from Bombay to Delhi back to Bombay, then to Raipur. Anyway, I have it now. Jam-packed full of creased clothes and melted cheese (my present for the Aasis, now a pile of smudged fat and grease, leaking through the molten rubber casing). The situation between us three “collaborators”\u0026nbspis very difficult. I’m the Rich Old Stupid Mute(d) Colonial Imposter. Good enough to pay. Nothing else. Silence. Then, at the airport, we separate (even on the same flight).The situation I encountered then seemed to confirm the aftermath of western colonialism. This was evident in the person I came to represent, as the white person who paid for everything and stuck out like a sore thumbNow on my own, I have time to reflect. This trip went from awful – luggage lost, fraud, card blocked – to worse than extreme,\u0026nbspbecoming the Outsider, a crisis of identity.Back in Bombay, I go for a frank meeting with the people who had offered to fund the whole project (that is, invest and pay for the major undertaking proposed in August, and also for the global travelling exhibition, book, and other intended happenings). As a result of this meeting, the project is officially OFF. For a practical reason, the funders said it would be madness to try and do it during the monsoon season, and simply would not be possible.Off for another reason: there are already numerous NGOs that work with the Aasis and their art. The funders suggest that if I still want to do this project, I must collaborate and work under one of them. There’s apparently an awful lot of AasiGond art out at the moment, so nothing new or valuable about my proposition. It already exists. It’s very popular. This points to yet another flaw:\u0026nbspinadequate research. It seems that there is no need for my project, and it must not happen at the only time I can do it. Shall I wait, rethink, gain new collaborators, work under another organisation (not from my own ideas), and then in two years’ time, after I’ve qualified as an art therapist, try again? But I’ll have a career – I hope – by then? The passion will have withered. It’s inconceivable. So it’s off. Officially.I’m distraught. I have spent the past four years organising this project. And now, it’s been a waste of time, energy, money. So much money.I leave the meeting with the funders with a premise from contemporary Indian neurology. A neuroscientist friend of the couple is at the meeting. We talk for a while, and I tell her about the damage to my left temporal lobe, which still affects me. Do you have any ideas for how to retain memory? I ask her. Yes, she says. In my research, I have found a solution to brain damage: to regenerate brain cell growth you must starve yourself, and take up running. I suggest you eat a low-calorie diet and go for a run at least twice daily. That should restore your memory and make your brain work better. Touché. I do not tell her that my previous experience of extreme starvation had been almost deadly. Is this advice what I should take from my time in India?By now, I’m in my hotel room in Bombay. Last night I slept well, because of my medication. I awoke at around 4:45am\u0026nbspand had a coffee. I will have something to eat at 7.30am – free breakfast, included in the expensive package of staying here. I was very upset yesterday. I’m still upset now, due to the collapse of the project. I don’t feel very well, mentally or physically. I’m exhausted, distraught, I feel dizzy, my head aches, I’m so disappointed.I mean, nothing’s wrong: by now I have my luggage, I’m in a room at a hotel. There’s hot water, wifi and a kettle. My bank card is now working, and I have enough cash left to get me to the airport. But I am defeated. My spirit, my passion for this project, for the Aasis, has died. How pathetic. A waste. Hopeless. Now. In fact.Created with Sketch.The blind elephants of India\u0027s popular Amber Fort tourist attraction Show all 7Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Amber Fort is one of India’s biggest tourist attractions, where elephants, many of whom are blind and lame, are forced to haul tourists up and down the steep fortMore than 100 elephants are kept at Amber FortOf the 103 elephants, 10 had tuberculosis, 19 were blind in one eye or both, and all suffered foot problems, according to a 2018 health report by the Animal Welfare Board of India When the animals are not forced to give rides to tourists they are often kept alone at night, heavily chained in “concrete boxes”.

Many visitors do not realise the animals are blind or lame.Tourist elephant rides are a steady business at Amber FortWhen I came to India, I was relieved and thrilled to be going to a warmer climate, to be releasing my darling project, to be collaborating with friends and useful people, to be fulfilling hopes and dreams. I was seriously considering emigrating to live in India. I changed my mind, when so disheartened – completely losing heart – by reactions and assumptions to me as a person and my project. For the Aasis, the guru, his friends, my collaborators, everyone I encountered in India, I am – and can only be – the colonial invader. I hold history on my back. It cripples me.The situation I encountered then seemed to confirm the aftermath of western colonialism. This was evident in the person I came to represent, as the white person who paid for everything and stuck out like a sore thumb. This happened because I can’t speak either Hindi or any of the Aasi dialects, I had to rely on my colleagues’ translation, I was separated and removed from proceedings and decisions. I felt separated and judged as the only white person.Crushed, I felt an outcast. This was very interesting, since perhaps I could then empathise with the Aasis’ situation on the margins of Indian society, and the caste system. I was an outsider, the Aasis are outsiders, but I was unable to connect with them. I felt cast out of their being cast out.The Aasis are not interested in my art project. They say they are happy, self-contained, self-sufficient people, they don’t need a western intervention from a white person.Protests erupt in India after videos of sexual assaults go viralWorld only thinks of Kashmir when it’s close to war, say politiciansThe girls hoping to fire India to Street Child Cricket World Cup gloryIndia bans imports of waste plastic to tackle environmental crisisIndia close to creating ‘green fireworks’ in effort to curb pollutionHaving been planning this project for over four years now, this is extremely disappointing. What can I learn from it? Perhaps the idea that there is never such a thing as “post”-colonial is an important observation to take from this episode. On the one hand, my proposed intervention seemed to rely on dominance and hierarchy (despite my best intentions). I approached the Aasi people with ideas and propositions about engaging with art as a form of sense-making. Some of these ideas were based around a form of art psychotherapy (with my colleagues, who were trained, and arguably blinkered around this field).Maybe this seemed an imposition of unwanted material. Who says the Aasis want or need art therapy? In the area we visited, there seemed little social unrest or disturbance. Any intervention from a westerner seemed unnecessary, unwanted. That is not to say the Aasis did not welcome usme. They listened, and two villages invited us to come into their community and make art with them, to do our project. But it is important to learn that the project being offered to the Aasis seemed to reconfirm a colonial dynamic. The contrary was my intention.I am left wondering if or how it is ever possible to be truly “post”-colonial. Are the remnants of history, the battle scars of the British Empire, impossible to eradicate or move on from? Now, I must consider how to facilitate a project which has a more elastic, symbiotic rapport with people on the margins, without reconfirming the barrier between the inside and outside of those margins.I had hoped my project would engage the Aasis’ ancient heritage and culture, to celebrate their innate capacity to regenerate. I began as the utopian wishing to destroy the empirical patriarchy I emerge feeling ever restrained, and crushed, by that very history and identity I’d wanted to challenge and disrupt.We’ll tell you what’s true.

This avoids having to purchase land to create affordable homes.The occupancy will vary depending on the location of the ZED Pods. The Pods flexible nature allows them to serve as short term accommodation, such as for holiday makers, as well as in a long term scenario for young professionals, or single people wishing to get on to the property ladder in an affordable manner.By minimising the demand for energy and water, and placing a translucent waterproof solar canopy over the space between the homes, it is possible to provide zero energy bills for the these homes as well as providing zero emissions electricity to charge points integrated in the parking spacesThe tiny homes could sell for between £50,000 to £60,000 or rented as one bed homes for young couples for around £750 month with around £50 bills on top, according to the architect’s estimates.The development costs are reduced as there is no need for land acquisition.Further benefits extend to the prefabricated nature of the pod, which significantly increases speed of construction without effecting the durability of the pod. A typical Pod community can be erected and commissioned in under a month, and within a week on sensitive sites.The eco-friendly houses, around 74 square feet of floor space, would be complete with solar panel roofs, water recycling systems and electric vehicle charging.77 Communal space under the canopy“It is cheap to live in, gives young people privacy, has good shared communal spaces, has good access to public transport and saves key workers from long commutes into city centres with high property values,” Bill Dunster OBE told the IndependentA ZED Pod is a small, low cost energy efficient starter home intended for housing young people within city boundaries over existing areas of parking or garages.

The single market and customs plan was rejected by 21 votes, and so would also have passed if all TIG and Lib Dem MPs had supported it.The speech Theresa May should make if she wants to avert Brexit doomThey were not alone: more than 30 Labour MPs who want a referendum abstained on Common Market 2.0. There were claims that some had reneged on a deal under which soft-Brexit backers would vote for a referendum, and similar\u0026nbspcounter-claims from the rival referendum camp.\u0026nbspA dispute between MPs who favour a single market blueprint and supporters of a public vote has simmered for weeks, and has\u0026nbspnow boiled over.The People’s Vote campaign\u0026nbspargued that a referendum should not be seen as a rival plan B since it offered\u0026nbspa solution to the crisis rather than an alternative Brexit option.\u0026nbspWhen it came to the crunch, TIG and most Lib Dem MPs decided not to dilute their selling point as a Remain party by voting for options allowing Brexit to go ahead.\u0026nbspTIG MPs said their efforts to draw up a composite motion combining a soft Brexit and referendum were rebuffed. Another attempt may be made in due course by TIG and the Lib Dems, but by then it might\u0026nbspbe too late.The senior backbenchers behind the search for a\u0026nbspcompromise are now devoting their energy to\u0026nbspa bill forcing Theresa May to seek to delay Brexit to prevent a no-deal departure on 12 April.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

security for their own future and that\u0027s the basis on which we will meet her and we will have those discussions.Mr Corbyn added: However people voted in the referendum in 2016, whether they voted remain or they voted leave, they didn\u0027t vote for lower living standards, they didn\u0027t vote to lose their jobs.And actually there\u0027s far more that unites people on both sides about the

whether the UK takes part in the EU elections was not the most important question, rather that the most important issue was to make sure we don\u0027t crash out of the EU next week with no deal, and what I believe would be a degree of chaos that would follow as a result.He also warned that Labour would hold in reserve the option of tabling a confidence motion in the government if it proves it is incapable of commanding a majority in the House of Commons.Responding to Ms May\u0027s statement, however, the former foreign secretary and Tory Brexiteer Boris Johnson said it was very disappointing the cabinet had decided to entrust the final handling of Brexit to Mr Corbyn and the Labour Party.It now seem all too likely that British trade policy and key law making powers will be handed over to Brussels - with no say for the UK.We’ll tell you what’s true.

infuriated Tory Eurosceptics as hope of no-deal Brexit slips awayClick to followIndy PoliticsTheresa May has dramatically torn up her Brexit\u0026nbspstrategy, paving the way for a softer withdrawal in a bid to secure Jeremy Corbyn’s backing to pull Britain out of the EU.The prime minister confirmed the UK would seek a further short delay to Brexit beyond 12 April in a Downing Street statement that infuriated Eurosceptic Tories.Government insiders believe the two big parties’ positions on future customs arrangements are not so far apart and could form the basis of a new deal.Does May think Corbyn is stupid enough to hand over a Tory Brexit?No 10 aides said the PM would approach talks in a “constructive spirit”, but within minutes other sources suggested discussions would simply be used to recapture control of the Brexit agenda as MPs come close to forcing an outcome on the government.Mr Corbyn agreed to a meeting, possibly set to take place as early as Wednesday, saying he recognised his responsibility “to represent the people that supported Labour” at the last election.Ms May’s move came after a marathon seven-hour cabinet during which ministers had mobiles taken off them to prevent clandestine briefing to the press ahead of the prime minister’s statement.Brexiteer ministers who have said they would quit if the PM pursued a customs union were yet to resign last night with the final Brexit outcome still unclear.In her statement Ms May said: “Today I am taking action to break the logjam.Created with Sketch.Opposing protesters flock to parliament on would be

ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of Parliament“I am offering to sit down with the leader of the opposition and try to agree a plan – that we would both stick to – to ensure that we leave the European Union and that we do so with a deal.”The prime minister said the idea would be to agree on a joint approach both she and Mr Corbyn can back and if not, put forward several different options for future relations with the EU for the Commons to vote on.We recognise that she has made a move. I recognise my responsibility to represent the people that supported Labour in the last election and the people who didn’t support Labour, but nevertheless want certainty and security for their own futureThe Independent understands Ms May would be likely to bring back her own previously defeated deal as one of the options at that point, if initial talks with Mr Corbyn fail.The prime minister said she would “abide by the decision” of the Commons and that Mr Corbyn would have to as well for the approach to work.The Labour leader responded: “We recognise that she has made a move.“I recognise my responsibility to represent the people that supported Labour in the last election and the people who didn’t support Labour, but nevertheless want certainty and security for their own future and that’s the basis on which we will meet her and we will have those discussions.”The PM’s aides would not rule out that discussions could include a customs union or even giving the British public a Final Say referendum on Brexit, although they pointed to the PM’s previously stated views.The government’s current plan for future relations include many facets of a customs unions, while Mr Corbyn’s approach calls for “a customs union” but one that would give the UK greater freedoms than Britain’s existing EU membership.A desperate last attempt to save Brexit, from a defeated PMThe logical dissonance at the heart of the Brexit failureTwo malicious devices found on railway lines ‘linked to Brexit’The Conservative Party is already in turmoil, with one MP quitting on Monday claiming the cabinet is “cowardly and selfish” – but the idea that Ms May could strike a deal with Labour will probably push the Tories to the brink of a major rupture.Boris Johnson said: “It is very disappointing that the cabinet has decided to entrust the final handling of Brexit to Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour Party.“It now seems all too likely that British trade policy and key law making powers will be handed over to Brussels – with no say for the UK.”He said it would be “ridiculous” if the UK were forced to contest European elections as a result of the further delay, adding: “I can under no circumstances vote for a deal involving a customs union as I believe that does not deliver on the referendum.”Ms May delivered her statement while the Brexit-backing European Research Group (ERG) met, with its members watching her on television and one reporting, “it did not go down well”.Chair of the ERG Jacob Rees-Mogg attacked Ms May for working with “a known Marxist”, and when asked if he could back a deal struck with Mr Corbyn, he said: “Well, I wouldn’t hold your breath – I’m not a Marxist in case you hadn’t noticed.”He added: “What was announced today was an attempt to overturn the referendum that wanted a clear Brexit, to do a deal with a socialist who doesn’t want Brexit and is not in line with the Conservative Party’s manifesto commitments or with the referendum.”But one minister told The Independent that the move was about ensuring that a cross-party move by MPs, led by ex-Tory minister Sir Oliver Letwin and Labour’s Yvette Cooper, to impose an outcome on the government is superseded, with the Commons looking to vote on its own options again soon.Cabinet ministers were called to Downing street at 9.30am on Tuesday for a stormy meeting, one without civil servants, to discuss the way ahead.It lasted until 2pm, with ministers eating sandwiches for lunch, before going into a formal government cabinet until 5.30pm.Ms May’s aides were clear that there was little support for a general election, but would not confirm there had been unanimous backing for her suggested approach, with The Independent hearing differing reports of the level of opposition.One suggested that the majority for an extension in cabinet was 17 to four, with only two of the 17 calling for a long one and two further making a point about backing a short one.The four ministers who opposed it were Liz Truss, Chris Grayling, Gavin Williamson and Penny Mordaunt, according to the source. Some other ministers were not explicit in their view.Another very different account suggested that there were 14 ministers against the idea of an extension and only 10 for. Ms May’s aides later said there had not been a specific show of hands at the meeting.\u0026nbspWe’ll tell you what’s true.

risk of the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal next week.\u0026nbspIn a second series of “indicative votes”, two options were only narrowly rejected: to keep the UK in the EU customs union – or in both the single market and a customs arrangement.The Commons also turned down putting any agreed deal to a Final Say referendum – and rejected revoking Article 50 if the UK is close to the no-deal Brexit cliff-edge.The results were followed by Nick Boles, the Conservative MP behind the “Common market 2.0” plan for the single market and customs arrangement, dramatically quitting the Tory whip on the Commons floor.Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, said the cabinet would discuss the impasse tomorrow – but pointed out the UK was due to leave the EU in just 11 days’ time, with no deal in sight.May calls cabinet talks as UK heads towards election \u0027nobody wants\u0027However, Final Say supporters were cheered that their option won more votes than a week ago, securing 280 and losing by just 12 – the narrowest defeat.Peter Kyle, one of the Labour sponsors of the motion, urged colleagues to “see how minorities can be brought together” to still achieve a Commons consensus.Created

because my party refuses to compromise.

According to @AOC, they can run for President, too,” Ms Cheney tweeted in reference to a conspiracy theory espoused by Donald Trump.“I see from your dead people comment that you get your news from Facebook memes,” responded Ms Ocasio-Cortez, who linked to a Newsweek article she said would “clarify your misunderstanding” of the 22nd Amendment.Created with Sketch.Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez - the Democratic congresswoman in pictures Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez greets fellow lawmakers ahead of the State of the Union addressAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez participates in an event with Democratic members of CongressThe Democrat senator speaks during a news conference at the U.S. Capitol January 30, 2019Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and fellow Democrat Rashida TlaibAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez at the Senate chamber to watch two votes on January 24, 2019Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez arrives with Chellie Pingree at a House Democratic Caucus meetingOcasio-Cortez during Donald Trump\u0027s State of the Union addressNew York State Assembly member Catalina Cruz with Ocasio-CortezNydia Velazquez talks with Alexandria Ocasio-CortezOcasio-Cortez casts her vote for Nancy Pelosi as Speaker of the HouseAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez poses with a campaign worker during a whistle stop in the Queens borough of New YorkOcasio-Cortez outside the US CapitolOcasio-Cortez after casting her ballot in the 2018 midterm general election at a polling site in New YorkAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez looks on during a march organised by the Women\u0027s March Alliance in ManhattanOcasio Cortez looks on at the Capitol in Washington, DC, on January 16, 2019Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez greets fellow lawmakers ahead of the State of the Union addressAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez participates in an event with Democratic members of CongressThe Democrat senator speaks during a news conference at the U.S. Capitol January 30, 2019Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and fellow Democrat Rashida TlaibAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez at the Senate chamber to watch two votes on January 24, 2019Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez arrives with Chellie Pingree at a House Democratic Caucus meetingOcasio-Cortez during Donald Trump\u0027s State of the Union addressNew York State Assembly member Catalina Cruz with Ocasio-CortezNydia Velazquez talks with Alexandria Ocasio-CortezOcasio-Cortez casts her vote for Nancy Pelosi as Speaker of the HouseAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez poses with a campaign worker during a whistle stop in the Queens borough of New YorkOcasio-Cortez outside the US CapitolOcasio-Cortez after casting her ballot in the 2018 midterm general election at a polling site in New YorkAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez looks on during a march organised by the Women\u0027s March Alliance in ManhattanOcasio Cortez looks on at the Capitol in Washington, DC, on January 16, 2019Despite the crticism, Ms Ocasio-Cortez was at least partially justified in her claim Roosevelt\u0027s popularity forced a constitutional change.Lawmakers were already pushing for the 22nd\u0026nbspAmendment when Roosevelt won an unprecedented fourth term in 1944.\u0026nbspHe died less than three months after his inauguration the following year, before a Republican-controlled Congress ratified the amendment in 1947.We’ll tell you what’s true.

He said people simply won’t believe in promises of such a big payout – a minimum wage of Rs 72,000 (£800) to the poorest 20 per cent of households in the country. “It won’t be a game-changer because of the lack of credibility in Indian politics,” he said.The BJP was seen as likely to lose its majority in polling just a couple of months ago, but an interim budget full of handouts and a nationalist reaction to clashes with Pakistan in February have seen Mr Modi’s party surge ahead. The latest poll for VMR gave the BJP a healthy cushion of 283 seats out of 543 in the Lok Sabha, the lower house of parliament.Styling himself as India’s “chowkidar” (watchman), vowing a “jaw-breaking” response to alleged Pakistan-fomented terror and announcing the launch of a new anti-satellite missile, Mr Modi has done everything in his power to make national security the main election talking point.India ‘prioritising cow welfare’ over women with ban on key drugWhy has India shot down a satellite in space?China destroys 30,000 maps that don’t list Taiwan as its territoryIndia is about to go to the polls, but not before a splash of colourAnd it is working, said Mr Mrug. “Our latest polling shows national security is now up there as one of the key issues, just behind jobs and unemployment,” he said.Sure enough, the BJP reserved its fiercest criticism for Congress’s pledge to review the Special Powers Act in disputed Kashmir, “to balance the requirements of security and the protection of human rights” amid accusations of widespread excesses by the Indian security forces.Finance minister Arun Jaitley, who also heads the BJP’s election publicity committee, said: “Some of the ideas in the Congress manifesto are positively dangerous and they will result in the Balkanisation of India.”Ajay Mehra, a former political scientist at Delhi University, said Congress’s “moderate” manifesto looked good on paper, but came too little too late for the party to counter the BJP’s right-wing pro-Hindu – and critics say anti-minority – agenda.The manifesto might strike a progressive tone, he said, but Congress has “veered to the right” since Mr Modi beat them to the 2014 election in a shock landslide.“Congress has not been able to mount an effective criticism of the (cow vigilante) lynching promoted by the BJP. It has not taken a very strong stand for the protection of minorities. It has also not taken a clear stand on Ayodhya and Ram Mandir (the plan to build a temple to the Hindu Lord Ram).“The manifesto now is all goody-goody, but by its silence and by some of its statements, in the past five years the party has certainly moved rightwards,” he said.\u0026nbspMr Mehra said that the only realistic prospect of unseating Mr Modi would be if the BJP falls short of a majority and a host of opposition parties, including Congress, can strike a deal for a broad-church alliance.Would-be coalition partners would probably ask Mr Gandhi not be put forward to lead the country, he said, making “the likelihood of him becoming prime minister very weak”.With so little time to go until polls open and the country is fully in election mode, the choice for voters is clearly being framed as either for or against another five years of Mr Modi. The vision for a future without the BJP at the helm might be more progressive, but it is also a lot less clear.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbspWe’ll tell you what’s true.

More than 740 people were killed and almost 3 million were left in need of humanitarian assistance after strong winds and widespread flooding ripped apart roads, houses, schools and health facilities – and submerged vast swathes of agricultural land.Cyclone Idai is possibly the worst weather-related disaster to ever hit the southern hemisphere. It\u0026nbspdevastated massive areas and displaced hundreds of thousands of people across the region. However, the full impact of the disaster has yet to be established and difficulties in reaching some areas continue as many bridges were washed away.As flood levels begin to recede, work to clear debris, reopen roads and reconnect electricity and water supplies has started. Some\u0026nbspwho fled their homes as flood waters rose are returning\u0026nbspand aid is getting through.However, a second emergency is looming as\u0026nbspwaterborne diseases threaten survivors. There have been reports of people drinking stagnant water from street puddles and of one the shelters is home to 3,000 people with just six toilets. Cholera cases have been confirmed and the number of reported incidences has jumped from five to 246 in Mozambique alone.Supplying clean water remains a significant challenge and member charities of the Disasters Emergency Committee\u0026nbsp(DEC)\u0026nbspare rushing to deliver drinking water, toilets and handwashing facilities.\u0026nbspMozambique confirms first cholera death as cases above 500Cyclone Idai is a reminder that we must take climate change seriouslyCyclone Idai: families desperately search for loved ones in aftermath Cyclone Idai reveals injustice at heart of climate changeCyclone Idai one of southern hemisphere\u0027s worst ever weather disastersAt times of very great need, the DEC brings together a unique alliance of 14 of the UK’s leading aid charities and broadcasters to maximise fundraising and quickly deliver effective emergency relief. The DEC’s Cyclone Idai Appeal was launched on 21 March and has now raised over £25m. The UK government matched the £4m donated by the public to the appeal.The immediate and primary focus of the relief effort is to save lives, but the effect of this disaster will be felt for some time. DEC charities are working closely with national partners to support the rescue and relief effort, deliver emergency shelter materials and blankets, food and urgent health assistance and trauma counselling.You can donate hereWe’ll tell you what’s true.

Its a fantastic opportunity to build understanding across communities and educate ourselves about our erse communities. Lets build bridges not walls.The Muslim Welfare House in London released a statement after the incident, saying it the attacker had shouted and hurled verbal abuse to the utter shock and disgust of all present.Toufik Kacimi, CEO of the organisation, said: We condemn in the strongest terms this outrageous act which has left everyone shocked.This disgraceful act by this inidual is a sign of the hatred and Islamophobia that sadly abound in our community.We will not let this deter us from cooperating with all groups in building a more cohesive society.Other Labour figures who have been also hit with an egg include ex-Labour boss Ed Miliband, as well as John Prescott, who went on to punch the protester.Last week Mr Corbyn confirmed that his party would get behind a second Brexit referendum, much to the fury of his pro-Brexit voters.But MPs in Leave backing seats warned it could cost the party their seats - and the next election."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000470489108.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"the independent group conservative mps political party","story":"Ex-Tory Heidi Allen today revealed more of her former colleagues were keen to join the Independent Group.And she hinted that the number was big enough to cost Theresa May her wafer-thin working majority of eight.Ms Allen told ITV: “We have more [potential defectors] than we could take in. We’re having to stem the enthusiasm there.“Two or three more would be as much as we could manage I think [to avoid destabilising the Conservatives].”The comment come as leaders of The Independent Groupprepare for exploratory talks with the Electoral Commission tomorrow to step up plans to become a fully fledged political party.Separately Labour began moves to boot ex-Labour MPs among TIG such as Luciana Berger off their seats in cross-party select cmmittees.TiG leader Chuka Umunna last month said the breakaway group hope to become a registered political party by the end of the year.But this could now be brought forward given the interest from other Tory and Labour MPs and polling which shows a staggering level of support for the new group.Ex-Labour MP Chris Leslie told The Sun: “The public deserve a better choice than Corbyn or an ever more right-wing Tory Party.“With politics this broken, we must urgently explore a new alternative for people at the ballot box.”So far, each of the  TIG MPs have defected from either Labour or the Conservatives and decided to sit as ‘Independents’ in their constituencies.Under Commission rules a new party has to provide information about its finances and constitution and to appoint people to the roles of party leader, treasurer and nominating officer.

There are currently almost , empty nurse jobs in England.And a new report by think tanks the Nuffield Trust, the Health Foundation and The King’s Fund predicts this could rise to , within five years.In the meantime, it is unsurprising to hear that nine out of ten NHS nurses say staff shortages are affecting the quality of care they can give their patients.One major problem is that we take our nurses for granted. Many AE nurses in particular are subject to unacceptable levels of rudeness, abuse and even violence.Hospitals are increasingly being run by non-medical staff who are mostly driven by targets and not quality of care. And more nurses are having to sit filling out paperwork rather than actually nursing.We also don’t pay nurses enough. You can probably work in Tesco stacking shelves for the same money as some nurses are paid — and live a much less stressful le.All too often, it’s not until we find ourselves dependent on nurses doing a good job that we truly appreciate them and what they do for us.When my grandmother was very ill in hospital, pretty much the only good thing about her hospital experience was the nurses.They were kind, chatty, cared for her, spoke to her and treated her with dignity in a very grim situation.We need to start appreciating nurses before it’s too late. Then we need to put our money where our mouths are.Sure, nursing is a vocational job. But money still matters, especiallyyou are living in a big city.It costs £, a year to train as a nurse. Nurses who have served ten years with the NHS should be given that money back in what I would call a “legacy payment”.If that payment is given in their pension, it would cost the Government very little, but I am sure nurses would love it.Since , the Government has axed the bursaries for people who are studying nursing or midwery at university.The budget for helping staff to develop their skills in the workplace has also been cut to a third of its value of five years ago.We need to give more support to people who want to train and bring back the bursaries.The current pay structure means that some fantastic nurses are underpaid — and that some terrible nurses are overpaid.We need to smash the pay structure and let hospitals pay what they want to their nurses and not be confined by pay brackets, so that really good nurses are rewarded and bad nurses are not.That would make a big dference, because we all know how demoralising it is to work really hard and yet be paid the same as someone who doesn’t.Nursing involves long and unsociable hours. All too often it involves having dinner at breakfast time. Nurses need to be offered more financial reward for working night shts.How will this money be raised  For a start, the NHS needs to make efficiencies, such as central buying and not give out vanity boob jobs and other medically unnecessary procedures.It needs to start charging peoplethey miss a GP appointment without good cause, and there should be means testing for patients over the age of  before they get free prescriptions.The country is run by unsung heroes — police, doctors, teachers and nurses. They are the foundation of this country and we can’t live without them.The repercussions of continuing to treat nurses with the lack of respect that we currently show them will be many, ied and severe.Let’s not find that out the hard way.RESEARCH showing that attractive women bosses are considered less truthful and trustworthy by both sexes is so depressing.As well as thinking that a pretty female boss is less likely to be honest, apparently both men and women also think they are more deserving of being fired than a less attractive counterpart.The implication is that any woman who shatters the glass ceiling is perceived to have used underhand methods to get there.How sad.And how far away from all of our hope that we are judged on our work, not our looks.I’M a big believer that it’s not what happens to you in le that matters so much as how you respond to it.But sometimes things happen that would make most of us want to crawl into a hole and hide.I have maximum respect for Londoner Zoe Parsons, , who has managed to turn her experience of domestic violence into something truly positive.When she told her husband, Edson Peart, that she didn’t want to have sex with him, his response was to rape her violently on a regular basis.He told her: “I own you.”After she plucked up the courage to leave him – a hugely brave act in itself – Peart broke into her house and attacked her, leaving Zoe needing stitches.Justice has now been served and Peart has been sentenced to eight and a half years in prison.Zoe has trained as a le coach, helping other survivors of domestic violence – which affects one in four women and leads to two women being killed each week.Astonishingly, marital rape was only recognised as a criminal offence in .This story is a necessary reminder that some men still misguidedly think they “own” women – and that marriage makes a woman their own personal property.For a start, private companies can pay their bosses whatever they like, as the pay comes out of the shareholders’ profits.And what MPs fail to realise is that these bosses give  per cent of whatever they earn back to the country in tax.So actually we should all be thanking God for them and the contribution they make to society, rather than making them feel bad about the money they take home.MPs might not like it but, frankly, as they seem incapable of doing their jobs at the moment, they are in no position to moan about people who get paid a large salary for doing a job well.What happened to the aspiration in this country MOSES ETTIENNE was jailed this week for claiming nearly £, from the taxpayer , in accommodation and living expenses, after saying he was living in Grenfell Tower when the fire broke out, despite giving the authorities who approved his payout a non-existent flat address.How on earth is this possible, surely an address is something simple to check Quite rightly he was jailed for five years after taking money that was set aside to help those who really needed it. Scum of the earth.But spare a thought for those for whom it’s not.I’ll be spending a quiet day with my kids and my mum.I don’t want any fancy chocolates, gts, cards or presents.Just a cup of tea in bed and a cuddle from my two kids... who can’t get their heads around the fact I have a mummy as well.VERY pleased to see that trend predictor Marian Salzman, , says the “age proud” movement is on the rise in .“Gone are the days when women lied about these things,” she says. “If you don’t say your age you look dated.”I couldn’t agree more. In fact, I make a point of never lying about my age. I am  next month – and proud.Andpeople ever say that I don’t look my age, I say: “But this is what  looks like!”WHY, when anything good happens in this country, do some people just want to whine Yet critics carp that it should be eligible only for Best International Programme, as the series first aired in the US.Shut up!It’s a British production and well worth celebrating.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They show voters are paying attention.Friday’s good-humoured protest by thousands of Brexit marchers in Westminster — on a working weekday — was in contrast to the otherwise souring mood among voters at large. Across the country, those who voted Leave in  are taking note and,betrayed, will seek revenge.The Black Spot planted on Tory plotter Dominic Grieve by his constituents last week is just for starters.The real blowback will come at the next election whenever it takes place — unless Britain is no longer a member of the EU.Polls yesterday suggested Labour is five points ahead of the Tories and poised to form a minority Government.These figures are meaningless. The next election will be decided not by votes for or against the major parties, but on the candidates’ support for the referendum result.There are .million votes up for grabs. They will either support pro-Brexit candidates or stay home and sit on their hands. Either way, it will transform the poll.Labour votes will be mopped up in Leave seats by Nigel Farage’s new Brexit Party, what’s left of Ukip, or, in Remain seats, by Labour deserters now known as Change UK.The picture is dferent for the Tories, depending upon when any poll is held and what happens in the next few weeks.A snap election, apparently to be announced on Wednesday, would be suicidal. Anything led by Theresa May would be a bloodbath.Under a new pro-Brexit leader, with breathing space to regroup, it could be an opportunity to clear the air once and for all. Meanwhile, we face further Commons chaos, showdowns with Brussels, the possibility of fighting European elections in May — and the outside chance of “crashing out”.No Deal is no big deal, as ex-Bank of England Governor Mervyn King told The Sun last week — at least for Britain. We would swtly overcome a short, bumpy ride.Not so for Europe — and for all their bluster, EU states are beginning to fear it happening by accident.Germany is grimly aware it is about to lose the UK as a long-standing ally in the balance of European power with France and the EU’s hard-up southern states.Without our £billion-a-year contribution — one of the biggest by EU states — Italy, Portugal, Spain and Greece will be queuing in Berlin for German cash.Unless a deal on frictionless trade is reached, German exporters will be hammered and hundreds of thousands of jobs lost in their manufacturing industry.Support for “populist” parties — including in Germany — has mushroomed since the UK voted Leave.Which explains this week’s dash to Dublin by German Chancellor Angela Merkel. She wants preening Irish PM Leo Varadkar to stop playing games and solve the Irish backstop question.Either he bows to technological solutions to avoid a hard border with Northern Ireland or there will be a hard border at Calais with Ireland on the wrong side.Merkel knows a solution to the backstop problem would persuade the DUP to support Mrs May’s Withdrawal Bill, and even push it over the line at the fourth time of asking.That, in turn, would be enough to persuade all but the most stubborn Tories to sign up and, along with a few extra Labour votes, bring this edition of the long-running Brexit soap to a close.As always with these negotiations, nothing is settled until everything is settled, always at the th hour. It is now .pm and ticking.Let’s hope the Irish Taioseach put his clocks forward yesterday.He needs results fast. In yet another bloody incident, four innocent civilians were kned at random in North London, apparently by the same man. But kne murders are sometimes little more than initiation rites.Stop and search by itself is not enough. Mobile detector arches must be deployed without warning where crowds gather.The only way to beat this scourge is to make knives too hot to handle.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They want to crash the Government, trigger a General Election, and reverse the referendum result.Senior Labour frontbenchers have said, on several occasions, that they’ve got no problem with the withdrawal agreement. And yet in their droves they voted it down on Friday, regardless of the .million votes cast nearly three years ago to leave the EU.It’s all very well for the Tories to simply assume that Jeremy Corbyn et al will never get near Downing Street – but it would be criminally complacent.We’ve more or less given up on the Brexiteers who refuse to vote for the PM’s deal, even though their preferred “no deal” is essentially impossible.But those who are tempted to plump for a permanent customs union in today’s ridiculous indicative vote process must also realise that they could very well trigger an election, with unknowable consequences.We are at a crucial moment in our history, and the stakes couldn’t be higher.WHEN the Tory leadership contest begins, it is an opportunity for the party to remind the country what it stands for.You can forgive the public for forgetting. Recently, the “small state” party has been more interested in bans and taxes than delivering for ordinary people.So it’s heartening to hear Liz Truss talk about radical overhauls of the planning system and slashing tax.

Bodyguard came from the off-cuts of Line Of Duty and it should be eternally grateful for the association.Line Of Duty is a television masterpiece and the opening episode of the fth series was a genuine TV event that, despite a whf of plot familiarity, had me reeled in before the end of the opening credits.That was as long as it took the show to introduce Stephen Graham, who’s giving a mesmerising performance as Detective Sergeant John Corbett, the UCOwho appears to have gone rogue with an OCG .There are lots of other new faces as well, including: A gang of bikers, with no bikes, who appear to have been styled by Vyvyan from The Young Ones.Slippery police spokesman Sindwhani, played by Ace Bhatti. PC Jane Cafferty, whose le was spared in the opening hijack scene by “gangster” Lisa McQueen.And the slightly robotic Detective Superintendent Alison Powell, who’s in charge of Corbett’s “Operation Peartree” and is yet another of those department chiefs who seems strangely drawn to “Ted” .A hell of a trick for a TV show to pull off, introducing them all while still tying up the loose ends of series four and leaving viewers to guess which painkillers managed to get DS Arnott out of that wheelchair and whether Hastings’ faulty hotel toilet cistern is critical to the new plot. Or just a faulty hotel toilet cistern.The fact Line Of Duty did it, however, is entirely down to the constants that have driven this show ever since its first series.It starts, obviously, with a thrilling and complex script from Jed Mercurio, who clearly gives not a stuff for any of the lazy, modern, right-on conventions of TV writing.It’s all about the story that demands the total attention of the viewers and gets the performance of their lives from the actors.Not just the newcomers, like Stephen Graham, but regulars Martin Compston and Vicky McClure, as Arnott and Fleming, who have the hardest job in drama, unravelling the plot for the audience.Without them there would be no room for the show’s crowning glory, Super-intendent Ted Hastings, who is that rarest thing in contemporary TV drama, a strong male lead.There used to be lots of them, obviously. Now we’re generally reduced to murderers, rapists or, at best, jaw-flexing “Yes, ma’am” dogsbodies, like in Bodyguard.The joy of Hastings is that the part gets the performance it deserves from Adrian Dunbar, who’s from Northern Ireland, so he was born sardonic and can give a whole new edge to lines like: “Listen Alison.

He knows he is — he loves to play and show off.”As I’m ushered through to him, I feel like I’m meeting a celebrity.I stretch out my hand and his tiny trunk pokes through the enclosure bars.He snfs my forearm and winds his trunk around my arm. It’s slightly wet, tickly . . . and very cute.“It’s a bit like a handshake,” Line explains. “When elephants meet, one may touch the face of the other, or they will intertwine trunks.”Howletts has two herds of elephants. Nusu was born into Masa’s group. The imposing -year-old matriarch is his maternal grandmother.Line explains: “She was rescued from Africa in the early s and is the boss of the group. She keeps them all in line. Where she goes, they all go.”Her daughter Jama, , became pregnant with little Nusu after mating with Coco, an -year-old who made quite the first impression with the females when he was transferred to Howletts from a Spanish zoo in September .Line says: “They went crazy for him but he is a very handsome elephant. He’s got a thick, large head and big pecks.“It was like Enrique Iglesias had landed!”And when Coco mated with Jama in January , “you couldn’t have missed it”, said Line, adding: “All the elephants gathered around them in celebration. It was quite . . . er, messy”.Not perhaps the Disney magic one would hope for.In director Burton’s version of the  animated classic, plucky flying elephant Dumbo was created using CGI.So a lesize model of Dumbo was made — selected from six iations produced by the film’s creatives — for use on set to get the lighting right.And in certain scenes, “creature performer” Edd Osmond stood in for Dumbo using a green suit — as both an eyeline and an interactive point of contact for the actors.Line, who hails from the French Alps, was the first to discover Nusu had arrived on the ­morning of September  last year.She said: “I came in at am and saw him standing — albeit shakily — with the herd. He was a bit wobbly and wet and only an hour old.Today Nusu — whose name means half-pint in Swahili — tips the scales at kg , more than twice his kg birth weight.At around .am the two groups of elephants —  in total — are released from their “house” into their nine-acre paddocks.And after lots of Mum’s milk and plenty of play time, Nusu is ready to head back to the elephant house for the night at .pm.It’s where the mighty mammals bed down, and a place where — just perhaps — this real-le Dumbo will dream about learning to fly. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Well, let’s see it.It is a crying shame that a clean break was effectively taken off the table years ago by this Government’s, and particularly this Chancellor’s, refusal to properly prepare for No Deal.And those ERG hardliners, who refused to confront reality over not one, not two but three votes, deserve plenty of flak too. They can’t say they weren’t warned.We loathe the idea of a softer Brexit. But at least it would unblock this paralysing stalemate. And we know Parliament will now do anything to avoid No Deal — even revoking Brexit completely.But it is vital — for the public’s faith in democracy — that the Withdrawal Agreement is passed and we aren’t forced to hold European elections.And an optimist must hope that the Tories are able to win a mandate in future to leave whatever customs fudge we end up in.All of this assumes that the Marxist opportunists in charge of the Labour Party don’t use this crisis to win themselves some party political points.The frontbench want the Government to collapse so they can force a General Election on the country.The backbenches, with a vanishingly small number of honourable exceptions, are full of elitist Remainers who are ­desperate to overturn the Brexit vote, come what may.There’s every chance their condition for talks is a confirmatory referendum.

Yet by his actions, he constantly thwarts the will of the people and blocks the road to genuine British independence.In a typical manoeuvre this week during further votes in the Commons, he ordered his MPs to support the so-called Common Market . option, which represents the softest possible EU withdrawal.Effectively, this option would keep Britain under Brussels’ domination by locking our country in the European single market. The bureaucracy of the EU would still be in charge, dishing out its rules and cash demands.But even worse, the plan — also known as Norway Plus — would mean the continuation of uncontrolled immigration from the EU.Our borders would remain open, the very opposite of what voters were promised with Brexit. Indeed, the Labour Party itself gave a solemn pledge in its  manesto that “freedom of movement will end” after Britain leaves the EU. Now those words have proved hollow.Corbyn’s move is a kick in the teeth for Leave supporters. One of the main reasons that .million people voted for Brexit was because of disillusionment with soaring rates of immigration, which have imposed a social revolution on our country without any mandate.Remain voters in the metropolitan chattering classes welcomed the massive influx, both as a source of cheap foreign labour and as a means to display their self-righteous political virtue. But large numbers of Leavers, especially in the working class, were fed up with the experience of seeing their own wages undercut, their public services over-stretched and their solidarity eroded.In part, Brexit was a bitter, justied cry of anger from those who had been left behind by the wealthy elite’s obsession with globalisation. These are the marginalised, hard-working people that the Labour Party was originally created to represent.  But now, in thrall to the fashionable dogma of mass immigration, Corbyn’s gang has badly let them down.Leavers wanted our Government to put a foot on the brakes of upheaval. The Labour leader is seeking to press down the accelerator.  His betrayal on freedom of movement is just the latest stage in Labour’s drive to prevent theof real sovereignty.Only last month their trade spokesman, Barry Gardiner, claimed that “Labour is not a Remain party”.  Yet Corbyn’s mob is certainly acting like one as it keeps inventing new obstacles to an orderly withdrawal.The hardline Brexiteers in the Tory Party rightly get a lot of stick for their stubbornness in their uncompromising pursuit of a clean departure from the EU. But at least they are motivated by principle.In contrast, all Labour seeks is narrow, short-term political advantage. The party cares nothing about the national interest or honouring the referendum result. It simply wants to create as much turmoil as possible in order to force a General Election, which would bring a Corbyn regime to power.Its ruthless opposition to Theresa May’s Withdrawal Agreement is a classic example of this damaging approach. Labour has no real objection to her deal, which fits exactly with Corbyn’s demand for a sensible compromise. Yet, in order to foment Parliamentary anarchy and bring down the Government, Labour refuses to back it.That is no way for a responsible movement to behave. Labour MPs keep telling us that they do not want a No Deal departure. Well, the best way to avoid No Deal is to vote for the only deal on the table. But that is exactly what Labour refuses to do.Typical of this intransigence is Yvette Cooper MP, the anti-Brexit cause’s hand-wringing high priestess, who has created a procedural quagmire in the Commons with her antics. Only yesterday, she called for a special Commission on Brexit. That would be a recipe for yet more delays and navel-gazing, which is exactly what she wants.Ever since the referendum result in , Corbyn has indulged in creative ambiguity about Labour’s stance on Brexit. He has tried to appeal simultaneously to both the army of Leave voters and the pro-EU brigade who make up the bulk of the party’s membership.But now the mask has truly slipped. By his decision this week, Corbyn has shown that he sides with the Remainers. In Labour’s battle for supremacy, the affluent metropolitan progressives have won against the traditional working class of the North and the Midlands. That should hardly be a surprise given how London-centric the top ranks of Labour really are.Every single one of Labour’s big guns on the front bench, including John McDonnell, Sir Keir Starmer, Emily Thornberry and Diane Abbott, represents a London seat. But the victory for the Labour Brexit blockers is a tragedy for our country. Corbyn’s gang is helping to wreck the chance for freedom.Labour thinks the present chaos at Westminster is playing into the party’s hands — reflected in a recent opinion poll that put them five points ahead of the Tories. But their negative strategy could backfire disastrously.If there is a long delay or, indeed, no Brexit at all, Leave voters will not be forgiving. Electoral carnage, not advance, could beckon.There are at least  Labour seats where support for Leave at the referendum was estimated to be more than  per cent — such as the . per cent in Normanton, Pontefract and Castleford where Yvette Copper, who campaigned for Remain, is MP.Many seats could be lost — and it would be no more than Labour deserves for its shallow, Remoaner-led dishonesty.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She has f**ked our party. She is f**king Brexit. She is f**king the country.And Boris Johnson announced he would no longer support the PM amid fears she was handing the keys to Brexit to Corbyn.Ex-Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith also stormed: “I am deeply worried.“The agreement is over and what we are looking at now is a completely dferent set of arrangements, dictated by Jeremy Corbyn, the worst political leader in the history of the Labour Party.“We have given Jeremy Corbyn legitimacy.”In an extraordinarily personal attack on the PM on Tuesday night the Brexiteer Tory MP Henry Smith blasted on twitter: Theresa May represents a monumental failure of British leadership, a betrayal of the majority who voted to leave the EU and Conservative Party membership.I called for her to go last year, incredibly she has descended further still. I cannot countenance her Corbyn Brexit process.The Democratic Unionist Party also made its feelings known.In a statement the DUP said: The Prime Minister’s lamentable handling of the negotiations with the EU means she has failed to deliver a sensible Brexit deal that works for all parts of the UK.Mrs May announced her last-ditch gambit in a Downing Street statement this evening after the marathon seven-hour Cabinet meeting.She said: We will need a further extension to Article , one that is as short as possible and ends when we pass a deal.And we need to be clear what such an extension is for – to ensure we leave in a timely and orderly way.This debate, this ision, cannot drag on much longer.It is putting Members of Parliament and everyone  under immense pressure – and it is doing damage to our politics.Mrs May said she was inviting rival Mr Corbyn for talks at No where they would seek to find a united approach - keeping the current withdrawal agreement but amending the declaration on the future UK-EU trade deal.The PM added: The ideal outcome of this process would be to agree an approach on a future relationship that delivers on the result of the referendum, that both the Leader of the Opposition and I could put to the House for approval, and which I could then take to next week’s European Council.However,we cannot agree on a single unied approach, then we would instead agree a number of options for the future relationship that we could put to the House in a series of votes to determine which course to pursue.Crucially the Government stands ready to abide by the decision of the House. But to make this process work, the Opposition would need to agree to this too.Mrs May concluded: This is a dficult time for everyone. Passions are running high on all sides of the argument.But we can and must find the compromises that will deliver what the British people voted for.This is a decisive moment in the story of these islands. And it requires national unity to deliver the national interest.And Brexiteer Michael Gove came out to bat for the PM this evening, saying her plan would allow Britain to leave the EU as soon as possible.He told Sky: The country voted to ensure we left, we need to make sure we honour that referendum mandate.And a spokesperson for the Prime Minister said tonight: Jeremy Corbyn was elected on a manesto to deliver Brexit.We think there is an opportunity to agree something here and put forward a plan that both sides agree to as a way of getting Brexit over the line.I think anybody would agree that is a signicant prize and one thats worth working towards.But Mr Corbyn has committed to keeping Britain in the EU customs union - so any compromise with Labour is likely to mean Brexit being watered down.The left-wing leader said tonight: We will meet the Prime Minister.We recognise that she has made a move, I recognise my responsibility to represent the people that supported Labour in the last election and the people who didnt support Labour but nevertheless want certainty and security for their own future.Pro-Leave Cabinet ministers may now be considering quitting in protest at the PMs new strategy.Ex-Foreign Secretary Mr Johnson led a chorus of criticism, saying: It is very disappointing that the cabinet has decided to entrust the final handling of Brexit to Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour party.It now seems all too likely that British trade policy and key law making powers will be handed over to Brussels - with no say for the UK.I can under no circumstances vote for a deal involving a customs union as I believe that does not deliver on the referendum.Brexiteer MP Charlie Elphicke blasted: Imposing the EU customs union with Labour votes would be appalling. It would break a clear Conservative manesto pledge. Our trade policy would be made in Brussels - not Britain. I will oppose this.Conor Burns, a close ally of Boris, added: We have a Government in name only. The reality is the Remain campaign began in June  and is on the cusp of victory.A former Cabinet minister branded the statement desperate, telling The Sun: The only real question is how anyone in the Cabinet agreed to it.There were signs that panicked Brexiteers realised they could be letting our EU exit slip out of their grasp.Daniel Kawczynski MP told Sky this evening: We are losing Brexit, we are actually losing it, and we are going to lose it unless we get behind the withdrawal agreement.But Nick Boles, who dramatically resigned the Tory whip on Monday night and accused the PM of mismanaging Brexit, welcomed her change in tone.He said: The PM’s statement is very welcome. This is the right approach. Better late than never.And EU bosses also suggested they are pleased with Mrs Mays U-turn - Donald Tusk tweeted: Even , after today, we don’t know what the end result will be, let us be patient.Ministers spent the whole morning locked in talks at No - then resumed after lunch and continued discussions until pm.They are torn over the next steps for Brexit and what should happenMrs Mays deal never makes it through Parliament.Cabinet ministers were served Chilean red wine while they waited for the PM to make her statement following the marathon Cabinet meeting. Ministers were ordered to stay in No to avoid reporters shouting at them as they left.The Cabinet was expected to see internal polling about how the party might do in another snap election.But tonight a No source said that ministers decided against holding a General Election. And Philip Hammond was said to be warning that Britain might be forced into a second referendum on Brexit as the only way to avoid a months-long delay.The Sun revealed that the PM would face an onslaught from Brexiteers who are demanding she go back to the negotiating table and try again to change the hated Northern Irish backstop.One Brexiteer Cabinet minister told The Sun: “We have to go back to Brussels and ask the EU to improve the backstop next week.“All we can do now is take this to the wire. Every other course will be a disaster.“The EU desperately want a deal. We just haven’t pushed them hard enough on this yet.The Pound rose and the FTSE- hit a six-month high as Mrs May’s speech calmed City nerves.But the Institute of Directors’ Edwin Morgan warned ther were still  “many obstacles ahead”.He added: “Business leaders want an end to this miserable uncertainty.We urge the Leader of the Opposition to work with the PM.”Food and Drink Federation chief Ian Wright also urged  Jeremy Corbyn’s “speedy support” for her.He added: “Livelihoods are at stake and jobs  on the line.”The FTSE- rose one per cent to  while Sterling hit .."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/NINTCHDBPICT0004803154981.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"tory mps tell theresa may tearing party apart","story":"Furious Tories said they could not believe the PM had decided to “legitimise” the Labour leader by reaching out to him to break the Brexit logjam.One likened the crisis facing the party to Suez  years ago.Senior sources said there was now a real threat of Tory backbenchers going on strike in the Commons by refusing to vote on Government business - while others Mrs May was “completely finished”.One said Brexiteers in the Cabinet – Liam Fox and Andrea Leadsom – had “betrayed the cause” and should have quit. Amid intense speculation Mr Fox could go his allies insisted last night he was staying put.Andrew Rosindell said the PM would “absolutely” split the party in twothe Brexit deal passes on Labour votes.He told The Sun: “Capitulating with Corbyn is completely unacceptable to all of us and I believe to the party across the country.“She has lost it. We are all pretty shell shocked by what she suggested.“We cannot believe a Conservative Prime Minister would actually want to give up governing the country and effectively forming a government of national unity with a Marxist.”Arch Brexiteer said Jacob Rees Mogg stormed: “People did not vote for a Corbyn-May coalition government.“This is a deeply unsatisfactory approach. It is not in interests of the country and it fails to deliver on the referendum result.“Leaders who decide to go with the opposition rather than their own party find that their own party doesn’t tamely follow.”One ex-Minister said the party faced wipe out at the council elections with activists already threatening to down tools.But others said they believed the hysteria would die down once they realised Jeremy Corbyn wouldn’t agree to anything. “I’m just going to let this f**kty.”Hardline Brexiteer Steve Baker said the crisis was so bad the PM may actually end up “unying” a bulk the party against her.“We are in a position where Conservative members across the country will be devastated that the Prime Minister has turned to an unreformed Socialist.“My sense is that everyone is so upset they are pulling together.

This would then be put to MPs for their approval. If she and Mr Corbyn cannot agree on a way forward then she will put a series of options to Parliament.  How signicant is this  This is a big departure for the Prime Minister who has so far refused to budge from her so-called red lines. She said in her statement that she would be willing to abide with whatever Parliament agrees to. Labouraposs position has been for a Brexit deal which includes a customs union, single market access and close alignment on workersapos and consumer rights. But they also want a confirmatory referendum. The PM, in contrast, has repeatedly spoken out against any form of a customs union and has been stridently opposed to a referendum.    Why is the Prime Minister reaching out to Jeremy Corbyn  The simple answer is she has very little choice. Parliament has rejected her Brexit deal three times. During the indicative votes process, no one option gained a majority - although the Customs Union option fell by three votes. However previously MPs have also opposed leaving with no deal.  Will Labour play ball  Jeremy Corbyn said he would very happily meet Theresa May. This is somewhat of a poisoned chalice for Labour because it means the Prime Minister can blame the oppositionthe pair cannot find a way forward. Labour have consistently said they are opposed to a Tory Brexit -they are seen to be facilitating that it could split the party.   Will they be able to agree  There is no sign for the Prime Ministeraposs statement on where she might be willing to compromise.

In a move which sparked a furious backlash from Tory MPs, the Prime Minister signalled she would move towards a softer Brexit .She promised thattalks with Mr Corbyn ended in deadlock she would then let MPs decide the future relationship with the EU.And to avoid a damaging No Deal Brexit she revealed her plan to kick the can down the road and ask the EU for another delay to Brexit. But in an explosive seven-hour Cabinet meeting, as many as  furious ministers criticised her plan to hand power to the Labour leader.   Many also fear a long extension with Brussels reluctant to grant one unless the PM shows she has a clear path forward.  Mrs May’s determination to finally get her EU orce deal through, even on the back of Labour votes, prompted a massive backlash. One Cabinet source told the Mirror: “This is a deeply isive move which puts the future of Brexit in the hands of Jeremy Corbyn and the EU. There is no way the party will stand for this. She can expect trouble ahead.” It comes after the PM tried, and failed, to get the withdrawal agreement past Parliament three times by relying on just Tory votes.  Mrs May’s plea to the Labour leader to work together to deliver Brexit signalled that she was prepared to go for a softer departure. No  confirmed that a customs union - which  Tories voted against this week - and a second referendum were both on the table.    A source said: “You know the PM’s views but unless there is compromise on both sides it is unlikely there is a way forward and Jeremy Corbyn needs to understand that too.” Downing Street was last night on resignation watch as several senior Cabinet ministers privately shared their anger. The PM’s move could even prompt Tory Brexiteers to vote against the Government in a confidence motion, bringing Mrs May down.    Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson said: “It is very disappointing that the Cabinet has decided to entrust the final handling of Brexit to Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour Party. “It now seems all too likely that British trade policy and key law making powers will be handed over to Brussels, with no say for the UK.”   Leading Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg added: “The history of political parties and political leaders who get major parts of business through on the back of opposition votes is not a good one. If you think of Robert Peel or Ramsay MacDonald. “You do find that leaders that do decide to go with the opposition find that their own party doesn’t tamely follow.” After the fractious Cabinet meeting, Mrs May said: “This is a dficult time for everyone. Passions are running high on all sides of the argument. “But we can and must find the compromises that will deliver what the British people voted for. This is a decisive moment in the story of these islands. And it requires national unity to deliver the national interest.”    The PM hopes to sit down with Mr Corbyn as early as today [WEDS] with the aim of striking an agreement to be put in front of MPs before an emergency Brexit summit in Brussels next week. But she promised thatthey could not reach a compromise, then Parliament would then be given the chance to dictate the future relationship with the EU. “Crucially, the Government stands ready to abide by the decision of the House,” she said. Mrs May stressed that any agreement was dependent on Labour backing her exit deal and helping deliver Brexit by May . But that date is in the hands of Brussels chiefs who could yet demand that the UK goes for a longer extension.   Mr Corbyn agreed last night to meet the PM. “We recognise that she has made a move,” he said. “I recognise my responsibility to represent the people that supported Labour in the last election, and the people who didn’t support Labour, but nevertheless want certainty and security for their own future. “That’s the basis on which we will meet her and we will have those discussions.” But the move could also spell trouble for Mr Corbyn with Remain-backing MPs deeply unhappy about being seen to facilitate Brexit. Labour needs to take Leave-backing seatsit wants to win the next election so feels under pressure to respect the referendum result.  Redcar MP Anna Turley said: “She is now trying to dip Jeremy Corbyn’s hands into the mess of Brexit.    “But a deal based on a backroom pact between the Government and the Opposition would simply be a stitch-up that left the people behind.” Others said Mr Corbyn should make a fresh referendum a condition of Labour’s support.   Cardf South MP Stephen Doughty said: “I sadly suspect the PM is not serious about cross-party talks, given her failure to engage seriously last time, but Labour will not engage in facilitating Tory Brexit.” The isive seven-hour Cabinet meeting took place in two parts - with a short  minute break for a sandwich lunch and a walk round the Downing Street garden.  Ministers, who had their phones removed to avoid leaks, agreed that they did not want a general election after being shown the latest party internal polling, which was described by one source as “devastating”. One No  insider said: “There was not a great deal of support,I can put it politely, for a general election at this point. It was agreed that it wouldn’t be the right thing to do.” Warring ministers led by Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson, chief secretary Liz Truss and Commons leader Andrea Leadsom, spoke out against the Corbyn plan but failed to get the PM to change her mind.    Sources suggested that gravel-voiced Attorney General Geoffrey Cox and Environment Secretary Michael Gove had played a pivotal role by declaring that this was the moment to “give Labour what they want” to finally get the deal through.  Chancellor Philip Hammond clashed with his deputy, Ms Truss, over the financial implications of No Deal - and was said by colleagues to have argued for allowing a second referendum.  After the meeting, ministers were kept in a side-room - described as “kettled in No ” by one source - and offered a glass of wine until after the PM had made her three-minute statement on national television.  While Brexiteers cried betrayal over the compromise, Remain-supporting ministers were delighted the PM had finally reached out. One cabinet source told the Mirror: “We’re very content. This should have been the statement she made after the snap election.” After the announcement, EU chief Donald Tusk tweeted: “Even , after today, we don’t know what the end result will be, let us be patient.”    Earlier, Brussels’ negotiator Michel Barnier warned a no-deal departure was becoming “day after day more likely”.  He reminded Brexiteers that leaving without a deal would not take the £bn orce payment or the Irish backstop off the table.  The UK would simply enter talks on a trading relationship from a weaker starting point. French President Emmanuel Macron warned that an extension could not be taken for granted and that the UK would have to present a credible alternative plan. He added: “Should the United Kingdom be unable - three years after the referendum - to propose a solution backed by a majority, they will de facto have chosen for themselves to leave without a deal. We cannot avoid failure for them.” "},{"url":null,"title":"dwp tory apologises parliament making","story":"NewsDWP Tory apologises to Parliament for making four errors in benefit freeze debateJustin Tomlinson, a Department for Work and Pensionsminister, said his factual blunders were \"inadvertent\"Share minister, said his factual blunders were inadvertent\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _NHP_CHP_-Parliament_JPG.jpg\" data-tracking\"facebook|share|\" minister, said his factual blunders were inadvertent\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _NHP_CHP_-Parliament_JPG.jpg\" data-tracking\"messenger|share|\" minister, said his factual blunders were inadvertent\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _NHP_CHP_-Parliament_JPG.jpg\" data-tracking\"twitter|share|\" minister, said his factual blunders were inadvertent\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _NHP_CHP_-Parliament_JPG.jpg\" data-tracking\"whatsapp|share|\" minister, said his factual blunders were inadvertent\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _NHP_CHP_-Parliament_JPG.jpg\" data-tracking\"linkedin|share|\" minister, said his factual blunders were inadvertent\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _NHP_CHP_-Parliament_JPG.jpg\" data-tracking\"flipboard|share|\" minister, said his factual blunders were inadvertent\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _NHP_CHP_-Parliament_JPG.jpg\" data-tracking\"email|share|\"CommentsByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  APR NewsJustin Tomlinson admitted the inadvertent factual blunders\"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA Tory DWP minister has apologised to Parliament for making four errors in a debate about the benefit freeze. Justin Tomlinson admitted the inadvertent factual blunders while MPs debated triggering the cruel measure for the fourth year in a row.The freeze - which is now costing families up to £, a year - will kick in for millions this coming Monday.It passed without a formal vote because it was tied up with separate rises to pensions and disability benefit.But Labour warned the freeze on working-age benefits was pushing families and children into poverty.The errors were made as Mr Tomlinson commented about detailed elements of benefits policy during the -minute Commons debate.    The minister said the severe disability premium would increase from £. to £., when in fact he was referring to the the Severe Disablement Allowance. Severe Disability Premia for a single person have instead increased from £. to £.. Mr Tomlinson said the government would increase the basic and full rate of the new state pension by either .%, average earnings or inflation, whichever is highest. In fact, he should have said the government would increase the full rates of the Basic and New State Pensions by the so-called triple lock. Mr Tomlinson also said the pension credit standard minimum guarantee - the threshold below which pensioner incomes should not fall - would rise to £. for a single person.  In fact the correct figure is £., higher than the minister said. And finally, he said the plans would help the vulnerable to the tune of £.bn, when actually this figure was also higher at £.bn. Mr Tomlinson made the apology in a written statement to Parliament. He said: The Social Security Benefits Up-rating Order  maintains the Government’s commitment to the triple lock for both the Basic State Pension and the New State Pension.  The Order also increases benefits for carers, s and those with disabilities and long-term health conditions sharing the proceeds of economic growth with some of the most vulnerable in society. I would like to clary the points... and apologise to the House for these inadvertent errors. Figures in February showed a series of benefit freezes and caps since the Tories took power in  have cost families £ to £, per year. Tory DWP chief Amber Rudd faced repeated pleas to end the freeze before it kicks in on Monday, but failed to do so. Chancellor Philip Hammond has said there re no plans to renew the freeze after it ends in April .

She explained: “Councils cannot open new schools of their own and have no powers to instruct academies to expand their intake. “This makes it very hard for local authorities to respond effectively to changes in pupil numbers locally.” She urged the Government to let councils open new schools - and provide the needed funding. However the Department for Education insisted class sizes are what matters. It said: “Despite an increase of over half a million [at] state-funded primaries in England between  and , class size has remained stable.

But is her quest for common ground sincere  An early test will be whether Mr Corbyn is invited in through No’s black front door in view of the TV cameras. If talks are hidden away in a back office, suspect bad faith. May’s penitent speech was a world away from her hectoring last effort, acknowledging the “best efforts of MPs” rather than accusing them of frustrating the will of the people. Let’s hope she strikes a similar note with Mr Corbyn. She’ll have toher goal of an exit by May  is to be met. Calm, reasoned compromise on a customs union, and maybe even a ­confirmatory referendum, is the order of day. Responsibility for the Tory Brexit chaos rests with her. But this is Mr Corbyn’s moment to demonstrate he is a Prime Minister in waiting – a politician who can lead, and deliver. Go for it.

The pretty three year old would now be approaching her th birthday. She’d be a young woman revising for GCSEs, thinking about A-levels and adulthood. She’d probably be dating and doing odd things to her hair, like most teenagers. Instead she has become a theory. A thing to be waved for headlines by politicians and other windbags. Reduced to a soundbite on the morning shows, and subject of a Netflix documentary which pretends to be doing something a £million British police investigation couldn’t. Madeleine is used as an excuse for the Portuguese cops who failed in every aspect of modern policing, contaminated the scene in that Praia da Luz holiday apartment and left the nearest border post open.   Armchair detectives who can’t detect the stink of the online sewers they inhabit use her as a weapon to beat others with, and charlatans have tarnished her name, fleecing the fund set up to search for her. We have lost sight of the fact Madeleine may be alive. In the years since her disappearance a dozen girls have been found and freed from cellars and secret rooms across Europe and the USA. In the absence of a body, a Fritzl-style, long-term incarceration must remain a possibility. And she may also be dead – her tiny body a long way from home and those who love her. Her parents have been victims of incredible vitriol, despite their grief and misery being plain to see, and their alibi rock-solid. Their determination to keep the hunt for Madeleine going so long is proof enough for me of their innocence a murderer would have let their crime fade. The guilt they must feel, though, for having left Madeleine sleeping in an unlocked apartment they could not see, must have eaten them up for the past  years.    In that time they’ve bought her birthday and Christmas presents in the hope one day she’ll be able to open them, and have probably become used to the nightmares. Kate and Gerry have served a longer sentence than most murderers do. They’ve paid their dues every day for the mistakes they made. They’ve raised her two young siblings, continued the campaign and kept their sanity amid the failures, blame, court cases and dramatisations. Someone knows what happened to Madeleine, and is keeping it secret. And it’s now reported the police are running out of leads and money. Madeleine has been lost more than once – on that fateful summer night in , in the vortex of blame that followed it, and now in a public consciousness which has forgotten she is more than just a name.

Dr John Marshall, head of forensic clinical psychology services at the State Hospitalaposs board for Scotland, said children as young as five can show psychopathic behaviour. This can include being cruel to animals or their peers, being hurtful, lying constantly and being distant from their parents. Dr Marshall was one of the psychologists who assessed -year-old Aaron Campbell, who was sentenced last month to a minimum of  years in prison for the horric murder of the six-year-old Alesha last July. In an article for The Scotsman he suggested early intervention could be key to ert budding psychopaths and make sure what happened to poor Alesha never happens again.  However, many were critical of his opinion.Speaking to the Press Association, he revealed he had expected a backlash to the suggestion. Dr Marshall said: One colleague has really criticised me saying I should never say you can identy psychopaths under five and I agree with that - you canapost. But there are temperamental risk factors which increase the likelihood or probability of heading on that pathway. Thataposs dferent. What Iaposm arguing for is that we are better at assessing those risk factors. A lot of professionals involved in child mental health have real issues with this stuff - you would dare describe a child at five as having callous and unemotional traits, such a terrible thing to say, youaposre damning them with that label. But my argument iswe ignore that and donapost support families who have children like that then weaposre taking huge risks, huge gambles. To be criticised so heavily so heavily for that, it just seems like Iaposm saying whataposs blatantly obvious. In the article he calls it a major public health issue and likened the idea of tackling it to how obesity is perceived.    Dr Marshall said: If youaposve got a problem with obesity at  you can track that back to over-eating and earlier obesity and so on, itaposs kind of obvious you can track things backwards. I think thereaposs a misunderstanding that Iaposm sort of saying you can identy psychopaths much earlier on. Iaposm not saying that, Iaposm saying you can identy children at risk. He added: Genetic factors are important, temperament is important, I think weaposre not paying enough attention to those other factors. It could also be a relief for parents to know that - parents might feel that theyaposre blamed for their childaposs early temperament. If we come to the conclusion those temperamental traits are present then those families will be issued with support around parenting, theyaposll need longer term support. Campbell snatched Alesha from her bed as she slept at her grandparentsapos home on the Isle of Bute and finally admitted his crime in a psychological report prepared ahead of his sentencing in March. Dr Marshall also pointed out you donapost become a psychopath on your th birthday and said the traits were entrenched and chronic by that age.    Lord Matthews, sentencing Campbell at the High Court in Glasgow last month, said social work and psychologist reports had painted a clear picture of a cold, callous, calculating, remorseless and dangerous inidual. He said the teenager had shown a staggering lack of remorse and told him: Not once did I detect a flicker of emotion from you. In the psychologistsapos report, Campbell also described his reaction to seeing Alesha as a moment of opportunity. When asked about Campbell, Dr Marshall said: Itaposs rare for sadistic rapes and murders to take place generally speaking but people who are much older - Iaposm talking older teenagers - who have got psychopathic traits might be much more involved in a lot more offending than other offenders. They might be involved in dferent types of offending as well - sexual and violent offending, robbery etc - so it might be more ied. They might be much more engaged in bullying and coercive control of victims. Itaposs highlighted because of the extreme nature of it but that type of murder is so rare.

Michelle and Scott Inglis were still dressed in their wedding finery after their reception when they arrived at the Hilton Leicester Hotel. The newlyweds had pre-booked a room and handed over their credit card to pay, reports Leicestershire Live. But when the transaction did not go through they realised they did not have enough funds to cover the room. Instead, they say they offered to pay £ on their credit card and the remaining £ in cash. But they claim the reception staff refused the compromise, as well as other suggestions, and told the Inglises they could not stay at the hotel. Michelle, , and Scott, , who had wanted a night by themselves after their wedding at Leicester Town Hall and reception at Wigston Liberal Club, said they were forced to go home to their family. The Hilton has apologised for any inconvenience caused but said its staff were just following company policy. A spokesman added that bookings must be paid for by either cash or card, and that that was not possible in this case. Michelle said the wedding was amazing and that everything went to plan and everyone was having a great time, until she and her husband arrived at the Hilton.    They said to me when I booked it in November that they donapost do card payment over the phone, but that wasnapost a problem so we agreed to pay on arrival - no problem, she said. The couple arrived at the hotel at about .am. We told them we had booked a room, and a member of the family had taken an overnight bag in the day before, said Michelle. She tried to pay for the room on her card, but the transaction would not go through. After the first time, I checked my banking app and saw that I had £, which is why it was declined, said Michelle. The room they had booked was £ plus £ per person for breakfast, making the final total £ for the stay. The new bride said she then askedit was possible to do a part-payment of card and then cash, which the hotel employee refused. After this, she said, she rang her mother to askshe could send her some money online. Her mum agreed, but the cash would not arrive until the morning. We askedit was at all possible to pay on departure, and again they said no, Michelle said.  My mum then offered to pay on card over the phone and again they said no. They said no to every solution, so we were unable to stay. The couple got a taxi to their family home in Blaby, where Scottaposs daughter from a previous relationship and the coupleaposs two children were sleeping. We just wanted to have our first night as a married couple together, said Michelle, who tied the knot with Scott on Saturday, March , after  years together. We got back at about two in the morning, and were woken up by our children early in the morning. She added: I donapost normally complain about things, but how we were treated was just not good enough Hilton Leicester Hotel said that staff were following company policy. General manager James Howard said: “We have been liaising with the guest to discuss her experience and explain that we unfortunately were not able to process the check in due to a credit card decline.

And the father-of-three claims he was even told on the weekend to cover up his bulging bicep as he fed his son James at a coffee shop. He alleges a diner said his muscles were putting her off her food and that he should put a sweatshirt on. So he posted on social media a comical photo of his exposed arm with a bottle of milk, a post liked and shared by thousands in a few days. Simonaposs playful post reads: Iaposm absolutely furious. James wanted his bottle today while we were in a coffee shop, and as soon as I started feeding him a lady came over and told me that my exposed biceps were putting her off her food and that I should put a sweatshirt on.    Because I was holding the bottle at a certain angle apparently it was making my right bicep look too pumped and she said she would complain to the manager. Itaposs not my fault - when you are bottle feeding your arms get engorged because of all the lting and holding, as well as the scooping and sterilising. I told her to leave me alone as I was just providing nourishment for my baby.  However, just a few minutes after that, another lady came over, winked at me and told me that she aposwanted a goapos as well before walking back to her husband who told me not to pay any attention to her as she always makes harmless comments like this and nobody complained in the old days. Before I knew what was going on, a manager came over and askedI would like to give him the rest of his bottle in the little room where they keep the dishwasher supplies as it would be aposmore comfortableapos for me. How the hell would squatting on a crate of Finish tablets be aposmore comfortable apos Anyway I bet % of you wonapost share this, mainly because itaposs a load of b****** and people are only monumental a****** about boobs for some reason.  Simon wrote the post to highlight he feels breastfeeding is perfectly natural. Speaking today from his home in Southend, Essex, Simon said: Thereaposs absolutely no dference between a woman or man bottle feeding and a woman having her boob out and breastfeeding. Breastfeeding has been going on ever since the start of time, I donapost get why thereaposs still a modern stigma about it. There is a massive disconnect in society between breasts for feeding a baby and breasts as a sexual object - I think theyaposre still way oversexualised. Iaposm not saying I donapost find boobs attractive, Iaposm just saying I think too many people have got it ingrained in their skull that theyaposre purely sexual. Since having kids thereaposs been a couple of occasions where Iaposve been talking to other mums at soft play while theyaposre in the middle of breastfeeding.  Simon combi-fed his children Luke, four, Emma, two, and one-year-old James with music teacher we -year-old Rachael Harris. The first time it was quite awkward but over time I just realised aposmaintain eye contact and donapost be a d*** about it. If itaposs something I can get used to as a heterosexual male, Iaposm sure that everyone  can, the father continued. Breastfeeding is an entirely personal thing and as men we have absolutely no idea of the reality of the situation. Whether a breastfeeding mum wants to cover up or feed her baby publicly thataposs her choice, to force her otherwise is wrong. A lot of comments Iaposve received have been from both breastfeeding and non-breastfeeding mums who appreciated the joke and shared it on that basis.

Victoria was born on May  , and is the nation’s second-longest reigning monarch, after being overtaken by Elizabeth II in . Her infamously outspoken nature and imposing reputation belied her tiny stature as she was more than five feet tall, although developed an impressive girth in her later years.    Through objects from the Royal Collection and an immersive experience in the Palace’s Ballroom, visitors will learn how Victoria transformed the headquarters of the Monarchy into an rallying point for national celebrations and a family home. Undertaking a massive renovation Victoria was responsible for adding the famous balcony and the grand ballroom, which she and Prince Albert used to stage magnicent themed costume balls. Guests were encouraged to commission elaborate costumes to give work to the Spitalfield silk weavers, whose business was in sharp decline.    The Stuart Ball of July   had as its theme the Restoration period, with guests dressed in the style of Charles II’s court. Queen Victoria’s costume for the Stuart Ball, designed by the artist Eugene Lami, has a bodice and full skirt of grey moire trimmed with gold lace and an underskirt of gold and silver brocade.    The Royal Collection said: “This year’s Summer Opening of Buckingham Palace will tell the story of how the young monarch turned an unloved royal residence into the centre of the social, cultural and official le of the country.” Queen Victoria’s Palace is part of a visit to the Summer Opening of the State Rooms at Buckingham Palace, and is open from July  to September .

Temperatures will remain on the cold side, with around C or C the maximum for many and C expected in the south-east. Despite the unsettled conditions moderate levels of UV and pollen are expected in the south.

Robbie Mullen’s actions led to vile Jack Renshaw being convicted of preparing an act of terrorism to murder Det Con Victoria Henderson and Labour’s Rosie Cooper. It can now be reported that Renshaw is a convicted paedophile who groomed boys as young as . Mullen has disclosed that the murder plots were Renshaw’s attempt to cover up the child sex offences.    The revelations came as a jury failed to reach a verdict on whether Renshaw was a member of banned far right extremist group National Action. Giving his first newspaper interview about his role in saving two lives, Mullen, , said: “Jack had a grudge against the police officer because she was investigating him. “He didn’t really have a clue who the MP Rosie Cooper was. “As an MP, she was seen by him as the puppet of Jews, trying to let immigrants in to weaken the white race.”    Mullen, a former National Action member who became disaffected when the group shted towards terrorism, says Renshaw, , planned to kill his local MP Ms Cooper so that he would be seen as a hero by the far right rather than a paedophile. Mullen said: “He’d bought a -inch machete. He worked in a DIY shop so he used to go trade fairs. He’d seen it cut through a pig, and said a pig is the closest thing to human flesh. “He was going to kill them, then planned to die by ‘suicide by cop’.”    Ms Cooper, the MP for West Lancashire, said: “I’d like to thank Robbie Mullen, whose information saved my le. Our way of le, our democracy and our freedoms are being attacked by the likes of Renshaw and extremist groups like National Action.” Until now, Mullen’s extraordinary insider account has remained untold for legal reasons. But yesterday a judge at the Old Bailey ruled Renshaw will not face a retrial for alleged membership of National Action, meaning reporting restrictions have been lted.    Mullen started reading far right material after being excluded from school at . “I guess I thought it was rebellious,” he says. His dad died of cancer around the same time. Mullen went on his first White Pride march in . “It felt good,” he says. “Part of it is that everyone is against it. It attracts you. You move further right as you get involved.” He explains how NA members told him “Jews were running everything”. He added there was a NA banner saying: “Hitler was right.” Mullen said it all “became an obsession... apart from work, that was my whole le”. In December , National Action was banned after glorying in the death of the MP Jo Cox. Despite the ban, NA continued meeting.  The self-styled “white jihadis” even visited the aftermath of the Manchester Arena bombing to see what a major terror attack looked like. Mullen said: “They were excited about it, but they would have preferred it in reverse.” It was when the group began preparing for a terrorist “race war” that Mullen emailed anti-extremist organisation HOPE not Hate. He warned them NA was having kne and martial arts training in an underground gym. Matthew Collins, HOPE not Hate’s head of research, and a former member of the far right himself, emailed Mullen back.  Mullen eventually agreed to meet him in May . When Renshaw turned up to a NA meeting at a pub in Warrington, Cheshire, in July  to win support for his plot, Mullen rang his handler, Mr Collins, and the double murder plot was revealed to police. “I said, ‘he’s going to do it, I can see it in his eyes’,” Mullen remembers. “Someone was going to get killed. I knew I couldn’t let it happen… “He was going to kill Rosie Cooper and take hostages in a pub. Then he would exchange the hostages for the female police officer who was investigating him. “He was going to kill her and then be killed by the police. He said he’d wear a fake suicide vest, so they’d kill him.” Last summer, Renshaw, from Skelmersdale, Lancs, admitted preparation for a terrorist act by purchasing a machete to kill Ms Cooper.  He also pleaded guilty to making a threat to kill Det Con Henderson. Renshaw has been remanded in custody to be sentenced in May. It can now be reported he was jailed last June for  months after he groomed two underage boys online. Jurors at Preston crown court found him guilty of four counts of inciting a child to engage in sexual activity.Renshaw, the former leader of the British National Party youth wing, was found to have set up two fake ­ Facebook profiles and contacted a boy aged  and a boy of  between February  and January .On Facebook Messenger, Renshaw told the teenagers he was rich, could give them jobs and offered one of them £ to spend the night with him. He also asked for intimate photos before one of the boys reported the messages to his tutor and the police were contacted. Renshaw also received a three-year prison sentence two months earlier when he was found guilty of stirring up racial hatred after he called for the ­genocide of Jewish people. But he denied membership of National Action. The jury at his retrial was discharged yesterday, having failed to reach a verdict. Making the phone call that revealed Renshaw’s murder plot to HOPE not Hate meant Mullen had to leave his job and home in Widnes, Cheshire, and go into hiding. Two years in hiding has taken its toll, and he seems withdrawn as he talks about the past few years. He was offered the chance to appear by video link in court to give evidence against Renshaw and others but decided to appear in person. “When I walked in, I instinctively looked towards them and smiled even though I was betraying them,” he says. “It was an old habit, I guess.” He added: “I don’t have those views any more. But it’s easy to believe one side of an argument when it is all you know. “I’d like to help young people understand the effects of going into the far right. It can get serious pretty quick. Go to HOPE not Hate. They can get you out.” "},{"url":null,"title":"you should think twice accepting","story":"NewsWhy you should think twice about accepting a receipt after you buy somethingThey may be made of paper, but those little slips are seriously bad news for the environmentShareCommentsByZahra MulroySocial Audience Editor:,  APR News \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Grabbing your receipt is something so many of us just do on auto-pilot when shopping .Letaposs face it, they also come in useful should you wish toan item too. In fact, a quick root around your home, bags and pockets will probably unearth quite a few - even now when many receipts are sent digitally. As necessary as this proof of purchase is, however, these little slips are also incredibly damaging to the environment. Perhaps this comes as a surprise. After all, theyaposre made from paper, right     Maybe you toss yours in the recycling, safe in the knowledge that youaposre doing your bit for the plant. Unfortunately, this is not quite the case.Around  per cent of receipts are printed on a thermal paper which contains which contains chemicals called Bisphenol Aand Bisphenol S ,reports.These are bad news because they have been classed as toxic to both people and the environment by the EU, and have been linked to cancer. Because of the risk of contamination, receipts canapost be recycled.    Not only this, but the paper used the most to make receipts is made up of more than one material, which makes recycling tricky anyway. To put it into perspective, in the UK alone we print around . billion receipts each year, and . billion of these go unused which results in about .kg of waste annually - just from receipts that canapost be recycled. In terms of solving this issue, an increasing number of shops are moving toward digital receipts. There are apps and programmes which retailers are slowly picking up.    Flux is a service that you sign up to and every time you make a purchase with a card at an enabled retailer, a digital receipt appears either in their app or in your digital banking app. Matty Cusden-Ross, founder and CEO of Flux explains why they are campaigning for change: Until paper receipts receive the same level of attention and awareness as other single-use plastics, they’re going to continue to suck as much as straws. While single-use straws have held the plastic-free limelight in recent years, experts are now calling on consumers and businesses to think about paper receipts in the same way. Most of us donapost think about receipts. And we certainly donapost care about them.

at half-time through a Connor McLennan goal only to concede twice after the break.“The blame is on us as we were not good enough man for man on the pitch,” said Lowe.“At times we were probably lucky it was only -. We have to look at ourselves and move on quickly because the fans deserve more than that.”Aberdeen’s wait for a Premiership win at Pittodrie has now stretched to beyond three months.During that home slump they have dropped points to teams battling relegation, losing to Hamilton and drawing with St Mirren.Lowe is perplexed at the Pittodrie dip.He said: “That is the confusing thing as we beat the best teams in the league away from home and keep clean sheets against them on a regular basis.“Coming back at home it has not really been the same.“We have to start off like we did at Tynecastle but it is about doing it for the  minutes.“As soon as the second half started it became like a game of two halves.“They had a couple of chances before their first goal to be fair and Hearts probably deserved the win.“We didn’t really create much in the second half or really put their goal under threat.“If everybody is at it and everybody is doing the best they can do inidually for  minutes we would easily have won at Hearts.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/04/2.41873084-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/04/2.41873084-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/04/2.41873084-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/04/2.41873084-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"aberdeen road to shut for 12 weeks during 500000 sewer works","story":"An Aberdeen street is to close while £, of roadworks to reduce the risk of sewer flooding are carried out.Morrison Construction will be carrying out work on King’s Gate on behalf of Scottish Water’s partner amey-Black  Veatch .A new metre-wide sewer is to be laid in the eastbound carriageway, which will help provide additional capacity during storm conditions when high volumes of surface water overwhelm the existing network.A section of King’s Gate between the roundabout on Anderson Drive and Moray Place will be closed to traffic from Monday for around  weeks.A ersion will be in place for anyone looking to travel that way via Anderson Drive, Queen’s Road and Forest Road.The team on site will work with residents in order to maintain access to properties.Pedestrians will still be able to use the footpaths for the duration of the work.aBV project manager Raymond Hope said: “I would like to thank residents on the affected section of King’s Gate who have been engaging with our team over the past year as we prepared to carry out this essential work to reduce the risk of flooding.#We will continue to work with them while we are on site to keep the short-term disruption caused by construction activity to a minimum.“Due to the size of the pipes we will be working with and the signicant excavation needed to install them, it is necessary for us to close a short section of King’s Gate to traffic.“We have worked with Aberdeen City Council to agree a local ersion in order to keep everyone safe and keep any delays to a minimum.“We would encourage travellers to plan their journeys and to allow some extra time where possible.”The new sewer will run a distance of almost  metres .It is hoped that once work takes place, it will reduce the risk of sewer flooding for residents.Scottish Water corporate affairs manager Gavin Steel said: “The work taking place is important to achieve a permanent reduction in the risk of sewer flooding affecting homes on this section of King’s Gate.“Our team will do all they can to minimise disruption, but we are grateful to customers and road users for their patience while we take care of their sewer network for the future.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/03/5c9e3170e57655.65257708-e1553874169592.jpg ","title":"adopt a pet midnight josie and donald are looking for a new home can you help","story":"Are you looking to get a new pet  Why not adopt one of these adorable pets from Mrs Murray’s Cat and Dog Home.Midnight and his wonderful moustache are both five years old.This dapper boy likes to keep himself to himself, but he does enjoy cuddlesthey’re offered.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks. Why have we in Argyll after nine years, four dferent Transport Ministers and £m spent and still have no guaranteed safe passage   on The Rest and Be Thankful Follow the Argyll Advertiser#s campaign #Invest in the Rest#. Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution. We demand no less.Sir,Calls for assurances that the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A will be improved to resist future landslides were made during a session of Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity questions in the Scottish Parliament.I quizzed transport secretary Michael Matheson, about what was discussed at the last meeting of the A Taskforce in November , and asked what assurances the Cabinet Secretary could give to local residents and businesses who rely on the A being open at all times.The Rest and Be Thankful was closed off for nine days in October  following the largest landslide in a decade, forcing road users to either take a major ersion, or to use the Old Military Road during certain hours of the day.A number of petitions were created during the period of the incident, including one by myself, calling for a permanent solution to the Rest and Be Thankful.The transport secretary said that the meeting was #full and frank#, and that there would be a #review of the potential for additional landslide mitigation measures at the Rest and Be Thankful#, and that this would be discussed at the next A Taskforce meeting in March .There was also a commitment that Argyll and Bute would be #prioritised# in the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.I welcome the assurances by the transport secretary that there will be a review of any additional measures for the Rest and Be Thankful, and that Argyll and Bute will receive priority at the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.Donald Cameron, MSPReserve forcesSir,Last issue#sletter raising concerns about the UK government’s proposed use of the army’s reserve force in the event of a no-deal Brexit is timely.In case anyone out there still thinks a no-deal Brexit is a good idea it’s worth noting that the legal authorityof Reserve Forces Act  allowing the Secretary of State to take this step requires him to establish that it is necessary #for the alleviation of distress or the preservation of le or property in time of disaster or apprehended disaster#.Enough said.Frances Roberts, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"honours even for red star in argyll derby","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Ropework played host to this keenly contested local derby which was watched by a healthy crowd on Saturday February .And for the second time this season, Red Star and Campbeltown Pupils shared the points in a match both sides will feel they could have won.Both sides were struggling for fluency in the opening stages but Red Star settled first and grabbed the opening goal after  minutes. A long ball to the right hand side was met by Ryan Caskie who cut the ball back to Stuart McLean. The youngster took a touch before slotting past the Pupils# goalkeeper to give Star a - lead.Star continued to press and doubled their lead when Coll McCallum robbed the Pupils# defender on the edge of the box before cutting the ball across goal. The unfortunate Pupils# defender could only ert the ball into the empty net, with McLean waiting on a tap in. The game continued at a frantic pace, however, there was no further scoring in the first half and Star went in with a - advantage.Pupils came out with purpose in the second half as they looked to force themselves back into the game, however, it was a howler from Red Star which allowed them back into the match.A square ball across the back resulted in a mix-up between Star keeper Luke Kalache and defender Ben Forbes which allowed Donald McCallum to prod the ball home from just inside the box and Pupils were back in the game at - with eight second half minutes gone.The home side didn’t recover from this and you could sense a nervousness that gave the visitors plenty encouragement. The equaliser arrived with  minutes remaining when good play from Pupils down the right by Soudan saw him get a low cross in which was met by the on-rushing run of Ryan Deans and he finished well to level the score at -.This set up a frantic finish and both sides could have nicked it towards the end. Pupils went close with a headed effort which was clawed to safety while at the other end there was a goalmouth scramble which Star couldn’t convert and both sides had to settle for a draw in the end as referee Jimmy Litster blew for full time.Red Star were dealt a blow as it emerged that captain Aaron Moore suffered a dislocated shoulder. Hopefully this will not keep him out for too long.On Saturday February , Star have another important home game as they look to move off the bottom of the table when they take on Claremont AFC.

Thank you Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club and Margaret Mather our secretary for this request.So I won#t forget my th in a hurry, but such kindness and friendliness cannot be forgotten ever.My thanks to you all,Niall Iain MacLean, InveraraySir,I read with great interest the letter in the March  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser from C Rees, Lochgilphead.In addition to all that was mentioned I wonderyour readers are acquainted with the McCrone Report which was written in the s As I’m sure your readers are aware this was when oil had just started flowing from the North Sea. Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 12","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowPIC:This beautul sunset across Loch Etive at Connel was taken with a mobile phone by Fiona McCuish from Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"athletes tackle the crinan puffer","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowOver  pairs of running shoes were strapped on for this year#s Scottish Sea Farms Crinan Puffer on Sunday March .Athletes from as far as Dunoon, Campbeltown, Mid Argyll and beyond came to join the race # billed as one of Scotland#s friendliest and most inclusive running events.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a £, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"bob shields need future plan","story":"NewsBob Shields: We need future plan for Ayr town centreRetail on our High Street is deadShareByAyrshire Post:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR News\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAt least five years ago – and certainly a whole elected council ago – I wrote on this page that Ayr town centre would have to change . . . or die. So please, allow me to confess that I actually got this the wrong way round. What I should have said was - Ayr town centre is going to have to die . . . and then change. And for better or for worse, that’s exactly where we are today. Our retail sector’s passing away was slow and painful. The ‘For Sale’ signs on our shop fronts began as a malady that grew into an illness - and finally became a virulent pandemic that was completely out of anybody’s control. The boarding up of a whole section of the “bottom of the town” was a warning symptom that our town centre was seriously ill. By the time BHS brought down their shutters for the final time – we were on le support. And our financial heart finally stopped beating when the leviathan that was once Hourstons was declared deceased on February . A post mortem in last week’s Ayrshire Post showed a record  shops in Ayr now lie empty. And alongside the report, a quote from council leader Douglas Campbell that . . “we have to ensure that our town centres become much more erse and about more than just shops”. I couldn’t have put it better myself, Mr Campbell. In fact, it’s almost exactly how I did put it . . . five years ago! To be fair to Mr Campbell and his Nationalist cohorts, five years ago they were languishing in opposition to a bullying Tory regime. While Big Chief Sitting Bill McIntosh ruled the class of  with  Tory councillors and some Labour nodding donkeys – the nine elected Nats sat in the naughty corner with as much power as my electric cigarette charger. After the  elections, it was role reversal. Labour jumped ship to prop up the Nats and now it’s the Tories who sit powerless – with a self-inflicted lurch from hapless to helpless. And following decades of Tory droning and dithering, the Nats of  looked like they might actually deliver something. Two years into their administration, we’ve witnessed everything from diddyness to dizziness. After last year’s budget farce and the great “Riverside Carbuncle” – the council tax paying public were right to wonderthis mob could run a tap - never mind a local authority!

If not – the “unprecedented funding” of £ million they’re ploughing into this will be the greatest waste of money in SAC history.The elephant in the room, of course, is the “building next to the Ayr Station”.How SAC can have a “vision” for Ayr town centre – without first resolving this nightmare – doesn’t make sense.Just in case they hadn’t noticed, the big sandstone thing draped in white IS the centre of Ayr!

Now Robert Dunlop has gained a criminal conviction for terrorising the people of Troon. The former Troon butcher, who turns  on April Fool’s Day, waged a letter vendetta against seven members of Troon Community Council. This reduced some community councillors to tears and one woman was so terried she now has a police panic alarm. Dunlop, of A Barassie Street, Troon, was found guilty on Friday by Sherf Scott Pattison of causing fear and alarm but not guilty of having a lock kne in Dundonald Road. His partner Krystyna Domanska, , was also on trial but was cleared of any involvement. Both had denied conducting the campaign between October  and September . Dunlop escaped with a slap on the wrist and has been warned to be of good behaviour for the next six months. His bail conditions banning him from approaching any of the community councillors will remain in place. This week a Troon Community Council spokesperson said: “We are very unhappy at the sentence but glad this man is now a convicted criminal. “He upset so many lovely volunteers in Troon and put us through the ordeal of having to give evidence in court. “It has been a very stressful time and we are all delighted this is now over.” Dozens of threatening letters were delivered to the home addresses of the community councillors. It was sparked when Dunlop lost the plot with the then South Ayrshire councillor Nan McFarlane, who had tried to help him in a benefits issue. The letters claimed the community councillors were involved in corruption, fraud and assault. Dunlop threatened to inform the public of this and claimed he was entitled to “bear arms and inflict violence”. The Ayrshire Post also received a nine-page letter, quoting an ancient Roman law called the Augustine Petition as the basis for the hostility. One y diatribe claimed all  South Ayrshire councillors were corrupt without providing any evidence. Other letters were despatched to South Ayrshire’s chief executive, legal head Ralph Riddiough, Troon police and the chief constable. Churches were also sent letters in a bid to blacken the names of citizens. Dunlop and Domanska made national headlines five years ago when the French village they were living in turned against them. They were accused of being neighbours from hell after building a wall, preventing the popular couple next door using their front door and nailing down their window shutters. The village mayor said the neighbours had been “terrorised” and Dunlop sent a -page letter to the French justice minister and an -page epic to then president Nicolas Sarkozy.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnTroonScotlands CommunityAyrAyr News"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"thieving girvan florist ordered cough","story":"NewsThieving Girvan florist ordered to cough upLaurenson was lucky to escape jail when sentenced at Ayr Sherf Court in February .ShareByAyrshire Post:,  MAR NewsAnnabel Laurenson appeared at Ayr Sherf Court\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA thieving florist has made just one repayment on £ compensation ordered by a court, writes Edwin Lawrence. That was for £ - and was made over a year ago, Ayr Sherf Court heard. Yet social media pages during that time show Annabel Laurenson on days out all over south-west Scotland. They also show a new family car and pay-to-view sports channels in her family home. Laurenson was lucky to escape jail when sentenced at Ayr Sherf Court in February . She admitted stealing from the Nicola Jayne Flowers business in Girvan on dates between January ,  and December , . Laurenson was ordered to complete  hours of unpaid work, and to pay back £ in compensation to her former bosses. The total value of cash and goods she stole was estimated at much more than this figure.    And the hurt and distress caused to her former employers, who were also her friends, can’t be quantied. Defence lawyer John Gallagher last week told Ayr Sherf Court that Laurenson, , had completed her unpaid work. But he admitted the only repayment she has made was the £ she turned up at court with - on the day of her sentence in February last year. Mr Gallagher claimed Laurenson, of Girvan’s Maxwell Street, had hoped to secure a loan from her father. But he died in November, and the costs of his care and his funeral made this impossible. “She is unemployed, but her husband is in work, and she is well aware this has to be repaid,” said Mr Gallagher. The lawyer said the remainder of Laurenson’s father’s estate would have to be shared with her mother and siblings. “How much is she likely to inherit ” asked Sherf John Montgomery. “I’m not sure,” said Mr Gallagher. “But not enough to pay this back.”    “The time for repayment has lapsed,” said Sherf Montgomery bluntly. Mr Gallagher insisted that Laurenson was anxious to pay the outstanding £. He asked the sherf to revoke the original payback order, and instruct a new compensation order. Mr Gallagher said Laurenson could pay £ per month, and Sherf Montgomery agreed to the request. Laurenson had worked at the popular Dalyrmple Street business for many years, and was a trusted member of staff. Shop owner Nicola Jayne Purdie said she was ‘devastated’ to find out her colleague and friend was ripping her off. She said at the time of last year’s sentence: “She stole a substantial amount of money and stock. There has been absolutely no remorse. She hasn’t said sorry. I feel betrayed. This is a family business and we were working together for  years.”Nicola Jayne said the theft came to light after she noticed discrepancies within the business. Laurenson who shared family occasions with the Purdies, including parties, weddings and funerals, offered no explanation for her behaviour.

His father had just passed away and he ended up drinking too much.\"Sherf Peter Paterson said the behaviour merited a custodial sentence but added he could impose the alternative.But he warned: \"If you are back before the court again because of your drinking, you will be jailed.\"Hadden was given a  months Community Pay Back Order with supervision,  hours unpaid work and a four months Restriction of Liberty Order at his Hawthorn Road home between the hours of pm and .am.In addition he was told to pay pound compensation to each of the four women - the two customers, the bar employee and the police constable - he subjected to abusive comments."},{"url":null,"title":"borders-chef-michael-hoping-to-follow-in-famous-footsteps","story":"A CHEF from the Borders has made it to the final of a prestigious cooking competition after impressing celebrity judges with his culinary skills.Michael Cruickshank, who grew up in Newtown, will join five other talented young chefs from some of the countryrsquos finest eateries in the Roux Scholarship National Final on Monday, April .The winner of the scholarship, founded by chefs Albert and Michel Roux in , will receive training in a three-star Michelin restaurant.The Roux Scholarship, which funds all expenses, also provides the winner with the opportunity to travel across the world and a pound, bursary for professional development.Michael, who previously made the final of the competition in , currently works at the Michelin-starred restaurant Bohemia, in Jersey.Having come so close two years ago, he is looking to go one better this year.He told The Border : ldquoAfter getting to the final in , I see getting to the final is the minimum level I want to aim for.ldquoItrsquos been a crazy couple of weeks with a mixture of nerves and excitement.ldquoI had loads of help from my head chef, who gave me time to practise and take time out to come here today.ldquoAs Michel Roux Jr said, you canrsquot do it without people helping you.Michael made it to the final after wowing the judges with his interpretation of the competition brief, with a recipe utilising roasted hogget loin with hogget kidneys in a haggis-inspired faggot.The judges at the regional final, held in London, were impressed by the levels of creativity, technical skill and knowledge displayed by the chefs.Renowned chef Michael Roux Jr, one of the judges who sent Michael through to the national final, described the ldquoamazing standard on display.

Deloris is a Philadelphia lounge singer who dreams of stardom, but when she witnesses her lover-turned-gangster shoot one of his mob, she flees into the arms of good guy cop lsquoSweaty Eddiersquo .Delorisrsquo world is turned upside down when she is placed under witness protection in a rundown convent, disguised as nun Sister Mary Clarence.Although the adaptation does not feature songs from the original film, the musical repertoire is erse and magical.When we first catch a glimpse of the nuns, as they meander across the stage squawking like a bunch of demented penguins, I grimace. They are so out of tune I pray I donrsquot hear that god awful sound again.Upon learning that Deloris will be joining the convent, Mother Superior, played by Pam Graham, prays: ldquoDear Lordthis is a test, I cannot fail with you by my side. May she be of faith, of modestyhellip But she is stopped in her tracks by the voice of a brash American Deloris.Mother Superior continues: ldquoPerhaps the choir of angels drowned me out and you didnrsquot hear me Lord.Pam plays the exasperated Mother Superior prissy and clipped, with subtle comedy delivered in perfect tone.Of course things donrsquot run smoothly for the ghetto-fabulous a-turned-nun as you probably can imagine. It isnrsquot long before Deloris ruffles Mother Superiorrsquos habit and puts the nuns in danger, which leads to Deloris being given just one simple activity, joining the choir.Can she really unleash the songbirds trapped inside these nuns  This is when the show steps up a notch, and, although all dressed in habits, the audience can start to identy with the lead characters.In steps jolly Sister Mary Patrick, played by the enigmatic Claire Bell, along with Sister Mary Robertas the timid church mouse, and deadpan choir director Sister Mary Lazaruswho fully captured the gravelly voiced cantankerous nun. Her reprisal of the screen character is uncanny and garners lots of laughs from the audience.When the large ensemble of nuns gathered together, I did feel a sense of sisterhood and that they were each playing dferent characters despite having a minor role or no dialogue. Their pitch perfect delivery of lsquoRaise Your Voicersquo and lsquoTake Me To Heavenrsquo would draw the crowds into any church Irsquom sure.Playing the leading lady is no easy task, but in scene after scene Nicola embraces Deloris and puts her own sass and ghetto style into the character, belting out powerful tunes. To sum up her performance, what better words to use than those of Deloris Van Cartier herself ndash shersquos lsquoFabulous Babyrsquo!The last time I saw Lizzie Bell she was stumbling about drunk and shouting at a group of young kids, so I was shocked to see her convert to a Catholic nun. Of course, Lizzie was in character then as the vile orphanage boss Miss Hannigan, for Annie, performed by the Kids Innerleithen Theatre in November last year. The young actress shows true ersity, by portraying the meek Sister Mary Roberts with an enchanting solo performance.Although the female performances were powerful, they did not overshadow the male cast. Roger Brydon, Stewart Wilson and Colin Tweedie had me in tears as bumbling henchmen Joey, TJ and Pablo. Their comical performance of lsquoLady In The Long Black Dressrsquo didnrsquot leave females in the audience weak at the knees, but it did conjure up a few belly laughs!David Paterson was cast as Curtis who played the mob boss brilliantly, dominating the stage fiercely. And mild mannered officer Eddie Souterwho gave a cracking solo, proves he lsquoCould Be That Guyrsquo going from lsquoSweaty Eddiersquo to lsquoCool Copper, saving Deloris and winning her heart. A special mention to Jamie McCubbin, as the Irish Monsignor OrsquoHara ndashI closed my eyes Irsquod swear it was Father Ted!Needless to say the cast were at the top of their game, but anyone going to the show will no doubt be dazzled by the glitzy backdrop and detailed stained glass art of the fictional Catholic church.

The wood surrounds a lake of the same name, which is actually a reservoir created  years ago.Pressmennan Lake is nearly km long and meanders through the wood, giving the appearance of a river rather than a loch. In summer, the lush canopy of trees which surround the lake can engulf the senses, and for a moment you can be fooled into thinking you are in the middle of an ancient forest.And in a sense, you are. The wood is a fragmentary remnant of the ancient oak wood which once covered most of our county. Records show it existed in medieval times, and Irsquom sure well before that.Much of it was felled, so tradition tells us, when the warship The Great Michael was built on the order of James IV around . This ship was famously constructed using the oak woods of Fe, but such was the size of the vessel that wood from where was also needed, including Pressmennan.Yet the wood seems to have survived, and in  the felling of trees here is said to have been stopped due to its importance as a habitat for the kingrsquos deer.It remains a place rich in wildle. Roe deer still roam free amidst the trees here. They are creatures of woodland magic, and native to these isles. They are small and nimble-footed, and will dart into the undergrowth at the sight or sound of approaching danger. They have short antlers and a tailless rear, which usually has a white patch. This is the part of the animal you most likely see, as it quickly bounds away from you.The wood is full of other wildle: owls and bats, hares and foxes, stoats and weasels, and, according to the Woodland Trust Scotland, who own and care for the wood, otters have also been seen in the lake. The birdle here is likewise rich, and there is a crescendo of song in the spring. The trust acquired the wood in  and is slowly restoring it to its natural character, planting oak and other native trees.We arrived at the wood last weekend, on a day of changeable weather, but laden with the promise of spring. There is a childrenrsquos map provided by the Woodland Trust and it proved a great hit for my kids, who followed the loch-side path looking for the features identied.These are wood carvings and sculptures made by artist Robin Wood. Part of the trail includes doors and windows in the trees which are said to be the homes of magical creatures called the Tootflits and Glingbobs.My children, well-versed in the folklore traditions of our county, know all about faeries, brownies, selkies, kelpies, witches and wizards. But Tootflits and Glingbobs were new to them, and to be honest myself as well.They are mythical creatures created by the artist and trust to provide a sense of wonder and adventure for children as they explore the wood. You can search for their homes and the wood sculptures along the way.And so we set off on our adventure of discovery. The path by the riverbank needs care with wee ones when wet, but it whispers magic. Ancient oak trees line the banks of the lake, their branches dipping into the water.These old trees were still leafless, biding their time for the arrival of spring proper. But they were a spine-tingling sight, a reminder of what once was here in abundance. But then, as we ventured deeper into the wood, we made a less pleasant discovery.Some people had decided it was a good idea to hammer coins into the sculptures, and even into the living trees. We found the homes of the Tootflits, and at their door was a pile of rusting coins which had clearly been left as a gt or good luck charm. Rusting coins also lay all around the base of the tree.I understand the desire to leave a gt or charm for a magical creature, but polluting and damaging nature with the ultimate symbol of materialism was, for me, horribly ironic.We removed what we could, and my daughter Skye searched for a more suitable gt. She found a small lsquofaerie cuprsquo, which was the cupule of an acorn, and placed it on the doorstep.ldquoThere, she said, with a sense of satisfaction.We continued our search but we found every sculpture defaced in the same way. One had actually collapsed due to the splintering and rot caused by the coins being hammered into it.The final sculpture was a frog on a log. It too was peppered with coins hammered into its body. In the universal measure of things, this damage was insignicant and perhaps even well-meaning, for I assume it was done by people who came to enjoy the wood and merely wanted to leave their charm here.But eventhere was no malice, it was a desecration. Then my heart tore as I watched my children scrape their fingers as they tried to pull the coins from the poor creature. But they were mostly rusted and too well-embedded.As we left the wood, I was reminded of a famous quote, attributed to the Native American chief Seattle: ldquoTake only memories and leave only footprints.The word lsquophotosrsquo is often used instead of memories but the message is the same, and now more powerful than ever. Itrsquos a worldwide issue ndash the desecration of natural sites by people who unthinkingly want to leave their mark. The coins that werenrsquot rusted we put in a charity box.The experience affected my daughter.ldquoCan you write about what we found, dad, and ask people not to do that  said Skye at bedtime. ldquoAsk them to find presents in nature, like faerie cups or stones or fallen branches or pine cones or berries, or even make a love heart shape in the ground. Faeries donrsquot like metal anyway or need money.And I promised her I would. As she slept, I kept my promise."},{"url":null,"title":"musselburgh-racecourse-business-continuing-to-be-conducted-in-private","story":"Musselburgh Racing Associated Committeewas established by East Lothian Council last February after the British Horseracing Authority threatened to pull the coursersquos licence to race over concerns about its governance.Relations between members of predecessor body Musselburgh Joint Racing Committee were described as ldquofestering.It was made up of four East Lothian councillors and three members of Lothians Racing Syndicate , the latter representing racing interests.But the two factions were described in an independent report as having ldquoconsiderable mistrust, weariness, resentment and bitterness.Staff under the previous committee threatened to strike and there were claims of a lack of transparency surrounding their meetings and decisions.The independent report by Pinsent Mason was branded commercially sensitive by East Lothian Council, which refused to publish it until an investigation by the Information Commissioner led to a redacted version being made public.In February last year, the council replaced the old management committee with MRAC, giving the council a - majority over LRS.However, MRAC has held only four public meetings in council chambers in Haddington Town Hall since it was set up, with  of the  items of business on the agenda heard in private.On each occasion, the council has cited Local GovernmentAct , paragraph six, which allows it to exclude the public for ldquoinformation relating to the business affairs of particular persons other than the authority.East Lothian Council said that it ldquolooks to ensure that, as far as possible, committee matters are progressed in public.A spokesperson added: ldquoThe MRAC often considers matters in public session.ldquoAs with other committees, some reports may require to be held in private should they contain exempt information.Reports which have been withheld from the public include the current yearrsquos budget, financial reviews and racecourse general managerrsquos report.East Lothian Council is currently looking for a third-party operator to take over the running of the racecourse, which is on Common Good land.The hunt for a new operator is currently out to tender with hopes an appointment will be made before the end of this year."},{"url":null,"title":"prestonpans-shop-could-feature-on-bbc-show","story":"Corner Shop Cook Off is coming to screens across the country to show off the importance of local convenience stores in Scotland.The new show is presented by actress and musician Clare Grogan, with winner of MasterChef The Professionals Gary Maclean as the resident chef.Each week, a prominent Scottish chef will guest star, going head to head with Gary, only using ingredients from a selected local convenience store from around the country.The Day-Today on Redburn Road in Prestonpans has been selected as a possible store to feature on the show and,it is picked, the BBC portable kitchen will be set up in Prestonpans Town Hall for the event next month.The BBC said that it wanted the local shop owner and the customers to be the judges, adding: ldquoThis means we can really get into the heart of towns all over Scotland and show how essential the local convenience store really isIf confirmed, Corner Shop Cook Off will be filmed on April  and  in Prestonpans Town Hall."},{"url":null,"title":"celebrations-as-prestonpans-charity-elcap-marks-its-30th-birthday","story":"The Lighthouse Hub hosted the event with a buffet, guest speakers and local musicians.Even microphone problems and a broken slideshow couldnrsquot dampen the mood as the birthday bash opened with two pipers from Preston Lodge High School Pipe Band.Bette Francis, member of the ELCAP board, hosted the event, introducing the speakers: chief executive Paul White, ward councillor Fiona OrsquoDonnell, and lastly a moving testimony from fellow board member Kirstin Doherty.Paul White, who was appointed chief executive five months ago, started the talks by outlining the importance that ELCAP played within communities, a point that was reiterated by guest speaker Councillor Fiona OrsquoDonnell.The final speaker, Kirstin Doherty, a member of the ELCAP board, has been supported by the charity since .

There is a big waiting list in the county and we hope to open a base here.But planning officers urged councillors to reject LARrsquos proposals, regardless of their own efforts to build housing there two years ago.Iain McFarlane, head of planning, said that two years ago the council did not have its Local Development Plan approved and faced a shortage of land for affordable housing.Now the plan had been adopted, he said there was sufficient land supply for the next five years.He said allowing housing on the site would set an ldquoundesirable precedent, adding it would be ldquoselling our employment plans down the river.Councillor Kenny McLeod, committee member, said he was ldquodeeply uncomfortable about refusing planning permission on a site the council had tried to develop in the same way two years ago.At the time, council officers said the landowner rejected their pound, offer as too low.Robin Holder, representing LAR at the meeting, said the council had given written reassurance it would consider the site, which has lain empty since , for housing.He rejected claims that approving the plans would set a precedent, saying: ldquoThis is a small area, this site is a quarter of one per cent of land identied for industrial use in East Lothian. The site has been vacant for many years and the evidence suggests it will remain so.But Councillor Norman Hampshire said: ldquoI cannot support the application: it would send a message to other owners of land designated for business use.The committee rejected the planning application by six votes to three.Following the meeting, Ms Leslie said: ldquoNaturally we are disappointed at the decision and are considering whether to appeal against it.ldquoWe have worked very closely with East Lothian Council over the last three years on a number of projects to enhance the provision of good-quality affordable homes in the area and have enjoyed a very positive working relationship with them.ldquoOur proposal for Prestonpans was a design and build project for  homes, very similar to our recently completed development at the disused site of the former boatyard in Cockenzie. This proved to be extremely popular and was vastly oversubscribed, so there is an urgent need for homes like ours.ldquoWe understand that this site in Prestonpans had been earmarked for commercial use but, in the absence of any confirmed interest, we had hoped that our plans, which would enhance the local environment and provide much-needed affordable housing, would have been supported."},{"url":null,"title":"woman-was-five-and-a-half-times-over-drink-drive-limit-in-prestonpans","story":"Gayle Duffy has been banned for  months after she was caught with mcg of alcohol in ml

seeing the right clinician at the right time for their specic needs.The new service, developed in partnership by Riverside, NHS  and ELHSCP, ensured that urgent care was dealt with on the same day and patients should have ldquono anxieties about being seen by the right professional at the right time.Through this new way of delivering patient care, it not only provided an increase in the number of patient appointments with practice GPs and other healthcare professionals, but also provided an increase in appointmentfor patients with complex needs.A recent survey conducted within the practice demonstrated that more than half of patients agreed that they did not always need to see a GP.Work is also under way by ELHSCP to implement a new telephone and IT system that will support call demand into the practice.The importance of patient involvement in getting services right is ldquovery much recognised by the practice, which is encouraging residents to get involved with the Patient Participation Group.Speaking after meeting with the Cabinet Secretary, Mr Beattie said: ldquoI would like to assure all of my constituents that patient care is of paramount importance and that all agencies involved in the new way services are being delivered within Musselburgh Primary Care Centre are focused on delivering the best care possible.ldquoRiverside Medical Practice is working with other organisations to ensure that improvements are made and I would encourage anyone with any issues regarding the practice to get in touch with them and become involved with the patient participation group.ldquoI am hopeful that the improvements being made by the organisations will be seen by patients and a vastly improved service will be delivered.ldquoI will continue to closely monitor the future performance of the practice and ask patients to keep me advised on whether the improvements are

Thankfully no one heard me asking for it but the embarrassment of having to ask was enough to spur me on.ldquoAt this point, on what should have been an exciting time, I was left feeling down, and it was then that I decided that it was time to lose weight.ldquoNever again did I want to be in that position of asking for an extension. The next time I was flying I wanted to be able to buckle up like any other person.ldquoWhen I ed, I decided to join Weight Watchers at Musselburgh Hope Church, and it was the best decision I have ever made.ldquoI have now lost more than four-and-a-half stones and feel fantastic. I find the Weight Watchers app amazing as its so easy to use and being able to track is really simple and motivating.ldquoI am a very fussy eater, and, on the plan, I can still have a treatI want. This makes le easy and no one really knows you are on a healthy eating plan as I can eat just like everyone .ldquoEverything about the Freestyle plan just suits me, and, even though I donrsquot eat meat or fish, I can still eat a lot of what I like.ldquoThe weekly workshops are very motivational and I love going. My wellness coach, Lisa Stewart, is so supportive, as well as all the other members.ldquoNow I can make the right choices, walk more and shop for clothes that I would never have been able to buy before. Clothes shopping has also become really enjoyable and less expensive as I no longer need to buy a size  but a rather smaller size .ldquoWalking has now become easier as I used to get breathless but this does not happen now.

Thankfully I can enjoy these and still lose weight.ldquoDoing the Freestyle plan with Carole is really good although we do not always eat the same foods. The choice of foods that we can enjoy and eat means both us can enjoy what we want.ldquoThe support from the coach Lisa is fantastic and sometimes Irsquom the only male who stays for the weekly talk. This does not phase me as my weight loss is too important and everyone is really friendly. Even when my we canrsquot make it, I go on my own. Men should not be afraid of joining as Irsquove had a fantastic weight loss.ldquoMy food choices are now better and I pay more attention to what I eat.

She called it Big Baby.She decided it was a girl and it became her favourite doll. It was soft and easy to cuddle, and Manja would take it with her everywhere.After years of being carried, played with and subjected to all manner of pampering with nail polish and make-up, the condition of the doll began to deteriorate.Then one day, Big Babyrsquos right leg came off! The seam holding the leg had torn and repeated repairs failed.At that time, I suggested we could replace her. But my daughter looked at me in horror: ldquoJust because she has one leg doesnrsquot mean I love her less.I remember being stung by my own insensitivity. Big Baby was not just an old doll, and I should have known that.Manja was six then. She is near  now. She has obviously grown in her games and play, yet Big Baby remains an important part of the family. But the loss of her dollrsquos leg led Manja into talking about disability. Over the years, it was a topic she wouldto when she was playing with her. She adapted clothes for Big Baby and refused to treat her as broken, or any less a doll.Then, recently, during one our story-making sessions together, she suddenly came up with this tale. We then wrote it down. I helped her with spelling and some phrases, but otherwise this is all her work and idea.I agree that children need to be taught empathy, but they often soon get it in ways adults forget, as I did. The discrimination and prejudice we encounter is taught by adults to children. Butwe listen to our children, they can often be the best teachers of understanding and empathy for us all.So here is Manjarsquos tale, which she titled The Magic Bracelet:Once there was an old man who had a foot which wouldnrsquot work and so he had dficulty walking.He had to use crutches and people said he was disabled, and because of this nobody would give him a job.So to get some money he would sit by the roadside and make porridge. Hersquod sell bowls of it to people who were walking by on their way to work. He told them that porridge was healthy and the best breakfast, which is true of course.So people would give him a penny for a bowl of his delicious porridge. That way he made some money.One day, while he was making his porridge, a young girl came and told him she would love to have a bowl of porridge but she had no money. The porridge maker gave the girl a kind smile.ldquoNever mind, he said, ldquoI always make extra just in case itrsquos needed.He handed her a bowl of porridge and she sat down and ate it. She was very hungry.As she gave the porridge-maker the bowl back, she noticed his crutches leaning against the wall.ldquoWhy do you have crutches  asked the girl.The porridge-maker looked sad and told her that he couldnrsquot walk very well because of his foot that wonrsquot work. He explained he needed his crutches to walk.The girl thought for a moment and smiled at the porridge-maker.ldquoI have a friend who can help you so you wonrsquot be disabled anymore, she said. The old man smiled at her, but this time it was a sad smile.ldquoThat is very kind of you, he said to the girl, ldquobut the doctors have told me that there is nothing that can be done to fix my foot, so I will be disabled for the rest of my le.ldquoPlease meet my friend, asked the girl. So the porridge-maker agreed.The girl helped him up and he walked slowly with his crutches with her. She took him to a beach.ldquoWait here, Irsquoll go get my friend, said the girl. The old man sat on the sand and waited for a long time. Eventually the girl ed.ldquoHere, she said, ldquotake my hand and Irsquoll take you to my friend. But first you must wear this shell bracelet.It was a beautul bracelet, made from dferent shells. He put it around his wrist.The porridge-maker went to pick up the crutches but the girl said: ldquoNo, leave them there, you will not need them.ldquoBut I canrsquot walk without them, he said. The girl just smiled and said: ldquoTrust me. So he did.She held his hand and slowly led him into the sea.He was hobbling at first, but the sea rose over his legs and his body got lighter in the water. Soon he was up to his waist in water.ldquoI cannot swim, said the porridge-maker, now feeling worried.ldquoTrust me, said the girl, ldquoI am wearing a bracelet as well, so we will e in together.So he trusted her and he ed into the water. Suddenly, he realised that there was some magic happening because he could breathe under the water. And he wasnrsquot cold or afraid.Then he saw the girlrsquos friend. She was a mermaid. ldquoWelcome, said the mermaid.ldquoYou see, said the girl, ldquoI told you my friend could help. The bracelet is magic, it gives you the ability to be like a mermaid and swim under the sea.The porridge-maker swam perfectly under the sea. He was not disabled under the sea. He could swim fast and he did circles and back flips. He smiled at the girl, this time a happy smile.ldquoThank you, he said. She smiled a happy smile back: ldquoMy friend said you can keep the bracelet and use it as often as you want.And so he did. And he realised it wasnrsquot his foot which made him feel disabled, but other people being unkind and making fun of him or treating him as useless.He still couldnrsquot walk well, but he knew he could breathe and swim under the water like a mermaid, while those who made fun of him couldnrsquot. And he could make the most delicious porridge ever. He understood now that although he had a disability, he was not disabled."},{"url":null,"title":"wallyfords-new-public-library-based-in-school-to-open","story":"The facility has been provided as part of the new Wallyford Primary School project at Futures Way to meet the demands of major new house building in the area.The library bears the name of Margaret Oliphant, a th-century writer from Wallyford.Born on April , , she died on June , .Alister Hadden, chairman of Wallyford Community Council, has given support about local historical events which are reflected in the new building.A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \"The community library has been named the Margaret Oliphant Library.\"The graphics on the internal windows, the old ship wheel from the former school badge and the external brickwork reflect aspects of Wallyfordrsquos history.\"This will be further developed in partnership with the community council and library over time.\"The library, which replaces the former library at Faside Buildings, has a separate entrance and exit when open for the public on: Monday and Tuesday, pm to pm Thursday, pm to pm Friday, am to pm and pm to pm Saturday, am to pm.

The team aim to increase awareness of how keeping a healthy weight can reduce the risk of developing some types of cancer.Supporting the cancer charities is particularly important to Gail as she has seen her dad battle the disease.When first Gail joined the Airdrie Slimming World she had been running for around nine months, however struggled to get reach a certain distance with her weight and poor diet taking its toll. When she joined Slimming World, however, she found she could eat to fuel her running and lose weight at the same time.For all your breaking Glasgow news, click here, or head to our Facebook, Twitter and Instagram pagesWhen Gail began following the Food Optimising healthy eating plan, she discovered a love for cooking. She swapped her diet of chocolate, cakes and shop-bought-sandwiches for cooking healthy, wholesome meals from scratch including her favourite dish of chicken stir fry.She said: ldquoWhen my consultant explained the eating plan, I couldnrsquot quite believe that I could lose weight without going hungry, and still enjoy all my favourite meals just by making changes to the way I prepared and cooked them. Irsquove never eaten so well in my le! And I need all the fuel I can get for marathon training ndash so potatoes, pasta, and rice are all regularly on the menu! I was so nervous before joining but I soon realised I neednrsquot have been. I got a fantastic warm welcome from the group.Gail added: ldquoI canrsquot believe Irsquom running the London Marathon after where I was a couple of years ago. Irsquove completely transformed my le, really found a love for running and canrsquot wait to be running the big one this year ndash especially in Slimming Worldrsquos golden birthday year ndash is a real dream come true!Gail said: ldquoTherersquos no way Irsquod have lost st or be running the marathon without the support of my group. They are the ones who have kept me on track each week ndash both with my weight loss and with my running milestones. My group inspired me to keep going and have been there to congratulate me whenever I reach a new lsquofurthest distancersquo, lsquofastest runrsquo and lsquohalf stone awardrsquo, as well as inspiring me with their achievements on their own journeys! Theyrsquove been really generous in sponsoring me and I know theyrsquoll be cheering me on when the day comes too!Gail started with the Couch to k app, and has now completed more than  half marathons. She canrsquot wait to run her first marathon as part of the golden Slimming World team: ldquoItrsquos so special to be on the team in Slimming Worldrsquos th birthday year.

Achieving this dream would never have been possible before losing weight. Ilsquom excited to give something back and raise money for Cancer Research UK and the Irish Cancer Society as I have seen first-hand how the incredible research can help with treatment and help people beat cancer. Slimming World Consultant Lynn Johnston, who runs Gailrsquos weekly group sessions, says: ldquoGail is a real inspiration to us and we are all so proud of her. When she first came through the door she just wanted to lose weight ndash she had no idea what a huge le and fitness transformation she was about to begin and certainly no idea that she would one day be running the London Marathon, itrsquos incredible!

Even after the Damascene conversion of arch-Brexiter Jacob Rees-Mogg, who used to described her deal as ldquovassalage, her final attempt to get a stripped-down Withdrawal Agreement through Parliament failed on Friday by a substantial majority. You have to give May full marks for her consistency: everything she touches turns to dust, even her own resignation.But thatrsquos by the by. As everyone has been saying: we are where we are. And where we are is extremely uncomfortable. Brexiters are gearing up to have a belly laugh at the opposition MPs, who will do their best throughout the coming week to find a compromise. Who do they think they are  Playing at being a provisional government  ldquoItrsquos like allowing the whelk stall to be run by the whelks, according to the Tory MP Sir Bill Cash. Butno-one  is able to run the eponymous stall, then all power to the whelks.Last weekrsquos indicative votes suggested that MPs are broadly in favour of a Brexit that keeps Britain in the EUrsquos economic loop while leaving the political institutions. Curiously, the SNP, who have been arguing for soft Brexit in two white papers and an election manesto, decided not to vote for the ious options, even the Norway model that they have long extolled. The SNP did, however, vote for the proposal from the Labour MP Margaret Beckett for a confirmatory ballot, and this option got the largest number of votes, much to everyonersquos surprise. This must be a serious possibility now that Parliament has failed to resolve the Brexit conundrum.However, this is not a Peoplersquos Vote as some have styled it. A confirmatory vote is not a rerun of the  referendum, but strictly a chance for voters to give their views on whatever deal Parliament agrees . The Kyle Wilson Amendment originally envisaged putting the Prime Ministerrsquos deal to a popular vote, assuming it was passed by Parliament. However, this confirmatory referendum might be dficult to schedule because it could collide with three other elections: a Tory leadership election, the European elections and a General Election. Brenda from Bristol will be in despair.EvenMPs fail to come up with a working compromise, they can still block a no-deal Brexit. The majority against leaving the EU without a deal is overwhelming. This means May, or her successor, will have to go cap-in-hand to Brussels in the next few days and request another, longer delay to Article . This would mean Britain participating in the European elections in May, which excites the Independent Group of Tory and Labour rebels, but is looked upon with dread by the main parties. Brussels too is worried about populist contagion spreading to other EU countries like Italy, but they are legally bound to make British participation a condition of any further extension to AVoter wrath, particularly in Labourrsquos leave constituencies, could lead to a dramatic revival of Nigel Faragersquos Ukip, or worse. The Svengali behind the  Vote Leave campaign, Dominic Cummings, is gearing up for the fight and reportedly suggesting a new party to fight for the right to leave. ldquoTell them again is the favoured slogan. The European elections might themselves turn into a kind of second referendum on Brexit.The Tories will presumably have a new leader by then, since Theresa May will surely go now there is to be the long extension she has resolutely opposed. Mind you, it is impossible to guess the Prime Ministerrsquos thought processes. She said she would goher withdrawal deal passed on Friday. But her gambit didnrsquot work. Even the opportunity to dispense with Mayrsquos services was not sufficient inducement for the Democratic Unionist Party to come on board. The joke doing the rounds last week was that she tried to fall on her sword and missed.But these things have a momentum of their own, and the Tory leadership election has already begun. Boris Johnson is the narrow frontrunner, but that could change. He might win the membership, but under Tory rules the parliamentary party has to agree the two candidates put to a postal ballot. The remainers in the Tory benches might use this as an opportunity to foil the hard Brexiters by keeping Boris off the list.Of course, what should happen when a government fails to get its most important legislation through Parliament is not a leadership election, but a General Election. The government cannot govern and, even with the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, this should lead to a General Election via a vote of no confidence. Some Conservatives might prefer to fight a General Election than European elections they had promised would never take place. But events are now out of everyonersquos control.Everyone, that is, except the EU, which now holds Britainrsquos future in the balance. Itrsquos trying not to crow about Britainrsquos abject national humiliation, but the , not the UK Parliament, will now decide the UKrsquos immediate future: deal or no deal. If MPs agree this week to back a soft Brexit involving the customs union and alignment with the single market, Brussels has promised to fast-track it in a matter of days. But the alternative, a long extension, will also suit the European Union.That means more money from Britainrsquos budget contribution, and serves as a warning to other EU countries about the dangers of trying to leave the Union. It also holds out the possibility of Britain remaining in the EU,a referendum is eventually staged.Well, that remains to be seen. What is perhaps more likely is that Britain gets stuck indefinitely in a long extension. It emerged last week that the Democratic Unionist Party, which again voted against Mayrsquos withdrawal deal, could live with a long extension. Indeed, they signalled that they could live with a customs union ndash as long as it ensured no border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. The DUP may be Brexiters, but they are ardent Unionists first.A soft Brexit may now be the best way of keeping the UK together. But it should be put to the people in a confirmatory vote,for no other reason than this was not what most people thought they were voting for in . MPs have the opportunity to decide this tomorrow.How and why Theresa May failed to seek the only kind of Brexit that could get through Parliament will be left for historians to judge. One of her own Cabinet ministers, quoted on BBC Newsnight, gave the provisional verdict: ldquoShersquos the sole architect of this mess because of her inability to engage in the most basic human interaction. Who says personalities donrsquot matter in great historical events "},{"url":null,"title":"dennis-kelly-on-writing-matilda-the-musical","story":"ldquoFor a big musical, the show feels really theatrical, says Kelly, who wrote the show with composer and Edinburgh Festival Fringe favourite Tim Minchin. ldquoIt is polished, but it doesnrsquot always feel like it, which is great. To do the burp, we talked about loads of dferent ideas about how to do it and make it feel as though a burp had just happened, but in the end we went for something really simple, which works in big theatres, but which you could do in tiny spaces as well.The sort of spaces Kelly is talking about are exactly where the London-born writer began his play-writing career after joining a youth theatre while a teenager working in Sainsburyrsquos. His first play of note, Debris, was staged at the tiny Theatre , situated above a Battersea pub, in . He came to further prominence two years later when After The End was seen at the Traverse Theatre in Edinburgh in a production directed by Roxana Silbert for the Paines Plough Company.By , Kellyrsquos BBC Three sit-com, Pulling, co-written with Sharon Horgan, was en route to being nominated for a BAFTA, while his  stage play, Orphans, premiered at the Traverse in a Birmingham Rep production directed by Silbert. The same year saw the National Theatre of Scotland premiere Kellyrsquos play for children, Our Teacherrsquos A Troll. With such a relatively left-field back catalogue, being approached by the Royal Shakespeare Company, then led by former director of Glasgowrsquos Tron Theatre, Michael Boyd, wasnrsquot what Kelly expected to happen next.ldquoWhen the RSC came to me and said they wanted me to do a musical, I said I didnrsquot have a clue about how to do that, Kelly remembers. ldquoI think they knew my work from Debris and Our Teacherrsquos A Troll, and I wrote about three drafts and then Matthew Warchus came on board as director. They looked around exhaustively for a composer, and as soon as I spoke to Matthew about Tim Minchin, I think he knew he was the one.Minchin is the Australian-based performer, whose internationally renowned musical comedy show, Darkside, was an Edinburgh hit in , winning him what was then the Perrier Comedy Award for best newcomer. By the time Kelly and Minchinrsquos take on the story opened in Stratford in , both had been through an extensive development process.ldquoWe did four of these huge two-week workshops, Kelly remembers, ldquoand it was a lot of work. I donrsquot really like workshops, to be honest. I find that stuff hard. The first person I want to hear doing something Irsquove written is the actor playing the part, but with something this big you just have to get on with it and do it.Kelly reckons the entire process took about four years.ldquoSomeone said to me at the time that was ten per cent of my le, he says.Matilda The Musical looks set to last a lot longer than that. Following its West End transfer, the show opened on Broadway, and went on to win seven Olivier Awards ndash the most ever won by a musical ndash and five Tony Awards. It has also toured Canada and Australia prior to its current UK tour. Has such international success changed things for Kelly ldquoIn some ways it changed things, he says, ldquoand in some ways it didnrsquot. Irsquove had a show on for the last eight years, which feels strange. As a playwright you tend to have a show on, then it closes and another one goes on, so it is dferent with Matilda, but after all this time I donrsquot have a lot to do with it anymore. I donrsquot think Irsquom a lot of use to it. I used to go in and maybe give a bit of advice, but at some point yoursquove got to step back and let them get on with it.ldquoHow I wanted to work didnrsquot change. Itrsquos not like this was what I was working towards, meeting famous people and swanning round musical theatre or anything like that. I still write grimy little plays, and always have done, and writing Matilda was no dferent from writing anything  Irsquove done.Such a down to earth approach is part of Matildarsquos appeal. ldquoThere are two things I really like about it, Kelly says. ldquoThe first is Matildarsquos inability to accept the status quo, and secondly, she doesnrsquot whinge about it. A lot of the time in musicals, people say, oh,only this or that happened, I could have done this. Matilda never really does that. She just gets on with it and sorts things out. I think as well itrsquos a bit cheeky and a bit naughty as a musical. The great thing about Roald Dahl is hersquos rude, and Irsquom rude as well, and so is Tim, so it all came together because wersquore all rude. But apart from anything , itrsquos amazing seeing that little girl telling the story, and holding , people or a couple of thousand people, in the palm of their hand.Kellyrsquos forte charting the adventures of unruly small people has continued with his version of Pinocchio, which he wrote for the National Theatre in London in a production that ran in  and  directed by John Tfany, formerly of the Traverse and National Theatre of Scotland. In this way, Kelly seems naturally drawn to such fictional trouble-makers.ldquoBeing able to watch someone who is very small overpower someone who is very big, thatrsquos not a bad message, he says. ldquoI learnt very early on, kids hate things that arenrsquot fair. If you tell a kid off and yoursquore wrong, they hate it. I just love the idea that therersquos a little girl out there who gets up and sorts things out. We could probably do with a bit of that in the world just now.Matilda The Musical, The Playhouse, Edinburgh, tonight-April .www.atgtickets www.uk.matildathemusical"},{"url":null,"title":"labour-accused-of-hypocrisy-over-big-oil-ahead-of-climate-vote","story":"MSPs will today vote on the principles of a Bill putting new carbon reduction targets into law.Labour last night said it wanted to ldquoembolden the legislation, by setting a target of zero greenhouse gas emissions by , instead of the  per cent cut proposed by the SNP.However, it also emerged yesterday that a Labour MSP will be promoting the North Sea oil industry in an exhibition next to the Parliamentrsquos debating chamber this week.Lewis Macdonald, a list MSP for North East Scotland, has sponsored a large display and information stall for Oil  Gas UK, the trade body representing the offshore industry.MSPs will walk past it on their way to vote for climate change targets.The Scottish Greens said Labour was two-faced and could not be trusted on the issue.Friends of the Earth Scotland said it was ldquosadly symptomatic of MSPs talking tough on climate change while backing the fuels that cause it.The environmental campaign also said it was disappointing that it couldnrsquot organise a lobbying event inside Holyrood about the Bill, but the industry was allowed in.ldquoThis risks reinforcing the misconceptions of some MSPs that oil and gas is somehow nothing to do with climate change, it said.Scottish Green MSP Mark Ruskell said: ldquoLast week, Scottish Labour voted down our proposition to declare a climate emergency. This week, as parliament debates the climate change bill, theyrsquove invited the oil and gas industry to lobby MSPs right outside the chamber.ldquoItrsquos clear that on climate policy, like many other issues, Labour is at war with itself and canrsquot be trusted.Dr Richard Dixon, FoE Scotland Director, said: ldquoThis is sadly symptomatic of the many MSPs who apparently see no contradiction between supporting the expansion of oil and gas extraction and action on climate change. The extraction and burning of fossil fuels is the key driver of climate change.ldquoSNP, Labour, Conservative and Liberal Democrats all refused to condemn the industry-led policy of lsquoMaximising Economic Recoveryrsquo of North Sea oil and gas in last weekrsquos Climate Emergency debate, which means maximising the damage to our climate.ldquoWe must cut our use of oil and gas - we need to stop going after new sources and plan an orderly but rapid transition to a green economy.A recent YouGov poll found % of people in Scotland were concerned about climate change.The most common reasons were concern for future generations , threat to wildle , natural disasters , and rising sea levels Scotlandrsquos greenhouse gas output has fallen by % since .With scientists warning of runaway temperatures without urgent action, the new Climate Change Bill would set a % reduction target for  , with an interim cut of % by  , followed by % in  and % in .Critics say it is not enough.Stop Climate Chaos Scotland, which is due to stage a rally outside Holyrood today, said greater urgency was needed in the next decade.Chair Tom Ballantine said: ldquoClimate change is the most urgent and pressing crisis facing the world, and Scotlandrsquos targets for cutting emissions must reflect our commitment to meeting that challenge.ldquoThe increasing frequency and severity of climate disasters around the world show that we are running out of time to solve this crisis.ldquoAs it stands, this Bill is out of step with what climate science says is needed. In recent months wersquove witnessed an upsurge in climate activism and public concern, including thousands of school children going on strike to demand more action from Government. Over , people gave their views that this Bill needed to be stronger, but they have been ignored by the Government. ldquoLabour environment spokesperson Claudia Beamish said: ldquoLabour will seek to amend the SNPrsquos Climate Change Bill to introduce a bold and ambitious target of net zero emissions by  at the latest and bolder interim targets. The Bill as it stands simply does not meet the challenges of the global emergency of climate change.ldquoWe can meet targets fairly [with] a Just Transition Commission to ensure well paid jobs as we sht towards the net zero economy and society.ldquoScotland deserves itrsquos very own Green New Deal bringing new well paid jobs - and a legal ban on fracking. This is the future of our planet, the water we drink and the air we breathe. We have a duty to our children, grandchildren and the global south to tackle climate change now ndash and we will make sure this Bill delivers fairly on climate and intergenerational justice.Mr Ruskell added: ldquoWe have just over a decade to take the bold action that is requiredwe want to avert the worst impacts of the climate crisis. The bill as it is written does not go nearly far enough in addressing this.ldquoMinisters need to set a target to reduce carbon emissions to net zero by  at the latest.ldquoIt is simply not good enough for Ministers to use the rhetoric of lsquoclimate leadersrsquo while failing to take the necessary action to back that up.Reacting to the criticism of the fossil fuel exhibition, Scottish Labour said: ldquoLabour supports a just transition to the net zero economy and society in a way that meets robust targets while protecting jobs.ldquoItrsquos disappointing to see the Greens attack us

The bill for each boat is estimated at under poundm.Labour MP Meg Hillier, the chairwoman of the Commons Public Accounts Committee, said: ldquoFor more than  years the Ministry of Defence has been promising to dismantle its out-of-service nuclear submarines and told my committee last year that it would now address this dismal lack of progress. It has still not disposed of any of the  submarines decommissioned since  and does not yet know fully how to do it.ldquoThe disposal programmes have been beset by y delays and spiralling costs, with taxpayers footing the bill. The ministry needs to get a grip before we run out of space to store and maintain submarines and we damage our reputation as a responsible nuclear power.Nine of the vessels ndash all at Devonport near Plymouth ndash still contain irradiated fuel.

NAO in its report said it was unclear whether there would be space for the bigger Trident submarines at Rosyth.Environmentalists have been warning that authorities just have not figured out how to deal with their old nuclear-powered boats. Five years ago Greenpeace said ldquothe UK has failed to identy a long-term storage disposal option for nuclear waste and that this problem will not be solved within the coming decades.Delays have not just hit defuelling as dismantling is also way behind deadline.

It said: ldquoThe department does not have a fully developed plan to dispose of Vanguard, Astute and Dreadnought-class submarines, which have dferent types of nuclear reactor. Within the civil nuclear sector, organisations must consider waste disposal during the design stage. The department does not have a similar obligation.A MoD spokesman said: ldquoThe disposal of nuclear submarines is a complex and challenging undertaking.

I can under no circumstances vote for a deal involving a customs union as that does not deliver on the referendum,\" said the former Foreign Secretary.His fellow Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg noted: ldquoGetting the support of a known Marxist is not likely to instil confidence in Conservatives.\"The Somerset MP said Mrs Mayrsquos announcement was an attempt to overturn the referendum that wanted a clear Brexit ldquoto do a deal with a Socialist who doesnt want Brexit and is not in line with the Conservative Partys manesto commitments or with the referendum.Her offer to Mr Corbyn was welcomed by the Labour leader, who said he was ldquovery happy to meet the PM, insisting he would ldquonot set any limits on the talks.It came in a statement in Downing Street after a marathon seven-hour Cabinet meeting, described as ldquoisive and ldquotense.The PM - who is expected to meet the Labour leader on Wednesday - made clear that to avoid Britain crashing out of the EU on April , she would seek from Brussels a further extension to the Article  process it would be ldquoas short as possible and end once a deal were passed.But the proposal split the Cabinet  to  with the majority against. However, a ldquokey intervention by Geoffrey Cox, the Attorney General, proved decisive and the Cabinet ldquocollectively agreed the move.At one point, Chancellor Philip Hammond called for a general election or a second referendum to resolve the Brexit issue but this was received badly by colleagues. It is also believed the issue of a national unity government was discussed but not agreed to.After the am to pm Cabinet, fuelled by Chilean red wine and sandwiches, Mrs May addressed the TV cameras from inside No , saying: ldquoThis debate, this ision, cannot drag on much longer. It is putting MPs and everyone  under immense pressure and it is doing damage to our politics.She announced she was taking action to ldquobreak the logjam by offering to sit down with the Labour leader to ldquotry to agree a plan that we would both stick to, to ensure we would leave the EU...with a deal.But she stressed it would have to abide by the current negotiated Withdrawal Agreement meaning the party leaders had to focus solely on the future relationship with the EU.The ldquoideal outcome would be an agreed approach on a future relationship that delivered on the referendum result, which could put to MPs for approval and which she could then take to next Wednesdayrsquos European Council.But Mrs May explainedshe and Mr Corbyn could not agree on a ldquosingle unied approach, then a run-off would take place possibly on Monday. This would involve a number of options put before MPs in a series of votes to determine the way forward.ldquoCrucially, explained the PM, ldquothe Government stands ready to abide by the decision of the House. But to make this process work, the Opposition would need to agree to this too.This means that, , say, the Commons backed a customs union option, Mrs May would be duty-bound to take it to the EU.Once an option were agreed to, the Government would then bring forward the Withdrawal Agreement Bill, which it would want to agree a timetable for to ensure it was passed before May , so Britain need not take part in Euro elections.ldquoThis is a dficult time for everyone, declared the PM. ldquoPassions are running high on all sides of the argument. But we can and must find the compromises that will deliver what the British people voted for. This is a decisive moment in the story of these islands and it requires national unity to deliver the national interest.Mr Corbyn stressed his partyrsquos plans for a customs union and access to vital markets as well as consumer, environmental and employment protections would be on the table. So too would an ldquoabsolute guarantee the Good Friday Agreement was maintained for peace in Northern Ireland.The Labour leader said, while the PM had thus far not compromised, he was pleased she had reached out.ldquoHowever people voted in the referendum of , they didnrsquot vote for lower living standards or to lose their jobs.

Which were, of course, in the  Conservative manesto.This is the logical conclusion of what the PM told the nation from Downing St last night.If things came down to a parliamentary penalty shoot-out between Mrs Mayrsquos deal and another option ndash probably a customs union given this was the alternative that came the closest to winning a majority ndash then,this other proposal were to pass, the PM would have to go to Brussels to make the case for it.ldquoCrucially, the Government stands ready to abide by the decision of the House, declared Mrs May to the TV cameras.Equally, Labour would have to sign the agreement in political blood so thatthe PMrsquos plan won the vote, Mr Corbyn and his comrades would have to support it.But, of course, firstly the two leaders will meet in Downing St for beer and sandwiches or more likely diet coke and vol-au-vents to try to avoid a run-off and get both sides behind a ldquosingle unied position.No  insisted Mrs May would approach the talks in a ldquoconstructive way while Mr Corbyn made clear he would ldquonot set any limits.But the very thought of an attempt to mingle the thoughts of Maggie May and Comrade Corbyn has sent the Brexiteers into eye-rolling disdain, summed up nicely by the Old Etonian Chairman of the European Research Group. ldquoGetting the support of a known Marxist is not likely to instil confidence in Conservatives,\" declared Jacob Rees-Mogg.The Tory turmoil has already seen Labour push its nose five points ahead of its rival in the latest poll.The reality is, as Chief Whip Julian Smith conceded in the BBC documentary, a minority government faced with the Brexit mountain was never going to scale it without help from the other side. So the centre of political gravity at Westminster always meant Mrs May was destined to accede to a softer Brexita no-deal was off the table.Compromise, someone somewhere once said, was the art of politics.

The case for Scottish independence would be greatly enhanced, evena second referendum is currently off the agenda. And anyway, Britain would have toto the negotiating table within months, even to negotiate a free trade arrangement.No deal is not something I would advocate, obviously. But events are beginning to take on a le of their own. Perhaps Parliament will come to its senses, but the arithmetic is against it. Soft Brexit needs to win a convincing and sustainable majority of the  MPs, and so far it hasnrsquot come close. Conservative MPs are refusing to compromise, as an emotional Nick Boles remarked as he left his party.

The Cabinet Secretary, Sir Mark Sedwill, estimates that food prices would rise  per cent, which seems likely, but I doubtpeople would take to the streets on the back of that. The Brits are a phlegmatic race and they would probably just queue, singing Clf Richardrsquos greatest hits to keep themselves amused. Medical supplies will probably get through, eventually, though some will suffer. EU citizens are not going to revolt ndash most of them have already made plans to leave.Irsquom not trying to paint a rosy picture of No Deal. It is not an option that any rational government should contemplate. But Britain has ceased to be rational, and Parliament has failed in its key role as a means of building national consensus. Remainers shouldnrsquot exaggerate the immediate problems of No Deal Brexit, as they did before the  referendum. It is partly the failure of the forecasts of Project Fear to materialise that has made many voters relaxed about leaving without a deal. At least until their jobs start to go.There wonrsquot be mass redundancies overnight, but rather a slow attrition of businesses and jobs as Britain loses friction-free access to its biggest market. Brussels has made clear that it will impose tarfs,  per cent on cars, up to  per cent on some food products. But many items are already exempt and itrsquos not asthere is going to be a blockade at the ports.There will be the full range of sanitary and phytosanitary checks on food and agricultural products. There will be the gamut of regulatory checks also, but these are not immediately visible. Those lorry parks in Kent will certainly be overflowing and the M will be disrupted for weeks, perhaps months. But eventually things will start to move again.Sir Mark Sedwill forecast, in his No Deal briefing, that another run on the pound would be likely. The prospect of car and pharmaceutical companies departing for Europe, along with the banks and legions of creative industry professionals, would make Britain a poor investment prospect ndash at least in the short term. Britainrsquos financial credibility would be in question, and borrowing costs would probably rise.Ireland will face particular dficulties under No Deal, which is why Emanuel Macron and Angela Merkel are holding emergency talks with the Irish Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar. Efforts will be made in the short term to keep the checks away from border posts, and they may be successful. But in the medium term, there is going to be a hard border. That is going to have profound economic consequences for Ireland, which sends nearly half its food exports to the UK.:Scotlands anti-Brexit charm offensive goes down a storm in EuropeThere will also be consequences for the peace process in Northern Ireland. Sir Mark forecasts Direct Rule ing to Northern Ireland, and that could destabilise the province. But in the immediate aftermath of No Deal, there will probably be a stunned silence, as political parties assess the economic damage.As for the rest of the UK, there will also be a breathless hush next Friday as everyone waits to see what happens. It will probably be an anti-climax. The consequences will be profound, but most will be delayed. And there is an upside for Scottish nationalists.

For those who believe that Mr Rees-Mogg is working for you let me remind you that this is the man who said that people who attended state schools were \"as thick as potted plants\" and added that they were not fit to stand for parliament.These politicians are motivated solely by self-interest and care little for the rest of the population.

Laura Kuenssbergs BBC documentary The Brexit Storm was a useful reminder of the long saga of ministerial resignations, of the Conservative Partys bitter civil war, with the European Research Group operating as a party within a party and other Tory MPs quitting in disgust, and of Theresa Mays deal being rejected by Parliament, once, twice, thrice. And the common factor running through the current sorry mess, is of a Prime Minister who stubbornly believed that the only way was her way, and who refused to reach out and include not only her own colleagues, but other parties at Westminster and the devolved administrations in Scotland and Wales.As Ms Kuenssberg presented the story of how Mrs Mays Brexit intentions and negotiations unravelled, it became clear that given her intransigence, the current chaotic mess was always on the cardsthe foundations are rotten, everything is rotten, and as Mrs May built her Brexit house on sand, the tide was against it, and it, like the Conservative Party, lies ruined at her feet.Ruth Marr, Grampian Road, Stirling.YOUR front-page lead story todaycontains a quote from the hard Brexiter Mark Francois referring to the wishes of the . million who voted to leave the EU and how this was still on track following yesterdays votes in the Commons where once again MPs demonstrated their hopelessness,with the SNP at the forefront, by once again saying what they didnt want rather than what they did want.This .m number bandied about, usually with an attachment along the lines of \"the democratic will of the people\" is becoming tedious and repetitive. The electorate was  million so just under  million did not vote to leave and therefore . million is only the will of some of the people. Make voting compulsory, either by going to the polling station or postal voting. Yes, you can spoil your voteyou wish but apathy or laziness would not be allowed. Only then could any vote be given the \"democratic will of the people\" tag.James Martin, Thomson Drive, Bearsden.Read more: MPs publish emergency bill to stop UK crashing out of EU in  days timeWITH the current chaos surrounding the Brexit debate, the blame game is now in full swing with the opposition partiespositioning themselves to gain maximum advantage with the electorate rather than focusing on delivering the  referendum result.First, there is little mention that it was the EU who laid down the \"red lines\" in the Withdrawal Agreementand demanded that the legally-binding document must be passed by Westminster before any meaningful trade discussion could take place.Indeed the only reference to our future trading arrangements is a -page political declarationwhich sits beside the -page WA where it describes the future trading relationship between the UK and the EU. In other words, formal negotiations on everything it containscannot be discussed until the WA is ratied.Rather than vote for the WA which would guarantee an orderly withdrawal from the EU and give time to negotiate a trade deal, parties like the SNP and Labour have muddied the waters by insisting on voting about the political declaration which has inadvertently pushed Brexit towards the much harsher WTO rules.

The benefits of the project for ScotRail customers include: a half-hourly service all day between Inverurie and Aberdeen from December , a new direct service between Inverurie and Montrose, reducing the need to change in Aberdeen.“We understand the inconvenience the work will cause to some passengers and residents, but such a project cannot be delivered without the closure of the line.

Waste cooking oil, lubricant oil and garden waste would need to be taken to  Bossack.Businesses wishing to do this should note they would need to register as a waste carrier with SEPA . There is currently no charge for this for many businesses.It’s also important businesses understand they need to register with the council ahead of taking waste or recycling to Bossack or Chinglebraes, to avoid delays at the gate — or possibly being turned away.Businesses can set up a trade waste and or recycling collection service with the council.Darren Richardson is the council’s head of infrastructure services. He said: “We’re issuing these reminders now to help businesses avoid falling foul of SEPA and possibly incurring fines.“Equally, we’re keen to spread the word amongst businesses that recycling where possible is not only a legal requirement, but it can also save them money.“It’s far cheaper to separate out recyclates than it is to dispose of these items in general waste. It also contributes to the Zero Waste Plan for Scotland where targets proposed include recycling  per cent of all Scotland’s waste and only  per cent of remaining waste ending up in landfill by .“The situation is slightly dferent on the isles with regards to recycling — so we are writing separately to isles businesses.“We’re here to help all businesses and we’d encourage any local business, no matter the size, to contact usthey’re unsure about what they need to do or wish to establish a recycling or waste collection service with us.”Resources and information for businesses is regularly updated on the council’s website and any business, large or small, who is unsure of whether their waste and or recycling is classed as commercial waste should get in touch with the council’s Waste Team on .copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The subsidy is unlawful state aid and it will disturb the market.”The company decided to go to Scotland’s highest civil court after an announcement from the Scottish Government last month. The ministers had decided to name three companies who are bidding to provide ferry services between Aberdeen and Orkney and Shetland.Final tenders for the contract are expected to be submitted by the end of April  and the successful firm will receive a subsidy estimated to be worth around £ million.Legal papers lodged in the case show that Pentland Ferries seeks a declarator from the court that the proposed subsidy is unlawful and breaches obligations placed upon the government by EU law.Today saw lawyers for the Scottish government argued that the ministers had acted lawfully.Having finished hearing from both sides, Lord Boyd said he’d issue his decision at some point in the near future.See next Thursday#s edition of The Orcadian for the full story.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Interviews will cover veterans’ experiences and their thoughts on remembrance.“It is important that these stories are captured now before they can no longer be shared, ensuring greater understanding for future generations.#What’s more, our research has shown that audiences are keen to understand more about recent conflicts and the experiences of our veterans.”The veterans will be asked the same set of questions giving a unique insight into their experiences and views at dferent times in history. Poppyscotland will also conduct group interviews to allow intergenerational interaction.The completed body of work will be available to view on the charity’s learning website and made available to schools. The short video clips will help the public to develop a better understanding and engage with veterans, and have greater appreciation of more recent and less well-known conflicts.If you are a veteran and would welcome the chance to tell your story, please contact Veterans’ Voices researcher Hannah Uttley on   , or atveteransvoices@poppyscotland.org.uk.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Hard down!#In  the foundering of the great three-masted square-rigged sailing ship Dalgonar off the coast of Chile was headline news worldwide, and the dramatic story of the saving of most of her crew has been retold many times over the years, often inaccurately. Commanding Dalgonar at the time was my grandfather, Captain John Isbester, who lost his le when boats were launched. As the only seafaring descendant of Captain John – I served at sea for  years – I welcomed the chance to explore the circumstances of the event and the  years that he spent at sea before his death.Of considerable help to me were the substantial collection of family letters, postcards, photos and documents that my father, eighth child of John, had carefully preserved. In addition I have been able to draw on a wide range of log books, articles of agreement, casualty reports and other official documents preserved in archives in Britain and overseas. The official documents provide the framework for my book while the letters bring the events to le and provide flashes of humour. My grandfather was raised in Shetland, his home for most of his le, and his seagoing career started with a summer season fishing for herring when aged . That was followed by four seasons with the Faroe smacks, fishing for cod in the stormy waters around Faroe, Iceland and Rockall and learning the skills of seamen in one of the toughest of schools. By this time John’s mother had died of tetanus and his father was gold mining in New Zealand. John based himself in Liverpool and found work as a seaman on big square-rigged sailing ships on voyages to such colourful and interesting ports as Montreal, New York, New Orleans, Buenos Aires, Portland, Calcutta, Bombay and Sydney. He sat and passed all his exams and at the age of  was qualied to command big sailing ships.He decided then that he was also ready to marry. After a whirlwind courtship he married Susie Irvine, the local laird’s daughter, at home in Shetland. Susie was later to accompany her husband on four of his year-long voyages to Sydney, NSW and San Francisco. While waiting for the birth of their first child, he took command of a schooner for a short voyage to the Baltic which he describes in interesting detail in his first letters to his new we. Inexperienced in writing to a we his letter starts with an account of the voyage from Lerwick to the mouth of the Baltic, with courses steered, distance run and wind direction. We also learn of the fish, eggs and potatoes bought from bumboats, how many pairs of wet socks he had accumulated and which week he changed his underwear!John Isbester soon found work as master of the barque Centaur where he spent the next  years making annual voyages to San Francisco. Susie accompanied him on two of those voyages having tohome overland to New York then by steamer to Liverpool when her childminding mother died. On one voyage, Captain Isbester picked up the -man crew of the Norwegian ship Fjeld, lost to a coal fire, and kept most of them aboard for three months, by which time provisions were running very low, despite having called at Pitcairn Island for whatever stores they could provide. On their passage through the Atlantic towards Europe, other ships they met were asked to accept some of the Fjeld survivors and three ships did so, ensuring that Isbester and his crew did not starve.During the following voyage John suffered a fire aboard his own ship when a crew member stumbled below decks when carrying a lighted oil lamp. The ship’s company fought the fire for  hours but were forced to abandon ship in stormy conditions in the middle of the Pacic Ocean where they made an eight-day, -mile passage to Hilo in the Hawaiian Islands. Captain Isbester was commended by the British Vice Consul in Honolulu for the ‘excellent discipline and conduct which appear to have prevailed throughout your crew under the very trying conditions which you and they have had to encounter.’ John was interested in people, enjoyed discussion and the telling of stories. It is fortunate that a passenger on one of his ships, a Scots solicitor named Arnold Franz McJannet, enjoyed his stories and, during a -week voyage from Liverpool to Sydney NSW, wrote a number of them down. Thus we have the benefit of John’s colourful description of the trials of eight days in an open boat, untrammelled by the need for formal reporting.His employers, the Australasian Line, quickly found him another big square-rigged sailing ship and he was soon back at sea in command of the barque Rossdhu, bound for the fascinating African Arab port of Zanzibar. In the following months, calling at Newcastle NSW and Tocopilla, Chile before ing to the UK, John completed his first circumnavigation of the globe. While on a similar circumnavigation the following year, Rossdhu was wrecked at Copper Cove on the coast of Chile. While no lives were lost the experience must have been a devastating one and it is fascinating to read John’s draft account of the circumstances, written for the owners and preserved amongst family papers. He may have feared that he would never work again but after  months one of the Australasian Line’s masters retired and John was given command of the company’s flagship, the mighty Dalgonar.For the final  years of his le, Captain Isbester commanded Dalgonar. Susie and two of their sons made two round-the-world voyages aboard the ship and they were joined by the other children for the second voyage. They were given some schooling by family and friends and appear to have suffered no serious damage from the disruption to their education.These years embrace the family’s move from their beloved Shetland to the London suburbs, the wedding of daughter Kathleen to chief mate Lewis Davies, the birth of John and Susie’s ninth child aboard ship in Australia and friendships with other Shetland folk in distant parts of the Commonwealth.While writing Hard Down! Hard Down! I have tried to follow my grandfather’s family and professional lives as closely as possible. I have been interested in what he did and in why and how he did it. What was the le of a Shetland fisherman like  What was it like to be employed as a seaman on big sailing ships  Was he a caring husband and father  Was he a competent seaman and a good shipmaster In the years before the First World War, about  British ships were lost each year to wrecking, sinking, fire and collision. Readers learning of the loss of the Dalgonar may conclude that John’s luck finally ran out but will find some consolation in the skill and heroism displayed by the Dalgonar’s survivors and the captain and crew of the French barque, Loire, which came to their rescue.Hard Down!

Odd shoes, empty suitcases, the occasional book: such domestic detritus, covered in the dust of years, lurks under the beds of many of those for whom Marie Kondo, the Japanese tidiness guru, is no more than a name, rather than an ideology. People who store things under their beds rarely bring themselves to take too close a look at what is there.But some people really do look under their beds, and may do so fairly often. For many of these, the practice of peering nervously under the bed is a hangover from a childhood fear of the monsters known to inhabit such regions. More realistic children, of course, may prefer to check the space under the bed for lions, or other entirely zoologically plausible possibilities. But whatever the under-bed fauna, in the normal course of events, children grow out of such fears, coming to understand that the likelihood of finding a lion in their particular postcode is slight. Even so, the possibility that there is something there may be sufficient to prolong the period of Unterbettwachsamkeit well into the adult years.Finding something untoward under one’s bed is, of course, a potentially traumatic experience. There are those who say that it simply doesn’t happen, but it does. Many years ago I had a conversation with former neighbours in Botswana who had given a home to my cat when I left the country after living there for a year. When I revisited Gaborone, I called on them to find out how the cat was doing. He was fine, they said, although he – and they – had recently had a somewhat unsettling experience.This is what happened. The couple had gone out for dinner and had ed to find that the front door of their house had been forced. They called the police, who searched the house and concluded that theof the householders had seen off the burglars. My friends then tidied up and in due course retired to their bed. The cat, however, seemed very disturbed and spent some minutes on their bed pacing up and down, extending and retracting his claws. They put this down to feline post-traumatic stress disorder: no cat likes an unannounced intruder.: The Edinburgh of the future will have no residents and an all-year festival – Alexander McCall SmithThey switched out the light and were drting off to sleep when the bed suddenly began to move up and down beneath them. The burglar, who had hidden there when he heard them , was struggling to escape the weight of the mattress pressing down upon him. He eventually managed – and rushed out of the room into the night. The cat had sensed his presence but had been unable to communicate this to his owners. A dog would have managed, of course, but cats are dferent.Having a burglar under one’s bed must be everybody’s perfect nightmare. It is the reason, I suspect, why, when staying in hotels on book tours in the United States, I always look under the bed when I move into a room. In my view that is simple prudence. Ex abundanti cautela more or less sums it up. The Unites States, for all its merits, is not a particularly safe country, and it is perfectly possible that your hotel room may harbour a psychopath. One of these hiding places could well be under the bed, or even one of those walk-in cupboards where they keep the complimentary towelling bathrobe. Violent criminals love those cupboards and the bathrobes they contain. Of course, I feel vaguely foolish when doing this – who wouldn’t  – but I believe that it is better to be safe than sorry, and to locate any intruder before you turn out the lights. Alfred Hitchcock, I believe, would have understood.: Alexander McCall Smith: All this talk about British identity is turning people IrishMcCarthyite America gave us the expression “reds under beds”, used to describe the paranoid view of those who believed that Hollywood’s studios were riddled with Trotskyites. Trotsky, of course, advocated entryism, and what more obvious form of entryism is there than going into a room and slipping under the bed  Reds under beds is clearly a metaphor, but recent reports have suggested that the metaphor bears more relation to widely encountered practice than one might imagine.These reports come from hotels where members of the Momentum Group have taken to staying while on political business. Many people are unaware of the fact that many of those in Mr Corbyn’s circle do not sleep on top of the bed when staying in hotels, but sleep under the bed. This, for some reason, is their preference. It is also very considerate of hotel management and staff, as their beds never need fresh sheets and can be let out again within minutes of their departure.This habit of Momentum members is yet another example of how popular expressions such a reds under beds may in fact be more literal than metaphorical. Metaphor reflects reality as much as it shapes it. But there are limits: those who sleep under the bed as opposed to on top of it, are not necessarily of the left, or, in demotic parlance, red: other reasons may play a part. But one might nonetheless ask: what explains this strange preference of the left for sleeping under the bed  That’s the really interesting question, for an answer to which I suspect we shall have to wait. If you find somebody under your bed, do not engage. Creep out of the room. There are other rooms, other beds – and other metaphors too.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit britain s done it for me time for independence kevan christie","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Assuming the SNP can stop telling tall tales like #Harry Potter and the White Paper on Scotland#s Future# and everyone stops using Twitter, Scottish independence is virtually in the bag, writes Kevan Christie.So, that’s it then, what’s done is done. FIN. The game’s a bogey, a dead rubber, bad light has stopped play and in the words of Dame Shirley Bassey, The Party’s Over.I am of course talking about ... Westminster. The last helicopter is just about to leave from the Parliament roof as Jeremy Corbyn and the Viet Cong approach the gates – make sure the Scottish MPs are on the last flight out of Dodge. It’s time for them to pack up their troubles in the old tartan travel rug and smile, smile, smile. Mhairi Black can come home and state the obvious – “the poor need our help” and such like – up here at Holyrood, while we marvel at her youthful genius. That big guy with the ponytail who blocks the entrance to one House of Commons’ lobby everytime there’s a meaningless vote – Chris Law, I believe they call him – you need to get up the road sharpish Sir, you’re needed for bouncer duties at hame. The Westminster  will add to the ‘talent pool’ at the Scottish Parliament – I say  as Ian Blackford can stay, he’s more suited to le down there. We don’t want or need this investment banker, send him to the hills – the Blackford Hills For the time has come, dear reader, to get the black marker out and draw a line at Berwick-upon-Tweed. The clarion has been called, all roads now point to independence as the only show in town.There’s no doubt the Brexit omnishambles is pushing folk towards “freedom” with Indyref coming to a cinema near you shortly. Theresa May has started talking backwards like something out of Twin Peaks and everyone who doesn’t work as a political journalist has given up on trying to make sense out of the whole sorry saga.Polls and stuff on Facebook say that two thirds of Scots who are “undecided” about independence, believe Brexit makes it likely and more than half would now opt for the Tunnock’s Caramel WafersBritain leaves the EU without a deal. : Kevan Christie: What Plato had to say about BrexitThe time has come to tell the Eton Rles where to go – Rees-Moog, Dominic Saab, Boris and the like can do one. Not Amber Rudd though, she seems nice. Arlene Foster can get back to watching ‘ Great Orange Walks’ on her Betamax video recorder as her beloved Union shrinks before her eyes. She can afford to buy her own video shop chain now anyway.And get the Trident submarines out of Faslane, they’ve been clogging up our driveway long enough like a petrolhead’s vanity project on bricks. The Russians aren’t coming.There’s no doubt Albion has had a good innings with some notable moments along the way. The Battles of Trafalgar in  and Waterloo in  were obvious highlights as was the winning of two World Wars and one World Cup – - at Wembley in , but we Scots need to move on.Hopefully we’ll still have trade agreements with the English when independence inevitably comes, so there’ll be no need to stock up on essential items like HP Sauce and Colman’s Mustard.All Nicolahas to do pre-Indyref is issue a decree that no-one in the SNP says or does anything daft – big ask, I know – and we should be home and hosed provided the Section  order hurdle can be overcome and a mandate to hold a second referendum secured. Perhaps a Twitter blackout and a blanket ban on anyone looking to throw eggs at the likes of Jim Murphy or hang half-Saltire, half-Catalan flags on the A flyover near Cowdenbeath, could be enforced. Here’s hoping – fingers crossed.: Kevan Christie: Red Clydesiders would despair over Edinburgh-Glasgow rivalryIt will be painful but we need the Scottish Government to tell the truth – no more of this “Harry Potter and the White Paper on Scotland’s Future” nonsense. If they lay out the facts and stick to a basic doctrine of “we’ll be skint for a while but it’ll be worth it in the end” then the opportunity to finally escape the Westminster cesspit is achievable.No more Broken Britain.Surely, the likes of Ian Murray and Monica Lennon in the Scottish Labour Party, Ruth Davidson and That Nice Man Willie Rennie can’t defend the Union as it stands with this Westminster UK Government debacle in full flow. With schisms in both the Tory and Labour parties, there is no end in sight to the misery, no matterNoel Edmonds finally gets his Brexit Deal or No Deal passed in the House. The whole thing has been a disaster from beginning to end and it’s no surprise that more people are toying with the idea of voting for independence when it inevitably comes around again.I feel there is a season of goodwill towards Scotland in the European Union. The likes of Donald Tusk and Michel Barnier know we are not supporters of this Brexit bampottery and voted for no such thing. Not in my name. Perhaps, they’ll let us join the EUwe go independent or at least let us stay pals via the EEA or EFTA routes.If Indyref does come about, let’s make it swt and above all be nice to each other. The opportunity for Scotland to be a cool wee Tommy Robinson-free country is within reach, but we cannot allow the SNP to dominate. Knowing the names of train stations in Gaelic is not on the list of everyone’s priorities but there’s no need to tell the poileas. Maybe they’ll finally be held to account in an independent Scotland and we can get on with fixing health and education.

Submarine recycling should be seen as a new economic opportunity to spread our expertise and intellectual property around the globe – we must grab it with both hands. “However as this damning NAO report points out it is unacceptable that consecutive British governments have for years ignored this issue and instead burdened the communities of Rosyth and Devonport with these ageing subs on their doorsteps.”A MOD spokeswoman said: “The disposal of nuclear submarines is a complex and challenging undertaking. We remain committed to the safe, secure and cost-effective defueling and dismantling of all decommissioned nuclear submarines as soon as practically possible.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"royal mile treasure trove of mary queen of scots documents found","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...A treasure trove of documents signed by Mary Queen of Scots and revealing the #everyday reality of ruling the country# in the th century has been unearthed in a council storage facility on the Royal Mile.A haul of handwritten papers is said to show the doomed monarch “carefully managing the busy commercial le of Edinburgh”, as well as authorising the building of new defences for the city in Leith.The documents, which are set to be the centrepiece of a new exhibition in Edinburgh on Mary’s short-lived rule, have already been conserved and digitised to allow them to be viewed publicly on the council’s online archive. They were discovered by staff in a store at the Museum of Edinburgh, just a few hundred yards away from the Palace of Holyroodhouse, where Mary ruled for six years after ing from France in . The  documents, which are inidually dated, numbered and signed, relate to the rights of deacons and tradesmen in the city, the selling of meat at the Tolbooth and the making of salt in Newhaven.Early conservation work on the documents, which were recently discovered in the Museum of Edinburgh’s own storage facility off the Canongate, has revealed watermarks – one of a goat and another of a flower – which can only been seen when held up to light.It is thought the papers entered the archives of the local authority in the s, but were then “lost” before being rediscovered nearly a century later during conservation work. Intriguingly, some of the documents signed by Mary date from when she was still in France.Experts in the council’s museums and galleries service, which is responsible for the official archives of the city, said the recently unearthed documents revealed an “often overlooked “ aspect of her le.History curator Vicky Garrington said: “Together, the documents shed light on a key part of Scotland’s past. We all know the tragic story of Mary Queen of Scots, her eventful le and eventual execution in , but in these documents we see a dferent side to Mary.“Here, she can be seen carefully managing the everyday affairs of Edinburgh, both from France and Scotland. It’s fascinating to think of her reading through these official papers before carefully applying her signature.“They are staying in storage at the museum for now. But we hope to have them assessed by a conservator and for further research to be done on them by experts on Mary, after which we hope to exhibit them, which will be hugely exciting.”Museums and galleries manager Frank Little said: “We’re constantly reviewing, caring for and researching our collections, and look forward to sharing more of the city’s rich heritage with residents and visitors through our programme of exhibitions and online activities.” Council culture convener Donald Wilson said: “Our museums and galleries hold thousands of historic treasures, many of which are on display in our venues.

Well done Shetlands!!#The Shetlands# did they have a march there too First of all, I would like to say # I am European #. The Brexit fiasco is nothing more than for this government to have a trade deal with the USA, by sanctioning the EU referendum to distance ourselves from Europe and to be more culturally linked to the USA. Nothing could be further from the truth. The psychological brainwashing of the xenophobic political uprising has brought to the fore the extreme, darker and fascist aspects of our society and how we are slowly but surely destroying the very fabric which makes up our society of every creed, colour, nationality, gender orientation and the iety of many aspects which we regard as the makeup of society. Brexit, by its very nature, erodes these values we hold dear and directs us into a more extremist political way of thinking. This is not what we should be advocating for our society and our future.The last time I looked the UK was still physically attached to the continent of Europe . As well as being English , Welsh , Scottish or Northern Irish we are all European . We # leavers # like Europe a lot, we strongly dislike being part of the dictatorial , undemocratic , unaccountable European Union . OK  The official EU view on independent Scotland EU membership:“The EU is founded on the Treaties which apply only to the Member States who have agreed and ratied them. If part of the territory of a Member State would cease to be part of that state because it were to become a new independent state, the Treaties would no longer apply to that territory. In other words, a new independent state would, by the fact of its independence, become a third country with respect to the EU and the Treaties would no longer apply on its territory.”i.e we shall be automatically out of the EU # with #NO DEAL# # from Independence Day.Have the EU’s treaties changed, meanwhile  No.However, it#sjoining rules have changed.

Voters don’t always get the chance to change the government, but they may want the chance to change their mind.You may be cheering the overturning of the democratic vote now, butthey get away with it we will all be losers. Be careful what you wish for you may just get it.Well, the #Put it to the People# march was in London in that there England, so I#m unsure why Quitters are making an issue of the numbers. The debate afterwards was billed as an open debate, and only one cockney Quitter spoke, so make what you like of that.Why go to the unnecessary effort of changing my mind  Parliament, the commentariat and most of the mainstream media seems perfectly happy to do that for me. And while they’re at it why not move the goal posts, change the game and rewrite the rules as you go along. Quintessentially EUropean modus operandi.Our major export markets are Japan and China. That is unlikely to change either.British markets of old will not be ing to the past and arguments made that this will happen is extreme naiveté.The commonwealth is far bigger than Australia. Much of it developing economies expanding far far faster than Australia is or ever will. You are right though Oz will have to keep selling to China because China owns vast swathes of Ozzy industry and mining. I for one will be delightedwe have a much closer links with Australia, New Zealand but they are hardly super stars of economic growth.I do not know of a single UK made item in any of my families ious homes.Ali says “ theyget away with itwe will all be losers”. Boo-hiss! Really  If Boris, Farage, Rees-Mogg and chums get away with it most folk will be worse off, with the few laughing all the way to their offshore banks. And that’s the point # them taking control to profit from their vision of a backwards looking low-tax-for-the-rich Britain of biddable serfs. Ali should be careful whose bidding he is doing by defending May’s hollow deal.Perhaps my previous point might distress Ali lessI rephrased it. Not all of the electorate who seek a change of government achieve this at election time. That’s parliamentary elections for you, particularly under first last the post. We get one day of enjoying the freedom of maybe changing the government and have to put up with the outcome for some years before the next time. However, in the terms of this referendum # brought on to placate those ideologues who bankrolled lawbreaking in their dishonest campaign, well # some folk might have changed their minds + days on. Unlike an unpopular government, Brexit would be forever. Why not make sure we really want it Peter, you so waffle on! Ignoring your obviously obsessive-compulsive dogma, reference Boris, Farage,biddable serfs and assorted socialist claptrap, I will take issue on one point only here. Your  statement,#Unlike an unpopular government, Brexit would be forever#, that is manest nonsense. After Brexit, Europe will still exist. The EU, on present developments, may well implode at any minute. Spain, Greece, Italy even Franceseem to be moving away from the suffocating mire of Brussels, Junker, Barnier and undemocratic cabals of theEU. Brexit would never be forever It is just the start of an equitable move towards democratic change and true democracy in Europe, not the present cartel of faceless unelected bureaucratic parasites and overpaid freeloaders.You keep harping on about Boris, Nigel and Jacob asthey were the only proponents of brexit. You steadfastly ignore the other . million people because of course you obviously are so much smarter and nicer than them so their votes don#t count. What I wonder is what will the political elites decide to ignore next time we votethey get away with it this time. How about we have a vote about the SCT andwe don#t like the outcome we vote again until we do get the result we want. Or may until they get the result they want which is contrary to what you want. How does democracy work in your fantasist mind Marc Petit, Superstars! I love Aus but economic Superstars, what planet are you on  Australia has a masive land mass, fantastic mineral resources yet is so outperformed financially by India, Canada, and with half the GDP of the UK . As my Aus brother would say, #A few stubbies short of a six-pack. A few sandwiches short of a picnic#. Now get real your comment marc,#we are superstars of growth # it must have been a petit and low starting point  years back.@Mark Petit,Thanks for that, very interesting. Do you think that the Australia-Japan Economic Partnership is helpful by removing tarfs from Japanese goods imported into Australia and vice versa for your agricultural exports to Japan  Whereas having no trade deal with the EU presumably means that goods from both parties are subject to tarfs  The EU is very protective of its agriculture.I#m assuming Australia would find a UK trade deal helpful by removing UK tarfs on your agricultural produce e.g. fruit and wine, and making British goods much cheaper to Australians than they are now What a wonderful attitude and comment from Marc Petit, #These goods Japan et al are cheaper and generally regarded as better .# as our goods are all manufactured under EU protocols and Marc claims are clearly poor quality, just another really good reason to move on. I quote, World Financial Review # Australia has become one of the first countries to finish signing off trade deals with Britain# and The Financial Times, #Australia to fast-track UK trade pact in event of no-deal Brexit# so you see petit comments from Mr Petit,are just that and no more.!!So, Boris Johnson has now changed his mind. Let’s respect his right to do so, but couldn’t the public have done so too And May took her deal twice to the Commons,but she won’t take it once to the commoners. At least you know where you are with the Tories # kind of.Only % of voters think May’s deal is a good deal, but we are meant to shut up and swallow it,her party can back it,she’ll go. How dare anyone speak up against this insulting nonsense Ali’s alt-right guided jibes are remarkably handy. Non-fantasist Ali draws a telling distinction between self-interested Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage and Jacob Rees-Mogg on one hand, the “political elite” on another hand,and the millions who fell for the demonstrablelies of the Brexit campaign cheats on yet another hand still. I am not of course forgetting those voters. I’m pointing out who misled them and why.To adapt Roald Dahl: these laddies from the upper crust. Does he really not see that they are political and elite  It’s troubling.Ali might care to note I am not calling him a member of the alt-right here, buthe continues to unthinkingly parrot their offensive arguments conclusions will be drawn. Non-obsessivecompulsive Ian might similarly do well to dwell on the benefits of avoiding ad hominem arguments. Whilst he has managed at times to play the ball not the man, Ian sadly is more than habitually inclined to foul, and thereby be judged foul in turn.

Coincidence  Maybe not. Does Ian still insist rich and powerful Brexit-backers aren#t out for themselves #neo-fascist German AfD party leader# revolting female, but elected to the German Parliament, I repeat elected!!! Now, Peter, can you see the reason we need out. Even you must now see what the E Union is doing with its Proportional Representation and revolting political systems. Neo-Nazi elected into the German Parliament, enough said.Fascism cannot be defeated by nationalist-navel gazing. The far-right are cooperating across Europe, trying to heighten a sense of crisis and undermine confidence in the institutions which they hope to control. Ian#s approach isn#t simply ahistoric. It is dangerously naive. His phrase #revolting female# normalises misogyny.Recognising the threat, not allowing ourselves to be ided and working with our neighbours to the greater good is the only way to keep the far-right at bay internationalism, standing together, kindness, respect. It is less than two years since Farage was speaking at an AfD rally. Ian should be more skeptical about the real motives of the brains behind Brexit. The David Davis#s quote shows they knew what they were about. Rich financiers, newspaper magnates and populist politicians have schemed together to break electoral law, lie to and manipulate the public to bring Britain to this precipice. Meanwhile all some have had to add is jeers. That said, Ian did manage to make his last ill-considered contribution without needless insult.

They then went on to highlight some of the key tenets underpinning the debate such as trade agreements, law and immigration, before making their concluding statements.In the opening gambit for the pro-Brexit team, S pupil Abbi Morgan argued that leaving the EU #would be a hugely positive thing for the UK# and would allow the country to #take control of borders and create worldwide trade agreements#.She went on to add that it would put the UK in a position to #take back its sovereignty# and make its own decisions on important matters. She stated that as a net contributor to the EU, the UK would be better off by £. billion.In the opening address for the pro-EU team, Lois Langlandssaid that #history and past experience as a member of the EU# gave the UK a more secure position for the future and that, in leaving the European Union, the UK would #enter the unknown# and #walk into the future blindfolded#.She said that outside the EU the UK was a #small fish in a big pond# and asked why any country would be interested in providing a free trade agreement with the UK.#The EU as an organisation is extremely wasteful#, he said. #Every  days the European Parliament moves from Brussels to Strasbourg, where it sits for four days # this is estimated to cost nearly £ million a year.#Touching on the issues of freedom of movement as part of the remain team, Chiara MacLeansaid: #Once the UK leaves the EU, British citizens will become third-party nationals, with no automatic right of admission.# She added that, through the new European travel information and authorisation system, all UK nationals over  years of age #would have to pay money to go somewhere they had a free right to go now#.Seth Bennettook up the reins for the pro-Brexit side, arguing that in terms of laws and immigration the EU could pass any laws they wanted and in by doing so #strip Britain of its sovereignty# # which he described as #one of its driving forces#.He believed that Brexit would offer the UK the chance to #increase its spending in education and housing# which could perhaps lead to a #revival of the nation#s once-thriving industries#.Speaking for the pro-EU team, Gracie Buchan said that leaving the European Union would lead to a trade deficit and result in a shortage of daily supplies such as fruit and vegetables.#Keeping food shop shelves full and prices down will be one of the biggest challenges when Brexit comes around,# she said. #Failure to reach some sort of an agreement could see retailers face an average increase of  per cent, particularly in dairy, meat, veg, and fruit.#Closing for the Brexit side, S pupil Joseph Moller said the EU favoured its own agenda and that in terms of per head of population Maltese citizens had  times more representation than UK nationals.He added that, rather than the , jobs that were cited as potentially being lost due to Brexit, the level of employment had in fact risen by one per cent since the referendum and unemployment was at its lowest level since the s.Summing up for remain, S pupil Innes MacNeil said: #Latest reports suggest that deals have been struck with just seven out of  countries, we have gained a lot more than we have spent on the EU, and multinational companies are threatening to relocate overseas, affecting jobs and investments.#Exiting in less than  days# time without any sound withdrawal agreement and just a few trade relationships will result in uncertainty and chaos.#The judges said they were impressed by how confident and informed the pupils were. They also felt the pupils were cohesive as a team and said that they saw some future MSPs and MPs.In the end, the judges awarded the team speaking against Brexit  points while the side advocating Brexit received  to claim victory.Skye, Lochaber, and Badenoch MSP Kate Forbes and Highland and Islands MSP Edward Mountain both fielded questions on Brexit after the debate and were quick to praise the pupils for their efforts.Ms Forbes said: #I certainly think they could have resolved Brexit faster than some of the politicians today # an absolutely fantastic debate based on fact, evidence, respect for each other, lots of confidence. I think I have left with a few top tips for my next debate in parliament!#Mr Mountain added: #I thought it was quite excellent # there#s obviously a lot of research gone into it. I thought they were extremely confident # I would have been much more nervous than that speaking at their age. As I said to Kate Forbes today, she should be worried because there are a few challenges for her position.#"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/2447-Nairn-v-LHWFC-adj-credit-euan-macleod.jpg","title":"lewis and harris womens football team kick off new league in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine with a barnstorming - away win over Nairn Ladies FC.The long trip to Nairn for their league opener on Saturday proved to be one to remember for the islanders as they enjoyed a resounding victory to get their league campaign up and running in emphatic fashion.Played in freezing conditions on Nairn showfield, the Lewis and Harris club fielded a young side made up largely of - and -year-olds # with just three non-pupil players included in the squad.After missing a penalty, Ann-Mairi Macleod made history by becoming the scorer of the first goal in the newly-formed Highlands and Islands league.Macleod#s goal opened the floodgates as the visitors went on to score five more in the first period # thanks to a goal apiece from Jessica Macleod and Hollie Martin, and a hat-trick from Mary Macleod.Lewis and Harris were in dreamland in the second half as they proceeded to score a further  goals.

They need tangible changes now, not months down the line.“Teachers are entitled to a safe working environment in which their wellbeing is safeguarded. Their Employer has a legal duty of care for them, which at the moment it is failing to deliver.“We hope that the Employer will agree to engage meaningfully with the union to address members’ concerns fully so that further strike action can be avoided.”The school will remain open this week despite the strike action.The Council for Catholic Maintained Schools called on the NASUWT to continue to engage in attempts to resolve the dispute and said the outstanding issues would not be resolved through strike action."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"one of our most unique and historic resting places","story":"There are no signs directing visitors to Tullyrusk graveyard which sits in the expanse of fields beyond the Ballymac Hotel. And there isn’t even a road to it. This graveyard is a precious relic of old Ireland that has been forgotten by all except those whose relatives lie there.Dúlra only learned about it from a reader who had happened upon the cemetery while out for a walk. The reader had mentioned that there were yew trees in the graveyard, and it was those trees that finally caught Dúlra’s eye or he wouldn’t have found it at all.And so he walked through a farmer’s gate towards a circular mound in the distance that is raised above the surrounding rolling fields that sweep down towards Lough Neagh, up the stone steps and in through the double iron gates. And what Dúlra found was a beautul, remote, wild resting place with stunning views over much of Ulster.It’s a graveyard from the mists of time. In ancient days it was a church whose name has long been forgotten which was reputedly founded by St Patrick. A thousand years later it was demolished by Cromwell. The foundations of the church are still visible, along with a holy well nearby.Indeed, the church at Tullyrusk was so famous it got got name-checked in story written in Armagh way back in the s.The gravestones reveal a mixed clientele – Catholics and Protestants made equal by the Great Leveller. Simply known today after the townland Tulaigh Ruisc, the hillock of the march, the oldest legible gravestone inscription dates from  . The most recent, as Dúlra was soon to discover, was last Friday on the day of his visit, a poignant reminder that in Ireland, history and the present day are rarely separated.A century ago cultural activist Francis Joseph Bigger called Tullyrusk the “last of the old burial places left to the ancient stock”, and said that a hundred years previously, the old Irish keening would wail around the crumbling walls during funerals. Some say it can still be heard in the wind after the burial of the old clans, he wrote.But the grave of one heroic resident of Tullyrusk remains unmarked. A local man called Armstrong was condemned to hang in Lisburn in  after messages from the United Irishmen were found sewn into the lining of his waistcoat. As he awaited the gallows, his we and children were allowed to see him, begging him to save his le by turning in his comrades.“Do not tempt me, mo chroí,” he told her. “My le is only one, and God will watch over my widow and children.” If I inform, he said, many “wives would be made widows and hundreds of children left fatherless”.As Dúlra walked through the small graveyard, its ground uneven due to the multiple burials over centuries, he thought of the distraught widow burying her husband that summer’s day in , her children gathered around her. There could have been few sadder sights in the tragic history of this land.Dúlra was making his way around the old gravestones, doing his best to decipher them, when a gravedigger arrived. “This graveyard is rarely used for funerals nowadays,” he said. “I’m called here once a year at the most.”Dúlra left before the funeral cortege arrived – access is through a nearby bungalow and the coffin is usually carried across the fields amid the glorious backdrop as has been done for countless centuries.Dúlra could not think of a better place to lie, below the beautul yew trees in one of the country#s most unique and historic resting places.A place apart, overlooking Lough Neagh and beyond, and alongside countless generations of a proud people. * If you’ve seen or photographed anything interesting, or have any nature questions, you can text Dúlra on  ."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37978600.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/artment%20block%20007.jpg","title":"belfast apartments evacuated following first floor blaze","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Full UK-wide participation in the customs union and single market is acceptable to the DUP because it does not leave Northern Ireland aligned to the EU in isolation.It would maintain a soft border, debunking the persistent myth that the DUP wants a hard border.On Wednesday, the DUP opposed harder Brexit options - such as customs union membership alone - because it would not remove the backstop on which the May-EU withdrawal agreement rests.The DUP also rejected Labours fantasy option of membership of a customs union - asthere is an a la carte menu of such unions - in which the UK would miraculously continue to have the right to its own global trade deals and input to those of the EU.Belatedly, the dferences between the European Research Group - obsessed with Brexit - and the DUP - preoccupied only with Northern Irelands equal Brexit alongside the rest of the UK - have begun to be laid bare. Boris bin, ditch and junk the backstop Johnson wont be getting a repeat slot at the next DUP conference.Having used the event to launch his Conservative Party ascendancy, any fidelity to the DUP dissolved the moment Theresa May said \"support my backstop deal and theres a leadership vacancy\".Shameless is too inadequate a word.Et tu, Jacob Ill only changethe DUP moves Rees-Mogg, you changed as the DUP held steadfast. The DUP conference gig could have been yours, Jacob. I was looking forward to the first such gathering to be addressed in Latin.Many continue to criticise the DUP. The extensive support for the backstop across Northern Irelands business and farming communities shows a determination that economic logic ought to trump constitutional politics. Seamless access to EU and UK single markets matters, protecting livelihoods.To those at risk, this matters more than unproven claims that Northern Irelands unique alignment to the EU single market would be a constitutional betrayal, jeopardising the Union.In trying to persuade the DUP onside, the UK Government has made clear that it will not allow regulatory ergence between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.In other words,EU single market regulations change, the Government will adopt them across the UK to protect Northern Irelands EU and UK trading relationships.The problem is that the DUP will not trust successor governments to honour that pledge.A certain mythology has developed over the seamlessness of Northern Irelands place in the UK single market.A reader, Alan Brookes, contacted me wondering how many people recalled that some British people from where in the UK could not work in Northern Ireland from  until  without a work permit.Such permitswere issued only to qualied essential workers, with notable exceptions such as members of the Armed Forces, religious ministers and teachers.Under the old Stormont regime, the Safeguard of Employment Act was designed to create local jobs for local workers. Brookes recalls his final interview with a Northern Ireland engineering firm in . \"When they asked did I need a work permit as I was born in England and I stated I did they immediately cooled and I was informed it would be too dficult\".There have long been checks on certain commodities travelling between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and identication is always required.None of this has threatened the Union, but it has highlighted the distinctiveness of Northern Ireland.If the backstop worked well, it might possibly stem the rising demands of nationalists for constitutional change via a border poll and shore up the Union. After all, Northern Ireland only looks vaguely secure when it is economically prosperous and politically ing.Rarely, in other words.The DUPs intransigence has been matched by the EU steadfastly refusing to change a single word of the withdrawal agreement.There might be something faintly ridiculous about the chancelleries of Europe standing paralysed before Sammy Wilson, Nigel Dodds and Arlene Foster, but its where we are.The DUP will never back the backstop in its current form. Amid all the noise, the party has at least been consistent, wanting a deal, but clear that no backstop removal equals no deal.What more can Theresa May do to sell her agreement given she has laid down her political le for the bargain  Rename it St Andrews perhaps The withdrawal agreement is as unsellable to the DUP as it is unchangeable for the EU. Mays promise to stand downher deal passes could be the longest resignation note in history. It is utterly irrelevant to the DUP. And the DUP do not fear a general election.Charting a way forward,the DUP does believe that UK-wide customs union and single market alignment to the EU solves the backstop conundrum, why not vote for it, rather than abstain,another opportunity arises For the DUP, its all about UKexit, not Brexit.Jon Tonge is Professor of Politics at the University of Liverpool and co-author of books on the Democratic Unionist Party and the Ulster Unionist Party"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed alevel league table for northern ireland catholic schools dominate top positions","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

setting of Castlederg Castle.The family friendly event hosted by Derry City and Strabane District Council is free admission and is set to bring together a host of the UK and Ireland’s top fly dressers, casters and top angling specialists.The fair will be open from am – pm each day of Saturday  and Sunday April  and will feature appearances and demonstrations as well as interactive opportunities for the public to get involved.The fair will host stalls from retailers and fly tying demonstrations while outside on the Derg River some of the best casters in the world will impart their wisdom through demonstrations.A special youth element entitled CATCHwill be hosted by the Loughs Agency where experienced and professional coaches will be on-hand to train new, novice and experienced young anglers in game, coarse and sea angling.Looking ahead to the event, Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Councillor John Boyle, encouraged local people to take advantage of the world class event on their doorstep and noted that it will attract thousands of visitors to the Council area.“I’d like to congratulate the Festival and Events team at Council for assembling a stellar line-up of special guests and an exciting programme of activities for the  North West Angling Fair,” he said.“This is the first time the fair has come to Castlederg which will allow us to showcase our angling offering not only to visitors to our Council area but also to local people who may be considering taking up fishing as a hobby.“The programme is family orientated and allows people of all ages to get involved and learn more about the art of angling and I’d encourage as many people as possible to come along and sample what it has to offer.”googletag.cmd.push

and Strabane District Council, Jacqueline Whoriskey, noted the Fair has something to suit all levels and tastes.“We are delighted to once again host the North West Angling Fair and bring it to the spectacular surroundings of Castlederg Castle, using the grounds of the St Eugene’s GAC and the Derg River,” she said. “Some of the biggest names in the angling world will be in attendance and there is a wide range of activities and demonstrations to choose from.“The event is free of charge but people can buy the best equipment and supplies for their fishing needs at the trade stands.“We are particularly excited about the CATCH Hub, hosted by the Loughs Agency, that will help inspire the next generation of anglers through short workshops covering casting, netting, fish identication, rover invertebrates, bait, lures, fly tying and safety and enable participants to achieve the CAST Angling Starter certicate.”Among the high calibre lineup in attendance at the fair will be well-known multiple world fly casting champions Hywel Morgan who will be demonstrating angling techniques and giving expert advice along with the likes of Robert Gillespie, Michael O’Kane and Stevie Munn.The exhibition area will offer the public the chance to browse and shop around for equipment from a wide range of local traders including Rodgers Fishing Tackle, The Bridge Gun and Tackle, River Mourne Gun and Tackle and The Great Outdoors.The ever popular Fly Tyers Row area will afford visitors the opportunity to watch fly dressers practice their craft and will include demonstrations from acclaimed tier Arthur Greenwood and local youngster Laoi Coyle.The full lineup for the North West Angling Fair is available at www.derrystrabane anglingfair.CAPTION:Local anglers get personal instruction from

It is vital our leisure services are made welcoming for our entire community.Council chairman Mark Murnin welcomed the move and said he was delighted that families with children with autism could enjoy the same facilities as families in Newry.Committee chairman Cllr Gareth Sharvin said he had raised the matter with the February meeting.The move was also welcomed by Rowallane councillors Billy Walker and Terry Andrews.The news has been welcomed by Downpatrick Autism Family Support Group which has been working with the council on the proposal.Group chair Aacuteine Sloan welcomed the move, saying ldquoit will now make this first class facility accessible to all.She added: ldquoIt will give local autism families the opportunity to use the pool and feel more relaxed alongside other families that understand the struggles that may arise. I hope this is something that continues after the trail period.ldquoWe are also hopeful that the council will source fully qualied special needs swimming instructors soon too so our children can have the same opportunities as their peers..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballygowan business gains contract with leading aircraft firm  ","story":"AIRCRAFT manufacturer Dornier Seawings has contracted Ballygowan precision engineering company McGreevy Engineering to machine parts for its iconic Seastar amphibious aircraft,.Dornier rose to prominence in the s and s as a manufacturer of large, all metal flying boats.The Seastar, designed in Germany, is engineered to operate from runway and water surfaces allowing for short field take-off and landing capabilities.Representatives from the local company met initially with Dornier Seawings at the Farnborough Airshow last July and subsequently gained a number of contracts.The Ballygowan firmrsquos managing director, Aaron McGreevy, said it was very pleased to be working with Dornier Seawings, a multicultural and multi-national joint venture between the Dornier family and two fully state-owned Chinese enterprises.ldquoGiven our recent investment to ersy our capabilities this is great news indeed, said Mr McGreevy.ldquoThe Dornier brand has a heritage of a pioneering spirit.

A Rhys OrsquoDonnell box kick was marginally long and carried back with interest before quick hands from Crosbie put his winger in for a superb try.The conversion left the game in the balance at -.The home side continued to dominate possession and territory and a Reaney penalty following a great breakdown turnover from skipper Aaron Cairns gave them a little breathing space.Old Belvedere, despite showing admirable invention, were guilty on occasion of overplaying and a series of errors meant they were pinned back in their own half.The bonus point score went to Cronin who drove over the line when Adair was held up just short and with  minutes to go Hinch looked certain of victory at -.A superb defensive effort then kept their Dublin opponents at bay in relative comfort until the th minute when the pressure eventually led to an overlap to leave the away side in with a chance of a draw as the game reached its final moments.However, in their desperation to run the ball out of defence and keep the game alive, Old Belvedere conceded a penalty which Reaney knocked over to clinch the win.That should have been the end of proceedings, but a penalty from a scrum led to another Belvo charge and they were awarded another penalty which Crosbie slotted with the last kick of the game to take two points back to Dublin.Ballynahinch continue their winning run and stand level with Old Wesley at the top of the table with two games to go.Ballynahinch Old Belvedere AIL DIVISION B.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Best friends laid to rest after accident  ","story":"BEST friends Shane McAnallen and Martin Patterson were buried side by side on Saturday.The two men in their twenties died together in a car crash on the Carlingford to Omeath Road in the early hours of Monday, March .It is believed they died at the scene and that no other vehicle was involved.Mr McAnallen was from the Castlewellan area and Mr Patterson was from Bryansford.Their tragic deaths, and that of missing Newcastle woman Ruth Maguire who also died in Carlingford over the St Patrickrsquos holiday weekend, left the community numb with grief.A community candlelight vigil was held in Carlingford on Sunday night which was attended by representatives from the deceasedrsquos families and rescue and emergency services.All three were connected to Bryansford GAC mdash the young men were former under-age players while mother of three Ms Maguire was the clubrsquos under-age coach.Mr Patterson also played for a time with Ballynahinch RFC U-s.He and Ms Maguire were also connected to St Maryrsquos Primary School in Newcastle.Ms Maguirersquos children attend the school and she was active in the St Maryrsquos Parent Support Group while Mr Patterson was a fondly remembered past pupil of the school.Ms Maguire was also known through her work as a casual leisure attendant at Newcastle Centre and also as a nursing assistant at Daisy Hill Hospital in Newry.The  year-old had been reported missing from a group of friends on a hen night while there were out socialising in Carlingford on Saturday.An extensive land and sea search was carried out on Sunday.On Monday, her body was recovered from the lough around the same time as the deaths of the young men became public.Mr McAnallen and Mr Patterson, also known as Marty Patt to friends, were laid to rest in separate ceremonies with many local people attending both services.A funeral for Mr McAnallen was held in St Malachyrsquos Church in Castlewellan early on Saturday morning.

local councils are being encouraged to provide financial support for the Air Ambulance Northern Ireland.The appeal has been issued by Rowallane councillor Billy Walker, who last month secured across-the-board political support from his Newry, Mourne and Down Council colleagues to provide funding to the service which plays a critical role across the district.It has been revealed that between August  and November last year, the air ambulance responded to  incidents across the council area.ldquoThe air ambulance is vital for people across the district, given its rural nature and attractions like the Mournes and Strangford Lough, Cllr Walke rsaid.The Rowallane politician recently visited the air ambulancersquos base outside Lisburn where he was joined by two of his party colleagues from Mid Ulster and Derry and Strabane Councils, both of which have agreed to provide financial support for the lesaving service.With three local authorities already on board, Cllr Walker hopes that the remaining eight Northern Ireland councils will provide financial support.He said while Stormont funds the air ambulance crew, medicines and medical equipment, it should be picking up the remainder of the servicersquos running costs.He confirmed that Strangford MP Jim Shannon plans to raise this issue with Department of Health Permanent Secretary, Richard Pengelly.ldquoDown District is already a main user of the air ambulance service which has already helped save a number of lives, Cllr Walker continued.ldquoThe service relies heavily upon donations to help meet the servicersquos poundm annual running costs and while this is welcome, I believe local councils and indeed the Department of Health needs to do more.Cllr Walker says while the air ambulance relies heavily upon public support, it also needs a sustainable funding stream to ensure it can continue to save lives and hopes this will be provided by the Department of Health.ldquoThe service is a key component of the emergency services and should not have to rely on charitable donations, he continued.ldquoGiven the costs to keep the service in the air, I believe all of the Provincersquos  councils, supported by the government department, have a role to play.Cllr Walker, who was recently made aware of the excellent work of the air ambulance when the crew responded to an emergency in Killyleagh when a woman was involved in an accident in Plantation Street, confirmed that Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos financial contribution to the service will be agreed at a meeting of its efficiencies working group.He added: ldquoThe air ambulance is an excellent service which all of Northern Ireland is fortunate to have and it is important that we continue to support its

the iconic sweeping beam at St Johnrsquos Point Lighthouse near Killough is seeking a meeting with local politicians.The Lecale Lightkeepers want to meet face-to-face with Newry, Mourne and Down councillors to spell out why the beam must be retained and why the proposed LED replacement suggested by the Dublin-based Commissioner of Irish Lights is totally inadequate and unacceptable.Campaigners have also submitted a Freedom of Information request to the local authority for copies of all correspondence between the councilrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Department and the Commissionerrsquos office on the lighthouse issue.Last month, the local authority was heavily criticised for excluding the press and public from a meeting mdash billed as a workshop mdash involving councillors and representatives from the Commissionerrsquos office, including its most senior official, Captain Robert McCabe.The council subsequently confirmed the workshop, held at the local authorityrsquos headquarters in Downpatrick, was a ldquopreliminary information session for councillors and that prior to any plans being finalised or put in place for the future of the lighthouse, a wide ranging public consultation would take place.The workshop lasted well over one hour but the report from the behind-closed-doors session which has been sent to councillors amounts to a paltry two and a half lines.Signicantly, the paper does not detail the questions put by councillors or, most importantly the response from Commissioner officials, compounding the frustration of those seeking to retain the beam.They are angry that the council report provides no detail whatsoever of what was discussed and simply states the issue of the lighthouse beam will be raised at district electoral forums across the district.Campaigners insist that as the Commissioner of Irish Lights had the opportunity to put its case before councillors, it is only right and proper and in keeping with equality legislation and good old fashioned fairness, that the Lecale Lightkeepers should be afforded the same opportunity.The campaigners have been exchanging correspondence with council officials and described one response confirming the sweeping beam issue will be discussed at ious district electoral forums with a view to having a joint meeting with Captain McCabe, which the public could also attend, as ldquodismissive and derogatory.The Lecale Lightkeepers have also vehemently rejected the councilrsquos view that a joint DEA meeting to put questions directly to representatives of the Commissioners of Irish Lights would be the ldquomost appropriate forum to address the issues they have raised.A spokesperson for the campaign group said councillors were keen to protect the iconic, sweeping beam, describing plans to remove the mercury bearing which rotates the Fresnel lamp due to health concerns as ldquoflimsy and flawed.They have also rejected claims that a new LED light proposed by the Commissioners would be the same, arguing this ldquosimply isnrsquot true.Campaigners say it is their understanding that some councillors are at a complete loss as to why the local authority is denying them a chance to meet all of the councilrsquos  members to state their case.They say Commissioners were in Downpatrick last month because councillors voted unanimously to invite them for a meeting to discuss the controversial plan to replace the sweeping beam with what, in their view, is a much inferior light.ldquoThe irony of what is happening is not lost on us, said the spokesperson for the campaign group.ldquoCouncillors discuss the issue of the sweeping beam and unanimously agree that it should be retained. They propose to meet with the Commissioners which happens but yet when campaigners ask to meet with all the districtrsquos elected representatives at one time, we are denied this opportunity. Why The spokesperson added: ldquoWe hope councillors will demand a detailed account of the recent workshop so the views of the Commissioners can be critically examined and scrutinised by not only campaigners, but elected representatives, to determinethey are accurate.ldquoIf, in our opinion they are not, we should be given an opportunity to refute them in front of councillors who were elected to represent the people of this district and who are accountable to them.ldquoIf changes are made at St Johnrsquos Point Lighthouse, the historic character of the sweeping beam will be lost forever. We must all stand together and ensure this does not happen. What is being offered by the Commissioner is inferior to what we currently have.A council spokesman said officers from the the Commissioner of Irish Lights will be invited to future meetings of the districtrsquos respective DEA Forums.He explained this is to ensure that information can be shared and that local stakeholders and communities are fully consulted upon any proposals for St Johnrsquos Lighthouse in the immediate future before any plans are finalised.The spokesman added: ldquoRequests for details of future public consultations on plans for St Johnrsquos Point Lighthouse would be best addressed by the Commissioner of Irish Lights..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Crossgar food sauce firm in deal with Aldi  ","story":"PREP House Sauces in Crossgar has won its first business with discount retailer Aldi in the Republic of Ireland.Prep House is a family business which has won a string of national awards for its original sauces and dressings.Itrsquos now supplying its pepper sauce to Aldi for its network of  stores across the Republic.Managing director Paul Bell, who took over the management reins of the company in , described the new deal as ldquoa marvellous boost.ldquoThis very important business for us resulted when we swtly followed up a lead from Invest NIrsquos Drew McIvor, he added.ldquoOur approach was well received by the Aldi buyer who was extremely interested and very supportive.

The Down sharp shooters lost their way and tried their luck from distance. The result was aimless, wayward shooting.Louth, who deservedly led - to - at half time, made a decisive burst with eight unanswered points either side of the break.Full forward Sam Mulroy bagged half their tally, all five of his points coming from frees, during that purple patch, with midfielders James Calfand Tommy Durnin also registering.With  minutes to go Louth led - to - and then came the Down revival, led by Darren OrsquoHagan who scored a goal and a point.The goal came after Donal OrsquoHarersquos initial shot was brilliantly kept in by Connaire Harrison. The ball fell to OrsquoHagan, who dummied and then fired his shot into the net.Harrison,who looked impressive,registered a great point and when Paul Devlin and then OrsquoHagan also pointed, the gap was down to a single score.Down, who had mounted a number of successful comebacks during the campaign, looked as though they were going to mount another great escape.But it was not to be.

I am confident that the completed public realm scheme will signicantly enhance the ambitious plans to develop a new retail and commercial centre at this part of Downpatrick.It was confirmed recently that the former police base will not be bulldozed as part of the ambitious multi-million pound plan to regenerate this part of the town.The building mdash which enjoys protected status mdash is to remain a key feature of the proposed redevelopment project which, in addition to new retail and commercial space, could also include an element of housing provision.Council officials insist the former police basersquos listed building status is not an impediment to the development of the site and view preserving the former station as an opportunity and a challenge, insisting it very much remains part of the overall development project and potentially could be utilised as an attractive entrance feature.To date, senior retailers including Marks and Spencer and Home Bargains have expressed an interest in opening new premises at the proposed retail complex which will be built on a huge area of land stretching back as as far as St Patrickrsquos Avenue.A council spokeswoman confirmed yesterday that while the public realm works were scheduled to complete on March , a utilities company was required to undertake work in Irish Street before the public realm contractor was able to get on site.She added: ldquoDue to unforeseen circumstances experienced by the utilities company on site which required their attention, it resulted in a delay to the completion date of the overall public realm scheme.

He said that in addition to the trauma of suddenly losing a young child, they now faced the added pressure of having to have their child flown to England for post-mortem.Mr McGrath said it was his understanding that the issue impacted on around  families a year, highlighting the importance of doing everything possible for families.ldquoThere are a number of considerations here, suggested Mr McGrath. ldquoWe have to consider the period of time to conclude the post-mortem andthe child to their family for burial.ldquoI am very heartened to hear that the present model involving Liverpool is maintaining the turnaround times. What is also of the utmost importance is supporting the childrsquos family and I am glad to hear that there are bereavement support teams here for families.Mr McGrath added: ldquoThis is not going to be an easy process, however what is absolutely vital is that we get the right long term solution and my colleagues and I will be pressing the government department for that.ldquoCllr Trainor and I met departmental officials to ascertain how we can progress matters for the peace of mind of families here.Explaining the background to sending babies to Liverpool for post-mortem, Cllr Trainor said the paediatric pathologist who was involved in carrying out these procedures in Belfast moved from his current post and there was no one available to fill the position.ldquoFrom our meeting, it is apparent that there is a shortage here of paediatric pathologists and this is why the link with Liverpool has been implemented as a short term solution, he said.Cllr Trainor added: ldquoThe Department of Health is also looking at the possibility of an all island approach. However, such a process would take some time to develop as we look at the possibility of a standardised level of care between north and south.Local health campaigners are also seeking a meeting with senior health chiefs to discuss the issue of child post-mortems being held in Liverpool.The Down Community Health Committee believes thatpriority was given to funding and enticement for the training of pathologists, post-mortems could continue to be carried out on a regional basis.At one of its recent meetings, Mrs Anne Trainor, suggested that the possibility of pathologists travelling to Northern Ireland periodically from England, Scotland, Wales and further afield could be considered.She described the decision to perform post-mortems in Liverpool as ldquosickening and immoral and argued health officials should have done more to continue the service.Mrs Trainor added: ldquoFor women who have had a miscarriage or whose baby dies, it is the single worst thing that is ever going to happen in your le.ldquoYou will lose parents, aunts and uncles, husbands and wives, but you will never experience the pain and heartbreak of losing a child. For health officials to suggest that a child is wrapped up like a package and sent across the water for a post mortem is cruel.

But until now Mr Corbyn has said that he is strongly opposed to the nature of thebackstop.Last July, when askedhe could guarantee there would be no Irish backstop in a Labour-negotiated Brexit deal, Mr Corbyn told Euronews: “There certainly wouldn’t be a backstop from which you can’t escape.”Speaking in  Downing Street after a marathon session of Cabinet lasting over seven hours, Mrs May said that any further delay to Brexit should be “as short as possible”.She said a bill to pave the way for departure would have to be in place by May  to ensure the UK did not have to take part in European Parliament elections.Any new proposal would have to accept the Withdrawal Agreement and focus on amendments to the Political Declaration on the future EU UK relationship, she said.Setting out her plan for talks with Mr Corbyn, Mrs May said: “The ideal outcome of this process would be to agree an approach on a future relationship that delivers on the result of the referendum, that both the leader of the Opposition and I could put to the House for approval and which I could then take to next week’s European Council.“However,we cannot agree on the single unied approach, then we would instead agree a number of options for the future relationship that we could put to the House in a series of votes to determine which course to pursue.“Crucially, the government stands ready to abide by the decision of the House. But to make this process work, the opposition would need to agree to this too.”\"  \"  Sister of murdered Lisa Dorrian in tearful appeal for information at scene of P.S.N.I. search for her body Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Standing at a lectern with the Government crest, before two Union flags, the Prime Minister added: “This is a decisive moment in the story of these islands and it will require national unity to deliver the national interest.”Mr Corbyn said: “We will meet the Prime Minister. We recognise that she has made a move, I recognise my responsibility to represent the people that supported Labour in the last election and the people who didn’t support Labour but nevertheless want certainty and security for their own future and that’s the basis on which we will meet her and we will have those discussions.”Ministers began their Cabinet meeting at .am, initially sitting in “political” session in the absence of civil servants. The meeting finally wound up shortly before pm, but ministers were held inside without access to their mobile phones while Mrs May prepared her statement.Mrs May said she believed that Britain “could make a success of no-deal in the long term”, but added: “Leaving with a deal is the best solution.”try catch  TrendingThree year-old missing N.I. boy is foundNI road closed after serious two vehicle collisionMulti-vehicle collision closes major NI roadDual carriageway closed after serious road traffic collisionlsquoAwesomersquo, lsquoExcellentrsquo and lsquoWonderfulrsquo -

The event ran from Saturday March  to Tuesday March .The Vale brewery Tomos and Lilford produced a special beer called ldquoCarnival - Penarth Pale Ale.Meanwhile the two Penarth butchers, Thompson Family Butchers and David Lush Butchers, both created their own special Penarth carnival sausages.The organisers estimated that more than  people took part in costume in the walk through town on Saturday, which saw the coronation of the lsquoFirst Foolrsquo at am. The procession marched from Sully Terrace through town.At .am in Penarth Library, there was a presentation of the head of Bendigeidfran, from The Mabinogion. The head was made by children from Cogan and Penygarth schools.The lsquoFirst Foolrsquo was then sent by train to the Tower of London to bring news of the Carnival to the traditional resting place of the head of Bendigeidfran, where he met the Raven Master.Long distance cyclist Dave Hann was due to cycle to Harlech, north Wales to raise money for the RNLI Penarth, and bring news to Harlech that Carnival had broken out in Penarth.Unfortunately Mr Hann only got as far as Cardigan before Storm Freya made it too dangerous to continue. Organisers have one barrel of carnival ale left and will take it to Harlech by train in the next few weeks to share it and the storybook of the carnival.On Sunday, two rugby teams took part in a ldquotug-o-sausage to decide which butcherrsquos sausage was better. Congratulations were extended to the winners, Team Thompson.Congratulations were also extended to the traders Ener-chi and Lilypad by the organisers, for having the best-dressed shop windows. Particular praise was singled out for the carnival flowers at Holm House Hotel created by Lilypad.Further nights of partying, songs and dancing were spotted in the Albion, St Faganrsquos Castle, and other pubs, bars and venues across Penarth. There were also celebrations on the Penarth Pier on Tuesday night following a Pancake Day event, while wandering bands of musicians like Wonderbrass kept spirits high.The festival culminated in a grand Mardis Gras party on Tuesday, which saw crowds of costumed residents dance the night away.Richard Parry, one of the carnival organisers, said: ldquoToday is Ash Wednesday, the beginning of Lent. Carnival finished last night on Mardi Gras.ldquoThanks to everyone who took part, contributed, encouraged, sponsored, smiled and partied, especially those people who took a carnival Bank Holiday Monday.ldquoIt was fabulous to hear your Carnival Bank Holiday stories, and to all those people who have had little private carnival moments of joy over the festival, thatrsquos what it has all been about.ldquoAnd some people have already said, lsquosee you next year!rsquoldquoThere were lots of people laughing and smiling on the sidelines, telling me they wanted to take part next year ndash just with a little more notice next time. But now itrsquos established, wersquoll be back next year and ready for even more people to join in the fun! article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Wersquore creating work which is not really necessary.If we want to improve the gateway there are other ways of doing it.ldquoIt really doesnrsquot begin to tackle the active travel . I do feel this is about spending the money before next February.Councillors were told the widened roundabout was one part of a wider strategy for transport improvements in Penarth.Charlotte Pugh, senior planner for the council, said the new scheme would transform the area.She said: ldquoThis whole are is going to be completely transformed. At the moment it is not very welcoming to pedestrians.ldquoI think it will go some way to transforming this gateway into Penarth and make it a safer environment.Previous plans to make part of Plassey Street one-way to incoming traffic, and removing the roundabout altogether, were dropped following opposition from the public.The committee agreed to endorse the transport scheme but requested regular updates on the wider transport plans for Penarth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Itrsquos their futures that wersquore concerned about here and they were absolutely right to do what they did.And then of course the Brexit shambles continues ndash we cannot escape it ndash but we were debating it again last week, with hugely important votes to come next week.But last week was a signicant one. The PM was forced into a corner, forced to concede that she might have to rule out No Deal and extend Article , and the Labour Party came out decisively for putting this issue back to the people.And this week we saw the Government attempt to win over MPs with a fund it claims will boost less well-off towns after Brexit ndash but in another shambolic aspect to this hapless attempt to bribe MPs into voting for Theresa Mayrsquos so-called deal, there is no cash for Welsh towns.Another example of the Tories letting Wales down, and yet further reason to support the push for a final say on Brexit for the public through a Peoplersquos Vote. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Last month I met with constituents over disruption to local rail services. I know that many of you will have experienced delays and cancellations to services in the weeks following the handover of the Wales Rail Franchise. I understand and share the frustration that these delays have caused. There has been a shortage of rolling stock as a result of a large maintenance backlog following the handover of the franchise together with planned changes to rail services. This has led to a signicant reduction in services and replacement bus services. I have been in contact with the Minister for Transport and Transport for Wales to raise the concerns of constituents. I have been assured that service levels are now back to normal and they do not anticipate any restrictions to services in the coming year. I will of course maintain my interest to see that those assurances are kept. I will update residents again on future plans to deliver improved station facilities, trains and more regular services.As many of you are aware Cardf Bus has recently announced changes to bus services across Cardf and the Vale. A number of bus routes are at risk as part of these changes. The removal of bus links for work, social links and public services, including hospital routes, would have a signicant impact on my constituents.Cardf Bus are not acting to deliberately hurt our communities. Far from being an uncaring organisation Cardf Bus are stuck with a legal framework that stops them from operating on the same basis as commercial competitors. Competitors can cherry pick and target single profitable routes that undermine the wider social propose that most of us want from local bus services. Cardf Councilrsquos Labour leadership has committed to supporting at risk bus services for  years. Unless the Conservative leadership of the Vale Council agrees to Labour councillors amendments to the budget and protects local bus services in the Vale then bus routes will go. The Vale Council leadership could and should act. If they donrsquot then my constituents will suffer.In future, the regulation of buses is the answer. London was the only part of the UK that was allowed to keep a regulated bus service. It is no mistake that it has the best and most coherent service. We now have the legislative powers to regulate bus services here in Wales. The Welsh Government is currently consulting on proposals to reform bus and taxi services in Wales. More information on the consultation can be found at: https:beta.gov.wales improving-public-transport. The consultation closes on th March ndash please do get in touch and take part. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Now, the bridge has several operational regulations like alarm levels ndash we canrsquot balance the high level of noise needed for a bridge and the low level needed for a residential area. This is the reality that the council have to consider and resolve.A Vale of Glamorgan Council spokesman said: ldquoThe swing bridge is maintained and operated by Quay Marinas, who manage the Penarth Quays Marina site.ldquoIt was closed due to a number of safety concerns, with upgrades needed before it can be reopened, including audible warnings.ldquoThe council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report following which our health and safety officers and those from Quay Marinas will discuss possible solutions which may enable the bridge to be reopened in the future. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

[]js  djs.id  idjs.src  \"embed.playbuzz \"fjsThe Prime Minister has already staked her future on the passing of the withdrawal agreement, saying to backbenchers she will quit ahead of the next stage of the Brexit negotiations provided her deal passes.This means the country is likely to see a Conservative Party leadership contest or a general election, and a new Prime Minister. Bookies have May and June as the most likely months for a general election, with May at   and June at  . Who are the favourites Michael Gove, Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt lead the polls for the Conservative Party hopefuls. Mr Gove is the bookies favourite at   and is seen by many to be a good choice to take charge of the next stage of the Brexit process. Conservative MPs would need to forget his betrayal of Boris Johnson in the  leadership race when he ran against Mrs May instead of supporting the former Mayor of London.Boris Johnsons stock is still high in the party, with many seeing him as the obvious hard Brexit choice from outside the cabinet. However, his time as Foreign Secretary and Mayor of London was prone to gaffes, and the Brexit bus still sticks in the memory of many voters.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is third favourite according the bookies, and would need a similar surge at the polls as the party had in  to challenge for a majority.As the longest-serving Health Secretary, Jeremy Hunt is seen as a safe pair of hands for the top role and backs a harder Brexit than other cabinet colleagues. This stance and his reputation could edge him ahead of the likes of Sajid Javid, Amber Rudd, and Matt Hancock.The long shotsMatt Hancock has publicly backed Mrs Mays deal throughout and is considered part of the next generation of Conservative talent and could be a dark horse.

Which makes it even more impressive that, in that time, he’s also managed to start and scale up one of the great business success stories in Northern Ireland, David Meade Events. Known for his skills as a mentalist and speaker, David also runs the company which delivers cutting-edge corporate events, learning and development workshops, and offers keynote speaking services. It has achieved double figure growth every year since its establishment in  working not only in UK and Irish markets, but also internationally. Asked how he had ersied into events and keynote speaking from being an on-stage mentalist, David says: “I’ve actually been delivering events and keynote speeches very successfully in the UK and Ireland for a number of years, but I suppose most people know me for my tours and the more corporate side of my business was lesser known. “I moved into this space roughly seven years ago because I love inspiring and motivating people and it was a natural move to work with companies who want to inspire their teams to be innovative and the best they can be.” David believes there are even more opportunities outside our region and this year the company is investing over £, to take advantage of them. This includes investing in new video learning services, enabling people to access David’s bespoke training services remotely, from wherever they are in the world. “Over the last number of years, the company has grown at a phenomenal rate and this latest investment was a no-brainer because we simply had to respond to that growth.” David says: “We are still based in Northern Ireland, but there is a huge untapped market that we want to explore further. The world is getting smaller because of technology and we want to meet the challenge and work with people all across the globe. So far in  we have contracts in  countries, including Dubai, Singapore and Switzerland and many more are in the pipeline.” David’s list of international clients reads like a who’s who of the biggest and most impressive organisations in the world including Apple, Hard, Mercedes Benz, Adobe, Bank of America, Coca-Cola, British Airways and Canon. David attributes his company’s success and ability to attract such high-level clients to its ability to adapt and innovate in response to the market. “If the uncertainty of today’s marketplace teaches us anything, it’s that you must evolve and that’s what we’re doing – keeping up with the ever-changing market and meeting the ever-increasing demands, both in Northern Ireland and across the globe.” One of the company’s most exciting innovations has been the development of a bespoke in-house video production studio. This has greatly enhanced its capacity to produce media projects for its clients. Allowing clients to access the bespoke training remotely means the firm can compete all over the globe. This view of the company, as competing on an international stage, is a vital part of David’s approach to business and informs the business decisions he makes, including this recent quarter of a million-pound investment. He explains “The investment in our video learning service means we can deliver training to clients in any corner of the world, at any time. Thinking of ourselves as part of a global economy, rather than just the Northern Ireland economy has been key to shting the company up a gear.” He has grown to a team of  and this year the company is expected to achieve a turnover of £m, an impressive milestone for any company but something David considers not a destination or even a point to slow down, but simply a  to push on to bigger and better things. “As the company continues to thrive and grow every year, I find myself looking at new and innovative ways to keep up with demand. Hitting that £m milestone will be energising and whilst I’m proud of the work my team have done here, I’m already thinking ‘OK, what’s next ’ With this investment, our ability to evolve and the international demand for the services we provide, there’s so much more we can do.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/sto1.jpg","title":"stormont departments compiling emergency no deal brexit contingency list","story":"Posted on Wednesday  March  by John Mulgrew Stormont departments are building a key list of emergency contacts across business and the wider sectors amid contingency planning for a ‘no deal’ Brexit, Ulster Business can reveal. It’s understood departments have begun contacting companies, organisations and business groups as part of “Brexit contingency” ‘no deal’ planning, in order to “locate someone who can assist them in normal working hours and out of hours”. An email seen by Ulster Business, sent by the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs , says in the event of a ‘no deal’ scenario “time will be of the essence and identying the correct people to help solve any problems or issues in a very short space of time will be critical”. It’s understood the Department for the Economy and the Department for Infrastructure have also made contact. A Northern Ireland Civil Service spokesman told Ulster Business: \"Since the UK Referendum, the Northern Ireland Civil Service has engaged in a signicant programme of work which covers a range of issues that arise as a consequence of the UK leaving the EU. \"Over recent months, there has been a greater focus on no deal planning across government, including the contingency plans that would be necessary in the event of a no deal outcome. \"The Northern Ireland Civil Service has been engaged in this process and plans have been developed on a ‘reasonable worst case scenario’ basis. \"These contingency plans are under constant development as we continue to engage with key stakeholder groups and partners in government.

Now, George Lowden has taken the biggest step in his career and paired up with a global superstar to develop an instrument for the masses, writes John Mulgrew If you first began making guitars as a boy in Bangor, it’s perhaps not surprising that after  years your instruments are among the greatest in the world. Now, George Lowden’s journey has taken its biggest step in decades – teaming up with one of the world’s biggest pop stars to produce a range of more affordable instruments George’s guitar-making story has taken many turns in the last few decades, from making small numbers himself, to larger-scale production and outsourcing, before moving to his current Downpatrick home and building some of the most beautul and acoustically rich-sounding instruments. They are regularly in the hands of people like English folk hero Richard Thompson and Pierre Bensusan, but have also graced the stage along arguably one of the greatest players of a six-string instrument, Eric Clapton. In fact, the former Cream and Bluesbreakers man took to the stage at the Grammy’s in  with a Lowden – forgoing the Martins which he had, and has, used throughout his career. But the next step in the Lowden journey came something out of the left field for many in the industry, and players alike. George and managing director Ausdahl took to the NAMM show in Anaheim, Calornia alongside Ed Sheeran – collaborating on a more affordable range of instruments. The most interesting part of that, from a production perspective, is the guitars will still be made in Northern Ireland, while the majority of the big US makers outsource production of cheaper ranges. “It all started about five years ago with Gary Lightbody when he was using my guitars,” George told Ulster Business. “I made one for Ed Sheeran. I thought, he uses small guitars and we don’t have them. “So, I decided to design one. I went up to the north coast and spent about a week there – thinking and drawing, and designed what is now the Wee Lowden.” After that, Ed used the guitar for recording, and it spurred on a relationship with the instruments which led to the new partnership. “I definitely didn’t want to outsource the production, having had experience of that in the s, with licensing there are limitations – particularly when it comes to quality control and design. “I decided,we do this, we are going to do it here. The challenge of course, is salaries and productionare higher than the Far East, for example. I had confidence that because of the tech available – the careful marriage between hi-tech processes, and more traditional hand processes.” “One of the interesting things is,you examine guitar-making worldwide, in the Far East the processes tend to be more hand made, because labour costs are very low. “In the US, the processes are more machine orientated. I wanted to develop some ground-breaking processes, which I think will be taken up by other companies in due course, but also keep some of the very important hand processes, most importantly hand carving the internal bracing system.” For acoustic guitars, the bracing inside the instrument is one of the keys to the overall tone of the instrument, along with the wood selection – and resonance – and the quality of the build, parts and set up. “That’s not a small challenge for us. We have to train young people to use sharp chisels. But I have found in the past, people have reasonable hand-to-eye co-ordination, so can pick it up quickly.” And from the volume perspective, George says he’s already pre-sold three quarters of the first year of production. That’s starting off at around , instruments a year, but growing that “considerably higher” in year two. Speaking about the burgeoning relationship between George and Ed Sheeran, managing director David Ausdahl, says it was a meeting of minds which focused on simplying design while retaining high build quality and tone. “There was a trecta of requirements. Not compromising on quality, doing it here and making it accessible to a whole new market and a whole new price point. George never moved out of that space. “We have had unprecedented demand. People were coming across the standand some hadn’t previously known the company. It gives them an introduction to a new market. “Young people are able to get engaged with the guitar, and make music.” If you aren’t familiar with the existing handmade Lowden range, prices start at around £,, while guitars using more exotic woods and parts can quickly rise to the cost of a small hatchback. But George is kicking off the new Sheeran by Lowden range at less than £. “We realised, for young people, that a price point of say £, is what most young people aspire to. One of our aims, both Ed and I realised, all too often, young people who want to take up guitar and write songs. They buy a guitar which is the best they can afford. But it’s uninspiring, has a hard tone and is dficult to play – far too many of them would just give up. “we could produce a guitar, that doesn’t have the cosmetics, butwe can make one that sounds really good, at an affordable price, something worthwhile.” To keep costs down, Lowden has cherry-picked production priorities, retaining hand made work for areas such as the internal bracing. “We also clearly did not want the two ranges to encroach in others territory.” He says existing players have already taken an interest in getting their hands on the new Sheeran by Lowden instruments. “From a commercial point of view, it’s a large market but obviously it is more competitive than the high end market Lowdens. I personally have to be very proud of what we do, and I feel, as long as I’ve done my job, I feel confident it’ll be a great success.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/gas_1.jpg","title":"work to start on m ni gas scheme","story":"Posted on Monday April  by Ulster Business A proposed £m natural gas storage facility in Co Antrim has taken a step forward after an engineering design firm was appointed to the scheme, it has been revealed.InfraStrata wants to build the facility at Islandmagee.

We have a business that has very much enjoyed its own expansion and we want to shine a light on our next generation of young professionals”.According to Susan Dunlop, that’s a well refined mantra at GMcG Chartered Accountants. Susan is one of seven directors at GMcG, having joined the firm more than  years ago and who now heads up the firm’s Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Part of planning for the future has been the recent appointment of a new director in Audit and Business Advisory Services, together with an associate director who will head up the firm’s Corporate Finance department. Both are signicant investments at management level and a reflection of the firm’s growth and ambition across its three offices.“As a leading independent accountancy firm, many of our key strengths lie in our ability to get things done, through local decision making, management and accessibility of our people” Susan says.Accessibility is regularly acknowledged as being of great value to the firm’s clients and has become a key component of how the firm does business.“Business owners know they can lt the phone and speak to any of our directors, at any time of the day. For us, that’s just part of our client service, but our clients expect it and they know it can make a huge dference to getting an issue resolved quickly and effectively, allowing them to get on with running their business.”As local businesses face uncertainty and challenges across many fronts, Susan and the management team recognise the importance of being positioned as the complete business advisor and having the expertise, understanding and experience to deliver. “Businesses evolve through dferent circumstances and with dferent requirements. We need to be one step ahead, providing the right expertise at the right time. GMcG can offer this expertise through our service lines which include Audit and Business Advisory, Tax, Forensic Accounting and Investigation, Corporate Finance, GMcG Digital and International liaison, through our TIAG membership.” The firm delivers these services though a team of more than  employees across three offices in Belfast, Lisburn and Portadown. Having initially operated as independent firms in each locationthe GMcG evolution was completed in  when the three firms merged completely under a single GMcG brand. This was a signicant investment and transition for the firm.Gill Johnston, director at GMcG Portadown, says: “It was vital that we didn’t lose focus on the profile and client relationships we had developed over many years in each location. “So we are delighted with the success of the transition and how the shared systems and expertise are adding real value to client service delivery across each location”. GMcG services a broad client base from sole traders to large corporates, including a erse range of businesses and private iniduals, public and not-for-profit sector entities, as well as legal and other professional services practices.For Susan and the rest of the team, the firm’s independence and longstanding client relationships are what bolster the firm’s success.“We have a loyal and growing client base and are particularly proud of the fact that many of these relationships go back decades or transcend generations. We advise many of these clients on succession planning, helping them develop their business through the next stage of its journey. “In our experience, all of this is underlined by the importance of investing in client relationships, getting to know the client’s business, their issues, opportunities and the type of expertise they need.“It can be a long term effort and something that often demands dedication beyond a nine to five working day. But we always view it as a rewarding investment, especially when we see our clients thrive and grow.”As part of the firm’s growth and expansion, GMcG has undergone major investment in its overall strategy, its people, IT systems and recruitment.With no shortage of drive and ambition, it’s very much a case of ‘been there, done that’ for GMcG, having themselves undergone restructuring, appointed new directors, undertaken signicant investment, experienced dynamic growth and transitioned seamless succession planning.“We have done it ourselves, and been through it all,” Susan says. “We have grown our firm and understand many of the challenges and opportunities facing SME clients with real aspirations or plans for business development we have that insight and experience that has really proved valuable in advising many of these clients.”Building on these foundations, the firm today has a strong focus on developing the next generation of its service team. A younger generation of professional advisors are moving up the ranks in the firm, with other new faces joining the expanding management team.Nigel Moore, who started with the firm back in  as a trainee, has been appointed director in the Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Director Stephen Houston also started his career as a trainee and heads up GMcG’s Lisburn office.
