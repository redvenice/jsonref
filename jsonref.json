If you’re feeling more laid back, you can just hit the tub and let the world scurry on by.Lough Erne Resort, County FermanaghIf you’re after absolute luxury, why not go the whole hog? The sprawling, castellated Lough Erne Resort, housed on its own 243-hectare (600-acre) peninsula between the reedy shores of Lower Lough Erne and Castle Hume Lough, just outside Enniskillen, really is the last word in refinement.Starting your day with a choice between the resort’s two world-class golf courses sounds like our kind of dilemma: the Faldo course has been represented globally by local son Rory McIlroy, who holds the course record.For those who don’t have the golf bug, take heart: with an incredible Thai spa, world-class restaurants and access to the 40-mile-long splendour of Lough Erne, you’ll be fine.If it’s good enough to host the not-unpicky G8 summit (as it did in 2013), Lough Erne Resort is sure to satisfy your own exacting standards …And those who are after quality local food won’t need to look further than the resort’s Catalina restaurant, where guests can dine in luxury after a long day of exploring.Larchfield Estate, Lisburn, County AntrimIt’s fair to say Myrtle has been around for a while, seen a few tight squeezes, and is always ready with a warm welcome for her guests. Don’t worry, she’s not an over-friendly local – Myrtle is a lovingly-restored 1952 Saurer Swiss Army truck that now serves as one of Northern Ireland’s most inspiring glamping options at the gorgeous Larchfield Estate.The accommodation is suitably cosy and stylish, equipped with a log-burning stove, sun deck and a sauna housed in its own wooden pod with bucolic views of the surrounding greenery. Rise and shine after a night with Myrtle and set off to explore the 243-hectare (600-acre) estate. Mission accomplished.Killeavy Castle Estate, County ArmaghA gothic flight of fantasy built in 1836, Killeavy Castle is both grand and cosy: it features imposing medieval-style doors and turrets, yet the restored pile makes room for just four luxurious bedrooms within its castellated walls. Wake to the view from any of its 52 windows and you’ll feel like landed gentry.Elsewhere on the estate, the original mill, gatehouse and coach house have all been converted into stylish accommodation. There’s also a high-end spa, all on 142 hectares (350 acres) in the shadow of Slieve Gullion, the tallest mountain in County Armagh.Famed for its locally sourced food, Killeavy Castle Estate provides everything from sublime seven-course tasting menus to a famously good fry-up for breakfast.That’s your morning plans sorted.Palace Street Apartments, Derry-LondonderryPass through the famed city walls at the ornate Bishop’s Gate, then hang a sneaky left, and you’ll find yourself in a barely car-width street lined on one side by the kind of Victorian red brick you’d expect to see in an adaptation of Dickens.It’s also the very fitting home of the Palace Street Apartments, a lovingly restored, three-unit, self-catering gem. Step outside in the morning and you’ll find all of Derry-Londonderry at your feet. Within the confines of the old walled city, you’re only a stroll away from the historic Guildhall (as well-known for its political history as for its appearance in Derry Girls), St Columba’s Cathedral, where the original keys of the city are held, and the Diamond war memorial.That said, dark wood, oiled leather, antique furniture and deep beds come as standard in each apartment, making going outside an optional extra.Finn Lough, County FermanaghA lot has been written about the bubble domes at the eco-conscious Finn Lough resort in Fermanagh, but nothing can prepare you for the experience of waking snug and cosy in a luxury bed, and opening your eyes to see the dawn sky straight above you.These transparent domes offer uninterrupted views of the surrounding nature alongside high-end creature comforts: four-poster beds, ensuite bathrooms, and coffee machines to ease you into the morning the right way.Once you’ve recovered from the majesty of the morning there are woodland trails to explore, on foot or cycle, and a lake to linger by. There’s also a top-tier spa for those who aim simply to “sleep well, be pampered” – and who can blame them, when your bed is this spectacular?Come on over to Northern IrelandPlan your visit to Northern Ireland with everything you need to know about things to do, where to stay and more at irelandnorthern-irelandGet advice about travelling to Northern Ireland, including the latest information on Covid-19 restrictions at nidirect.gov.ukcoronavirus"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/345c28211f4ca1ea57842a60109e9d76c3d87992/0_116_6242_3745/master/6242.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b59877834e5319eb717de6309ac0365b","title":"surf cycle or hike go wild on northern irelands adventure coast","story":"Where can you hike along a world-heritage coastline, ride an Atlantic wave, then cycle around a puffin colony, all within a few miles of each other? The answer is along Northern Ireland’s Causeway CoastWhether you like to explore on foot, by bike or by water, Northern Ireland’s Causeway Coast could be the most scenic part of the UK you’ve never visited. Yet its natural attractions and ersity of landscapes make it perfect for anyone with an adventurous heart.Here we pick a few of Northern Ireland’s outdoor highlights, though the full range of opportunities extend far beyond what’s mentioned here. The best advice? Book a week and discover the possibilities for yourself.Explore by footAt the tip of Northern Ireland lies its most famous attraction – the Unesco world heritage site of the Giant’s Causeway. And there’s no better way to reach it than on foot, by following an eight-mile section of the Causeway Coast Way. Begin at picturesque Ballintoy Harbour, which Game of Thrones fans will recognise as a setting for the Iron Islands. Then head west along the signed coast path, passing sandy beaches, rock arches and a ruined clifftop castle before finishing at the Giant’s Causeway. The 40,000 interlocking basalt columns provide a fitting finale to one of the best walks in Northern Ireland.For something completely different, head to nearby Glenariff Forest Park. Set within the celebrated Glens of Antrim, the scenery here transports you to another world. Expect numerous waterfalls, wooden walkways deep within river gorges, and long-distance views along chiselled glacial escarpments. Signed hiking circuits of different lengths mean there’s a route for walkers of all abilities.Explore by bikeIf two wheels are your thing, Rathlin Island offers an outing that will remain etched in your memory for years to come. Lying six miles off the coast, the trip begins with a ferry ride from Ballycastle marina. You’ll need to bring your own bike due to Covid-19 restrictions, but the island can be explored in a few hours. The highlight is the eight-mile return trip to its western tip. Here the land ends in sheer cliffs that are home to both a lighthouse and Northern Ireland’s largest breeding seabird colony. There’s no better way to break your ride than descending to the RSPB viewing platform and, if you’re here at the right time of year – between April and August – watching the antics of hundreds of thousands of nesting birds. Regardless of when you visit, the views remain breathtaking all year round, and the sensual assault of sound and smell makes the trip back to the harbour feel positively peaceful.For a longer journey, back on the mainland try the signed cycle route between the Giant’s Causeway and Benone. This 22-mile trip can be completed in either direction, and follows a mixture of public roads and traffic-free paths. The ride takes you through the coastal towns of Portrush, Portstewart and Castlerock, with numerous opportunities to explore sandy beaches or stop for refreshments along the way.Explore by waterAnother great option is to leave the land altogether, and explore the unique coastline from the sea. This is a shore littered with caves, arches, tunnels and cliffs, and the only way to appreciate them fully is from the water.Sea kayaking is a great option, with several local companies providing all the equipment and guidance you need to begin weaving silently between the headlands. Choose from a half-day or full-day excursion, with incredible coastal scenery interspersed by a snack or lunch in some tucked-away cove along the way.If you’d prefer to embrace the waves then there’s the chance to try surfing instead – the neighbouring towns of Portrush and Portstewart are the twin meccas for local surfers. Hire a wetsuit and surfboard from the back of the beach, book into a lesson, then hit the waves. Whether you’re a beginner or a pro, you’re guaranteed a great time, with watery thrills and spills all part of the fun.Novices and experts are also welcomed by the local sailing centres. Take a lesson or join a skippered yacht for a longer adventure, spending anything from an hour to a whole weekend on the water. With the emphasis on guests doing as much of the sailing as possible, it won’t be long before you know your jib from your gybe.Something differentOf course the activities mentioned here just scrape the surface of what’s available, and with a little imagination almost anything is possible. How about a catch-and-sea boat trip, where you start by going sea fishing, then return to watch a professional chef prepare your bounty, garnished by other local delicacies?Or a horse ride, featuring a gentle hack through the glens or an adrenaline-filled canter across the beach? Organised scuba ing, coasteering it’s all here, with countless options to suit all ages and abilities.So what’s keeping you away? The Causeway Coast is a goldmine of activities and opportunities, its charms are just waiting to be discovered.Due to Covid-19 restrictions, the mini-bus tour, bird sanctuary and bike hire are not currently available, for more information visit: rathlincommunity.orghomeCome on over to Northern IrelandPlan your visit to Northern Ireland with everything you need to know about things to do, where to stay and more at irelandnorthern-irelandGet advice about travelling to Northern Ireland, including the latest information on Covid-19 restrictions at nidirect.gov.ukcoronavirus"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e1707f80c94d7f05b8fbc3891b951fb10d4c3fc/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d8c7f69c508572d7c858166c5f76249","title":"chadwick boseman black pride","story":"It was a thrill to see him in Black Panther. He reflected the ownership of self that white America still has a hard time embracingFor African-Americans, always braced for news about our own being taken from us early, the unexpected impact of Chadwick Boseman’s death, from colon cancer – and the shoulder-to-the-grindstone dignity of his decision to work through his illness and keep it quiet – encapsulated the grim reality of black life in America. We didn’t lose Boseman to the ongoing calamity of street violence that extinguishes so much black life – and gets so much media coverage that we have been conditioned to expect it. That’s what many of my friends said as we emailed and texted about the actor’s sudden passing.But what made Boseman’s death hard to take was that he’d made his breakthrough as a black actor playing adults, grown men who had to wrestle with their own expectations, as well as the diminished expectations others had for them. There was something in Boseman that understood the power of pride: his performances doubled as meditations on the allure and dangers of self-regard. That is what we responded to in him, especially as African Americans – whose pride can be maligned, treated as effrontery, and turned into a felony because it reflects the ownership of self that white America still has a hard time embracing. It’s the reason that race riots have peppered America’s history from the late 1800s to the present. (Our nation likes to pretend such upheavals are a new thing, or at least, part of the modern civil rights movement, but they precede that.)This is the journey of black culture, from the blues to hip-hop, from Lead Belly to Billie Holiday to Nipsey Hussle, the last two lost far too young. Because for so long, pride was the sole territory we could claim as African Americans. And Boseman massaged so many variations of that pride into the shoulders of the characters he acted.He could satirise pride, as he did in a small role as a street punk in the TV series Justified, when he made an entire comic turn from the bruised ego of having his car stolen by someone who was even more small time than him. Or he could show someone growing into it, as he did as Jackie Robinson in 42, when the dawning of that power and its effects on a nation – creating a tsunami of upraised-head happiness for the black fans and a tropical storm of resentment in fearful whites – have to be reckoned with.As an actor he was physically expressive – playing the young Thurgood Marshall, he took the temperature of a courtroom with a sly turn of the head. In Boseman’s portrayal, pride could also be a close-to-the-chest celebration, as Marshall pursued justice within a legal system that denied him the respect due an American citizen.Boseman made his A-list breakthrough in 42, in a genre that is often looked down upon – historical drama featuring black protagonists. Hollywood’s sense of pouty obligation about such films is telegraphed in the way they are advertised, with an almost audible sigh of “at least we tried …”Hugely resourceful, he had a wry, intense decency that communicated his pleasure and love of craft. That’s why it was such a thrill to see him as T’Challa in Black Panther, surrounded by such a richly gifted cast, any one of whom – Michael B Jordan, Daniel Kaluuya, Sterling K Brown, Forest Whitaker – could have played the title character. Boseman was so singular that not for a moment was he lost in such an assemblage of talent. (And if you’d followed him since programmes such as Lincoln Heights, your patience was rewarded.) Boseman’s Black Panther endured pride as if it were the five stages of grief, with the finality of acceptance feeling like enlightenment.He effortlessly pulled us into whatever state he was experiencing. As James Brown in Get on Up, his gaze shifted seamlessly from faintly amused twinkle to a flinty stare. We felt the weary misery in the supple but upright demeanour of an African king.What links all the firsts he played – baseball’s first, soul brother No 1, the lawyer on the way to being the first black supreme court justice, the first black Marvel character to get a big-budget movie (no one’s forgetting Blade here) – is that he embodied the awareness of a man who realised that he had to prove himself to himself, first and foremost.He played them all as people aspiring to move on to the next challenge, rather than taking shallow delight in accomplishments at hand. That intersection of joy and drive is still at the heart of African American achievement it’s the line that connects Ryan Coogler to Betye Saar. It’s using everything you have because part of you didn’t expect to get the chance it’s grabbing the next opportunity before it’s snatched away.But there was never anything hurried in Boseman’s pride, that eager grace at the heart of the actor and the man. That quality is what made me spend the night I got the news of his death listening to African American artists who died too young: Pop Smoke, dead at 20, with a voice that sounded a decade older, and whose mature work we’ll never hear or the tragedy of the sneaky-cool J Dilla, whose diminishing weight due to a combination of a rare blood disease TTP and lupus was uncomfortably visible in the last few years before his death of a rare blood disease at 32.Mostly, I thought of the exceptional jazz saxophonist Eric Dolphy, who died in 1964 in Berlin, at 36, after falling into a diabetic coma. He was a teetotaller who neither smoke nor drank, but doctors saw needle marks on his arms and assumed this black jazz musician was a junkie. But his transcendent desire for mastery was something he passed on to his listeners. On Friday night, I thought about the remarks attributed to Charles Mingus after Dolphy’s sudden death. When people die, Mingus said, we tend to remember just the good, but with Dolphy that was all there was to remember. That is also the legacy of Chadwick Boseman.• Elvis Mitchell is a film critic and broadcaster"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9badd696cf7250b942409a58df622affc1797640/0_289_4335_2601/master/4335.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=602a2b8c1e724b8e0c625a814c0ebe58","title":"teachers and parents across the uk share your thoughts on the reopening of schools","story":"We’d like to hear from people in England, Wales and Northern Ireland about returning to schools, and those in Scotland about how it has beenWith just weeks to go until children return to school in England and Wales, and less than a week until the first cohort of students in Northern Ireland return for the start of the new academic year, protective measures in schools remain fiercely contested.Many teachers have criticised the government’s ‘bubble’ group scheme and social distancing measures, while some unions have called for teachers to be able to choose to use face coverings, against government advice.We’d like to hear from teachers and parents about how they are preparing for the reopening of schools, and how they are feeling about it.If you are in Scotland, where schools are already open full-time, we’d also like to hear how it has been so far.We are particularly interested in hearing from parents about whether they will be sending their children back to school, and how they feel about possible fines for not doing so.You can get in touch by filling in the form below, anonymously if you wish.

There were 225 pieces of roadkill in total, including red-headed woodpeckers, painted terrapins and blue racer snakes – once-common species that are now rare. The paper, called The Toll of the Automobile, was the first study of “road ecology” – a growing area of research that looks at the many ways tarmac dissects habitats.In Britain, dead pheasants, foxes and badgers are common roadside sightings, but much of the environmental damage is hidden and hard to measure – roads fragment habitats and damage them through noise, chemical and light pollution. There are an estimated 28m miles (45m km) of paved roads on our planet, set to increase to about 43m miles by 2050, according to the International Energy Agency.Nearly 100 years after Stoner’s research, the first landscape-scale study to look at how roads affect birds suggests they cause “large-scale simplification of avian communities” in Britain. Roads are so ubiquitous that we often forget about their negative effect on wildlife, but the findings of the new study, published in Nature Communications, are a cause for major concern, says lead researcher Dr Sophia Cooke, an ecologist from Cambridge University.Researchers found that birds such as common gulls, pigeons and blackbirds, which are common in cities, are doing better along roads at the expense of rarer, specialist species, such as yellow wagtails and skylarks.Cooke says: “The first thing I spotted was that the birds that seemed to be in higher abundance around roads are all the birds that turn up to my feeder in the garden. They are the birds that come into towns and cities, so they clearly are presumably able to tolerate human disturbance more.”Birds that dislike roads have limited alternatives. Typically, we think of an “urban footprint” as belonging to towns and cities that feature a large number of buildings, but if the areas around roads are included in that definition, it would cover most of the country. If road-building continues, this could cause extinctions in the UK and other road-dense countries in the future, the study found.In Britain few natural, wild habitats remain, and scrubby bits of land alongside highways might therefore be an attractive place to settle for many birds – much better than surrounding agricultural land, or fully urban areas. Roads also provide grit and warmth. Scavengers such as red kites may benefit from picking up roadkill, and power lines and fences make useful perches. Litter also accumulates on verges, which could attract birds such as the common gull.That does not mean, however, that these species are benefiting from their proximity to roads. A study of roadkill rates in Europe found nearly 12 common blackbirds are killed per kilometre of paved road per year. In total about 194 million birds are killed each year on European roads.Roads may be acting as “sink habitats” that simultaneously attract and negatively affect species. Although these habitats are perceived as high quality because of the prevalence of shrubs and trees, birds there may not be thriving, says Cooke. Living near roads is linked to health problems in humans, including lung damage and an increased risk of dementia, but the effects on wildlife are often overlooked and require more research.Cooke says: “The overall finding that more common birds are seen to be in higher abundance around roads, possibly replacing already rare species, is a cause for major concern. If that’s happening around all our roads, then that’s almost the whole country. That’s a huge area in which already rare species are possibly struggling even more.”The study highlights that avian winners and losers are not confined to areas where roads are being built for the first time, such as in the Amazon, but also in landscapes with a long history of development, says Dr Alexander Lees, senior lecturer in conservation biology at Manchester politan University.Lees, who was not involved in the study, says: “In the British Isles, roads have been established for millennia but remain damaging to many bird species of conservation concern. The government needs to rethink plans to expand the road network and should rein in not only major roads but also the smaller ones – such as moorland tracks – which are creeping across our wilder spaces, leaving them forever scarred.”In March, Rishi Sunak announced plans to build 4,000 miles of new roads by 2025 as part of a £27bn programme that the chancellor described as “the largest ever investment in English strategic roads”. Conservationists want the government to rethink the strategy, instead encouraging people to use public transport, walk or cycle.Flexible working schemes would also reduce road use, says González-Suárez. “Covid-19 has shown us that remote working and virtual meetings can work. We may not want to always stay at home, but even working from home one to two days a week would mean fewer cars on the road,” she says.“Lockdown gave us a taste of a quieter world, with the lowest levels of transport-related noise pollution in decades. Perhaps that could be a preview of the future, rather than just a glimpse of the past,” says Cooke.As well as reducing noise pollution, improving the habitats around roads is one of the most significant things that could be done to help nature in the UK, says Ben Phillips, a PhD student at the environment and sustainability institute at the University of Exeter.These strips of land can have an abundance of wildflowers which are often missing from the wider countryside, and they make up a large area of the UK given the vast extent of the road network. It is relatively simple to improve road verges because they are owned by local government, compared to making changes to farmland, which is owned by many thousands of iniduals. “The study teaches us that we need to better appreciate the strong influence that our vast road network can have on our natural environment, and the need to take a serious look at mitigating this,” says Phillips.The results of this study are not just pertinent for road-dense countries such as the UK. Dr Marc-André Villard, an ecologist from Mount Allison University in Canada believes a failure to address the effects of road networks could contribute to the simplification of bird communities across the world.“This study may represent a harbinger for more responsible land development,” he says. “We will have to design landscapes, including road networks, more wisely in the future. The pandemic has shown that under a major threat, humans can restrict their movements. Considering the importance of protecting large, roadless areas for the benefit of bioersity, we might be more likely to accept the resulting constraints on our movements.”Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow bioersity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5cde28753c9f7ff5b3440649b864d20eef7613bd/0_27_2078_1247/master/2078.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eeacbb5017876918dec0f1bdf5d17e88","title":"final tweet from chadwick boseman account most liked ever on twitter","story":"Statement confirming the Black Panther star’s death from cancer has more than 7m ‘likes’, as tributes continue to pour in for actorThe final tweet from the account of Black Panther star Chadwick Boseman has become the most-liked post in Twitter history.The social media company’s official feed announced the news.

So that was part of it.”Participants in the “Covid on Mind” study, which will be anonymous, will keep a dream log and undertake a “daily mind-wandering task” over a period of two weeks.But first, they will be asked to complete a wellbeing questionnaire that examines their mental state, and “concerns related to coronavirus specifically” to give the researchers “some measure of how people are doing, how concerned they are about the virus, and changes related to the virus in their everyday lives”.The cross-disciplinary project involves cognitive neuroscientists, psychologists and sleep and dream researchers, many of whom study how dreams reflect people’s mental states while awake. “We have people on the team who’ve done a lot of work on emotion and dreams … the pandemic seems to be an ideal opportunity to study that,” says Widnt.She says there is already a body of research that suggests “negatively toned” dreams are associated with issues like anxiety and depression, and wonders, “Could changes in dreams be a marker to help identify people with mental health issues?”“We’re not interested in interpreting the dreams in any sense,” she explains. “This is really a quite different approach that tries to get objective numbers … It’s really about quantifying changes in emotion, and relating them to measures of waking thought and emotion.”Other researchers will be investigating the number of social interactions people report, both in their dreams and mind-wandering tasks. “Dreaming has been proposed to have a possibly evolutionary function in fine-tuning social skills,” she says. “We know that many of our interactions have gone virtual … does that have an impact on how people dream?”“Dream bizarreness”, which Windt describes as “a technical word for all of the different ways in which dreams can be weird”, will also be a focus for Melbourne-based PhD student Manuela Kirberg.In order to quantify how bizarre, social, positive or negative a dream is, independent raters read through dream reports and score them using established criteria. They rate the occurrence of “emotion terms” and “social content”. Any comments that do not form part of a dream’s description – for instance the dreamer’s own interpretation – are discarded, and raters talk to each other to ensure there is “sufficient agreement” in how they are scoring the dreams. “You need a lot of patience and sticktoitiveness to do that scoring, as well as training,” Windt says. “A lot of dreams are pretty mundane.”The researchers are currently recruiting volunteers for the study – and anyone over the age of 18 who lives in the UK, Australia or Finland can participate. The study will be open for up to 12 months. The resulting dataset will feature well over 1,000 dreams and daydreams.Windt is particularly curious about the dreams and mind-wandering of people in lockdown. “It’s obviously horrible what’s happening in Melbourne,” she says. But, “I do think it is a particularly interesting period to get people involved … How do their dreams relate to the changing outer circumstance?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61453f8122b6e29760991095223e475c3abede6c/0_0_2126_1594/master/2126.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b60c0b358e4d22c7cd9bff77f1b8b150 720w","title":"living in the uk are you planning to move out of a city or urban area","story":"We would like to hear from people who are moving to smaller towns or more rural areas and what their reasons areAre you planning on moving out of a city?Some have noticed an increase in people wanting to move out of cities amid an increase in home working and a desire for more outside space.Whether you are buying or renting, if you are moving out of a city centre to a more suburban or rural area, we would like to hear from you.

This officially marks all of the top white women in pop as problematic. Hate to see it.”Another said: “If you haven’t quite understood cultural appropriation, look at Adele’s last Instagram post. She should go to jail no parole for this.”Writing in the comments section of the Instagram post, a user said: “Bantu knots are NOT to be worn by white people in any context, period.”However, others came to Adele’s defence. David Lammy, Labour MP for Tottenham and shadow justice secretary, dismissed the allegations of cultural appropriation as “poppycock”.He tweeted: “This humbug totally misses the spirit of Notting Hill Carnival and the tradition of ‘dress up’ or ‘masquerade’ Adele was born and raised in Tottenham she gets it more than most. Thank you Adele. Forget the Haters.”Claudia Webbe, Labour MP for Leicester East, said: “Carnival is a contested event in which either the usual order of things are overthrown, unhinged and disturbed, or it can reinstitute and reinforce the very order its meant to overthrow. In this sense Adele embraces the spirit of carnival as an event which is qualified to do both.”The singer’s celebrity friends also appeared to approve of the look. The model Naomi Campbell, whose mother was born in Jamaica, commented with two love heart emojis and two pictures of the Jamaican flag.Jamaican musician Popcaan also appeared to be a fan, sharing a fist emoji and a love heart. And actress Tessa Thompson, who stars in sci-fi TV series Westworld, commented with a flame emoji.The Notting Hill Carnival is an annual event that celebrates black culture, but this year it moved online due to the coronavirus pandemic. Adele recently shared a snap celebrating “Queen” Beyonce, following the release of the visual album Black Is King.

Now, inspired by their US counterparts, they are fighting for recognition and residencyThe US Dreamers – young people who arrived in the country as children – have spent the past 20 years focused on their fight for the legal right to live, study and work there. In 2012 they secured an intervention from the then president, Barack Obama, who paved the way for their legal status with the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) programme. In Europe, populist politicians and the rightwing press still fuel the perception that the undocumented population is a faceless mass of opportunists. It is not well understood that the majority of people without papers are young people, many of whom arrived in Europe as small children, and some were even born there. Now, inspired by their US counterparts, they are fighting for recognition and residency.

On Monday 1,406 new cases were reported. Numbers collected over the weekend are often lower than those for other days of the week owing to lower levels of testing and reporting delays.Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, said Sunday’s figure was “quite a big jump”. He said data for the rest of the week would be needed to get a clear idea of the scale of any uptick, but the figures tied in to a broader trend of an increase in infections in the UK since early July.Prof Neil Ferguson, an epidemiologist at Imperial College London, said: “What it clearly demonstrates is we’re in a position where case numbers are going up. So we don’t have much room for manoeuvre.” Ferguson said the reopening of schools could lead to a further rise. “I think that will pose more stress and is likely to lead to a somewhat fast increase in case numbers. And then at that point there will be a need to make potentially some difficult decisions to get on top of it,” he said.“We do need to have a system in place to respond to those outbreaks, to implement rapid testing in schools, and measures to control spread.”While some have suggested the rise in infections could largely be explained by increased testing, Hunter said the figures told a different story. “You can’t explain it all by the amount of testing,” he said. In the first seven days in July, 232 tests were done for every positive case reported, and in mid-August it was only about 164 tests per positive case, although in recent weeks the figures appear to have stabilisedOther data reveals a similar trend. Office for National Statistics figures suggest there was an increase in infections in England during July, and that it appears to have levelled off in recent weeks.Pagel said: “Even if all the new cases were in hotspots, they are hotspots because transmission is increasing a lot in those areas. That represents spread of Covid.”Ferguson said the rise was expected given the relaxation of lockdown measures, adding that local measures would continue to be needed where outbreaks occur, as has already been seen in Leicester and Greater Manchester.The situation is not yet as severe as in many countries in Europe. Spain, Italy and France are all experiencing large rises in cases, leading to concerns about lockdown easing. Again, experts have said an increase in testing does not fully explain these rises. Pagel said she was surprised the UK had not seen more infections, given the situation in Europe, but there were a number of possible explanations. “We are still doing way more home working than the rest of the continent, and we are also much less likely to go out still,” she said.Ferguson agreed. “We have relaxed lockdown less than those countries, and later, and actually now our testing system is close to being the equal of Germany’s and it’s probably a slightly better position than France.”Pagel said there should be checks on cafes and restaurants in the UK for measures such as social distancing, as well as on whether people returning from abroad were quarantining if instructed to do so. “We have policies that we are not actually enforcing.” She said the government’s new drive to reduce home working was “a really bad idea”.Prof Rowland Kao, an epidemiologist at the University of Edinburgh, said upticks in infections were more likely to be spotted when case numbers were low, but the increase in the proportion of tests coming back positive was of concern.“We know that because we are relaxing restrictions in the broad for various reasons – schools are going back, universities are going back – we will get sparks,” he said. “It is whether or not test and trace is working well enough to stamp those out quickly.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e27f754b139f4f234b72d7a7e6c4f3f0dc5bb330/0_559_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=30daea8e8e1d278a29514aa0db284ef9","title":"caleb ewan lays down marker and eyes more tour de france wins","story":"The Australian, who won stage three in Sisteron, has an eye on a seat at the head of the sprinting tableCaleb Ewan arrived at this Tour de France a different man compared to the one who made a commanding debut last year, when under stress that he later reflected on as unhealthy. Then, the Australian needed more than a week to work up to his career first stage win, but he has taken just a few days to notch his maiden victory of this campaign.Ewan won stage three of the 2020 Tour by pipping Irish champion and race debutant Sam Bennett (Deceuninck-Quick-Step) and Italian champion Giacomo Nizzolo (NTT) in a bunch sprint on Monday. The performance was a display of physical and mental fortitude from Ewan, who is intent on finishing what has been described as one of the hardest Tours in modern cycling in a bid to win again on the Champs-Élysées – an unofficial world championship for sprinters. Unlike Deceuninck-Quick-Step and NTT, who were clearly assembled at the front of the bunch with 16km to go, Ewan’s Lotto Soudal team were not visible until they moved up with 8.7km remaining. It was smart, given the headwind finish and that Lotto Soudal has lost two men. The 26-year-old Ewan likewise bided his time in the frenzied run to the line.“In the last kilometre I was literally too far forward, so I dropped back into the wheels,” Ewan said. “That gave me some time to rest the legs a little bit before the final lead-out. Coming from behind was a bit of a risk but I found my way through the barrier and I came with a lot of speed. In the end it worked out perfectly.” Ewan’s Tour last year was a coming of age tale. When asked in October to recall his debut, Ewan spoke of winning the Bay Crits in Victoria as a teenager when he was likened by an overzealous Australian media to Mark Cavendish and linked with a race he had only watched on TV. Ewan shouldered that expectation for the years that followed, and it compounded when former team Mitchelton-Scott reneged on sending him to the 2018 Tour. In 2019 he succeeded legendary sprinter Andre Greipel at Lotto Soudal and his infant daughter, born six weeks premature, was still in hospital when he left for the Grand Départ. “There was so much stress I guess leading into the Tour, it wasn’t healthy I don’t think,” Ewan said. “When I finished the Tour, it was the biggest relief of my life.”Fast-forward to 2020 and the story is not about verification or validation, rather a ferocious but considerate competitor, who has an eye on a seat at the head of the table. Ewan’s lead-up to this year’s Tour has not been without challenges – not least having to reset after an almost five-month competition shutdown due to a global pandemic. The eight-time Grand Tour stage winner is based in Monaco and lockdown protocols there prevented him from training outside for a stint. Also, the peloton had just four weeks of race conditioning from when the revised and condensed season resumed on 1 August to when the Tour left Nice under a cloud of virus-related uncertainty on Saturday. Yet it has not penetrated his composure. Ewan entered the Tour with an understated but clear surety in his own ability to not only compete but also stake a claim as the best sprinter in the WorldTour by season’s end. He is aiming to finish the Tour and less than two weeks later start the Giro d’Italia, where every marquee sprinter is slated to be. Ewan is not brash like some predecessors in claiming he is the best, especially in one of the most competitive and populated sprint fields seen for a long time, but his focus on quality victories over quantity is testament to the aim. When asked at the outset of the Tour how many stages he believed he could win – a stock standard question that nearly every sprinter responds to with a diplomatic “one and then we’ll see” – Ewan left it open. “The goal is to always win a stage, but you know it’s a hard question because if I go to this Tour de France now and if I’m the fifth best sprinter here and I win one stage then I’m going to be happy,” he said. “But if I’m the best sprinter here and I only win one stage and I miss out on four or five then I’m going to be unhappy. It depends on how I’m going compared to the other sprinters. If I’m going really good, then I want to come away with as many stages as possible.”Ewan won three stages on debut and has counted six opportunities, two now gone, to repeat if not improve on that feat.

My boss at RDF Media at the time, Stephen Lambert, was experimenting by mixing entertainment formats with documentary production. Big Brother was already on the air, but it felt like we were leading the way in this new genre of television-making.Stephen’s wife, Jenni Russell, had the idea of making a sort of modern-day My Fair LadyPygmalion – take people from one walk of life and teach them to pass themselves off as the opposite of who they are. The first show was commissioned as a one-off documentary, part of a Channel 4 strand called Cutting Edge.Stephen wanted a director called Mike Warner to make the first show as he had a good entertainment sensibility, and Mike asked me if I wanted to work on it with him. I knew it was a great idea – brilliantly simple and uplifting. I think we all knew we were making something good, but I don’t think we knew how good. The genius of Stephen was being able to create this bigger entity from what started as a one-off idea.It was one of the first times a factual show was made using documentary filming techniques and was then commissioned as a repeatable “entertainment” format. Faking It and shows like it came to be known as factual entertainment formats.There was a classic moment where we drove Alex through the estate for the first time and there was a mattress up against the wall. He’d never been to a council estate, he’d never seen a mattress on the street. It was priceless. It really was, like, “Wow, where have you been?” I think that’s probably why we picked him, because he hadn’t really left his twee country village, and we took him to Hackney, which 20 years ago was rough. It was the journey of Alex’s character that we were looking for.Making the show was a deeply affecting experience for us all. It was the start of a new era of TV. It changed everything.I was a chemistry student at Oxford University and shared a house with three other people. One of the guys would print off every single spam email that he got, and I came across one of these pieces of paper on the stairs. It said there was an audition happening not far from where we lived. I thought: “That could be interesting.” It didn’t say what it was or what it was going to be.I went down and met this person over a cup of coffee, then the following Wednesday they called and asked if I could come to London. I met more of the team and they asked me if I wanted to do the programme, still not telling me what it was. Back then we didn’t really know what reality TV was. Once I signed on the dotted line, they said: “OK, you’re going to be trained and working as a bouncer in central London.”I didn’t know what any of that entailed. I hadn’t really come across that sort of lifestyle before. I guess I didn’t underestimate it, I just didn’t comprehend how impactful it could be for the rest of my life.Coming out on national TV was not ideal. It just happened. That was one of the naive things about me at the time, which was wonderful, actually, because it was honest. It wasn’t set up at all and I hadn’t thought of the repercussions. I realised that if I could learn to be a bouncer, having been as naive and as useless as I was, then I could pretty much do anything.I don’t think there will be one day that goes by without something reminding me of Faking It.

Spreading from the heartlands of the US to a new generation of eager buyers in China to dominate even the twisting, narrow streets of Europe, the sports utility vehicle, or SUV, has bludgeoned its way to automobile supremacy with a heady mix of convenience and marketing muscle.The rise of the SUV as the world’s pre-eminent car has been so rapid that the consequences of this new status – the altered patterns of urban life, air quality, pedestrian safety, where to park the things – are still coming into focus.But it’s increasingly clear that SUVs’ most profound impact is playing out within the climate crisis, where their surging popularity is producing a vast new source of planet-cooking emissions.Last year, the International Energy Agency made a finding that stunned even its own researchers. SUVs were the second largest cause of the global rise in carbon dioxide emissions over the past decade, eclipsing all shipping, aviation, heavy industry and even trucks, usually the only vehicles to loom larger than them on the road.Each year, SUVs belch out 700 megatonnes of CO2, about the entire output of the UK and Netherlands combined. If all SUV drivers banded together to form their own country, it would rank as the seventh largest emitter in the world.Climate activists may hurl themselves in the path of new oil pipelines and ladle enough guilt on to flying that flygskam, or “flight shame”, has spread from Sweden around the world but a mammoth, and growing, cause of the climate crisis has crept up almost unnoticed around us.“The global rise of SUVs is challenging efforts to reduce emissions,” Fatih Birol, executive director of the IEA, admitted.Combining the weight of an adult rhinoceros and the aerodynamics of a refrigerator, SUVs require more energy to move around than smaller cars and therefore emit more CO2, overshadowing the car industry’s climate gains from fuel efficiency improvements and the nascent electric vehicle market.Emissions analysis commissioned by the  illustrate, for the first time in detail, how much worse for the climate SUVs are than smaller vehicles, and how they have helped transform our cities.“To avert the worst of the climate catastrophe, the transport sector needs to be completely decarbonized,” said Sebastian Castellanos, a researcher at the New Urban Mobility Alliance who calculated the emissions. “With the explosion in SUV sales, we are moving even farther away from our goal of decarbonizing the sector.”This global phenomenon has its roots and impetus in the US, where in the 1980s the car industry carved out a new category called the “sport-utility vehicle”, a sort of mash-up between a truck, a minivan and the traditional American family car. After successfully lobbying lawmakers to class these vehicles as light trucks rather than cars, binding SUVs to less stringent fuel efficiency standards, the industry set about slotting them into almost every arena of American life.Once a workhorse that lugged tools around or was used for bumpy off-road driving, the SUV morphed into the default option for families puttering around suburbia and even for people in the cores of densely populated cities. The look and cost of SUVs stretched to suit all tastes – the 1984 Jeep Cherokee, a boxy, spartan offering considered the first SUV, has spawned successors ranging from the compact Kia Sportage to the sporty Mercedes ML.The industry found that American drivers enjoy the lofty seating position of SUVs, as well as the capacity and the comforting feel of security their bulk provides, even if half of all journeys taken in the US are mundane trips of under three miles to run errands rather than high-octane adventures in the Rocky Mountains. For many Americans, SUVs invoke alluring qualities of fortitude and independence.“Pretty much everyone wants one now,” said Stephanie Brinley, principal automotive analyst at IHS Markit. “The family car is now a utility vehicle and not a sedan. Millennials like them, baby boomers like them. Americans like to take all of their stuff with them and automakers figured this out.”Marketing for SUVs is now so broad it no longer seems jarring to see ads of a beefy car-truck zooming around urban streets to take its occupant to a yoga class or to grab a coffee. Ford was so thrilled with its recent relaunch of the Bronco, a model infamous for being driven by OJ Simpson as he was chased by a phalanx of police cars in 1994, that it rolled out an eight-part podcast series in celebration.“Car companies looked at things that people value, such as macho-ness, ruggedness and protection of the family, and leveraged that,” said Harvey Miller, professor and director of the Center for Urban and Regional Analysis at Ohio State University. “These SUVs are named after mountains and other places you’ll never go to. They created a market that pushes our buttons.”As Bloomberg’s Nat Bullard noted in a recent tweet: “We don’t buy cars here. We buy big cars built on truck bodies, and we buy trucks and drive them like cars.” The US is now indisputably an SUV nation, a transformation that has had profound consequences for American cities as well as the global climate.To Miller, SUVs are a monument to a broader American failure that has seen pedestrians and cyclists forsaken for endless miles of road building, with non-car users forced to push what he calls “beg buttons” to pause traffic to enter roads that should be egalitarian public spaces. SUVs, according to Miller, not only bring a stew of pollution and an element of fear to those attempting to traverse roads on foot or bike, they are fundamentally inefficient. “You are taking a 200lb package, a human, and wrapping it in a 6,000lb shipping container,” he said. “For some reason we think that is a good way to move through a city. If Amazon used that rationale it would be out of business in a week.”Alarm has also been raised over the safety of SUVs, given that during accidents their elevated stature tends to strike pedestrians and cyclists on the upper torso and then crushes them under the wheels. “They are killing machines,” said Miller. “They cause a lot of damage to the global climate, to air quality and to the people they hit. SUVs are terrible for cities and neighborhoods, they serve no purpose there. You don’t need them to run to the store to buy a gallon of milk.”Taming SUV emissions will largely come down to fuel efficiency improvements and a significant shift to electric versions. Firms including Nissan, General Motors and, of course, Tesla have started to roll out electric SUVs, nudging the driving range up to 300 miles without a charge. But the challenge is steep – today, only about one in every 100 vehicles sold in the US is electric, recharging stations are still sparse and the price of oil – and therefore gasoline at the pump – has recently plummeted to record lows.A deeper-rooted reform would involve a reimagining of US towns and cities as places largely without cars, a previously unthinkable scenario before the pandemic emptied streets and saw outdoor diners, skateboarders and strolling couples take their place on the reclaimed tarmac. The crisis of 2020 has given Americans a glimpse of a different sort of urban life, one more readily associated with Amsterdam or Venice, although there is little sign the clamor for SUVs is weakening.“Most Americans can’t imagine anything else other than highways and crappy public transit. It’s all they’ve ever seen,” said Miller. “Now that SUVs are here they are difficult to unwind but if we want sustainable, healthy cities we have to do it.”“The dominance of SUVs is only going to stretch,” said Brinley. “We will just see them as the norm.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f342c4984f6a0423b658a28a24333d65ffb175ad/272_35_907_544/master/907.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fd3b9ad07a1d4b7782d0b90f54e0982c","title":"australian citizen detained in china amid tensions between canberra and beijing","story":"The foreign minister, Marise Payne, says the Australian government was notified in mid-August that Cheng Lei had been detainedAn Australian citizen who works as a TV anchor for a Chinese state-controlled broadcaster has been detained as tensions between Canberra and Beijing escalate.The Australian government was notified on 14 August that Cheng Lei, an anchor for a business show on the China Global Television Network, had been detained in Beijing.In a statement released on Monday night, Australia’s foreign minister, Marise Payne, acknowledged the detention and said a consular visit had been conducted via video link.“Australian officials had an initial consular visit with Ms Cheng at a detention facility via video link on 27 August and will continue to provide assistance and support to her and her family,” Payne said.The foreign minister said “further comment will not be provided owing to the government’s privacy obligations”.It is highly unusual for foreign journalists to be detained in China.Cheng was born in China but later became an Australian citizen. In 2018, when she was an anchor for BizAsia on China Central Television, she appeared on ABC’s QandA program. She was previously China correspondent for CNBC for nine years.She last tweeted on 12 August and her profile on CGTN’s website has been taken down. CGTN videos featuring Cheng have been removed from online platforms and social media pages.Cheng has not been charged but is being held under “residential surveillance at a designated location”, according to an ABC report which states she can be held for up to six months without access to lawyers.The ABC reports Cheng’s two young children are being cared for in Melbourne by family members and supporters are organising legal representation.“We are aware of the current situation with regard to Cheng Lei’s status as advised by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade,” her family said in a statement provided to the ABC. “In China, due process will be observed and we look forward to a satisfactory and timely conclusion to the matter.”Geoff Raby, former ambassador to China and a friend of Cheng, said he was “very concerned”, and that her circle of friends had no idea where she had been for the past few weeks until Monday.Raby told ABC’s Radio National it was “astounding” that someone of Cheng’s profile working for state media in China had been detained.“Cheng Lei is a very skilful operator, she knows where the limits on public comment are… she understands how it works and she’s pragmatic and hardheaded, and was mainly doing business programs,” he said.“It’s very hard to see where the sensitivity is, and where she may have overstepped any red lines around political sensitivities in China.”The Alliance for Journalists’ Freedom called for Cheng’s immediate release from her “unjustified detention” pending judicial proceedings, in line with international laws to which China is a signatory.“In the absence of evidence, the only conclusion we can come to is that she is being used as a hostage in a wider diplomatic spat between Australia and China, or perhaps because of some critical comments she may have made,” said the Alliance’s spokesman, Peter Greste. “Either way, it is simply unacceptable.”Amid deteriorating relations, Australia currently warns its citizens they may be at increased risk of arbitrary detention in mainland China.Confirmation of Cheng’s detention follows Monday’s announcement by Chinese authorities of a second trade investigation into Australian wine imports in as many weeks.Simon Birmingham, the federal minister for trade, acknowledged there were a “number of issues” with the relationship between China and Australia.“I’m disappointed that the Chinese authorities have not agreed to have those sorts of minister-to-minister discussions. We continue to support engagement at a range of different levels of cooperation, and stand ready and willing to do so,” he told ABC News Breakfast.“But we continue to be committed to working as closely as we can, and particularly in the areas of mutual interest and advantage for our two nations.”Canberra, meanwhile, is pursuing legislation to allow the federal government to stop state, territory and local governments, and universities, from entering agreements with foreign powers considered detrimental to Australia’s national interests.On Tuesday morning the hawkish state media mouthpiece, the Global Times, ran several articles and op-eds, warning Australia over the move, and accused it of “unprovoked attacks in normal economic exchanges”, and of blindly following the US in anti-China rhetoric.“In the past decade, China has been Australia’s largest trading partner, and this market is difficult to replace. If Australia views this close economic relationship as well as China-Australia collaboration in other sectors such as science as a burden rather than an opportunity, it will face far-reaching consequences it cannot bear.”In the months since Australia pushed for an international inquiry into China’s handling of Covid-19, China has increased tariffs on Australian barley, citing dumping, and banned imports from some abattoirs over alleged compliance issues.China has also told its international students and citizens not to travel to Australia because they could encounter racism.After tensions initially escalated as a result of the coronavirus inquiry, the Australian government changed its position to declare Beijing’s claims in the South China Sea “invalid”, and condemned Beijing’s moves to curtail freedoms in Hong Kong.Cheng is the latest high-profile Australian to be detained by Beijing. Her detention comes more than a year after former Chinese diplomat turned Australian academic Dr Yang Hengjun was arrested and charged with espionage."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d32fcdf0c4283afc8b53e7a57aa4939634a77a36/0_185_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b3852255ee3f8eeed02b65c058ca0662","title":"coronavirus selfish covidiots on tui flight to uk from greek island criticised","story":"Tui launches investigation after almost 200 passengers told to isolate after outbreakA flight from the Greek island of Zante was “full of selfish ‘covidiots’ and an inept crew”, according to a passenger among the almost 200 onboard who have been told to self-isolate after a coronavirus outbreak.Tui said it had launched an investigation after 16 people tested positive for Covid-19 linked to its flight to Cardiff on 25 August, including seven passengers who were infectious or potentially infectious on the plane.Stephanie Whitfield said on Monday that many of her fellow passengers were not wearing face coverings correctly and seemed to “disregard the rules”.“Lots of the people were wearing the masks underneath their noses or even underneath their chins,” she told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “They were taking the masks off to talk to friends and they were going up and down the aisles to talk to their friends without their masks on.”Whitfield said she noticed a crew member ask one woman to put her mask on but “the vast majority” of passengers were not reminded of the rules. Face coverings are required to be worn at airports and on flights unless a passenger has a medical condition that makes them exempt.“There was a chap sat next to me who had his mask around his chin for the full flight, and the stewardess was talking to him and she didn’t say anything to him,” she said.Whitfield said she was not surprised to hear about the outbreak on the flight and that she and her husband had since developed mild symptoms and were self-isolating. She added: “The flight was full of selfish ‘covidiots’ and an inept crew who couldn’t care less.”Tui said it was concerned to hear Whitfield’s claims and a full investigation was under way. It added: “The safety and wellbeing of passengers and crew is our highest priority and we operate all flights line with European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) guidelines.”Dr Gwen Lowe, a consultant in communicable disease control for Public Health Wales, said there had been about 30 confirmed coronavirus cases in Wales in the last week of people who had returned from Zante and that she was expecting the number to rise.She said the confirmed cases had included people staying at different hotels and returning on different flights. Officials are in the process of reaching all 193 people who were on Tui flight 6215 to Cardiff on 25 August.Lowe said face coverings “may help” stop the spread of the virus but that they were an “informal measure” that were difficult for airlines to police.Last week, Plymouth city council said up to 30 teenagers in the area could have contracted coronavirus after they flew back from Zante, with 11 members of the group – aged about 18 and 19 – having tested positive.Greece is not on the list of countries for which travellers face quarantine restrictions coming into the UK. But the Foreign Office said on Friday that local restrictions had been tightened on Zante, with stricter limits on large gatherings, large groups in restaurants and late-night food openings.There were reports on Monday of Zante hospital being deluged with requests for Covid-19 tests as it became increasingly clear the island was experiencing a sharp rise in cases. Most people were being turned away and instructed to self-isolate, local reports said, adding that at least two doctors at the hospital had been diagnosed with the virus.The situation in the party resort of Laganas, a draw for young Britons, was described as “especially worrying” by the island’s local MP Dionysios Aktipis, who said the government’s recent decision to tighten restrictions was inevitable.Additional reporting by Helena Smith in Athens "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f98fabb01586387ea393e5262a5856a4bb2a266/0_147_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cb597ba93ea7f5fd8013771c5e0aeaa9","title":"schools in england and wales draw up covid behaviour codes","story":"One school says it will exclude pupils for behaviour such as ‘malicious coughing’Students face being sent home for “malicious coughing” or making inappropriate jokes about Covid-19 under new rules being drawn up by some schools as the bulk of those in England and Wales fully reopen this week.The new behavioural guidelines come as the Department for Education said schools should clearly state the consequences for bad behaviour, particularly around new movement restrictions and hygiene rules.In updated guidance for schools, the DfE also warned: “It is likely that adverse experiences or lack of routines of regular attendance and classroom discipline may contribute to disengagement with education upon return to school, resulting in increased incidence of poor behaviour.”Schools planning to implement a list of “coronavirus red lines” included the Ark Alexandra academy in Hastings which informed parents that they could result in fixed-term exclusions for pupils.Breaches would include “deliberate or malicious” coughs or sneezes, “humorous, inappropriate comments or statements” related to Covid-19 and “purposeful physical contact with any other person”.“Any student that needs to have a fixed-term exclusion during the pandemic will not return to main circulation until a risk assessment and we can be assured that the student will adhere to all our expectations,” Jerome Scafe, network associate principal, said in a letter to parents.Ark Byron primary academy in Acton, west London, said in a letter to parents that pupils refusing to abide by hygiene routines and social distancing instructions would “immediately be moved to a separate area”.“Some behaviours (eg coughing deliberately on another person) that were previously ‘simply’ antisocial are now potentially extremely serious,” it added.The development comes as schools also face calls by the co-founder of one large parents’ campaign group to ensure that their other policies protect children who won’t be wearing masks.Schools in England will be permitted to make pupils wear masks in busy areas such as corridors under new government guidance last week.But the policy has alarmed some parents, particularly those with disabilities. Dozens have told the parents’ campaign group UsForThem that they are considering de-registering their children, while some have already done so.“Given the very low threat of the virus for children, we don’t think that requiring children to wear masks is a proportionate response and we would like schools to be very clear on their policies,” said the co-founder Molly Kingsley.“Schools should not go above and beyond what they are permitted to do, which is to mandate masks in cases of local lockdowns, but we also feel that attention should be paid to World Health Organization (WHO) guidance. It says that, where masks are introduced for children, the body introducing them has to do an ongoing risk assessment. But it’s not what schools are doing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/998f03a97ec3b2f8c2b79e9ba261be9d60135b7e/0_249_3861_2316/master/3861.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=daaab5e097f4b9f2520ae70ae284a930","title":"new zealand lockdown led to biggest spike in welfare claims in modern history","story":"Demand for social welfare ‘unprecedented’ in April as coronavirus lockdown claimed tens of thousands of jobsAnalysis by the Ministry of Social Development showed the jump in April was the biggest monthly rise in 24 years, “noting that this period includes the global financial crisis and the Asian crisis”.The analysis of benefit numbers – which includes those claiming a range of allowances related to unemployment, health and parenting – was carried out to compare benefit Covid-era benefit rates with those observed during significant economic downturns since the Depression.“This increase corresponded with the strict alert level 4 restrictions and significant reductions in global demand,” the report said. On 25 March, New Zealanders began level 4 restrictions – the most severe possible.Unusually, the report found that the Covid-19 pandemic had disproportionately affected European New Zealanders, who usually fare best in social, health and economic outcomes in the country.“In the current downturn, the percentage increase in unemployment-related benefit receipt was higher for New Zealand Europeans than Māori or Pacific people,” the report stated. “Likely reflecting how Māori and Pacific people are over-represented in benefit numbers to begin with.”The report said it was too soon to say “with any certainty” when welfare rates would peak, but the rate of change in benefit numbers observed in April was “unprecedented in modern history”.The Salvation Army and food banks around the country say demand for their services has quadrupled since the start of the pandemic, and the unemployment benefit isn’t enough for most Kiwi families to survive on, at just NZ$250 (£126) a week per person .More than a million New Zealanders – a fifth of the population – accessed the government’s wage subsidy during and after lockdown, while others were kept afloat by the Covid-19 income relief payment of NZ$490 per week.The discrepancy between welfare payments and the Covid support package has angered many, who said the gap was “unfair and discriminatory”.Many in the welfare sector have called for the new rate of NZ$490 to be extended to those needing welfare help, too.New Zealand could return to pre-pandemic economic levels by 2024 “with significant loss of income along the way”, the government’s treasury secretary Caralee McLiesh, said recently.Finance minister Grant Robertson warned in April the nation faced an economic shock “a quantum greater” than that of the 2008 global financial crisis."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/daadd1fad5dce4d465eaa4fd8fdb360425d6b161/310_150_3619_2172/master/3619.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=38a01eef81e3bdf7a4f0f0ea11831ad4","title":"saudi commander in yemen removed in fresh purge","story":"Crown prince Mohammed bin Salman behind ousting of Lt Gen Fahad bin Turki bin Abdulaziz and othersSaudi Arabia’s top military commander in its years-long war in Yemen and his prince son have been removed from their posts along with other officials as part of an anti-corruption investigation.The announcement, early on Tuesday, attributed the actions to a referral by Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. The 35-year-old son of King Salman has previously carried out mass arrests in a similar anti-corruption drive that also targeted potential rivals to his rule.A statement on the state-run Saudi Press Agency referred to “suspicious financial dealings monitored at the Ministry of Defence,” without elaborating.As a result, the statement said the kingdom fired Lt Gen Fahad bin Turki bin Abdulaziz, a prince in Saudi Arabia’s large ruling family in charge of allied forces in Yemen fighting the Iranian-allied Houthi rebels.Authorities also removed his son, Prince Abdulaziz bin Fahad bin Turki, from his position as the deputy governor of Saudi Arabia’s al-Jouf region in the kingdom’s north-west.Four other officials are also being investigated on the orders of 84-year-old King Salman, the statement said. It was not immediately clear if those accused had been detained or if they had lawyers.Anti-corruption officials “shall complete the investigation procedures with all relevant military and civil officials, take the necessary legal measures against them and submit the outcomes,” the statement said.Lt Gen Fahad took over leading the Yemen war in February 2018 following years of stalemate. The Houthis still hold the capital, Sana’a. He previously served as a paratrooper and special forces commander, and also oversaw the Royal Saudi Land Forces.He took over the coalition as part of a mass restructuring of the Saudi military at the time.The war in Yemen – which has killed over 100,000 people, displaced millions and shattered the Arab world’s poorest country – has become the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. It began with Houthi rebels seizing Sana’a in September 2014, then marching south. Saudi Arabia and its allies entered the conflict in March 2015, led by Bin Salman as the Saudi defence minister.The war has become a regional conflict, as the Iranian-backed Houthis hold the north and a variety of forces operate in the south under the umbrella of the Saudi-led coalition.There has been international condemnation of Saudi airstrikes which have killed civilians and the torture of prisoners at Emirati-controlled prisons. The Houthis face outrage over stolen humanitarian aid, indiscriminately using landmines and sending child soldiers into the conflict.The Saudi-led coalition has splintered as the war has dragged on, especially after Emirati troops withdrew last year. Separatists backed by the United Arab Emirates have openly fought against Yemen’s internationally recognised government, which has been based in Saudi Arabia for years. That violence has flared again in recent days.After coming to power, Bin Salman has been behind several anti-corruption campaigns, including turning Riyadh’s Ritz-Carlton hotel into a luxury prison in late 2017 as part of a mass arrest of businessmen, royals and others. Those released agreed to sign over some of their assets, giving the crackdown the feel of a shakedown.

The post involves relocation to Geneva where the successful candidate will require the cunning of a Machiavelli, the political skills of Nelson Mandela and the thick skin of a rhinoceros. Plus a good dollop of luck.The job description for director general of the World Trade Organization did not quite go like that, but none of the eight people who have put themselves forward to succeed Brazil’s Roberto Azevêdo are in any doubt as to the extent of the challenge.Ground down by seven years in the role, Azevêdo quit the WTO on Friday a year early and has moved seamlessly to a job on the board of the US soft drinks company Pepsi. The first phase of the struggle to replace him ends on 7 September by which time it is thought the eight candidates – including the former UK international trade secretary Liam Fox – will have had enough time to make their pitches and the selection process begins. Over the next two months the intention is to whittle the eight down to five and then two before the lucky – or perhaps unlucky – winner is announced.The WTO’s problem is simple: it has two functions – to negotiate global trade deals among its 164 members and to act as the arbiter of trade disputes – but has struggled to do either in recent years.The eight candidates to be the next director-general of the World Trade Organization are:Amina Mohamed:\u0026nbspthe Kenyan candidate knows her way round Geneva and is a former chair of the WTO’s general council. Currently cabinet minister for sports heritage and culture, Mohamed was Kenya’s foreign minister between 2013 and 2018.\u0026nbspChances:\u0026nbspjoint frontrunner.Jesús Seade Kuri:\u0026nbspMexico’s choice has a long career in trade negotiations stretching back to the days of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the forerunner to the WTO. More recently, he was involved in the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement between Mexico, Canada and the US.\u0026nbspChances:\u0026nbspShould make the first cut.Mohammad Maziad\u0026nbspal-Tuwaijri:\u0026nbspRiyadh’s pick for the job is a former Saudi air force pilot who worked in banking for JP Morgan and HSBC but currently advises the Saudi royal family on international and domestic economic policy.\u0026nbspChances:\u0026nbspWill struggle to make the first cut.Yoo Myung-hee:\u0026nbspSouth Korea’s trade minister is a veteran of trade negotiations and took charge of WTO affairs for her country when it was set up in 1995. More recently, she has been responsible for negotiating free trade agreements, including the one with the UK.\u0026nbspChances:\u0026nbsppotential dark horse.Liam Fox:\u0026nbspthe Brexit-supporting MP was made international trade secretary by Theresa May in 2016 but was ousted by Boris Johnson in his 2019 reshuffle. The former defence secretary twice ran unsuccessfully to be leader of the Conservative party and was chosen as Britain’s nominee in preference to the former EU trade commissioner Peter Mandelson.\u0026nbspChances:\u0026nbspslim.Abdel-Hamid Mamdouh:\u0026nbspThe ultimate trade insider, Mamdouh’s experience of trade talks stretches back to the mid-1980s when he was the Egyptian negotiator at the Gatt. He later became an official at the WTO and ran the services ision. Holder of both Egyptian and Swiss nationality.\u0026nbspChances:\u0026nbspoutsider.Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala:\u0026nbspNigeria’s candidate spent 25 years at the World Bank, eventually rising to number two in the Washington-based organisation. Okonjo-Iweala was a strong voice against corruption during her two terms as her country’s finance minister and was also foreign minister.\u0026nbspChances:\u0026nbspjoint favourite despite no trade background.Tudor\u0026nbspUlianovschi:\u0026nbspThe youngest of the WTO hopefuls, at 37, Ulianovschi was a diplomat before briefly becoming Moldova’s foreign minister between 2018 and 2019. He gained experience of how Geneva works during his time as Moldova’s representative at the WTO.\u0026nbspChances:\u0026nbsprank outsider.\u0026nbspLarry ElliottNext November, it will be 20 years since the WTO launched the Doha development round, with the avowed aims of extending free trade to new areas such as services and expanding the benefits to the least developed countries. Officially, the intention is still to complete the Doha round but in reality the members gave up on the idea years ago.Under Azevêdo, the WTO has tended to focus on plurilateral deals, essentially coalitions of the willing where small groups of countries try to cut deals in areas, such as e-commerce, where there is some prospect of finding agreement.Finding common ground for anything more than a limited agenda of liberalisation has proved impossible. The US, backed by the EU, says China, now the world’s second-biggest economy, should no longer get special treatment for its trade. Beijing says it should because its per capita incomes are much lower than those in the west.This argument has been rumbling away for years. The issue that has brought the WTO’s problems to a head involves the seemingly arcane question of how to settle trade disputes. Under the WTO’s rules any argument between member states over alleged unfair practices are decided by a panel, with the losing side having the right to appeal.The rulings made by the WTO’s appellate body have become controversial. The US, and other countries, are unhappy about the tendency of the judges to make rulings that make trade law rather than simply interpret the existing rules. So upset has Washington become over what it sees as an infringement of its sovereignty that it has blocked the appointment of new judges to the disputes panel, depriving it of a quorum.Add in a collapse of global trade caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and the increasingly tense trade relationship between the US and China and all the ingredients are in place for a perfect storm. The atmosphere in Geneva has become so poisonous that it proved impossible for members even to agree which of Azevêdo’s four deputies should act as temporary WTO head while a new director general was chosen. As a result, all four are jointly in charge.Richard Kozul-Wright, the director of the globalisation isions at the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, said: “The WTO has seen a huge haemorrhaging of trust on all sides. It doesn’t need a technocrat. It needs someone who can restore a bit of faith in the institution. That’s what’s needed.” The candidate who ticks the right boxes, Kozul-Wright says, is Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, a former Nigerian finance minister with a reputation as a skilled political operator and fighter against corruption. Her strongest rival is the Kenyan trade expert Amina Mohamed, who has worked at the WTO. Either would be the first African and the first woman to hold the post.The chances of one of the two getting the job are relatively good, but is likely to have as much to do with global politics as with their suitability. Mexico’s candidate will probably be ruled out because a Latin American has just held the post. Fox is supported by the US, which according to one Geneva insider might be the kiss of death. The Moldovan, Saudi Arabian and Egyptian candidates lack an obvious power base. That leaves the South Korean trade minister, Yoo Myung-hee, who would be a good compromise candidate were it not for her country’s fraught relations with two big neighbours: China and Japan.Every candidate has said the WTO needs reform if it is to survive, but according to Kozul-Wright that might not be sufficient. The hostility towards China exists across the US political spectrum and will not disappear if Joe Biden defeats Donald Trump in November. Most trade, he says, takes place within three blocks – east Asia, North America and western Europe, and involves big corporations struggling to secure and maintain intellectual property rights.When it was created a quarter of a century ago, the WTO pledged to raise living standards, ensure full employment and ensure there was enough effective demand to facilitate open trade in goods and services. “No one thinks it has anywhere lived up to its claims,” Kozul-Wright said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94a3a91087f93994fbd4d88eb3e19b9315f04c97/0_224_6708_4025/master/6708.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f36ece4fb6c666fbb9e876cfb90975a6","title":"coronavirus live news who says states cant pretend pandemic is over french cases rise 50 in august","story":"The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany increased by 1,218 to 243,599, data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases showed on Tuesday.The death toll rose by four to 9,302.Good morning from Greater Manchester in England’s north. I’m Helen Pidd and I will be looking after this blog for a few hours today. Here is what has happened over the past eight hours on our Covid-riddled planet:Hungary has decided to let tourists from its three eastern European neighbours, Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, enter the country with a fresh negative coronavirus test, it said late on Monday, just as a lockdown on its borders took effect.Last week, Hungary said it would close its borders to foreigners from Tuesday to curb a rise in coronavirus cases. Returning Hungarian citizens can avoid a 14-day quarantine only if they provide two negative Covid tests.However, after talks with the Czech prime minister, Andrej Babiš, on Monday, the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, agreed to let Czech visitors who have already booked holidays in Hungary for September enter the country, the foreign ministry said.The easing was subsequently extended to Poland and Slovakia, the ministry said in a statement. Visitors coming to Hungary have to produce a negative Covid test not older than five days, which Budapest says represents sufficient safety guarantees.As of Monday, Hungary had reported 6,139 coronavirus cases with 615 deaths. The number of new cases has surged in recent days, just as Hungary prepared to start the school year.World Health Organization director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has taken issue with the opinion that high death rates from Covid-19 are not a major concern if it is mainly the elderly dying with the disease.Accepting someone to die because of age is moral bankruptcy at its highest, and we shouldn’t allow our society to behave this way.The WHO chief urged governments around the world to engage with people demonstrating against Covid-19 curbs and listen to their concerns, but stressed protesters needed to understand the virus was dangerous.Tedros said it was important to “listen to what people are asking, what people are saying … we should engage in an honest dialogue”.But he stressed demonstrators have a responsibility to ensure protests are safe.“The virus is real. It is dangerous. It moves fast and it kills. We have to do everything to protect ourselves and to protect others.”Hong Kong began a mass coronavirus testing programme Tuesday overshadowed by fears that China is using the scheme to harvest DNA, while the number of infections in the US surpassed 6m.The voluntary initiative is offering free tests to millions of Hong Kongers as authorities worldwide continue efforts to stamp out an illness that has killed almost 850,000 and infected more than 25 million.But it comes as populations are increasingly wary of coronavirus curbs and distrust grows in governments’ handling of the pandemic, with protesters taking to the streets in a number of major cities in recent days.German demonstrators against mask rules and other restrictions tried to storm parliament in the biggest of several European protests over the weekend.Suspicions about government intentions have done much to undermine the testing programme in Hong Kong, where disillusionment with officials has been fuelled by China’s crushing of the city’s democracy movement.The scheme is part of an attempt to stamp out a third wave of infections in the densely populated finance hub that began in late June and saw the city reimpose economically painful social distancing measures.But the programme has been hampered by a limited response due to the involvement of mainland Chinese testing firms and doctors - and swirling public fears of the harvesting of data and DNA.Since registration began on Saturday, 510,000 people have signed up to take the free tests. Health experts advising the government however have said as many as 5 million people might need to be tested for the scheme to end the current wave.I reported earlier that India had added nearly 2m cases to its coronavirus case load in August … we now have today’s figures and the country has added a further 69,921 new infections on Tuesday, the lowest daily jump in six days, taking its overall total to 3.69m infections. This is based on more than 1m tests.The country has had the single highest daily total of new cases for more than three weeks, according to a Reuters tally.The death toll rose by 819 on Tuesday to 65,288.How Covid-19 is impacting people’s dreams is the subject of a study being run by a cross-disciplinary team of academics from Australia, the UK and Finland.“Pandemic dreams” are already the subject of a book of essays from Harvard research Deirdre Barrett, alongside reams of popular audience articles and social media posts.“Certainly there were different lines of evidence that inspired this project,” says Dr Jennifer Windt, a senior research fellow in philosophy at Monash University, who will be working on the project alongside researchers from the University of Cambridge in England and Finland’s University of Turku. “People seem to be reporting weird dreams, but also generally they seem to be reporting that they’re dreaming more … and unfortunately often having more negatively toned dreams and nightmares. So that was part of it.”Participants in the “Covid on Mind” study, which will be anonymous, will keep a dream log and undertake a “daily mind-wandering task” over a period of two weeks.But first, they will be asked to complete a wellbeing questionnaire that examines their mental state, and “concerns related to coronavirus specifically” to give the researchers “some measure of how people are doing, how concerned they are about the virus, and changes related to the virus in their everyday lives”.The cross-disciplinary project involves cognitive neuroscientists, psychologists and sleep and dream researchers, many of whom study how dreams reflect people’s mental states while awake. “We have people on the team who’ve done a lot of work on emotion and dreams … the pandemic seems to be an ideal opportunity to study that,” says Widnt.She says there is already a body of research that suggests “negatively toned” dreams are associated with issues like anxiety and depression, and wonders, “Could changes in dreams be a marker to help identify people with mental health issues?”“We’re not interested in interpreting the dreams in any sense,” she explains. “This is really a quite different approach that tries to get objective numbers … It’s really about quantifying changes in emotion, and relating them to measures of waking thought and emotion.”Other researchers will be investigating the number of social interactions people report, both in their dreams and mind-wandering tasks. “Dreaming has been proposed to have a possibly evolutionary function in fine-tuning social skills,” she says. “We know that many of our interactions have gone virtual … does that have an impact on how people dream?”“Dream bizarreness”, which Windt describes as “a technical word for all of the different ways in which dreams can be weird”, will also be a focus for Melbourne-based PhD student Manuela Kirberg.In order to quantify how bizarre, social, positive or negative a dream is, independent raters read through dream reports and score them using established criteria. They rate the occurrence of “emotion terms” and “social content”. Any comments that do not form part of a dream’s description – for instance the dreamer’s own interpretation – are discarded, and raters talk to each other to ensure there is “sufficient agreement” in how they are scoring the dreams. “You need a lot of patience and sticktoitiveness to do that scoring, as well as training,” Windt says. “A lot of dreams are pretty mundane.”The researchers are currently recruiting volunteers for the study – and anyone over the age of 18 who lives in the UK, Australia or Finland can participate. The study will be open for up to 12 months. The resulting dataset will feature well over 1,000 dreams and daydreams.Windt is particularly curious about the dreams and mind-wandering of people in lockdown. “It’s obviously horrible what’s happening in Melbourne,” she says. But, “I do think it is a particularly interesting period to get people involved … How do their dreams relate to the changing outer circumstance?”Tens of thousands of girls across Asia are being forced into marriage by desperate families plunged into poverty because of the coronavirus pandemic, as campaigners warn years of progress tackling the practice is being undone.Child marriage has long been common in traditional communities from the Indonesian archipelago to India, Pakistan and Vietnam, but numbers had been decreasing as charities made inroads by encouraging access to education and women’s health services.These improvements are being eroded as the impact of the virus causes mass job losses leaving parents struggling to feed their families, experts say.“All of the gains we’ve made in the past decade are really going to suffer,” said Shipra Jha, from ngo Girls Not Brides.“Child marriage is firmly rooted in gender inequality and patriarchal structures. What’s happened is that it’s become compounded in the Covid era,” she said.Poverty, lack of education, and insecurity, drive child marriage even in stable times, so periods of crises exacerbate the problem, the charity says.Worldwide, an estimated 12 million girls are wed every year before the age of 18, according to the UN.But the organisation has now warned that unless urgent action is taken to tackle the economic and social impact of the virus - an additional 13 million child marriages will take place in the next decade.In Asia, charities report the snowball of forced unions has already begun, estimating tens of thousands are already affected - though hard data is yet to be collated.“There has been an increase in child marriages during this lockdown period. There is rampant unemployment, job loss. Families are barely able to make ends meet, so they think it’s best to get their young daughters married off,” said Rolee Singh who runs India’s ‘1 Step 2 Stop Child Marriage’ campaign.Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who has consistently downplayed the severity of the coronavirus outbreak, said on Monday that nobody will be forced to have the vaccine against Covid-19 once it is developed.The comments come after the government earmarked millions of dollars for the purchase and future production of vaccinations as Brazil suffers the second worst outbreak of the pandemic outside the United States.“No one can force anyone to get a vaccine,” he said in response to a question from a supporter, a video posted on social media showed.Brazil has become a hot spot in recent months, with 3,908,272 confirmed cases and 121,381 deaths from Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus.On Monday, the Health Ministry reported 45,961 new cases of the coronavirus and 553 deaths from Covid-19 in the past 24 hours.Bolsonaro, who recently recovered from the coronavirus, has downplayed its severity, calling it a “small flu”, ignoring scientific recommendations and opposing quarantine efforts by Brazilian governors and mayors.Despite this, his government earmarked 1.9 billion reais (US$346 million) in early August in funding to buy 100 million doses of the vaccine candidate being developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca PLC and to eventually produce it in Brazil.The Sao Paulo state government is also working on a potential vaccine with China’s Sinovac Biotech. Brazil hopes distribution of doses of either vaccine can begin at the start of next year.Bolsonaro’s acting health minister Eduardo Pazuello, an Army general, has appointed a veterinarian to lead Brazil’s vaccination program.Lauricio Monteiro Cruz, who was working at the ministry on the control of the parasitic disease leishmaniasis, is a specialist in the prevention of diseases in animals, according to his CV on the ministry website.Bolsonaro’s response to the virus outbreak has led to significant street demonstrations, and a billboard campaign accusing him of mishandling the pandemic, at the cost of people’s lives.French pupils go back to school Tuesday as schools across Europe open their doors to greet returning pupils this month, nearly six months after the coronavirus outbreak forced them to close and despite rising infection rates across the continent.Many teachers and parents are worried the reopening of schools will accelerate the spread of Covid-19, but governments have insisted it should go ahead.French children return to school on Tuesday, after a two-month long summer break that followed two weeks of obligatory schooling just before the holidays.Teachers and pupils between 11 and 18 will be required to wear masks both indoors and outdoors. Pupils in Belgium will also return to school on Tuesday, while those in Germany went back last month.Masks will also be compulsory in Greece, where children are expected to return to school next Monday with a maximum of 25 children per class.In England and Wales - where children return to school this week after a six-month closure - the government initially said masks in schools would not be necessary, but reversed its policy last Wednesday.The new guidance advises secondary school students aged 11 to 18 and staff to wear face coverings in corridors and communal areas, in places with local virus restrictions.The Spanish government has insisted all children over the age of six must wear masks at all times and wash their hands at least five times a day.Children should maintain a distance of 1.5 metres from each other, and regional governments have hired additional teachers to reduce class sizes.South Korea’s coronavirus cases have remained under 300 for a third day in a row. On Tuesday the CDC recorded 235 cases, including 222 local infections. It took the total number of cases recorded in the country over the 20,000 mark, to 20,182, since the first infection was reported on 20 January. “It is worrisome that more than 30 percent of the confirmed COVID-19 patients over the past two weeks are those aged more than 60,” vice health minister, Kim Ganglip, said in a briefing. “The risk of dying due to the COVID-19 virus is highest among older people and those with underlying diseases.”Of the new cases, 175 were in the capital area. India has added nearly 2m coronavirus cases in one month, jumping from 1.64m infections at the end of July to 3.62m at the end of August. It’s the highest single-month rise recorded in any country in a month throughout the pandemic. The next highest monthly total is the US, which added 1.91m cases in July. And we have just heard from the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, who says when he announces his road map out of the Australian state’s six-week lockdown, there will be two roadmaps ... one for regional parts in the state and one for metropolitan Melbourne. Andrews said:And ultimately, this is all about making sure that the sacrifice, the pain, the amazing work that Victorians have done counts for something.It’s no good doing this too fast, opening up too much, too quickly, only to be open for just a few weeks and back in lockdown by Christmas time.We don’t want that. We want to do everything we can to avoid that.In Australia we are getting some more information about cases in the most populous state of New South Wales. The state has 13 new cases, 11 of which are locally acquired and linked to known clusters, including a cluster in the centre of the city, which now totals 41 cases. China has reported 10 new Covid-19 cases, down from 17 reported a day earlier, the country’s health authority said on Tuesday.The National Health Commission said in a statement that all new cases were imported infections involving travellers from overseas, marking the 16th consecutive day of no local infections.The number of new asymptomatic cases rose to 34 from 19 a day earlier. China does not count symptomless coronavirus infections as confirmed cases.The total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in mainland China now stands at 85,058, while the death toll remained unchanged at 4,634.There are 14 new cases of COVID-19 to report in New Zealand today - nine in MIQ (managed quarantine) and five in the community, all related to the Auckland cluster. Yesterday Auckland dropped down from Level 3 to Level 2, despite more cases emerging.There are 10 people with COVID-19 in hospital today, two of whom are in ICU care.Forty-four thousand people have now been through managed isolation in New Zealand. With today’s 14 new cases, New Zealand’s total number of active cases is 132. Of those, 33 are imported cases in MIQ facilities, and 99 are community cases.Yesterday the country’s laboratories processed 8,599 tests for COVID-19, bringing the total number of tests completed to date to 766,626.Quarantine minister Megan Woods said: “Covid is growing, not slowing around the world”, and New Zealand is no exception, with cases continuing to arrive at the border. Private security guards are now being “phased out” of isolation facilities, and replaced by defence force personnel. Eventually, the deployment of defence force officers in managed isolation facilities would be larger than New Zealand’s entire deployment to East Timor.We are about to get New Zealand’s daily media briefing on coronavirus cases, today hosted by minister for managed isolation and quarantine Megan Woods and Air Commodore Darryn Webb.Local media is reporting that there are 14 new cases in the country, nine of which are in managed isolation, and five in the community. Our NZ correspondent, Eleanor Ainge Roy, will bring us the updates."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4343071.1598891294!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"teachers with underlying health issues worried on safety asti","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA recent snapshot survey carried out by the ASTI found a quarter of secondary schools didn’t have warm water while more than eight out of 10 had poor ventilation. Photograph: Alan BetsonTeachers with underlying health issues, who are worried about the risks of returning to teach children and young adults, need further reassurance that all possible measures are being taken to ensure their safety, the Association of Secondary Teachers (ASTI) has said. Speaking on Monday as hundreds of primary and secondary schools around the country reopened their doors to students for the first time in nearly six months, ASTI president Ann Piggott warned that many educators remained deeply concerned about the spread of Covid-19 in school settings. A recent snapshot survey carried out by the teachers’ union found a quarter of secondary schools didn’t have warm water while more than eight out of 10 had poor ventilation, she said. The union has also heard of teachers correcting copy books and eating lunches in their cars in recent days because staff rooms were no longer available, she added. “Teachers want to be back in school but we need to ensure funding so that buildings can cope with changes while students who must stay home have access to wifi and a computer. Teachers now have to move from room to room and they’re telling us they want a Perspex screen around their desk. We would also like to see temperature checks and fast-tracked testing in schools.”Some teachers remained very worried about their health, said Ms Piggott who has spoken to cancer survivors and one teacher who had a lung removed. “Teachers who are in very high-risk groups are in some cases being forced back into work without clarification on support from the HSE,” she said. Early retirementTeachers’ Union of Ireland (TUI) general secretary Michael Gillespie said some older teachers, who under normal circumstances would have remained in their jobs a few more years, were retiring early rather than risking contracting the virus. Those with vulnerable family members at home were also concerned about carrying Covid-19 from the school to their loved ones, he added. Mr Gillespie said he expected “lots of teething problems” over the coming weeks as schools adjust to new practices and he hoped to see rapid Covid-19 testing introduced for teachers as soon as possible. However, he said he had “huge confidence” in young people’s awareness of the gravity of the health situation. Pairic Clerkin, chief executive of the Irish Primary Principals’ Network (IPPN), said feedback from members in recent days revealed “a great relief” that schools were back open. Mr Clerkin paid tribute to the principals who gave up their summer holidays to ensure schools were ready for the students’ return. Asked to comment on social media reports of large crowds of parents and students gathering at school gates for drop-off and pick-up, Mr Clerkin said schools needed a few days to settle into a routine but the vast majority of parents were “very aware and supportive” of social distancing measures and the use of face coverings. Hugh Cronin, principal of St Catherine’s National School in Ballymoe, Co Cork, said he had received “100 per cent positive feedback” from parents and staff since the school reopened last Thursday, describing the opening as “a joyous occasion”.Mr Cronin, who worked 12-14 hour days through the summer to ensure the primary school was ready for its 116 students, said the start of the school year “actually felt like getting my summer holidays”. “Work was relentless before that,” he told The . “We’ve all been learning from this and it comes down to mutual respect. It’s been a huge cultural change for the school but the children have accepted it straight away. It’s been about keeping the lines of communication open. We want to be sure our staff feel safe and comfortable in the school too.” "},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"A speed limit is fairer than a fuel tax, which affects the less well-off to a greater degreeThe teenager elicits hope, admiration and even awe in people many times her ageDismantling of protections \u0026lsquois making it harder for future administrations to use science\u0026rsquo"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: A new survey brings arresting confirmations of declineThe by-the-wind sailor\u0026rsquos sworn foe, the violet sea snail, floats upside-down alongside itMichael Viney: North Atlantic\u0026rsquos top predator now shares island with 13 other speciesMichael Viney: The wayside ashes of the west stand as defiantly healthy emblems of their kindInidual ants are certainly not smart, but their group wisdom may exceed our ownMichael Viney: Irish numbers have more than doubled since the counts of Operation Seafarer in 1970Michael Viney: A predator denning in parks, gardens and wasteland gets mixed responsesA beefed-up, independent National Parks and Wildlife Service would be just the ticketMichael Viney: Wild grasses have loved the mood swings of our climate this yearAnother Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalities"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4343632.1598942935!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"new list of names for storms in ireland uk and netherlands announced","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSwimmers enjoying the swell in Dublin Bay during Storm Francis at the end of August.

File photograph: The At least 55 cases of Covid-19 in August have been linked to some form of sporting activity, the Department of Health has said.The Health Protection Surveillance Centre, which monitors outbreaks of the virus, says those who have been infected have had 365 close contacts, with each case generating an average of 6.6 close contacts.Public health officials last night ruled out any immediate lifting of the ban on spectators at sporting events, which was imposed in mid-August. Acting chief medical officer Dr Ronan Glynn said the focus for now was on making the reopening of schools work over the next few weeks, after which other measures would be examined.The GAA, which believes the measure will force spectators indoors to more risky environments, has asked officials to present the underlying evidence.Although no meeting has taken place between the GAA and the National Public Health Emergency Team, Dr Glynn said he was happy to meet all sporting bodies.Meanwhile, Cabinet is expected today to sign off on a plan to supply free flu vaccines to more than two million people.However, the delivery to Ireland of flu jabs is being delayed due to problems relating to Covid-19.Doses for 1.4 million adults will be made available from mid-September. For the first time, a mass vaccination of 600,000 children is planned, but this will not start until mid- to late October, it is understood. This is close to the recommended timeline of within two weeks of the annual flu season.With new figures showing Ireland’s incidence of Covid-19 higher than in Sweden, the UK, Germany and 14 other European countries, Dr Glynn defended public health emergency team’s response in recent months.With 30.6 cases per 100,000 population over the last fortnight, the incidence of the disease in Ireland is up to 12 times higher than it was two months ago, according to figures from the European Centre for Disease Control.However, Dr Glynn denied that public health officials had “taken their eye off the ball” and put the surge down to an “explosive” and “unusual” growth in clusters with “significant knock-on effects”.He admitted there were “some delays” in testing large clusters in Co Kildare but said these issue were being addressed and “lessons have been learned”. Ireland was “there with the best countries in Europe with testing”, he insisted.Businesses in Co Kildare yesterday welcomed the Government’s decision to lift restrictions imposed on the county last month following a steep rise in cases, initially linked to outbreaks in local meat processing plants.‘Apparent stabilisation’The decision was made despite Kildare still having the highest incidence of any county in the Republic, although the trend is downwards.A further 53 confirmed cases of Covid-19 were reported by public health emergency team on Monday evening, and no new deaths. Dublin accounted for 25 of the new cases and Limerick for 11.Dr Glynn said it was too early to read anything into the improvement seen in recent days but added that he was heartened by the “apparent stabilisation” in numbers.Any review of the green list of countries from which travellers do not have to quarantine on arriving in Ireland, is a matter for Government, he said.The public health emergency team has undertaken an internal review of its operations, according to Dr Glynn, and its role would be reviewed externally as part of the Government’s planned framework for tackling the disease.The US yesterday surpassed six million cases of Covid-19, including one million new infections in the past month.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Coverings should cover the wearer\u0026rsquos nose and go under their chinSaidhbh\u0026iacuten among storm names suggested by members of the publicThose who have been infected have had 365 close contacts, according to health watchdogBowel, cervical and breast checks way behind due to Covid-19 restrictionsSchool reopening has been \u0026lsquoa joyous occasion\u0026rsquo says Cork national school principalGovernment has not yet been decided whether to submit one or two namesThird-level capacity to be increased in response to Covid-19 pandemicAsthma Society of Ireland says ban has resulted in more than 350 fewer annual deaths\u0026lsquoA lot of businesses have closed...there is a lot of derelict buildings around\u0026rsquoSimon Coveney, Maire\u0026aacuted McGuinness and Frances Fitzgerald comment on EU Commissioner roleOrder requires Facebook to provide Lisa McGowan with details on account holdersFamily of children with Covid-like symptoms must self-isolate ahead of test results, public health officials sayGarda\u0026iacute investigating cause of blaze at four-bedroom propertyPublic health officials concerned about alcohol and congregating in queues at venuesHigh Court hears that refusal of grades to 17-year-old is \u0026lsquounjust and discriminatory\u0026rsquoAccused (17) charged with murder of Azzam Raguragai (18) at Finsbury Park in DundrumRaffle by Covid-19 survivors raised close to \u0026euro1m for frontline healthcare support staffPatrick Curtis and Mohammed Smew are the last two men sentenced for involvement in plan to kill Patrick HutchStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4343264.1598906496!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"party leaders to meet again today to nominate replacement for phil hogan","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMEP Mairead McGuinness: Sources in Brussels said Ms McGuinness is highly thought-of by European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen. Photograph: Nick BradshawDiscussions between the three party leaders in the Coalition Government about who should be nominated as Ireland’s European commissioner to replace Phil Hogan will resume on Tuesday morning, after discussions on Monday night ended without the selection of a nominee.Government sources said Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney is keen on the nomination, but with European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen seeking two names – a man and a woman – there are fears in Government that he could be disappointed.It has not yet been decided whether to submit one or two names. Some Ministers believe that the request for two names is an infringement on national governments’ right to select their nominee, though others think that not complying with the request is a high-risk strategy which could result in a job of lesser importance for the eventual nominee.However, sources acknowledge that the chances of retaining the trade portfolio are slim. There were discussions on the nomination on Monday between Dublin and the commission, it is understood.SoundingsEarlier, MEP and former minister for justice Frances Fitzgerald entered the race to replace Mr Hogan, confirming on Monday morning that she was interested in the post, and acknowledging that it was a “difficult decision” for the Government. She has taken soundings in Dublin in recent days, it is understood.Ms Fitzgerald’s confirmation of her interest brings to three the list of supposed Fine Gael candidates, with Mr Coveney and the MEP Mairead McGuinness.Sources in Brussels said Ms McGuinness – a vice-president of the European Parliament and strong contender for the next presidency of the parliament – is highly thought-of by Ms von der Leyen.Meanwhile, Taoiseach Micheál Martin is also likely to nominate a new minister for agriculture this week to replace Dara Calleary, who resigned in the wake of the revelations about the Oireachtas golf dinner.FrontrunnerParty sources say Donegal TD Charlie McConalogue is the frontrunner to replace Mr Calleary. Mr McConalogue was agriculture spokesman in the last Dáil, and has served as a Junior Minister in the Department of Justice since July.If appointed, Mr McConalogue will become the third agriculture minister to hold the office since the formation of the Government at the end of June. Prior to the resignation of Mr Calleary, Offaly TD Barry Cowen resigned after a controversy surrounding a drink-driving ban from 2016.Elsewhere, the Cabinet will on Tuesday discuss a proposal to expand the free flu vaccine for the coming season, with the Government anxious to minimise the risks of a second wave of Covid-19 occurring at the same time as the flu surge."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Move comes as country set to be first to make social media giants pay for news sourced from local providersPeople encouraged to practice \u0026lsquoa bit of smiling with the eyes\u0026rsquo as masks made mandatoryQuick vote expected to maximise influence of outgoing prime minister and his alliesAs Abe quits he will be remembered more as a caretaker PM than a radical reformerAbe tells shocked nation that return of bowel condition means he cannot continueItinerary of three-week visit by investigators fuels concern over China\u0026rsquos co-operationBrenton Tarrant killed 51 Muslim worshippers at two mosques in New Zealand last yearLong-serving president already general secretary of the party and head of the militaryTed Hui and Lam Cheuk-ting detained as part of crackdown under new security lawVictims and relatives seek life without parole for man who killed 51 in 2019 attackResearchers say man had no Covid-19 symptoms the second time, suggesting immune system kept virus somewhat in checkLocals and police search the debris after five-storey structure crumbles in MahadLuon Sovath, who has spent decades fighting for human rights, was the victim of a vicious smear campaign this summerFears that country teetering on edge of major outbreak supported by data on rise in daily casesWhite supremacist killed 51 worshippers at two New Zealand mosques in March 2019Health condition \u0026lsquovery worrying\u0026rsquo after drinking tea that allies believe was laced with poisonDecision to transfer Kremlin critic ill with suspected poisoning after day of lobbyingProtests over last two months most serious threat yet to prime minister\u0026rsquos administrationLack of foreign visitors has facilitated increase in poaching and loss of revenueReport by US intelligence agencies sheds light on actions \u0026ndash and inactions \u0026ndash that created global crisisStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Jared Kushner urges Palestinians not to be \u0026lsquostuck in the past\u0026rsquo during visit to finalise pactMustapha Adib must satisfy international donors and also deal with warring campsMustapha Adib faces task of rebuilding public trust after decades of failed political leadershipHouses were built on private Palestinian lands in unauthorised West Bank outpostMike Pompeo\u0026rsquos tour of the Middle East failed to gain support for normalising ties with IsraelOne-time revolutionary Shia movement now a status quo party opposing popular protestsMore than 2,200 cases reported in 24 hours as number of infections surges to 365,606Netanyahu says now is not the time to drag the country into an unwanted fourth electionSaudi minister says \u0026lsquopeace must be achieved\u0026rsquo on the basis of international agreementsOne found guilty, three acquitted in UN-backed tribunal into killing of former Lebanese PMCourt rules there is no proof Syria was involved in Hariri\u0026rsquos assassinationFour low-ranking members of the Shia Muslim Hezbollah political party are accused of killing the former prime minister and 21 others in a massive bombing in 2005Two countries taking steps towards normal relations with telephone links and flightsPutin suggestion came after Trump said he would trigger a \u0026lsquosnapback\u0026rsquo of sanctionsAs inquiry into Beirut blast gets under way, rescue of country not ruling class urgedThursday\u0026rsquos announcement underlines split in Arab world on Palestinian questionIsraeli right wing furious over decision to drop plans for annexation of parts of the occupied West BankDire condition of Libyan migrant detention centres condemned by human rights groupsCountries to open diplomatic relations for first time and Palestine accuses UAE of selling outAgreement between the two countries described as \u0026lsquoa complete sellout\u0026rsquo of PalestiniansStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4332116.1597668041!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"inside joe biden s race of a lifetime to be us president","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDemocratic presidential candidate Joe Biden: Should he make it to the White House, Biden would have completed the longest marathon in US political history. Photograph: Olivier DoulieryAFP via Getty ImagesIt was late afternoon on February 2nd, the eve of the Iowa caucuses. We were jammed into a high-school gymnasium in Des Moines, the state capital, for Joe Biden’s closing rally.No one thought he would win the primary season’s talismanic opening contest the following day. Nor was he expected to come close to beating Bernie Sanders, the socialist Vermonter, in New Hampshire the next week. Though he was still ahead in the national polls, the 77-year-old former vice-president was treated as yesterday’s news.A crowd of several hundred was waiting unexpectantly. Biden entered roughly half an hour late, accompanied by a phalanx of retired politicians: John Kerry (76), the former secretary of state Chris Dodd (75), the retired senator from Connecticut Tom Vilsack (69), former governor of Iowa and Harold Schaitberger (73), president of the International Association of Firefighters.The oxygen seemed to drain from the room. As Biden’s surrogates spoke one after the other, the air got progressively thinner. By the time the candidate got up to speak, it was positively embalmed. “This is like a wake,” joked one veteran television anchor. Biden’s low-key soliloquy did little to lift the energy.Such are the limits of conventional wisdom. Twenty-seven days later, Biden grabbed the Democratic mantle after sweeping the South Carolina primary. With the notable exception of Sanders, who fought on for another five weeks, most of the rest of the field dropped out and endorsed him. It was a breathtaking twist.With hindsight, Biden officials say they always knew he would be the Democratic nominee. They were playing the long game. “We made a decision from the start not to listen to the loudest voices on Twitter,” says Stef Feldman, Biden’s policy director. That was not how many sounded at the time. When I asked a Biden staffer in Des Moines about the campaign’s mood, he used the TV anchor’s same funereal analogy.Who could blame them? Biden’s long history of running for the White House offered no cause for hope. Over a  of more than 32 years, he had not won a single primary. In 1987, he crashed out months before the voting began, having been accused of plagiarising a speech by Neil Kinnock, leader of the British Labour party.In 2008, he quit after having won just 0.9 per cent of the Iowa caucus vote. “At that point, most people thought his presidential career was over,” says Shailagh Murray, then a journalist with the Washington Post, who went on to become Biden’s deputy chief of staff. He had at least another 12 years to go. Nobody that night imagined that Barack Obama, winner of the Iowa caucus, would go on to pick Biden as his ­running mate.Ceremonial presidentThe vicissitudes of Biden’s 50 years in politics ought to make anyone sceptical of forecasts for this November. In the absence of time machines, we can only go by the numbers. Both the betting markets (about two to one in Biden’s favour) and the polls (an average eight-percentage-point lead over Donald Trump) suggest Biden will be America’s 46th president.What manner of president would he make? Half of Washington claims to know the man well. At a year above the median US male’s life expectancy, many expect him to be a ceremonial president. Even Biden’s close friends admit his energy and power of recall are not what they were.His would be a restorationist presidency – an erasure of what he is fond of describing as the Trumpian “aberration”. Others, notably Trump, depict him as a geriatric prisoner of the Democratic Party’s left. Most agree that whatever his agenda, and whatever the time of day, he would probably still talk too much.The word “logorrhea” (a tendency to extreme loquacity) has recently come into fashion. Biden’s campaign is keen to emphasise he would not, like Trump, be the “Twitterer-in-chief”.Those who know him the best – many of whom spoke to me for this profile – are in little doubt about the character he would bring to the presidency. Their Biden may stray too readily into schmaltz. But his empathy for people is real. In this pandemic-blighted election year, that quality could count for a lot.“Biden is the same guy I first met in 1969 – he was full of piss and vinegar,” says Louis Susman, a Chicago-based investor and former ambassador to the UK. “He doesn’t suffer from inner demons, he doesn’t bear grudges and he loves being around people.”Should he make it to the White House, Biden would have completed the longest marathon in US political history. No other serious figure has tried this long to make it over the finishing line in recent history.A majority of Americans were not born when Biden first entered national politics. At 30, he was the fifth youngest senator in the country’s history after he won office in 1972. Biden’s 48-year political career is older than John F Kennedy, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama when they were elected.Yet he sounds remarkably similar today to the ambitious, blue-collar Irish-American that he was then. Staffers tried and failed to get him to avoid using words such as “record player” during the 2020 primaries. Calling someone a “horse’s ass” is no longer thought to be cutting. In an interview with Kitty Kelley in 1974, Biden worried about being seen as a “gay young bachelor” around Washington – by which he meant “happy”, not “LGBTQ”.So popular are Biden’s anachronisms that there is even a “Biden insult bot” – a Twitter algorithm – to which fans can turn. “You got something stuck in your craw, you milk-swillin’ circus peanut,” reads one tweet. “Shut your piehole, you hood-winked britch soiler,” reads another.‘Amtrak Joe’Most American voters already know of the ­tragedy that struck Biden in his early career. A few weeks after he was elected to the Senate, he lost his wife Neilia and one-year-old daughter, Naomi, in a car crash while they were Christmas shopping in Delaware, his home state.His sons, Beau, aged three, and Hunter, aged two, survived but were hospitalised with severe injuries. Most people would have disintegrated. Biden considered not taking his Senate seat. In the end, he was persuaded to be sworn in at the hospital beside one of his sons. He said he could only continue in politics if he saw his kids every morning and night.Thus was born “Amtrak Joe” – the senator who took the 90-minute journey each evening from Washington to Wilmington to say goodnight to his sons. He commuted until 2008, long after the boys had grown up. Subtracting a tenth of nights for other travel, and nearly half the year for recess and weekends, I calculate that Biden spent at least 21,000 hours – or three years of his life – on that train.“He knew the names of every conductor and they all loved him,” says Paul Laudicina, Biden’s legislative director between 1977 and 1982. “Often, he would still be talking when he boarded, and I would go to Wilmington with him and then cross the platform and come straight back.”In the 1974 Kelley interview, the famously acerbic journalist said Biden “reeks of decency”. He nevertheless managed to sound almost Trumpian about his deceased wife. “Let me show you my favourite picture of her,” he says, holding up a snapshot of Neilia in a bikini. “She had the best body of any woman I ever saw. She looks better than a Playboy bunny, doesn’t she?” Kelley described his office as a shrine to Neilia.Biden recently conceded that he has been too invasive of women’s personal space – “handsiness” has also entered the DC lexicon. Unlike some of his contemporaries, however, he has not been dogged by rumours of infidelity. A former Senate staffer, Tara Reade, accused him earlier this year of sexually assaulting her in a corridor in 1993. Biden denies it and her story has been criticised as inconsistent.In 1977 Biden married Jill Tracy Jacobs, a teacher based in Wilmington. On their first date he dressed in a jacket. When he dropped her back home he shook her hand. According to What it Takes, the ­celebrated 1988 campaign book by the late ­Richard Ben Cramer, Jill said she could not believe such men still existed. “Jill is Biden’s least appreciated strength,” says Susman, who often hosted the Bidens for Thanksgiving in his Nantucket home.Much of Biden’s sense of gravity comes from her. Even when her husband was vice-president, Jill Biden continued to teach every day at a community college in Northern Virginia. When he left office in 2017, the Bidens’ net worth was less than $500,000. They still hadn’t paid off the mortgage on their Wilmington home.Irish-Catholic and handsomeUntil he was rescued from near-certain genteel decline by Obama, Biden was defined by his disastrous 1988 presidential bid. Most of the people who helped him on that jinxed quest, including Ted Kaufman, his long-running chief of staff, Michael Donilon, his chief strategist today, and Donilon’s brother Tom, Biden’s foreign-policy adviser, are still around him.They are mostly Irish-American and very tight-knit. Cathy Russell, Tom Donilon’s wife, was Jill Biden’s chief of staff when she was “second lady”. Her husband is tipped as a possible secretary of state. Kaufman is running Biden’s presidential transition – that long and rickety bridge between victory and inauguration.In the 1988 campaign, Biden tried to present himself as the new John F Kennedy – young, Irish-Catholic and handsome. It never quite took hold. Then he saw a video of Kinnock’s soaring oratory – “Why am I the first Kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to get to university?” That was the middle-class poetry Biden had been lacking – the story of how the sons and daughters of coal miners had been lifted up by the welfare state, Britain’s version of the New Deal.“He grabbed that tape and took it home he inhaled the thing,” wrote Cramer. “It was like when Barbra Streisand came on the radio – Kinnock was singing Joe’s song.” For the most part, Biden credited Kinnock’s words. But the rival Michael Dukakis campaign found one tape where Biden had not. They leaked it.Suddenly, Biden was inundated with calls asking whether his grandfather had been a coal miner (none of his forebears had been). “It looked like Joe didn’t just steal the words, it looked like he ripped off Kinnock’s life,” Cramer wrote. A few months after dropping out, Biden had a near-fatal ­aneurysm. Then another. He was given a 50-50 chance of ­surviving the first nine-hour operation.“Joe wouldn’t be alive today if he had still been running for president,” says Kaufman. “He wouldn’t have had the time to get his headaches checked out.” Or, as Biden said when he emerged from the anaesthetic: “Now I know why the campaign ended like it did.” For what it’s worth, Kinnock’s Labour Party lost the election too.Emotional antennaeBiden’s 2008 loss left less of a mark on him, partly because he became vice-president less than a year later. “How could you begrudge losing to Barack Obama?” says Murray. “Obama was like The Beatles.”The campaign Biden still regrets was the one that he didn’t fight in 2016. His reluctance stemmed from another tragedy, the death in 2015 of his son Beau from brain cancer. But he had little encouragement from Obama, who had already committed to backing Hillary Clinton. Biden’s internal polls show that he would have beaten Trump. But he had little chance of wresting the crown from Clinton, whose machine he could not hope to match.In his memoir Promise Me, Dad, named after Beau’s request that his father stay in politics, Biden recounts his anger following a Politico story that he was exploiting his son’s death for electoral purposes. “It exceeded even my worst expectations of what the opposition was going to be like,” he wrote. In truth, he could not discuss running without breaking down. “He would literally start to cry every time we raised the subject,” says a Biden ­confidante.In another cycle, Biden’s lachrymosity might have been an albatross. During coronavirus, his emotional antennae look like a virtue. More than 165,000 Americans have now died in the pandemic. That toll is likely to be approaching a quarter of a million by early November.Trump’s inability to express condolences for America’s grieving families could not be further apart from Biden’s. In 2016, anger was the dominant political emotion. In 2020, it feels more like sadness. “If Trump were matter, then Biden is anti-matter – their characters are opposites,” says Laurence Tribe, a Harvard law professor who has been advising Biden on constitutional matters since the mid-1980s.When Biden was vice-president, Norm Ornstein, a veteran Congressional watcher, lost his son in a tragic accident. “The moment he heard, Biden telephoned and spent an hour on the phone with me and my wife, talking us through it,” says ­Ornstein. “The next day I received a handwritten letter of condolence from him. There is nothing fake about his sympathy. He feels it deeply.”Andrew Yang, the maverick hit of the Democratic primaries, says: “When most people hadn’t figured out who I was, Joe took me aside and was very gracious and friendly. This was just as true when things were going badly for him – he’s always steady and good-natured, in public and in private.”‘Shoot. Me. Now’Some in Biden’s world admit they have one or two concerns about the election and beyond. Chief of these is his tendency to make gaffes. In that sense, the lockdown has a silver lining: there is no campaign trail to avoid. Zoom is easier to manage.When Obama was elected to the US Senate in 2004, Biden invited him to join the foreign relations committee, of which he was chairman. Having listened to a trademark Biden disquisition, Obama scribbled a note and handed it to a staffer. It read: “Shoot. Me. Now.”When the two men were discussing how they would handle their White House relationship, Obama said: “I want your advice Joe, I just want it in 10-minute, not 60-minute, increments.” For the most part, Biden complied.Sometimes, he could not help himself. The term “Bidenism” – self-inflicted public humiliation – has long been in currency. “Stand up Chuck, let ’em see ya,” Biden once said to a Missouri state senator in a wheelchair. “Folks, I can tell you, I’ve known eight presidents, three of them intimately,” he said in praise of Obama, adding: “I promise you, the president has a big stick, I promise you,” in a mangled rendition of Theodore Roosevelt’s dictum about speaking softly and carrying a big stick.Fear of such miscues saw the Obama camp “quarantine” Biden for most of the 2012 re-election campaign. This year’s actual quarantine could thus be helpful.Many in Biden world are betting that his choice of Kamala Harris as running mate will immunise him against a record of racial gaffes. Earlier this year, Biden apologised after saying that “you ain’t black” if you would consider voting against him. As a mixed-race American of Indian and Jamaican heritage, the Harris pick will buy Biden more protection.Given Biden’s age, she is far likelier than most running mates to become president. As Biden discovered in the primaries, she also knows how to throw a punch.It is hard to find anyone in Biden’s circle who is losing sleep over three debates with Trump later this year. As Biden showed in 2008 with Sarah Palin and in 2012 with Paul Ryan – the Republican running mates of John McCain and Mitt Romney – he is a surprisingly taut debater.Trump, meanwhile, seems to be afflicted with his own severe dose of logorrhea. His recent boast in a Fox News interview that he recalled five words in order in a cognitive test was greeted with mockery. “I have two words for you,” says a senior adviser, when I ask about Biden’s age and prolixity: “Donald Trump. ”Biden’s peopleNor is the campaign worried about Twitter. When I asked two Biden officials whether he composed his own tweets, or would know how to send one, I got an unexpectedly constipated response: “No one has ever asked us that.” It turns out that Biden does not physically send his own tweets but is involved with their substance.Their second concern is ageing. At 74, Trump is only a smidgen younger than Biden. The difference with Trump is the people with whom Biden would surround himself. Chief among these is Ron Klain, a long-standing Biden aide who is likely to be White House chief of staff. Tony Blinken would probably be his national security adviser.Other top-job contenders would include Tom Donilon and Susan Rice (successive national security advisers to Obama), Kurt Campbell (who ran Asia policy for Obama), Jake Sullivan (who leads Biden’s campaign policy), Nick Burns, a former under secretary of state, and Bill Burns (no relation), a former deputy secretary of state. Michèle Flournoy, a former under secretary of defence, is tipped as a likely Pentagon chief.One adviser predicted that Biden would choose Romney, the Republican senator from Utah, as his secretary of state. That would annoy Vladimir Putin’s Russia, whom Romney described as America’s “number one geopolitical foe”. It would also upset most Democrats for very different reasons.Either way, the contrast between Biden’s friends and the parade of often bizarre cameos that have staffed the Trump administration is glaring. The current president is now on his fourth chief of staff and sixth national security adviser. By contrast, most of Biden’s coterie have known him for decades.“What leaps out about Biden’s people is their competence,” says John Podesta, a senior official in both the Clinton and Obama White Houses. “Neither he nor his team need training wheels.”There are also lingering worries about Hunter Biden, who has long been a source of concern for his father. “Joe has a total blind spot about Hunter,” says a close family friend.Hunter was discharged from the US Navy because he tested positive for cocaine. He launched various business ventures while his father was vice-president. He was accused of monetising the Biden name and subsequently got a seat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.Trump’s attempts to extort Ukraine to supply Biden opposition research resulted in his impeachment last year (though he was acquitted by the Senate). “The campaign just has to keep Hunter out of the picture,” says the friend.Radical platformWhat would Biden actually do in office? Tackling the pandemic would be the first, second and third priority of any incoming president. Little can happen while the US economy is under semi-­permanent lockdown.Beyond that his economic platform is radical by the standards of any recent Democratic president, including Obama. “We would have the largest mobilisation of investments since world war two,” says Feldman. “We would start by putting pandemic logistics and supply on a war footing.”Some people compare the gargantuan challenges of today to 1932, when Franklin D Roosevelt won the election in the middle of the Great Depression. In spite of running a fairly bland campaign, FDR then embarked on a streak of “bold, persistent experimentation” that would remake America.But the differences are more interesting. For all its ravages, coronavirus is not as intractable as the Great Depression. By next January, the world should be closer to having a vaccine. Biden would also be fulfilling the first rule of any job – always follow an under-performer.He could achieve a lot in his first 100 days simply by covering the basics, such as launching a national coronavirus plan, shunning Twitter and not insulting foreign leaders. “If you have an American president at foreign summits eating with his mouth closed and not throwing cutlery around, the world will give him a standing ovation,” says one adviser and friend.Low-hanging foreign-policy fruit that Biden would pluck in his opening days include rejoining the World Health Organisation, the Paris agreement on climate change and the Iran nuclear deal, says Jake Sullivan. He would also convene a global summit to tackle Covid-19.Domestic steps would include stopping work on the US-Mexico border wall (such as it is), setting up a daily coronavirus briefing led by Dr Anthony Fauci or Ron Klain (who led Obama’s Ebola team) and picking an attorney general who would embrace planks of Black Lives Matter’s criminal-justice reform agenda.In his dealings both with Republicans and foreign leaders, Biden would place great stock in personal chemistry. Enjoying the company of people is one area where Biden is as different to Obama as he is to Trump. “The thing that Biden most likes is what Obama liked the least – the ­personal stuff,” says Podesta. Nick Burns says Biden revels in the “constant gardening” of diplomacy – talking frequently to his counterparts.Wishful thinkingSceptics point out that today’s Republican Party is unrecognisable to the one with which Biden grew up. Should he emerge intact from transition with a paranoid Trump, the chances of the defeated party working with him will be slim. Woke nativism will prove a more durable pathogen than Covid-19.Moreover, Biden’s global honeymoon would be unlikely to last long. Most people view his musings about restoring the status quo ante – going back to the world before Trump – as wishful thinking, not that geopolitical trends were particularly stable during the Obama years.China looms far larger today than it did in 2016. Biden’s favourite European, Angela Merkel, Germany’s chancellor, is due to retire by next year. And Biden will neither be inclined – nor likely in a position – to offer Britain’s Boris Johnson the US-UK trade deal he craves.Tony Blinken, Biden’s senior foreign policy adviser, says Biden’s scepticism about Obama’s ineffectual Afghanistan surge looks better and better in hindsight. “I respect Gates tremendously but he just wanted approval for his Afghanistan plan and Biden disagreed,” he says. Biden was in favour of US intervention in Bosnia in 1995, he adds, to convey that Biden is not some ­inveterate peacenik.But Biden’s biggest migraine would probably be at home. In the coming weeks, Trump is likely to make a lot of Biden’s “socialist” agenda – the hundreds of billions he has pledged to spend on everything from college education to rural broadband.Should Biden follow Obama’s example and pick Wall Street-friendly economic advisers, the left’s distrust would soon resurface. Last week, Lawrence Summers, Obama’s chief economic adviser and Bill Clinton’s Treasury secretary, ruled out joining a Biden administration. “My time in government is behind me,” he told the Aspen Security Forum.Happy passengerTo many people’s surprise, the left has largely fallen into line. Bernie Sanders dropped nearly all his most-cherished demands to agree a joint platform with Biden. This is in stark contrast to Sanders’s stand-offish – and simmeringly uneasy – ceasefire with Hillary Clinton in 2016.An estimated one-fifth of Sanders’s supporters in 2016 either sat on their hands or voted for Trump. Biden has not adopted a universal basic income, Medicare for all or a wealth tax – Sanders’s top three priorities.Yet the Vermont senator seems to be a happy passenger on Amtrak Joe’s train. Their policies may differ but their values are not miles apart. “Biden believes that his ultimate calling is to make life better for the middle class,” says Jared Bernstein, an economic adviser. “His watchword is ‘dignity.’” Ted Kaufman adds: “Biden and Bernie may disagree ideologically but they respect each other’s integrity.”Might such charms work on Republicans? I spoke to many people in Biden’s world and none thought the Republican leopard was likely to change its spots. One said: “Joe is still a romantic about the Senate. He will have to learn the hard way.”The omens for old-fashioned Biden-style bipartisanship are not cheerful. Yet there is an improbability to Biden’s odyssey that should give anyone pause. The lyrics may be corny. The music is not. It is an odd mix of Shakespearean tragedy and Shakespearean comedy.I have heard people describe Biden as the embodiment of America’s can-do spirit. Shailagh Murray called him a “spiritual optimist”. A campaign official talked of his “strategic empathy”. I have also heard people call Biden a “clown”, including a former Obama official.Biden loves to talk of when “the man meets the moment”. The joke is that he has said this about himself every time he has run for office. There has never been a moment where Biden does not think he should be residing in the White House.But like a stopped clock, perhaps this time he is right. “Life is about choices, right?” says a former senior CIA official who has interacted with Biden over more than three decades. “Biden or Trump?” He admitted that he occasionally saw Biden as a “mediocre” politician. But he added that Biden always struck him as fundamentally decent, which sounds like a subversive quality in today’s Washington.“Even if you thought that Biden was mediocre,” he continued, “you would take mediocre over catastrophic every time.”– Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Full coverage of the US presidential election 2020Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"flu jabs likely delayed december people","story":"Millions of flu jabs may not be offered until close to Christmas, despite fears of an NHS winter crisis, The  can reveal.Ministers have promised “the biggest flu vaccination programme in history” in a bid to ensure the NHS can cope if it is hit by a “double whammy” of flu and Covid this winter.They pledged to expand the programme to half the population, with healthy over 50s offered a jab, as well as pensioners, those with underlying health conditions, and young children.But now patients have been told it is likely that they will have to wait until December for the jab - despite the fact the flu season may well start earlier, and amid fears of a second wave of Covid.The vaccination programme is due to start this month, with the most vulnerable patients prioritised first. Government guidance, seen by The , says services aim to “extend the vaccine programme in November and December to include the 50-64 year old age group, subject to vaccine supply”.Patients within this age group - including those with underlying conditions such as type two diabetes - have now been told that it is is “likely” that vaccinations for such patients will not even start until December. The government guidance goes on to suggests that flu jabs may not be offered to healthy patients aged 50 to 64 at all. It says only that for this group, the vaccinations “might” be offered - “following prioritisation of other eligible groups and subject to vaccine supply.The Royal College of GPs on Monday night urged the Government to provide assurances about whether there are actually sufficient vaccines to provide an expanded programme. One diabetes patient, aged 63, received a text message from Bounds Green Group Practice in North London, this weekend, stating: “The government have increased the age range of those entitled to the flu vaccination to include those of 50 years and over. Due to availability of vaccines, the vaccinations for this group will likely commence in December.”The message also ordered patients not to ring the surgery to make any enquiries about the matter “as this places additional pressure on our phone lines”.The patient, from Haringey, said she was fearful that by the time the practice gave her a jab it would be too far into the flu season to protect her. “Because I have an underlying condition which makes me vulnerable to Covid and I fall in the new plus-50 age category I thought I was eligible for a flu vaccination on two grounds,” she said. “I was pretty surprised to receive a text message from my practice saying that ‘due to availability of vaccines’, vaccinations ‘will likely commence in December’”.NHS England and the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said that patients with diabetes should have been among those who were prioritised for jabs, under the Government’s guidance.Dr Jonathan Leach, Honorary Secretary for the Royal College of GPs, said it was essential that those in the highest risk groups received their vaccinations.But he said the RCGP was seeking assurances from Government that there is sufficient supply of the vaccine to expand the programme to cover healthy people below the age of 64.Dr Leach said: “For the extra cohort of patients included in the expanded flu programme, for example 50-64-year-olds, we have asked for assurance from the Government that there is enough supply of vaccines to go around. “If there is not enough supply, GPs, our teams and the public need to know, so that patients’ expectations can be managed – and we need clear guidance as to who we should prioritise for a flu jab, outside of those patients most at risk.”A DHSC spokesman said there was high demand internationally for procuring flu vaccines, but said the Government had procured additional supplies for the expanded programme, and intended to roll it out to those aged 50 to 64. He said:  “We have outlined in our flu vaccine plans that those eligible under at risk groups – including diabetes - are to receive a flu vaccine as a priority, and we have secured additional flu vaccines for those who need them. This is the biggest flu vaccine programme in UK history and healthcare staff will work to vaccinate more than 30 million people, millions more than received it last year. “An NHS spokesman said: “GPs are expected to follow the government’s guidance that people with diabetes should be offered the flu vaccination as part of the national programme beginning this month.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"portugal expected placed back red list week new cases rise","story":"Portugal looked set to have quarantine re-imposed on Sunday after coronavirus cases passed the Government’s “red list” threshold.Less than 10 days after the UK’s travel ban was lifted on Portugal, its coronavirus cases rose on Sunday to 21.1 per 100,000 of the population.A rate of above 20 is the “trigger” point most frequently used by the Government for re-imposing the 14-day quarantine on all arrivals from “high risk” countries.It is a sharp increase from the rate of 14.1 per 100,000 when quarantine was lifted on Thursday August 20, and up from 19.4 in the seven days to Saturday August 29.Paul Charles, chief executive of travel consultancy The PC Agency, who compiles a daily list on country-by-country case rates, said: “It will be a tough call for the Government this week - will they want to add Portugal to the red list when they have just taken it off last Saturday?“I suspect they will also be under pressure from Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish First Minister, to add it because it is over 20 per 100,000 and she has taken a consistently tough line. On the face of it, Portugal will be added on the basis of those numbers.”He said the “off-on” decisions on quarantine caused uncertainty for holidaymakers as well as the industry and underlined the need for a comprehensive testing regime on arrival to allow travellers to sidestep the 14-day self-isolation.Searches for flights to Portugal soared after it was taken off the quarantine list, with EasyJet flights sold out by the weekend of August 22. Jet2 added extra seats to Faro from Monday August 24.Since then cases have climbed, particularly in the North including Porto and the Douro Valley, while the Algarve this weekend reported 37 new cases, its worst daily result since lockdown, off the back of an outbreak at a football club.The Portuguese government accepted one reason was the opening of the country to tourists as it announced the country would return to a “state of contingency” from September 15 when it will reimpose restrictions, including limits on gatherings of more than 10 people.Chris Sainty, the British ambassador to Portugal, hinted at the prospective change in tweets on Sunday: “We worked closely with Portugal to ensure the situation here was fully understood by decision-makers in the United Kingdom. But things can change quickly. Travellers should consider their plans carefully and factor in the risks of travelling abroad in this fast-moving situation. As Grant Shapps said, only travel if you are content to unexpectedly quarantine if required.Mr Shapps, the Transport Secretary, warned that people should only travel with “their eyes open” because of the risks of countries being rapidly added.Last week Switzerland, Jamaica and the Czech Republic were stripped from the “safe” travel list. France, Spain, Croatia, Trinidad and Tobago, Austria, Monaco, Malta, Turks \u0026amp Caicos and Aruba, Andorra, Belgium and the Bahamas, Serbia and Luxembourg have also previously been removed.The latest data shows Italy has continued to climb to 14.7 cases per 100,000 people but Greece has dropped back to 13.7, just ahead of the UK’s rate of 13.2.There are also question marks over Gibraltar, which remains out of quarantine but has a rate of 166.1 cases per 100,000 of the population. The Government has retained it on the list because it argues the actual numbers of people contracting coronavirus remain low.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"west running time help belarus","story":"With increasing foreboding, we see the opportunity for liberty in Belarus slipping away. At best, events have reached a critical point. The Belarusian people must now decide whether they are prepared to insist on self-government, potentially at enormous risk to life and property, or whether, as winter approaches, they will simply retire indoors and grumble at their fate.Journalists report that nationwide demonstrations against August’s manifestly fraudulent re-election of long-time president Alexander Lukashenko rest only on domestic political opposition to his regime. The demonstrators are not pro-West or anti-Russian, we are told. The EU apparently buys this analysis. Its high representative for foreign affairs, Josep Borrell, wrote on Sunday: “This conflict does not pit Europe against Russia, but Belarus against its leaders. Protesters who are denying election results don’t wave the EU flag, but the country’s former flag.”Journalists and diplomats alike should look at a map. Given a free hand, Russia will not allow another “colour revolution” on its borders. Multiple conversations between Lukashenko and Vladimir Putin in recent days can only mean that Lukashenko knows his political survival (and maybe more) depends on securing a Kremlin lifeline. Putin is more than willing to provide one, and perhaps already is, but it comes at a high price. Lukashenko may not realise it yet, but seeking Moscow’s assistance likely means he is relinquishing power in Minsk, and probably sooner rather than later.The EU has been, as usual, long on rhetoric, long on hand-wringing and short on action. By contrast, Donald Trump has been short on rhetoric, short on action and short on attention . And that’s not going to change, certainly not before the November 3 election, success in which is all that truly concerns Trump. What truly concerns the EU is not yet evident.To date, the EU’s major contribution has been calling for new elections supervised by the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), which is already effectively dead on arrival. Worse, by invoking the OSCE – a cotton-candy ball of an international organisation – the EU handed the authoritarians the propaganda line that this is yet another Western intervention under the pretext of bringing democracy, but really only to advance Western interests.Diplomatically, the only feasible option is quietly approaching Lukashenko through someone he might trust, such as a former European leader retired from politics. This emissary might fashion a Lukashenko exit strategy, entailing an acceptable retirement in a distant venue (Spain’s former king may have some ideas) and immunity from prosecution. Such a benign departure might be unacceptable for the high minded, but consider the potentially catastrophic alternatives. And even this diplomacy is a long shot.Alternatively, the EU must tell Putin privately that Russian intervention in any form will produce unacceptable costs. Germany, for example, can threaten to block completion of the Nord Stream II pipeline until and unless it is satisfied that the Kremlin keeps its distance. There are several substitute natural-gas sources other than authoritarians repeatedly using force to change European borders. Similar disincentives could come from like-minded EU states.The West’s response may already be too little too late. If so, Belarus will become another entry in what Winston Churchill called “that long, dismal catalogue of the fruitlessness of experience, and the confirmed unteachability of mankind”.

Thanks for the support.”That revelation came one day after Meghan made her first intervention into this year’s US election, with a not-at-all-subtle anti-Trump message to American voters, suggesting: “We all know what’s at stake this year”.I have long been told by those close to her that Meghan harbours political ambitions and would one day like to end up in elected office.Which is absolutely fine.But to continue to use the Duchess title and represent the Queen on the Commonwealth Trust is highly inappropriate.I’d have great respectshe would cut the cords entirely and become a political activistwithout causing a massive diplomatic headache for the Royal Family.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I hope they accept our offer of a meeting this time and will look forward to bringing this awful situation to an end.Explaining the decision to no longer pursue the lawsuit, family spokesman Radd Seiger said: Harry Dunns parents were relieved to see the signal from the State Department in Washington that they are now working with their counterparts in London to find a resolution to the impasse following Anne Sacoolass departure to the US after Harry died.They have accordingly equally now signalled to the US government that they do not intend to sue them in respect of their decision to recall Mrs Sacoolas and have written to officials in the US Embassy in London to make a comprehensive offer an amicable meeting to help the parties find the resolution that is now desperately needed on all sides.That resolution will only involve Mrs Sacoolas going through the English justice system andour offer of a meeting is accepted, the parents intend to speak directly to the US government to tell them why it is so important that justice is done here.Mr Seiger continued: From the outset, the parents have always tried to enter into dialogue with others to find a resolution.This is not a situation of their making and I know there is a lot of regret both in Washington and London about decisions that were taken last September when Harry died.If the US government and Mrs Sacoolas now step forward to do the right thing, we have indicated to the US government that we would very much like to play our part in helping to heal the deep wounds left by this decision, not only in terms of relations between both countries, but also locally in our community where RAF Croughton sits.There is an awful lot of good that can be done here with the parents at the forefront of that but that will require the US government to stop denying justice for Harry.The Dunn family have said they will continue to pursue a civil claim against Anne Sacoolas in the US.In a statement, a US State Department spokesman said they had worked with their UK counterparts from the outset to find a mutually acceptable path forward.The spokesman said they continued to engage with the UK to find a reasonable resolution.Last week, Harry Dunns family blasted a diplomat for having a retirement do on the anniversary of the -year-old’s death.They blame the Foreign Office for the suspect leaving for the US after the teen motorcyclist died.Sir Simon McDonald, who is quitting as FCO permanent under-secretary after five years, tweeted a “thank you” to staff for Thursday’s event.Dunn family adviser Radd Seiger said: “I am appalled and horried to learn that Sir Simon’s leaving do was organised on the very evening one year from Harry’s death.”The family says spook’s we Anne Sacoolas, , left “unlawfully” after the crash. The FCO insists it “continues to seek justice for Harry”.Mr Seiger added: “It seems that the very people who allowed Mrs Sacoolas to leave unlawfully didn’t have Harry on their mind.“I do not know whose bright idea it was to arrange the do on th August, but whoever it was needs to have a good long look at themselves in the mirror.“Le goes on and Sir Simon is entitled to a leaving do, but on the anniversary of Harry’s death ”An FCO spokesperson said: “We have the deepest sympathy for Harry’s family on the anniversary of his tragic death. We will continue to support the family and seek justice for Harry.”GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But the Government’s furlough scheme — meaning workers could get straight back to work once restaurants, cafes and pubs reopened — and Eat Out To Help Out on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays have been much-needed lelines. Historically, Monday to Wednesday has always been the quietest time for restaurants, even at Christmas.I’ve been pleasantly surprised by how many people have taken advantage of the Government’s scheme. The public were clearly hungry.Since lockdown, I have been offering a takeaway and delivery service through my business, Casa Zilli. It has proved very popular, showing there is real appetite for restaurant-quality meals.Yet the end of the Government scheme yesterday doesn’t mean we ought to stop going out. I would advise restaurants to carry on offering the discount — and I wouldn’t change a thing about it, as it’s obviously working.So I am delighted that many are continuing — while others have come up with their own scheme or discounts to entice diners.Thanks to the social-distancing measures put in place, we can now all go out for a meal safely.Everyone needs to do their bit, by supporting these businesses and helping to keep the country going.After months cooped up at home, cooking the same old recipes, now is the time to step outside. People should seize this opportunity to experience new food and places they wouldn’t normally dine in — maybe posher restaurants or a dferent bottle of wine. The British hospitality industry is wonderfully erse. You can eat the world in a week. So why not make the most of these dferent offers Eating out is an experience and we have all been starved of new experiences in lockdown. As I saw with my own eyes in Devon, eating out isn’t just helping to boost the economy, it’s also great for our mentality after what has been an extremely dficult few months.Humans are social beings and there is no better way to socialise than sharing a meal with family and friends.The restaurant industry is wonderfully creative, and far more welcoming to young families these days. My children Rocco, , and -year-old Twiggy know that when we eat out they have to sit properly and behave.It’s a win-win situation. You’re supporting your local restaurant but also spending quality family time.Best of all, you don’t have to do the washing-up.NATIONWIDE: Bill’s – still offering up to  per cent off Mondays to Wednesdays in September.

International Trade Secretary Liz Truss has recruited dozens of business chiefs and farmers to help shape trade policy once the UK severs ties with the EU at the end of the year. But trade unions have been entirely excluded from the  trade advisory groups, which Ms Truss said would bring business “closer to the negotiating table”.

Animal welfare campaigners such as the RSPCA and consumer groups have also been left out - despite concerns that a US trade deal could slash food standards by allowing chlorinated chicken in British shops. The outcry comes amid a backlash over reports that DIT was planning to hand a senior trade role to former Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott. Kathleen Walker Shaw, GMB Officer for International Trade, told the Mirror: “Do we need a clearer sign of the times when we have a UK Government that prefers to hear from a washed up former Australian PM than our own workforce on the shape of the UK’s future trade deals  “Good trade deals mean listening to the voice of workers - it is our jobs, rights and the future of our public and health services on the line. “The government might try to silence our voice, and appoint tsars to rebut concerns, but the need for wide scrutiny on these negotiations in the public interest will not go away.”  Mike Clancy, general secretary of Prospect, said: “It’s clear from the makeup of these new advisory groups that the government would rather listen to a rejected Australian PM than to the voice of its own workers. “Good trade deals are vital to the economy but any deal which undercuts pay or workers’ rights is a bad deal for this country.If the government isn’t listening to the voice of workers it will not get this right and it is workers who will suffer.” Frances O’Grady, TUC General Secretary, called on the Government to reconsider. ,],totalVotes:,votesToShow:,mentometerId:,publicationId:,callbackUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  status,voteActionUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  vote,closed:,closedMessage:This poll has been closed!,hideResults:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,loginRadiusAPIKey:d-da-d--ccee,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,loginRadius:true,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,enableAboutTopics:true,GDPRConsentEnabled:,viafouraComments:true,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:true,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,LoginRadiusDomain:https:reachplc.hub.loginradius,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,og.image.for.section.and.topic:https:s-prod.mirror @trinitymirrordigital chameleon-branding publications mirror img logo-mirror-socialsharing.png,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true\""},{"url":null,"title":"struggling schools must find cash","story":"NewsStruggling schools must find cash for £million bill to keep our kids safeEXCLUSIVE: Teachers unions say coffers are running dry at schools already hit by years of Tory austerity - and now they have to stump up for coronavirus preparationsShareCommentsByPippa CrerarDaily Mirror Political Editor:,  SEP NewsPupils from years  and  back in the classrooms at Manor High School in Oadby, Leicestershire \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"What is really going on in politics  Get our daily email briefing straight to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Headteachers, said: “Every pound spent on cleaning materials is a pound that cannot be spent on a child’s education.” Around two in five schools are expected to welcome back pupils for the start of the autumn term on Tuesday, despite ongoing concerns about their ability to reopen safely. The majority of pupils will already be three months behind in their studies when theyto the classrooms, with boys the worst affected. Teachers estimate that those at school in the most disadvantaged areas could be more than four months behind pupils in the wealthiest areas. A National Foundation for Educational Research study also found the learning gap between the two groups has widened by % since the start of the pandemic. The Government has provided £m ‘catch-up’ funding to help close the gap, as well as covering some other costs related to an outbreak.  But schools are expected to cover additional expenses themselves - including sanitiser, extra cleaning staff, signs, disinfectant wipes, PPE kit, perspex screens and large ‘troughs’ for disinfecting outdoor play equipment themselves. Teachers’ leaders claim the £m ‘back to school’ cost will go up as they are forced to restock supplies, bring in supply staff to cover those who need to self-isolate, or in the event of a further lockdown. Mr Whiteman of the NAHT said: “School leaders and their teams have stuck to their task, calmly and professionally and parents can have confidence that schools will be ready. “Our research shows that  per cent of schools are organising regular additional cleaning of classrooms and school premises. The Government has mandated certain safety measures, and parents and schools alike would rightly expect the Government to meet these costs in full.  The NAHT’s latest research also found that three in  teachers believed budgetary constraints would affect their schools’ ability to reopen safely. Heads spent an average of £, getting ready, while they are also losing an average £, in income from renting out facilities or cancelled fund-raising events. The NASUWT union estimates thatschools spent as much as % of their funding on all Covid-related costs, rather than just reopening costs, they would need an injection of at least £.bn to this year’s £.bn funding budget. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, added: “The Government has said that schools should use their existing resources to make arrangements to welcome all children back, and that there are no plans to reimburse additional costs incurred as part of that process.  “This is a deeply disappointing and short-sighted decision which will inevitably mean that school budgets will be put under further strain. The costs that are associated with reopening in line with the Government’s own guidance are considerable. “Our view is that the Government should provide funding to cover these costs, so that school budgets, as well as extra catch-up money from the government, can be used as effectively as possible for educational purposes, rather than funding hygiene measures and plugging gaps in staffing.” One primary school head told how children will lose out as a result of a lack of Government support. The experienced teacher told the Mirror: “We are using precious money from our budget to pay for this which would otherwise be spent on resources for the children.  “We spent about £ and were led to believe we would be able to claim this back but we can’t. “The only claims allowed are as a result of measures for a suspected case of COVID in school. “Our costs will continue to rise as we open fully and we don’t know how long we will have to keep this level of cleaning up for. “It’s time consuming for staff to be endlessly cleaning door handles and light switches and the office staff are cleaning toilets during the day. “We can’t afford to pay the cleaner to come in, especially now we know we can’t claim back any of the costs.” A Department for Education spokesperson said: “Headteachers, teachers and school staff have gone to enormous s to ensure children can get back into their classes safely when the new term starts as it is the best place for their education, development and wellbeing.  “Throughout the pandemic, schools have continued to receive their core funding, with this year marking the first year of a three-year £.bn total cash boost.“Schools have also been able to claim for specic exceptional costs such as additional cleaning required due to confirmed or suspected coronavirus cases.”Education Secretary Gavin Williamson, who remains in post despite his handling of the A-level results debacle and a series of policy u-turns and last-minute advice for schools, faces demands to come to the House of Commons today [TUES] to say how he will protect pupils’ schooling. Labour leader Keir Starmer will call for a “proper plan” from the Government, adding: “He needs to explain how he will make up for the damage already done, bring pupils up to speed and mitigate against the ongoing risk from the pandemic.”Thanking teachers for their hard work, Mr Williamson said yesterday: “I do not underestimate how challenging the last few months have been but I do know how important it is for children to be back in school, not only for their education but for their development and wellbeing too.  “But it is down to the sheer hard work of so many teachers and school staff that from today pupils will be able to learn in their classrooms together again.” Schools have been warned to expect unruly and disruptive behaviour as some pupilsto class for the first time in nearly six months. Guidance issued by the DfE admits that many young people will struggle to adjust to routine and discipline after being at home for so long. It suggests schools should have plans in place to help pupils reintegrate into school le, with children with special educational needs likely to need extra support. New research shows that lockdown has heightened anxiety with one in three parents feeling their child will struggle to settle back in with friends. Almost halfsaid that lockdown has negatively impacted their child in the study by youth charity The Diana Award and Nationwide Building Society. More than a thirdof young people also admitted to being more worried than usual about theto school because of lockdown. The NAHT has said that % of schools plan to welcome all pupils full-time from the start of the autumn term, while the remaining % have set out how they will phase pupils back into class. All children will stay in groups or bubbles to reduce the risk of spreading infection, and older children in particular will be expected to follow social distancing guidelines.

Gavin Williamson acknowledged the damage being done to pupils by not being in school in a letter to parents, in which he said: If a child is not in school, they stand to lose far more than just a few months of learning. It could well put a huge dent in their future le chances. Education is a birthright, so letaposs make sure we get all children back - back to learning, back to playing and back to being kids again. And now a new survey of nearly , school leaders and teachers has provided firm evidence of this. The majority of pupils will be three months behind in their studies when theyto classrooms in England this week, it found. A whopping % of respondents felt students were not as far along with their learning as would normally be expected at the end of the   school year. Almost a quarterof teachers from across more than , mainstream primary and secondary schools also believed boys had fallen further behind than girls.  The National Foundation for Educational Researchaposssurvey comes as many studentsto classrooms this week for the first time since lockdown. Its study found that as of July, teachers had on average covered % of the curriculum during the   academic year. Teachers estimated on average that their pupils were three months behind in their studies, the survey said. However, more than halfof those teaching in the poorest schools in England reported their students were four months or more behind in their learning, compared to % of teachers in wealthier settings. The survey also found that the learning gap between disadvantaged pupils and their better-off peers had increased by %, adding that the figure was likely to be an under-estimate.  Labour leader Mr Starmer has accused the Government of taking a chaotic approach to education as he demanded Gavin Williamson show how he will make up for the damage already done to pupils.He said the Education Secretary should go to Parliament to tell us how he will protect our childrenaposs futures. Mr Starmer said:  Excitement for children who will be back in the classroom for the first time in months. But anxiety for teachers and parents about a year ahead that is full of uncertainty because of a pandemic that continues to cast its shadow over childrenaposs education. I want to pay tribute to the extraordinary dedication of our teachers and school staff who have worked tirelessly over the summer to make sure schools can reopen safely.  Labour want and expect children to be back at school. Every day that schools were closed was a day of opportunity, learning and support lost. This situation was worsened by the exams fiasco and the Governmentaposs chaotic approach to education. We cannot keep repeating those same mistakes. Young peopleaposs futures cannot be held back by the Conservativesapos incompetence. But the Department for Education said its £ billion Covid catch-up package will tackle the impact of lost teaching time and include targeted funding for the most disadvantaged students. Other findings from the teachersapos survey:The majority of pupils had been expected to learn at home throughout the   summer term, but teachers reported that only % ed their last piece of set work in July, compared to % in May. School leaders said that just over halfof students who were eligible todid so, with those from black, Asian and minority ethnicbackgrounds having lower attendance at %.Almost a thirdof school leaders said safety concerns from parents were a common reason for their children not attending. Almost three quarters of teachersdid not feel able to teach to their usual standard while the coronavirus regulations were in force, the survey found.In an open response question, % of , teachers whose teaching was affected said distancing requirements had a negative impact on areas such as group work and their ability to interact with pupils properly. More than half of school leadersalso reported that they were using teaching assistants to lead classes. Teachers estimated that % of their pupils will need intensive catch-up support, the survey said, with the percentage increasing to % in the most deprived schoolsPaul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, which represents leaders in the majority of schools, said: This is another alarm bell that the Government needs to pay attention to. The Covid- pandemic has interrupted education for the majority of children, and schools were already struggling to provide everything children needed before this crisis, damaged as they and other social services have been by a decade of austerity.  Mr Whiteman said schools will absolutely require additional support to play their part in healing the scars left by the pandemic. Dr Angela Donkin, chief social scientist at NFER, said: While it is crucial that children catch up, we should not assume that teachers will immediately be able to deliver the same quality of teaching, at the same speed, as before the pandemic.

Since August  Scottish students have been back in the classroom. In their first few weeks back from their summer holidays pupils north of Hadrianaposs Wall were not required to wear face masks. However, as of today coverings are mandatory in both Scottish and Northern Irish schools in corridors and communal areas. It is hoped that the measure will help to limit infections as large numbers of children in dferent classes pass each other on the way to lessons. In Scotland the rules apply to all pupils over the age of , with everyone over the age of five to mask up on public transport to and from school. In Northern Ireland, post-primary pupils and teachers have to wear face coverings in corridors and communal areas. Masks on school buses are strongly recommended but not mandatory. It is not required for pupils to wear masks in classrooms in either country.  The stricter regulations come after several outbreaks at schools in Scotland. At one school in Dundee  members of staff and two pupils recently tested positive for the disease. Scotlandaposs Education Secretary John Swinney said: There is increasing evidence that face coverings can provide some protection for the wearer as well as those around them.  We also know that some pupils have found it very dficult to physically distance when moving around school, which could increase the risk of transmission of the virus. And on school transport, as on public transport, there can be mixing between dferent age groups. He added: We want to continue to protect what we have achieved in suppressing the virus and re-opening schools, and to do the best for children in schools.  Swinney has stressed pupils will not be excluded from schoolthey do not wear a face covering. The World Health Organisation has advised that children aged  and over should wear face masks.

Researchers decided we’ve been concentrating too much on the ­negative fallout of our sedentary and inactive lestyles with bad news stories about heart disease, stroke, diabetes, even cancer. Scientists at the universities of ­Edinburgh and Cambridge wanted to celebrate the benefits of getting active rather than repeatedly telling people they’ll pay a pricethey fail to do so. The science team, including researchers from Moray House School of Education and Sport, studied data from  countries in an attempt to find out how many people on the planet were meeting recommended activity guidelines –  minutes of moderate exercise or  minutes of vigorous exercise each week. The proportion of people meeting these World Health Organisation guidelines in dferent countries was quite ied – from a low of % in Kuwait to % in Mozambique. The figure for Britain was %, still too low.To estimate the number of premature deaths prevented each year by exercise, researchers combined this data with estimates of the risk of dying early for active people, compared with the same risk in inactive people. What they found was that globally, thanks to exercise, premature death rates were % lower than they would have been – equating to approximately . million lives saved per year. This is a much more uplting message than the number of early deaths due to lack of physical activity – estimated at . million premature deaths each year.

The exhausted pet spaniel had gone bounding after the birds while on a walk along the beach in Rhyl on Monday morning, before getting carried away. The dogaposs owner could only watch as his pet swam further out before he dialled  for help at around am.He was advised to keep the dog in sight and refrain from attempting any rescue of his own, and within  minutes of the call volunteers from Rhyl Coastguard launched a leboat, reports NorthWalesLive. Initial reports said that the dog was off the old Suncentre site to the East of the station at Rhyl, but the owner updated the coastguards saying that the dog was actually off the new SC site to the west. The leboat turned round and sped to the scene, directed by the coxswain at the boathouse over the station radio. The dog was soon located, brought on board the leboat and ed to his grateful owner.  Martin Jones, RNLI Coxswain for Rhyl’s RNLI Leboat, said: There was initial worry the owner would attempt to rescue the dog, but on the coastguard’s advice, remained on the beach, keeping the dog in sight. We are so happy the animal and it’s owner are reunited.In a video filmed from the leboat and posted on the RNLI Twitter page, a rescuer can be heard saying youaposre not supposed to be this far out, as they approach the paddling dog.He then whistles and says come here with the dog still around  yards away. The video then cuts to the boat right alongside the pet, as it continues to swim. The rescuer says: Come here.

Her mum, Tina, says the chances of finding another donor are so slim that doctors are now planning a dferent course of treatment. But, in future, a stem call ­transplant is Evie’s best hope of being cured. The schoolgirl, from Whitby, North Yorks, was first taken to hospital with a rash and was diagnosed with aplastic anaemia in May. After a global donor search was launched, a   match was found and the anonymous donor agreed to the procedure. In preparation, Evie had to have dental work and one of her oies was removed. But on August  the donor pulled out. Tina, , who works at RAF Flyingdales, in Pickering, North Yorks, said: “We were devastated, it was a huge blow. We have no idea why the donor changed their mind. Evie has already been through so much. She thought she had a donor and now she doesn’t. “The donor pulling out is quite hard-hitting, but we want to raise awareness of the stem cell register. It’s so easy to be a donor. It’s just like giving blood, but you could save a child’s le. It’s so easy to join but only % of the UK population is registered.” Evie said: “I need this transplant to save my le.

The Liverpool gran even brought her own cleaning supplies with her because she expected similar conditions after booking a £. holiday promotion.But she claims it was worse than expected and the stay was horrible from start to finish, with ants crawling all over her five-month-old baby grandson, a floor covered in dirt like a crust, and filthy appliances, KentLive reports.After a sleepless night, Cheryl, daughter Kiera Underwood and the kids checked out, and the grandmother is now demanding compensation. She said: “We did take some cleaning stuff with us because of all the reviews we’d seen. “We thought it would just be somewhere to lay our head after we’d been out for the day but it was horrible from start to finish.” To make matters worse, the familyaposs car broke down during the long drive from Liverpool.  Cheryl said: “When we first got into the cabin, everything seemed nicely laid out but when we took our shoes off we could feel the dirt. It was a like a crust. “We went checking everywhere. The oven was full of grease, there was one quilt between four people, no TV and no bath plug.” The family say they complained, but park staff did nothing. Cheryl said: “When we complained the next morning, specically regarding quilts. There was no communication at all. “I rang them up about multiple things and they told me reception was closed. We were told it was too windy for our TV to work despite the fact that in every other room the TV’s were working.“I don’t know whether they’re short staffed because of coronavirus or incompetent.”Cheryl said the family decided to leave after realising the cabin was infested with ants. She said: “The ants were the last straw. My daughter complained that she had them all over while she slept, we moved the baby’s bag and found they were all hiding under it.  “I told my daughter to change the baby, she laid him down, and when I came back they were all over him.“He’s a five month old baby. It’s disgusting, there were bugs everywhere. I put it on a Facebook group that’s used by people who’ve stayed in the camp and they said they were bed bugs.The family checked in to a hotel for the rest of the staycation. Cheryl said: “Looking through other people’s reviews on the Facebook group of the holiday park, I feel I’ve got off lightly. “I’ve complained to customer service and I’ve been told I’ll likely get my money back. “It’s not good enough. It should be knocked down.”Environmental Health Officers recently inspected the park after complaints from unhappy guests who booked post-lockdown holidays this summer, SussexLive reports.Officers, however, have no control over the cleanliness of the accommodation.

"},{"url":null,"title":"schools coronavirus covid opening rules","story":"AdvertorialAll the things which are changing as schools and colleges open doors againEducational institutions are ready to welcome pupils back safely – and the benefits to their wellbeing and mental health are hugeShareByDave Masters:,  AUG Updated:,  AUG AdvertorialIt’s the start of a new term and it’s time for children across the country to get back to school, nursery and college. Many parents, pupils and teachers are excited to get back into the routine and although it’s understandable to have a few worries the benefits of going back into education are clear. Not only will pupils be learning again, but they’ll benefit from the sense of routine, the chance to see their friends and a boost to their wellbeing. With new safety measures in place things will look a bit dferent, but pupils will be guaranteed plenty of support from their teachers.  Dr Paul Phillips CBE, , the Principal and Chief Executive of the Weston College Group in Somerset is one of many leaders who’s worked hard to make the learning environment safe and welcoming for ing students. He said: If you came into my campuses you’d see the one-way system, you’d see all the sanitisers, you’d see the counselling service, you’d see the ability for us to check temperatures, but behind that are the inidual learning plans for each student. That’s where the crucial planning really takes place. We’ve increased the number of mental health advisors and support workers who are here, we’ve put a massive investment into all levels of additional learning support at tutorial level, mentoring and one-to-one teaching. I’ve doubled the amount of cleaners in the college – I just need to be assured that everything we do is protecting everyone.  Home schooling hasn’t been easy and many parents are worried that their children have fallen behind, but parenting expert and author Dr Kalanit Ben-Ari believes they’ll catch up quickly and that getting back into the classroom will boost their mental health. I’m not worried about the academic gap, because I think kids will pick up very quickly. But it’s starting to affect their mental health more and more, so it’s good that they will be back in school from September, says Dr Ben-Ari. Children are not designed to sit down all day. They need to be out in the fresh air and moving their bodies. It’s so important for children of all ages to interact with their friends face to face for communication, and non-verbal communication.  Kids at home have spent a long time on screens while parents are working and they don’t have the resources to entertain and teach their children at home. Spending more time on screens will have affected their mental health: it increases anxiety, especially with children who are a little bit more vulnerable to it. For Chloe Williams, a beauty therapy student at Weston College, thecan’t come soon enough. I feel ready to go for a long-awaited  and seeing the new socially distanced facilities has been great, she says. My tutors are very approachableI have any worries and we are all helping each other. The PHE’s Chief Nurse, Viv Bennett, says: Parents can be reassured that to maximise safety in schools, an extremely stringent system of controls has been advised by PHE and is published in DfE guidance. Evidence so far indicates that schools do not appear to be a primary driver of coronavirus infections in the community. Globally, children and young people have been found to experience coronavirus asymptomatically or as a minor illness.  The Government’s new Wellbeing for Education Return package has training and resources for teachers and young people to protect their wellbeing and mental health. Now the NHS Test and Trace system is up and running and there’s more understanding about what needs to be done to stay safer. Children should stay at homethey have any symptoms such as a fever, continuous cough or loss of taste and smell. If there is an outbreak at a school or college, local health protection teams will work with staff to agree what action is needed. Schools shouldn’t need to close fully, butthey do there’ll be a contingency plan in place to make sure children’s education continues. It’s vital that young peopleto school and college for their educational progress, mental wellbeing and wider development, so attendance is mandatory from the beginning of the new school year. For post-, attendance is important becausea student doesn’t turn up their college may believe they’ve left the course. Schools and colleges have put in a raft of measures to keep pupils and staff safe, including staggered start and finish times and lunch breaks, one-way systems, extra cleaning and encouraging regular handwashing. Where it’s dficult to maintain social distancing, with younger children, contact between groups or “bubbles” will be limited. This means things will look a little dferent, soparents or young people are anxious or worried about ing, they should have a chat with teachers. Parents with younger children are encouraged to take up a nursery place because it provides a routine and helps them develop their social skills. The Government offers a wide range of financial support for families with children aged up to , including Tax-Free Childcare worth up to £, per child per year and you can also apply for a  hours free childcare place before  August.

Daddy long-legs Weaposll ease you in gently with one weaposre all pretty used to seeing and are easy to identy. A daddy long-legs has a small body and - you guessed it - long, thin legs. Although they can measure up to a few inches in size, thataposs made up mostly of gangley limbs rather than an intimidating body. They can bite but the good news is that itaposs rare and is reported to cause a very mild burning sensation that lasts only a few seconds at most. Orb-weaving spider  Thankfully the photo above is zoomed in and rather than appearing like something from a horror film, orb-weaving spiders only actually grow to about mm and is one of the smaller entries on this list. They are common in houses and gardens, and are not harmful to humans. It can be identied by a its pale body and legs, with silver-grey markings on its abdomen. It likes to spend the autumn months inside to keep warm, so could well be visiting soon. Giant house spider  If youaposre not a fan of spiders then youaposve probably ran away from a couple of these before due to their larger size . They can run extremely fast, which makes them dficult to trap under a container to be safely removed, but they can only sustain the speed for a short amount of time. Although they do possess a apospotentapos venom and can bite, itaposs said they are not aggressive. Money spider  The good news with money spiders is they are tiny in size and are even linked with the superstitious idea that spotting one of these little guys can give you good financial luck. They weave hammock-shaped webs to catch prey, which they then paralyse with a bite before wrapping it in silk to eat. But they are too small to bite humans, so you have nothing to worry about here. Cupboard spider  Closely related to the  widow, cupboard spiders are red-brown in colour and in some cases females are very dark brown. They have been known to bite humans, but are not usually aggressive. However,you are unlucky enough to get bitten, symptoms can include blistering and generally feeling unwell.

Weather charts show highs of C today by the afternoon but Wednesday sees a sht and is likely to be dominated by cloud and wind and rain, added Mr Avery. However, Met Office meteorologist Alex Burkill told the Evening Standard temperatures are set to climb as the week goes on, despite continued chillier nights.Brits could see C before the end of the week, he said, adding: It will feel warm in the sunshine but much cooler in the shade. It comes after the mercury plunged to just above freezing on Monday - the last day of summer - as the UK heralded the coming of autumn with a chill in the air.  A low of .C was recorded at .am at Ravensworth in North Yorkshire, making it the second coldest start to an August Bank Holiday in England since the holiday was introduced in . It was just above the lowest of .C at Kielder Castle in Northumberland  years ago in . The average overnight low for North Yorkshire for this time of year is usually about C or C. Meteorological summer ends on August , with autumn beginning in September, according to the meteorological calendar. Looking ahead to the first days of September, Met Office forecaster Craig Snell said: It will be pretty seasonal this week. Temperatures will be roughly where we expect them by day, and there will still be some chillier nights. I imaginepeople are going out late evening or early morning there certainly will be a chill in the air and they probably will need at least a lightweight jacket to take that chill off. The low temperatures of the bank holiday weekend ended a month of extreme weather in the UK, which has included two named storms, a heatwave and the hottest August day recorded in  years.

During the last month, those who have recovered have reported hair falling out weeks after other symptoms ended. And while it may seem trivial given Covid- can be a killer, it’s important to appreciate that our hair is an indicator of our health. “In order to understand why health affects hair growth, we must keep in mind hair is not essential to our survival, so when we have a health problem or internal imbalance our hair is the least of our body’s priorities,” says Anabel ­Kingsley, a consultant trichologist at Philip Kingsley. Medical columnist Dr Rosemary Leonard says though there is no published research on the effect of Covid- on hair, any illness, even flu, can affect hair growth and cause loss. Click here for live coronavirus news and updates Psychological stress can also trigger it, so being unsettled by lockdown could in theory have an impact. “It is known that many people experience a general thinning of their hair several months after a physical or emotional shock,” says Dr Leonard. “So just the huge mental stress caused by the Covid- pandemic, with many people being furloughed or losing their jobs, or trying to cope with home schooling children while working from home, could be enough to cause some hair loss.” While it’s normal to lose up to  hairs each day, excessive daily hair shedding – up to  in  hours – is known as telogen effluvium, a form of widespread, non-concentrated hair loss on the scalp. It occurs when the hair’s growth is cut short by an internal disturbance.  “It makes complete sense,” says Anabel. “Due to the hair growth cycle, telogen effluvium is often expected six to  weeks or so after the period of illness, medication or stress that triggered it. Although it can be extremely distressing, rest assured the hair will almost certainly grow back in around three months, as long as the underlying issue has been resolved.” So what other health problems could trigger hair loss, and when do you need to worry  Thyroid issues Your thyroid gland produces two hormones which regulate metabolism and they must be balanced to ensure the body s properly. “For many, hair shedding is one of the first signs thyroid hormones are imbalanced,” explains Anabel. “Thyroid-related hair loss occurs anywhere on the scalp and can also result in loss of eyebrow and body hair. It may also cause your hair to become dry and brittle, and nails to become thin.” The good news is that thyroid-related hair loss usually recties itself once your condition is treated. Stress This can disrupt hormone balance. It increases cortisol levels, which in turn increases sebumproduction and disrupts the skin’s barrier , triggering skin ­irritation and inflammation. You may find your scalp gets itchy, flaky and greasy when you are going through a stressful period. “People who suffer from scalp conditions, such as psoriasis and dandruff, often find their condition is made worse by stress,” says Anabel.Nutrition Whether you’re crash dieting, have an eating disorder or have changed your diet dramatically – for example by going vegan – what you eat can have a big impact on your hair. “As hair is non-essential tissue, it is the last part of you to receive nutrients you intake,” says Anabel. “Even a small deficiency can cause hair loss, long before it affects your general health. The most common deficiencies are iron, ferritin , vitamin B, vitamin D and zinc deficiency.  “Lack of dietary protein, not eating enough complex carbohydrates and crash dieting are also common causes of hair loss, or hair not growing to full . “Hair is made of protein so I recommend adding at least a palm-sized portion of protein to breakfast and lunch, and having a serving of a complex carbohydrate with each meal for easily accessible energy.” Menopause Hair changes are common leading up to and during menopause. “When you go through the menopause you have two main things occurring that can impact your hair,” says Anabel.

Rebecca Bennett-Formstone, , had become so fed-up of her st figure that she bought the corset to hide her frame. She wore it during meals out or at work - and it was so painful that she couldn’t eat or sit down. So the Coventry-based clothing business owner started a new low-carb ketogenic diet in a last-ditch attempt to slim down for her wedding. Some experts have raised concerns about the wearing of corsets, warning that it can deprive your body of oxygen. Some suggest it can reduce lung capacity by up to  per cent - even leading to a potential build-up of fluid in your lungs. Rebecca is thrilled after she dropped five stone. Rebecca decided to go alone and she said: “I bought a waist trainer because I was told it would give me amazing curves and I began to wear it because I felt so self conscious of my own frame. “I’d wear it two or three times a week - when I’d go out for a nice meal or under my work unorm - but it was so tight I felt like I couldn’t sit down and I wanted to take it off after  minutes. “I didn’t notice my weight as much until I got engaged and then I became more conscious that I was going to have to wear a big wedding dressI didn’t lose weight. I heard about the keto diet on Pinterest and thought I’d try it because I had nothing to lose other than a bit of weight. “Within the first week I’d lost four pounds already and I was shocked that it was working for me when the other diets hadn’t. “Now I feel so confident and I can finally dress how I want without straining myself in a waist trainer.” Rebecca began piling on the pounds in , after feeling the need to snack constantly and treat herself to a Starbucks drink every day due to her retail job. When she got engaged to now-husband James, , she tried to follow diets - but nothing was working. She turned to waist trainers to help build her confidence but grew tired when they became unbearable and constantly left marks on her stomach. Rebecca said: “I always wanted to wear baggy clothes so I didn’t have to wear the waist trainer becauseI wore anything tight, I would have to wear it, and then I couldn’t eat or sit down - it was horrible. “I wore it once or twice a week but as I got a bit bigger I had to stop because it became so unbearable, I could only wear it for three hours.”  Deciding enough was enough, Rebecca came across the keto diet and began to reduce her carbs and introduce more healthy fats to her diets, such as fish and nuts. Rebecca managed to lose almost two stone in only two months, and had her wedding dress altered by an inch-and-a-half on the bust. She said: “It was really quite quick - I didn’t expect to lose that much when I’d only wanted to slim up a little bit before my wedding. “I felt really confident on my wedding day, especially when it came to taking the photos because I didn’t feel like I had to tuck myself in to try and look tiny.” Rebecca has now continued to slim down on the keto diet, dropping five stone in less than a year, weighing a healthy st.

Currently unemployed, he is constantly in and out of jobs and has been fired by previous employers for being childish. Speaking to , Damien said: Diapers are very convenient, comfortable, and cute. It’s a very nice lestyle and I wouldn’t want to do anything .  Dressing and acting like a baby gives off a very calm, relaxing, safe vibe. It’s almost asyou were back in preschool without a worry in the world. Employment is hard. Iaposm constantly in and out of jobs. Sometimes my employers find my pictures online or just canapost put up with the fact Iaposm wearing a diaper and acting childish in the workplace. Damien never hides his lestyle choice but has lost friends and is often teased outside of work. He has since been welcomed into the ABDL community who have helped him feel at home.He said : Iaposve lost a few childhood best friends. I do still have a few good friends that all know about it.

He initially told his parents, who support his lestyle, that he had an incontinence problem and fully embraced the lestyle during his teen years.  Damien added: ‘It’s something I’ve always been into since I was a kid. If I really had to pin it to something I’d say episodes of SpongeBob or Tom and Jerry where they are wearing a diaper for a gag or throwaway joke. I found it very appealing and have pretty much been wearing them since I was . I lied and told my parents I had an [incontinence] problem at the time so they would buy me some. Eventually, I told them the truth. My parents don’t really mind at all, I’ve never had a problem with them when it came to my lestyle. Despite the support from his family, Damien has been poked fun at on the street and faced cyberbullying where people post memes of him.

The disturbing images highlight the living nightmare the animals endure. Mink were in physical distress, some with hideous eye wounds. Seriously injured animals were filmed dragging themselves over the wire-mesh floor of their cages to reach the few drops of water. One campaigner said it is like something “from a horror film”. Investigators also found clear evidence of repetitive behaviour typical of mental disturbance due to inappropriate living conditions.The images, taken this month, show some animals in tiny wire cages completely barren apart from huge piles of faeces. Investigators described the air as thick from the foul stench. Despite being semi-aquatic animals, the mink have no access to open water. The Mirror is campaigning alongside Humane Society International UK to stop the sale of fur products in the UK. The latest figures available show the UK imported £million worth of fur from France between  and . The footage was sent to French animal welfare charity One Voice.  Executive director Claire Bass said: “This footage is like something from a horror film. Once again, behind the glossy PR of the fur trade, the gruesome reality is exposed – mutilated and paralysed animals in squalid conditions. Many people will be shocked such appalling suffering is hidden away... with animals so terribly failed by French and European animal protection laws. “For as long as the UK remains open for business to buy fur from overseas, we are complicit in this cruelty. It has to end.” The charity has submitted a complaint to police about the scenes captured in the footage.

But he has to find that consistency to stay in the team.#As far as interest in him, then I#m delighted for him. I hope there is because that means I#ve got good players here.#I wouldn#t want an empty scouting bay as that would mean people had made their mind up about my team.#I have no problem in teams taking an interest but it honestly won#t deflect away from every day improvement and trying to win games of football.#Mellon will come up against a familiar face in the opposition dug-out on Saturday when he takes United to Rugby Park to take on Alex Dyer#s Kilmarnock.Mellon knows the Englishman well from his time south of the border and while he insists there will be no old pal#s act this weekend, he is confident his friend can turn Killie#s campaign around after seeing them open up the season with just two points from the opening five games.The former Shrewsbury and Tranmere boss said: #I#ve known Alex for a long, long time. He#s a real good football man. I#ve competed against him numerous times.#I remember him and Chris Powell at Charlton and again at Huddersfield, so I know him really well.#I know that he will make sure his team are ready and we#ll have to overcome that challenge.#I#ve no doubt he can get Kilmarnock out of the situation they#re in. It doesn#t even need me to justy that.#Given his experience in football and the type of guy he is, you can#t look at him and think he doesn#t have the know-how to win games at any time.#It#s always dficult when you get both Rangers and Celtic in your first five fixtures.#But we know we#ll have to go down to Rugby Park and get an awful lot right.#We#ve shown in the first five games that we#re a match for anyone.#What we need to find is the consistency of that performance over a league season.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

against Celtic in what was probably the most emphatic success in either of the Old Firm’s backyards since the introduction of the Premier League.Former Don Charlie Nicholas, whoseto Parkhead was marked by an ear-shattering reception by the , crowd, left the field under less enthusiastic circumstances after contributing little to the day’s proceedings.Aberdeen went to Parkhead on September  following an opening day victory against Hibernian at Pittodrie and even at this early stage of the season, it became clear that it would be Aberdeen that would challenge Rangers for the title.It was Aberdeen’s third win in succession over Celtic and it was by far their most impressive.Celtic threw everything at Aberdeen from the start only to find Dons goalkeeper Theo Snelders in great form.Aberdeen gradually asserted themselves on proceedings and took the lead on  minutes when Paul Mason scampered on to a -yard pass from defender Alex McLeish.Mason ignored the howls for offside from the Celtic fans and raced  yards into the box to beat Pat Bonner with a good finish.Aberdeen went further ahead just six minutes later when Brian Grant intelligently hoisted in a cross following great link-up play with Peter Van De Ven and Stewart McKimmie.Robert Connor ghosted in behind the Celtic defence and saw his downward header brilliantly saved by Bonner.Connor followed up to whack home the rebound from a few yards out before vaulting the advertising board behind the goal to salute the Dons fans with a star jump.Charlie Nicholas, a close-season transfer from Pittodrie, could do little to stem the Aberdeen tide and was substituted by Andy Walker on  minutes.A minute later Mason rode a clumsy challenge and released Hans Gillhaus into the Celtic box.Gillhaus lashed it home via the inside of Bonner’s left heel and through his legs.Celtic fans started to leave the ground early following the third goal.Manager Alex Smith said it was Aberdeen’s best performance since he took charge in .The Dons had been linked with moves for Keith Wright and Robert Fleck before the partnership of Mason and Gillhaus produced two of Aberdeen’s three goals.“If they can provide that kind of finishing on a regular basis and we can bring on the likes of young Jess and Booth, there might be no need to look outside the club,” he said.“Hans and Charlie Nicholas struck up a good partnership last season and I have a feeling this one could be even better.“But it was particularly pleasing to see the way we dominated the game for long spells, with our midfield pushing up on the Celtic defence and refusing to allow them space.“Every player did well, and although it is perhaps a little unfair in those circumstances to single out players, I thought Brian Grant was the best player on the park.“Brian gets through a lot of work and does not always get the credit for what he does, but that was one of his best displays.”Aberdeen would go on to take the title race to the final day of the season on the back of a run that saw them recover from being seven points behind with  games to go.Aberdeen went to Ibrox for the league decider level on points and goal dference, but ahead on goals scored, knowing that a draw would give them the title.Rangers – who were now under the guidance of Walter Smith – held their nerve and a double from Mark Hateley broke Aberdeen hearts.“We were changing in the Portakabins because Ibrox was being redeveloped, and the Rangers fans definitely played their part that day,” former Dons defender Alex McLeish recalled.“For the older players in the Aberdeen team, it wasn’t really intimidating because of the experiences we’d been through playing in front of big, volatile crowds, but maybe it affected one or two of the younger players.“We only needed to draw that day, but the management never said ‘Let’s play it tight and play for a draw’, and we actually played well for the first - minutes against a makesht Rangers team with a lot of injuries.“Rangers rode that wee bit of luck, but the atmosphere was very good from start to finish and was everything any player should want to be part of.“It’s tough to take, but you have to move on.”Aberdeen came close the following two seasons before entering years of struggle at the wrong end of the table.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"the time for change is is now july 17 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThis isn’t really a campaign, it’s just the things that we should all be thinking aboutwe want Argyll # and the world – to be a recognisable place for our children and grandchildren to live in.The economic crisis could be seen as an opportunity to get started on the work that we know needs to happen.I think that many people in Argyll could continue to work from home people who have lost their jobs could be retrained, or use their existing skills, to do the work that is necessary for Argyll to become carbon-neutral. Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

So many people are intimidated by other vehicles. The Bikeability scheme gives children and adults the confidence to ride out safely.#The training, over three days, and was a mixture of games, exercises and on road practice, finishing with an assessment. The village#s fire engine was used to demonstrate to the youngsters how dficult they are to see from the cab of a large goods vehicle, particularly to the rear and near side at junctions.They also learned about primary and secondary road positions, right of way and good observational skills.They were even encouraged to ask their parentsthey do the #Dutch Reach# to keep passing cyclists safe. The Dutch Reach is a simple change of habit to help you open your car door safely. Instead of using the hand closest to the door, it means reaching across to open the door with the hand furthest from the door # your left handyou are the driver. This naturally turns your body towards the window, helping you spot approaching cyclists.Mr Catterwell added: #Thanks to Scottish Fire and Rescue Service for the use of the appliance and the drill yard, the Bike Bothy for administrative assistance and training materials and Graham Love for his excellent mechanical services. Also to residents and holiday makers around Craignish who were mostly respectful of the learner cyclists.#P S pupils Fergus Bennett, Beth Gregory, Magnus Hampton, Kay Neville, Harry Whittle and Reiley Van Der Zel received their Bikeability  badges. P  pupils Ross Potter-Irwin and Henry Small should get their Bikeability badges in term time next year.Through partnership with the Ardrishaig Bothy, Cycling Scotland is offering schools free instructor support, instructor training and resources to deliver Bikeability Scotland training.Bikeability Scotland is the national cycle training programme designed to give children the skills and confidence they need to cycle safely on the roads and to encourage them to carry on cycling into adulthood.

I share many of his concerns, and commend the series of articles.It would be good to hear from a range of Argyll and Bute residents with their ideas for how we get from #here# towards a better #there#. My personal pet project would be an Argyll and Bute Citizens’ Assembly, that would bring people together to generate real strategies to bring about just and #green# change for our area.A good start would be better transport links, via enhanced road and ferry services.A permanent solution to the Rest and be Thankful would be welcome, of course, but it was really heartening to see how Western Ferries rose to the challenge on Friday Auust .  They magicked away that endless queue at Gourock with great patience and goodwill and double service, showing what can be done.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, ArdrishaigSir,Following the latest landslide and road closure at the Rest and be Thankful, once again the road closure signs were placed at the wrong place on the Arrochar side.Having spoken to several of the local businesses owners, the main issue around the signs are they are too far away from the incident. There are information signs from Balloch to Tarbet advising of the closure at the Rest.Surely moving the signs to Ardgartan would make more sense. Should anyone have to turn then there is ample space to do this. We cannot continue to render two villages effectively closed in case someone has failed to read the signs or cannot turn.Transport Scotland and BEAR Scotland must guarantee that the signs will not be put back in the same place when further disruption occurs, and it will.Jane Ireland, Slanj restaurant, Tarbet"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures august 21 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGordon Stewart from Ardfern sent us thisatmospheric photograph, taken from Corranmor Farm on Monday August .A stunning full rainbow appeared that day over Loch Craignish lagoon, captured by Gordon on camera.PIC:no_aYourPictures_Rainbow"},{"url":null,"title":"enjoy cowal highland gathering in the comfort of your own home","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWith just days to go until one of Scotland’s favourite events takes the virtual stage for the first time, Cowal Highland Gathering’s organisers are preparing to unveil a packed programme to a worldwide audience.Cowal’s Virtual Highland Gathering is an ambitious three-day event which mirrors as closely as possible the programme of the gathering itself.Kicking off on Thursday August , Cowal’s Virtual Gathering features a host of exclusive interviews and performances, together with a look back at some of the highlights of the -year-old event.The Gathering’s Friday night gig is back too, with the Gig at the Gathering Unplugged going live from pm.

This is now brought into line with the public transport guidance.What about primary school children With the exception of school buses as outlined above, the new guidance in schools only applies to secondary school pupils.Do they need to be worn in class While staff and students can continue to wear face coveringsthey wish to, they will not generally be necessary in the classroom.This is because there is greater scope for physical distancing and face coverings can have an impact on teaching.However it remains the case that where adults cannot keep m distance and are interacting face-to-face for a sustained period , face coverings should be wornCan a child be excluded for not wearing one It is expected that the guidance will state that pupils should notbe excluded from schoolthey do not wish to wear a face covering.Can someone help my child with their covering Education Secretary John Swinney said:ldquoSchools will be asked to ensure children and young people have clear instructions on how to put on, remove, and store face coverings.\"Any staff member or pupil will still be able to wear a face covering when they wish to do so.\"John Swinney confirmed the new guidanceWhy is this being done Mr Swinney added:ldquoThere is increasing evidence that face coverings can provide some protection for the wearer as well as those around them.\"We also know that some pupils have found it very dficult to physically distance when moving around school, which could increase the risk of transmission of the virus.\"And on school transport, as on public transport, there can be mixing between dferent age groups.\"What  was said Mr Swinney said:ldquoWe want to continue to protect what we have achieved in suppressing the virus and re-opening schools, and to do the best for children in schools.\"Alongside this change to the wearing of face coverings, we need to reinforce the importance of maintaining high standards of cleaning, personal hand and respiratory hygiene and physical distancing, where possible.\"In situations where there is a local cluster, use of face coverings throughout the day may be required.ldquoThe position will be kept under review to ensure that our

Masks can trigger ious types of skin irritationsand redness .How can you combat maskne There isnrsquot a prevention for maskne, as we need to continue wearing our masks, but there are ways that you can help combat the issues.Skin Care routineIf you want to combat the impact of maskne then having a good skincare routine is essential.It is just as important to cleanse your skin before wearing a mask as it is to cleanse after wearing a mask.To help your skin heal, Ashley would recommend using a squalane or balm cleanser so help remove make-up, dirt and debris.However,you are experiencing chapped, irritated skin or suffer from sensitivity then a gel based cleanseradvised.Dermalogicarsquos UltraCalming Cleanser helps to calm and cool sensitised irritated skin.ExfoliatingExfoliating is key to clear clogged pores and remove dead skin cells which will help reduce the impact of maskne.There are thousands of dferent types of exfoliators available from chemical, physical and masks but it is always important to follow the recommended application and how often you should use the product.Over-exfoliating your skin can compromise your skins barrier , damage the skins capillaries and dehydrate the skin.Ingredients such as glycolic acid, lactic acid and salicylic acid are great exfoliating athelping fight breakouts.Spot treatmentsUsing targeted spot treatments with ingredients such as salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide will help remove dead skin cells and decongest pores.Hyaluronic AcidsHyaluronic acid can hold , times its weight in water - so it is like a magnet for moisture.,params: .pushUsing hyaluronic acid regularly will leave the skin feeling super-soft, radiant and reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.Hyaluronic acid has antibacterial properties meaning it will help soothe and protect chapped, irritated skin.FoundationsOpt for tinted moisturisers rather than a heavy foundation or go bare faced to help cause less clogging in your pores - but donrsquot forget your SPF!MoisturisersHeavier moisturisers will sit on the skin for longer due to the humidity of wearing the mask which can cause further clogging and irritation of the skin.However, donrsquot want to stop using a moisturiser all together as our skin still requires hydration and moisture.Instead try using a light and soothing moisturise such as Charlotte Tilburyrsquos Magic Cream light.Chapped SkinFor those suffering from chapped skin try using a physical barrier cream such as Dermalogicarsquos Barrier Repair.Barrier Repair shields against environmental pollution and helps forty sensitive skin with a damaged barrier."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-mobile-testing-unit-hawick---know","story":"A MOBILE-TESTING unitwill run in Hawick for six days, according to NHS Borders.It comes following an outbreak in the townlinked to three businesses.The testing unit will operate from tomorrowuntil Wednesday, September .It will be based in the Teviotdale Leisure Centre car park on Mansfield Road, with tests available between pm-pm.An NHS Borders spokesperson said: \"The MTU can only take a limited number of people each day so it is essential that only people with COVID- symptoms book a test.\"Other household members must self-isolate but should not be tested unless they too are showing any symptoms.\"The symptoms of COVID- are a high temperature or fever a new continuous cough or a loss of or change in sense of smell or taste.\"Tests, which must be booked in advance, can be arranged by visiting this websiteor calling  .The new unit will run alongside the existing facility in Galashiels Netherdale car park, which will operate betweenam and pm.If travellingto a mobile unit is not possible, people can arrange for a home test kit to be posted through their door.NHS Borders jointdirector of public health, Tim Patterson, said: \"I realise that people in Hawick will have concerns about the virus as a result of this outbreak.\"Unfortunately this can lead to the circulation of unsubstantiated rumours, especially on social media.\"I would like to re-iterate that it is crucial for everyone in the community to follow our advice and avoid speculation and rumour about the outbreak.\"Dr Patterson added: \"In terms of schools, all education settings in Hawick are currently safe places for children to learn.\"Unless your child has been asked to self-isolate by NHS Borders Test and Protect team they should attend school as normal.\"However it remains vital that no child attends schoolthey are displaying any COVID- symptoms.\"At the time of publication, a total of nine new cases of coronavirus have been recorded in the Borders in recent days,bringing the regions total to  since the outbreak began.To book a testing unit appointment or a free home testing kit, visit: www.gov.uk get-coronavirus-test or you can call:   "},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-scotland-book-covid-test-testing-centres","story":"In the last week, demands for Covid testing in Scotland have surged.The First Minister suggests some Scots have had trouble trying to book coronavirus tests over the weekend due to a \"major spike\" in demand, which resulted in technical issues.Butyou are experiencing symptoms, how do you get a test  Heres everything you need to know.When should you take a test If you think you are experiencing symptoms of coronavirus, you should take a test.

It was the sound of their wings that caught my attention before I saw them. It was a lockdown morning, no traffic, no background sound, and they were flying low.I never have been much of a bird watcher well, what I mean is I have always loved sightings of wildle, including birds, but donrsquot sit for hours to spot dferent types. I know the names of some birds but many I canrsquot identy with certainty. My friend Jim is my human encyclopaedia for such things.Of course, we can still appreciate nature and wildle without being able to identy their exact names. A beautul tree is still worthy of admiration, evenyou donrsquot knowitrsquos an oak or a sycamore. You can enjoy the antics of a flock of birds, evenyoursquore not surethey are martins or swts.And there are some wild creatures we all know and can identy: a fox, a robin, a hedgehog, a squirrel, a rabbit, a mole, a deer, a dandelion, a daisy, a heron, a swan, a duck and a hare would be on this list, but itrsquos not as extensive as it used to be. As nature has receded from our lived experiences, so has the ability to identy and name much of the wildle and plants that survive around us.The beautully illustrated book The Lost Words by Jackie Morris and Robert MacFarlane was a response to this loss of nature vocabulary. With beautul pictures and poems, it brings back to le some of the animals and flora of our land. And resources like the ranger service do a fantastic job in our county, providing walks, giving fascinating information and talking to a iety of groups.But itrsquos the lived experience of nature that is the vital link between having knowledge and developing an understanding that will nurture a love of our natural environment. We cannot really love that which we do not experience and value personally. Itrsquos when we physically encounter a plant or animal that we develop a desire to know its name and understand its signicance.This seems a perfect time to find ways to enhance that lived experience of nature. In schools, because of the presence of Covid, learning outdoors as much as possible is being promoted. Some schools will have access to woodland or natural areas more than others. Some schools in built-up areas will be more restricted. But even in urban areas, there may be a grassy area with a tree or two, or perhaps a nature corner can be created.Teachers do a great job, and they are doing so in very challenging circumstances just now they know their business. But as a storyteller who until the lockdown was in schools every week telling stories, I am unable to do so in these new circumstances. I fully understand why, of course.But as things develop, it may be possible for storytelling to take place outdoors, wersquoll see. For me this is not so much a restriction but a new opportunity to make nature the stage, with listeners immersed in the natural surroundings in which so many stories are set. Evenonly concrete playground is currently available, there is potential to make more of the outdoor space now that it will be used in a dferent way.As I say, time will tell what will be possible. My interest is not just as a storyteller but also as a parent. Itrsquos a time to be cautious and safe, yes, but let us not forget the vital importance of the creative arts in all this. Many children have missed out on so much already, and music, song, storytelling and drama are such a vital part of childrenrsquos development and soul indeed for us all. Perhaps we all need to relearn the campfire spirit, around which so much human culture and understanding developed.And so my thoughtsto the swts which flew over my garden. They will now be flying over Africa, following the rains and chasing the insects there. Their story is utterly fascinating a lesson in natural and human history, as well as geography, biology and ecology.Soon the pink-footed geese from Iceland will arrive in their honking formations, to spend their winter here. Irsquove noticed some trees are showing they already feel the nip of autumn. The cycle of naturersquos stories are all around us,we have an ear to listen and eye to notice.More learning outdoors is a gt.

However, in our local conditions wersquove rarely seen it much above -.metres.If yoursquore looking for an evergreen tree, itrsquos worth remembering many coners are extremely hardy and tolerant of adverse conditions, surviving in severe coastal conditions and at altitude.The tree wersquore highlighting is the Picea omorika, sometimes called the Serbian or Bosnian spruce, being native to those countries.With dense, short green needles that are slightly whitish underneath, it has a dense, columnar habit, and forms a graceful, slender, conical feature in the garden.It is extremely hardy and, although it doesnrsquot require any pruning, it can be trimmed to remain in proportion to the garden.Many of our customers love garden lighting, and the stable conical form of P omorika makes it the ideal plant for strings of lights!For something a little dferent, why not try Phormium Phormium is sometimes known as the New Zealand flax because of its country of origin. It is one of the hardiest plants we know and indeed is used effectively at the front of the garden centre as a windbreak!Grown primarily for its form, the clumps of strap-like leaves are virtually indestructible, and some years will even produce tall, architectural flowering spikes which dry and remain a feature.Most often grown as a focal point, it can also be used to create an unusual hedge.There are many ieties of Phormium to choose from offering a wide range of colours, from eye-catching yellow through to deep, purplish-black, or combinations of colours on striped leaves.Similarly, therersquos a great selection of sizes available, from small compact ieties to the larger ieties that can exceed two metres.Itrsquos been very dficult to choose only five of our favourite evergreens, because there are so many wonderful plants that will provide you with structure, form, colour and interest throughout the year.If you require advice on these plants or other options, just please speak to one of our plant team and theyrsquoll help you choose an evergreen plant thatrsquos just right for you!"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-scotland-book-covid-test-testing-centres","story":"The First Minister suggests some Scots have had trouble trying to book coronavirus tests over the weekend due to a \"major spike\" in demand, which resulted in technical issues.Butyou are experiencing symptoms, how do you get a test  Heres everything you need to know.If you think you are experiencing symptoms of coronavirus, you should take a test.

I really wanted to get the role.IN WHAT WAYS DID YOU SEE YOURSELF IN THE CHARACTER Even physically we were quite similar. He talks about having a wiry strength from the long walks around the Yorkshire Dales... And I was very sporty as well, just like Alf was.Hes got a lot of passion and commitment to his field and that was like me. Once I found acting, I was completely enveloped in it - and havent looked back.He has little intricacies sometimes he can be a little socially awkward... Little quirks that I could identy with. I had fun with them as well.HOW DAUNTING WAS YOUR FIRST DAY OF FILMING I thought Id be more nervous or apprehensive on the first day of filming I really wasnt, and it was a fortunate revelation.My first day was with Samuel West - obviously a veteran of the industry. I was so excited to work with him and then, on top of that, he was just so lovely. Any questions I had, he was there for me.He just put me at ease straight away and, its maybe a bit corny, but I genuinely did feel at home on that first day.HOW DO YOU THINK FANS OF THE ORIGINAL SERIES WILL REACT TO THIS ADAPTATION The original is obviously loved the world over- and in a lot of peoples eyes, its perfect. But Ive never thought of it as a competition in any way, because its a completely new adaptation. The storyline will not be the exact same.That series was the late seventies, eighties, and the technology in filmmaking has come on leaps and bounds. Youre going to see the Dales in stunning HD, with drone shots and crane shots. I think the Dales are really realised in this it is like another character.WHO WAS YOUR FAVOURITE ANIMAL TO FILM WITH Theyve got these Jersey cows who were just lovely. When youre working with these bigger animals, a whole new focus comes into it. Theres an atmosphere on set you have to be really calm. So it was nice to do those scenes.But also the little dog who plays Tricky Woo, which people will remember well from the series and the books, is a little Pomeranian... tail waggles in the air as he walks along, you cant see his legs and its kind of like he glides. But the dog actor is actually called Derek. You would never expect this fancy little thing to be called Derek!He was a consummate professional and his character journey over the series is very strong. Hes going to be a star.WERE YOU BROUGHT UP AROUND ANIMALS I was raised in the north of Scotland, in a little town. It was my back garden, then a fence and then a field the field always had cows and sheep in it.When we were really small, there was one cow who we named Friendly because the farmer would lt us onto her back and let us ride on this cow for theof the garden and take us off again.THIS SERIES SHOWS THE IMPORTANCE OF BELONGING TO A COMMUNITY. IT FEELS VERY TIMELY...Its certainly that thing about helping your neighbour, and community, and coming together... [after schools shut because of COVID-] I remember a teacher going out with his backpack on full of school meals and he was doing kilometres a day to get meals to the kids. Brilliant stuff.I think it [All Creatures Great and Small] is simpler times and something many people yearn for, especially now, when times are a bit more complex. It will be a lovely bit of escapism.ARE YOU READY FOR THE FAME THAT WILL COME WITH THIS ROLE Honestly, I have no idea. In drama school, theres no class on people noticing you in the street.

All have a strong hold over the upbeat, poppy tracks that in dferent circumstances would have been certied dancefloor classics.Certainly Perry doesnt shy away from being honest, with lyrics such as \"Ill cry about it later, tonight Im having fun\", and \"Just keep on dancing with those teary eyes\", flowing over disco beats and electronic sounds.But theres a triumphant edge to the album, and Perry brings her lighthearted trademark sound to the proceedings, \"Im faithful, baby\" is an uplting lyric that will compel you to sing along at the top of your voice, and \"Ill regrow right through the cracks\" is the audio equivalent of a joyful plateau after rising out of a depressive episode.While Smile isnt % cohesive as an album, its a collection of singles that were made to be sure-fire number ones, andthey cant pack a dance floor thanks to social distancing, theyll have you singing along, revelling in their powerful message.Sophie GoodallPVRIS - USE MEUse Me is the album that sees PVRIS step out of the shadows while retaining the darkness that has always surrounded them.\"Wide awake, just cut the head off of a snake\", Lynn Gunn sings on opener Gimme A Minute, to dramatic synth chords and urgent bass.The Lowell, Massachusetts band have come a long way from their metalcore beginnings, with their third full album completing the journey into stadium electropop.Thats not the only change, as Gunn this year found the confidence to step out as the sole creative force behind PVRIS - pronounced Paris, the original name before being changed for legal reasons.Drummer Justin Nace left in January, with guitarist Alex Babinski and bassist Brian Macdonald fading into the background on videos, artwork and merch.Use Me is delayed from May and while its release at the end of summer fits the goth elements, PVRIS missed out on a summer of touring and festivals that would have surely lted them to the next level.The tour is delayed to spring but the charismatic Gunn is a star in waiting and there is no reason why PVRIS should not be huge after this supremely confident album.They embrace pop fully on Stay Gold, Hallucinations and Wish You Well, while the title track has an alternate version featuring rising New Jersey rapper  Shake, hinting at future new directions.The shadows remain, and on Good To Be Alive Gunn sings \"feels good to be alive, but I hate my le\", while other tracks are called Death Of Me, Old Wounds and Loveless, an acoustic ballad, but they never sound miserable, saved by panache and some jet-propelled choruses. may have been a washout for live music, but thanks to Use Me, well always have PVRIS.Matthew GeorgeGIANT ROOKS - ROOKERYGermanys Giant Rooks offer more than just an intriguing name on their debut album, which melds classic indie with modern soul flavours.Album opener The Birth Of Worlds, a shock of cascading drum rolls and cinematic synths, suggests a more experimental album than ever materialises.But it is a fine showcase for frontman Frederik Rabes throaty voice, which takes centre-stage throughout Rookerys  songs and holds up some of the weaker cuts.Rabes swaggering, half-sung delivery hints towards a confidence that never quite shows up in the songwriting.Subsequent songs like Watershed and Wild Stare stray towards the derivative, drawing from the sanitised RB of Jungle and the quirky aesthetics of Alt-J.This formula works better when Giant Rooks go full pelt like on Heat Up, which features a taut disco beat.There are plenty of lyrics - some nonsensical - about hip-swinging clubs and souls being set on fire by love.Into Your Arms unexpectedly transforms into an auto-tuned slow jam and, oddly, works.You have to admire their bravery.It is a promising debut that would have helped Giant Rooks storm festival stages worldwide in pre-Covid times.Alex GreenMETALLICA - SMThe trend for artists reinventing their songs with the help of an orchestra has produced a mixed bag.Yet thrash metal titans Metallicas  concert with the San Francisco Symphony at The Berkeley Community Theatre stands as a benchmark in vibrant, madcap quality.Two decades on, the proud San Francisco natives reunited with the Symphony for another performance, this time to mark the grand opening of the citys Chase Centre.James Hetfield and Lars Ulrichs band of merry men remain total strangers to subtlety.Their music worships at the altar of maximalism and this is perhaps why their never-ending rfs and pattering, machine gun drums fit so well with the bombast of the San Francisco Symphony.Opening with The Ecstasy Of Gold, the simmering energy of the room is almost audible.And from The Call Of Ktulu, which takes on the pomp of a James Bond theme, it is full pelt, with the band working their way through their heaving back catalogue, ending with Enter Sandman, of course.Alex Green"},{"url":null,"title":"herald-sunday-letters-readers-talking-week","story":"Male MPs and MSPs donrsquot get the vile and unprintable comments which are sent to women politicians ndash the people who send these are probably someonersquos husband, son or grandson.

But isnt this a non sequitur, especially in light of the SNP administrations latest economic figures The Readers Digest version of the numbers shows that, in the last fiscal year so before the pandemic, Scotlands deficit soared to . per centwith Scotland generating pound less per person than the UK average in taxation while public spending was pound, per person higher in Scotland, as a consequence of the generosity of the UKs Barnett Formula.Ms Sturgeon may be considered by some to be telegenic yet she has made many of the same errors as Downing Street in handling the pandemic. Scotlands continuing lacklustre financial position plus slim prospect of joining the EU any time soon suggests that with independence would come a y period of austerity. Ms Sturgeon may be self-assured on TV, but that wont run the NHS and educate our children in an independent Scotland.Martin Redfern, Melrose.I HAVE observed many political leaders come and go over the years, in the UK, the United States and where, among them JFK, Harold Wilson, Margaret Thatcher, right up to the present day.The present incumbents I believe are most certainly the worst and least able. At local, Scottish, level we are governed by one-issue-obsessed nationalists. Forget the \"civicrsquorsquo appellation beloved of the SNP. Nationalism is like a cancer, there are dferent kinds, but the basic illness is exactly the same. It is in effect tribalism and an appeal to the worst instincts in humans.None of this is helped by the rampant narcissism and rabble-rousing displayed by the SNPrsquos leaders, past and present.At UK level, we have Boris Johnson, and in the US, Donald Trump, both at times approach the buffoon level. Both are lacking the intellect and political skill to govern wisely.I fear for my children and grandchildren in this \"brave new worldrsquo.rsquoAlexander McKay, Edinburgh EH.IT IS WRONG THAT SALMOND IS STILL ON TRIALIAIN Macwhirter suggests that while Alex Salmond has been found not guilty by a jury of his peers, he remains on trial . Of course he is. The story of a colleague suggesting that Nye Bevan was ldquohis own worst enemy, being met with the comment by Ernest Bevin, ldquonot while Irsquom around he ainrsquot is instructive in thatwe substitute Salmond for Bevan and much of the Scottish media for Bevin, the situation is much the same.Mr Salmond enjoys a fantastic degree of loyalty from his supporters, much to the astonishment of his opponents, some within the SNP. But the not guilty verdict has been greeted in some circles with ldquohe got away with it. This is most ably demonstrated by the last words in Kirsty Warkrsquos recent ldquodocumentary on the trial going to one of the women whose case did not convince the jury of Mr Salmondrsquos guilt.Moreover, bear in mind the Moorov doctrine, which says ldquo that the evidence of one witness can corroborate the evidence of another in certain situationsthe Crown can prove that the accuseds offending was part of a course of conduct, systematically pursued. This can address dficulties of proving rape or other sexual offences, where there is no corroborating evidence, by showing a pattern of behaviour over a period of time. However, while there were  charges for the jury to consider, with certain features in common ndash the involvement of alcohol, being alone with Mr Salmond ndash the jury chose not to convict. Therefore, is the conclusion not that the jury were unconvinced by the womenrsquos versions of events not just inidually but collectively as well Mr Macwhirter concludes ldquothat you are guilty even when you are found innocent. Early in her ldquodocumentary Ms Wark speaks of the ldquowomenrsquos stories, but without convincing evidence that is what they remain ndash stories. The Carl Beech case, though I am not associating any of Mr Salmondrsquos accusers with him, is a prescient warning of where justice being based on ldquostories without convincing evidence can lead. We cannot have a legal system that accepts something is true just because the accuser says it is.Alasdair Galloway, Dumbarton.SONGS THAT SHOULD BE CHERISHEDWHAT a pointless brouhaha created by the BBC so unnecessarily over those two rousing tunes which bring such a resounding climax to the Proms.If ever we needed the feelgood factor in our lives, it is today, in the midst of a pandemic and the gloomy prospect of economic woe.What better way to raise the spirits of any community than with powerful community singing which comes across even from our TV screens as energising, defiant and uplting Those tunes provide a marvellous send-off to the traditional finale of the last night of the revered Proms.Yes, Britain did have an empire, which like any endeavour contained elements both good and the bad.Maybe we should recall those words of a well-known holy man, \"let he who is without sin cast the first stone\".Again while the lyrics of the songs were written in a dferent era with a dferent outlook ,they take on a fresh new meaning, outside of nostalgiafor every new generation.No one can quarrel surely with the sentiment that Britons shall never be slaves when that applies to all our compatriots regardless of their origins, colour or creed.Let the BBC reinstate the choral singing of those tunes which it has downgraded out of a weird and faux concern over political correctness.There are some traditions we should always cherish and this is one of them.Denis Bruce, Bishopbriggs.DEPORTATION IS THE ANSWERDOUGLAS Robinsonchooses to reduce the important topic of illegal immigration to that of a pub discussion.He is obviously a Europhile. Mr Robinson misses the whole point about UK sanctions on France, since the Yellow Vests would riot on the streets demanding Emmanuel Macron stopped the migrant flow to the UK. Britain can get food from where delivered to our door.More than , asylum seekers, paying large sums of money, have illegally entered the UK this year. Following the death of -year-old Sudanese migrant Abdulfatah Hamdallah on a beach in France, the usual suspects have been rushing to blame Britain. After leaving Sudan he and his friend Gamr Alsha were in Italy and France, so under EU \"safe haven\" rules they should have claimed asylum there and Abdulfatah would not have died. The , who travelled through numerous \"safe havens\" in Europe should quickly be deported and this would deter others from risking their lives.Clark Cross, Linlithgow.MASKING THE DANGERSTHERE is much talk in the media currently on whether people should wear masks in ious situations.Inevitably most people wear cheap masks, and the fact that my glasses steam up, and that when I seal a cheap medical mask around my mouth I almost cant breathe, suggest that my breaths are taking the path of least resistance and going round the edges of the mask unfiltered.There are several research papers on the effectiveness of mask wearing, and perhaps the most interesting one is from  which claims to be the only study on cloth masks to that date.

This was Brown Young, Shaw McCall, Woodburn and Cox. There were no substitutes then and no thought of squad rotation. When one of the five outfield defenders was injured, Willie Rae came in at left half and the others were moved around as necessary. Young could play at full back or centre half and Cox could play anywhere. So for other defenders at the club, the Iron Curtain meant they could not get a game.

Carrying in a tray of tea first thing in the morning, itrsquos very odd finding tousled, sleepy-eyed friends in their pyjamas, propped in our regular place. For the duration of these visits, we relocate across the landing, to the spare room. Its bed is not what yoursquod call generous. Itrsquos fineyou are alone, orboth of you have been on a diet, but less so in any other circumstances. It does, however, have the advantage of being above the kitchen, and thus the second warmest place in the house. For that reason itrsquos also my study.Back in April, as we used an old tin of Farrow  Ball found in the loft, and discovered too late that there was only enough to cover a single wall, we were uncertainAustrian friends due to visit in July would still be able to make it. While Alan slapped glossy woodwork paint onto the ceiling, wondering why it was so hard to work in, we discussed the advantages of cast iron bedsteads over wooden, Scandi sleekness over shabby chic. Gradually, though, the need to make a decision receded. As the weeks ticked past and Europe turned into a giant hairbrush, covered in spikes, all such international trips have been cancelled or pushed back a year.Even in the best of times, when it comes to hospitality we are more roadside burger van than country inn. Where we previously lived, we did occasionally have friends and family to stay, but it was not what yoursquod call a revolving door. More of a portcullis. It was noticeable, though, that after we moved to the Borders, footfall increased.What does Hoolet have that East Lothian or Glasgow doesnrsquot, you might ask  Itrsquos a question to which others, clearly, also wanted an answer. In my seven-year-old step-granddaughterrsquos experience, the big dference is a roaring fire, and the witchy shadows of moving trees on her bedroom wall during the night which, she told us next morning, ldquoliterally petried me.Peter Maylersquos A Year in Provence was the first and funniest of a genre that offers a humorously enticing glimpse of moving to another country, and meeting head-on the challenges of local lingo and customs while undergoing house restoration. One of the late Maylersquos charms ndash assuming you were not a neighbour ndash was his candour. He describes near strangers inviting themselves for a holiday, entirely oblivious or resistant to every excuse given to dissuade them. In that initial year he and his we learned their mistake: ldquoHalf-forgotten invitations, made in the distant safety of winter, were coming home to roost and drink and sunbathe. The girl in the laundry assumed from our sheet count that we were in the hotel business...At one particularly low point, with a boorish London advertiser in residence, they sat by the pool and ldquowondered why we both found it so dficult to get rid of thick-skinned and ungracious people. They realised then that in future theyrsquod require more than ldquofirmness and ingenuity. What they needed was an answering machine.The lucrative and entertaining well that Mayle dug is still gushing. Quite apart from the ever-popular Frances Mayesrsquos books, which turned the word Tuscany into a synonym for bourgeois, there have been quieter, better books. One such is A Season in Spain, by Andrew and Lesley Grant-Adamson. Taking on a fruit farm in Andalusia for two years, they lived among peasant farmers whose families have worked the land for centuries. Despite the excellence of local food and wine, they learned how tough and precarious subsistence living can be in a region that goes from scorching heat to freezing, from drought to deluge.They too had unwanted guests: ldquoQuiet. Remote. The essence of tranquillity  Not quite. We ed from our first foray to find a young English family stripping one of our few ripe orange trees. The man was wearing a cheeky grin and a hat that put us in mind of Eddie Grundy of The Archers. He and his we carried off sackfuls of oranges, using the Grant-Adamsonrsquos wheelbarrow to transport them to their mule. Meanwhile their children were stripping the mandarin trees.Fashion in travel writing has since turned the compass towards Scandinavia, Latin America, Japan, but the principle of all these books remains the same: hapless, starry-eyed foreigners stumble into a beautul and rural part of the world, and either makes a success of settling, or eventually, after discovering a worm in the apple, acknowledge defeat and retreat.The danger in any such enterprise, of course, is not poisonous reptiles or a poor grasp of grammar, but that writers have a tendency to hyperbolise. An ordinary day, in their hands, becomes the stuff of adventure, romance or glamour. Mayle was a former advertising copy writer, so could sell turnips as truffles. Not that he had to try very hard. Since Provence offers months of sunshine, sumptuous local cuisine and wine, and rolling fields of lavender, itrsquos no surprise that visitors flocked to his doorstep. His books became such a success that the whole region, previously an idyllic backwater, was flooded with tourists. So too Mayesrsquos Tuscany.Writing about the Borders carries no such risk, unless yoursquore keen to test out equipment for a trip to the North Pole. We once encountered a man who had a weekend place in the nearby hills. It was a beautul old house that he was slowly renovating, whenever time allowed, but we got the impression his guests hadnrsquot bargained on it still being under hammer and drill when they arrived. ldquoFor some reason they prefer to camp out in the field, he told us, waving to the rugged fields in which the house sat. They must have been robust. Even indoors the draughts whistled.And yet there is something about living here that makes the hardened hermits happy to make up beds and stock the fridge. Since Alan is the chef, when we next have visitors all Irsquoll have to do is pop the corks, and go to sleep asin a strait-jacket, for fear of falling out of bed.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

There are a few things that could fairly be called unsafe, but Irsquom hard pushed to think of many that are  per cent safe. Most of what we do in le falls between the two, and where an act lies on the spectrum can be moved by how we perform it. We need to talk about risk, not safety or the absence of it.Free climbing, climbing rock faces without ropes or any other safety equipment, is clearly very risky. However, training and practice can reduce the level of risk to personally acceptable levels, as demonstrated by the extraordinary Alex Honnold when he climbed El Capitan in Yosemite. I spent my working le inside an aeroplane, a thin metal tube flying at  miles a minute, six miles above the earth, with the temperature outside - degrees. Flying is very low risk, made so by science and engineering, and by extensive training and adherence to procedures, but itrsquos not % safe: accidents do occasionally happen.Worldwide, over a million people die every year in road traffic accidents, more than have died from Covid-. So is driving safe or unsafe  Itrsquos neither, and the vastly dferent fatality rates in dferent countries show that itrsquos how we, as iniduals and nations, go about the business of driving that moves it along the risk spectrum.There are risks associated with opening up our schools and the economy. However, there are very substantial riskswe donrsquot educate our young and donrsquotour economy to something close to full capacity. Itrsquos clearly vital that we reduce the level of risk as much as we can, and the record of the Scottish Government has been good on that so far, but the task isnrsquot only for them. Itrsquos down to all of us to respect the rules that keep risk to a low level. Those rules wonrsquot stop all Covid- infections, but they will limit them, and thatrsquos the best we can hope for until science delivers a vaccine.Doug Maughan, Dunblane.RECENT coverage about the pandemic has shown that transmission of Covid- is greatly reduced in indoor spaces when the proportion of fresh air in the internal atmosphere is high. It is baffling that so many people have a mental block about providing good ventilation. The over the top legislation on indoor smoking would not have been requiredpubs and the like had to have suitable ventilation . How many schools , hospitals, and offices could be more Covid-secure with adequate ventilation They would not need a lot of bulky duct work. Compressed air can transport as much air in smaller pipes using no more material, and is easier to store than air at ambient pressures.Sandy Henderson, Dunblane.THE restrictions imposed on us by both governments are having results that no-one foresaw, largely economic but also social and health related.Unfortunately, politicians, both in government and opposition, have painted themselves into a corner. They are afraid thatthey come out and say that the restrictions should be stopped, that any increase in the statisticsfor the virus will be blamed on them, and the public will therefore not vote for them at the next election.It follows that the situation at present is that the restrictions are having a greater harmful effect than the virus, but most politicians feel unable to acknowledge this.

To suggest so is to digny the SNP with an undeserved gravitas. Its ldquocase is based solely on a misplaced romantic view of themselves, as relevant as Morris Dancers and historical re-enactment groups are to UK foreign policy.Devolution was for sure a concession too far by the UK Government. It has been an unmitigated failure, and Holyrood is an appalling waste of public money that has failed in every area of its limited responsibility. Along the way it has legitimised an agenda of hate and politicised everything in public le, including local government, to the detriment of us all. Enough already. Game over.John Dunlop, Ayr.TO accept Peter Russellrsquos argument that the Vow was deliveredrequires a lack of awareness of the reality of the UKrsquos constitution, and in particular that the House of Commons is sovereign, possessing supreme or ultimate power. For instance, there is nothing to prevent the repeal of the Sections of the  Scotland Act which Mr Russell puts his faith in. Similarly, the Barnett Formula could be brought to an end by a vote in the House of Commons, and with  of  MPs at Westminster, there is little we could do about it.Ah, but they wouldnrsquot do this, comes the reply. They are bound by the Vow. But with UK indebtedness at something like pound trillion the temptation to cut spending in this way must be great for a Conservative Government with little support here already.With regard to ldquoextensive powers devolved, letrsquos suppose the powers were ldquoextensive as Mr Russell asserts. However, we already know Westminsterrsquos intentions with regard to the ldquoSingle British Market will mean Scottish food regulations can be undermined by the requirement of ldquomutual recognition. In any event, it would always be open to Westminster to legislate to amend regulations passed at Holyrood. As Enoch Powell said, ldquopower devolved is power retained, because it can always be taken back again.Thus to consider the Vow without consideration of the context within which it will operate, is, to put it at its best, limited. His reticence to do this is though easily understood.Lastly, Mr Russell disapproves of others ldquotelling lies, but the fact is his claimed Commission opinion about Scotlandrsquos membership position never existed, as this would only have been forthcoming to the political head of state of a member country. It might be interesting to learn why David Cameron never did get round to asking that question. Thus, Mr Russellrsquos claim that, had Scotland voted Yes, we would have left the EU on independence, is based on no more than the opinion of inidual Commissioners writing in a personal capacity.While Mr Russell may, as I do, deprecate anyone telling lies, his letter reveals a careful selection of the truth.Alasdair Galloway, Dumbarton.CATRIONA Stewart thinks Douglas Ross ldquois right, we need to learn to disagree.

Anne and Rob were ordinary, working-class, Ayrshire Scots who didnrsquot have a lot of cash when they were growing up, took a deeply practical view of le, health, and other people, and were wary of salesmen, politicians, and journalists .Like a lot of Scots of their age and experience, Anne and Rob also had several core instincts that drove most of their views. First, they were cautious about spending money unnecessarily. Second, they were wary of change and had generally conservative instincts. Third, they were resistant to governments telling them what to do . And fourth, they had a dual identity that they pretty much took for granted: their Scottishness was their Britishness was their Scottishness.:Opinion: Mark Smith: In defence of Sarah Smith hellip and a plea to the First MinisterAll of these instincts ndash formed and confirmed by the war, and post-war governmentsndash led both Anne and Rob to be deeply suspicious of Scottish nationalism and the people who led it: first Alex Salmond, then Nicola Sturgeon. Salmond, as far as they were concerned, was a blowhard and Sturgeon a troublemaker and a stirrer. In later years, Anne would sit back in her chair after wersquod finished our cups of tea and cakeand say: ldquoSo, tell me, what has that besom been up to now I realise not all of you may feel quite as affectionate about Scots like Anne and Rob as I do: indeed, some of the nastier nationalists on Twitter take great delight in the fact that Scots of Anne and Robrsquos generationare dying out. But, as the law of demographics adjusts the population without pity, and there are fewer Scots like Anne and Rob and more Scots who take dferent views, I canrsquot help feeling a bit down dispirited depressed. The Scotland I know, through people like Anne and Rob, my grannies, my mother, is dying. And I need to accept it.A couple of recent trends have confirmed where things seem to be going. Scots like Anne and Rob were generally thrty ndash my granny in Thurso used to give us felt-tip pens to colour in the bald patches on her rugs so she didnrsquot have to buy new ones ndash and much of their antipathy to Scottish independence came from the realisation that it would be expensive for Scots like them. They would be worse off.However, increasingly, many Scots take a dferent, and more cavalier, view of money. A lot of them have credit cards and overdraftsand the idea of debt, and the cost of debt, is not off-putting to them, which explains why the economic cost of independence is no deterrent. They shrug their shoulders. So what  A Panelbase poll the other day showed that  per cent of Scots believe independence will be good for the Scottish economy.Anne and Robrsquos instinctive caution and suspicion about politicians, especially politicians telling you what to do, is also clearly under threat. Many Scots listen to Nicola Sturgeonrsquos briefings obediently rather than questioningly they are more likely than people in the rest of the UK to wear face masks and to do it zealously, belligerently even they also bristle at criticism of the First Minister. Scots like Anne and Rob may have been conservative, but they werenrsquot conformist. What happened to our antipathy to authority  Itrsquos one of the things I liked about us most.:Opinion: Mark Smith: The leaked SNP email that shows why Nicola Sturgeon is doing so wellAnne and Robrsquos dual British Scottish identity is also on the way out. I was chatting to a retired coal miner the other day ndash hersquos in his s ndash and it was interesting to see his take on the world. He was passionately anti-Thatcher and is passionately Royalist he is instinctively Scottish and instinctively British. Some nationalists would see those positions as contradictory but theyrsquore not. A lot of Scots feel that way. The problem is a lot of them are in their s and s and wonrsquot be around for much longer.I have to admit that fact does get me down. I accept there are lots of older Scots who support independence . But it seems to me that, as more of the post-war generation dies out, the more we lose the voices of caution and conservatism. Younger Scots are always going to be a bit more relaxed about risk ndash thatrsquos natural ndash but we are losing the Scots who look at the idea of change, and the cost of it, and say: ca canny.The only hope is that some younger voters wonrsquot always be the same as they are now and that, as they get older, their views will moderate and change. Who knows, they may even start to understand the value of Anne and Robrsquos approach to spending money, and to politicians and nationalistic politicians in particular. It sometimes happens as you get older: you see more.But I am not hopeful. Increasingly, when I speak to people under , they feel uncomfortably dferent to many of the Scots I know, and the effect is even more marked when you speak to people under . They are aggressively supportive of Nicola Sturgeon and aggressively attached to Scottishness. They are dismissive of the risks of independence and the benefits of being in a union. I do not like any of this. I think it is a mark of nationalist ideology. I would prefer itmore people thought like Anne and Rob, and my granny, and me. But I can also see that itrsquos happening nonetheless. I cannot change it. I cannot stop it. I must accept it."},{"url":null,"title":"60-minute-makeover-star-john-amabile-home-design-haven-lockdown","story":"And as people spent more time at time at home during lockdown, interior designer John Amabile was able to give a little back to his followers and fans.

It has been so enjoyable to do and it is great when all the questions come through. People put up pictures and I post projects and room ideas and I think everyone just likes a good nosy and I like to see what people are doing. People have been engaging which has been great and even answering their home questions.

You set your budget from a bronze, silver or gold box and I have chosen items to go in it with the running about all done for you.ldquoAnother step would be to offer online design consultations through my website. It was something I had been thinking about before lockdown, and now seems like the appropriate time do to something like this.It is not the only ambition Amabile has to expand as he is looking to start what would initially be an online design school helping people to take on their own projects.He added: ldquoDuring the forums I have been taking notes on all the questions asked to see what people are interested in doing or trying and I would like to develop this into a design school. It seems to be he next stage and would help people get to the next step in design without any mystery or magic to help them have a good home.ldquoFrom the comfort of their home they could download kits from design theories to colour wheels to create their own style.And while many people are logging on to Amabilersquos facebook forum on a Sunday morning, many fans can still get their -minute Makeover fix on TV reruns.ldquoI did loved doing the show and the most important thing for me was meeting the family and getting it right for them, added Amabile. ldquoI could have jumped about the UK and designed homes based on what I liked, but it was about getting it right for the person.For more information go to: www.youtube johnamabiledesign, www.facebook johnamabiledesign or www.facebook groups amabilehomehaven"},{"url":null,"title":"new-glasgow-labour-leader-named-upset-win","story":"Malcolm Cunning lived up to his name by defeating favourite Martin McElroy after entering the race at the eleventh hour.Cllr McElroy, , was seen as ashoo-in for the postafter Frank McAveety stood down saying it was time for a ldquonew generation to take over.However Cllr Cunning, , madea late entry at last weekrsquos Glasgow Labour Group AGM and went on to winby  votes to .It is understood he had the making of most of the female councillors on the -strong oppositionat SNP-run Glasgow City Council.Cllr Cunninghas said he will contest the next local election in , but not serve a full term.His deputy leader is Eva Murray, , who was elected unopposed at last weekrsquos AGM.Cllr Cunning was first elected to the City Chambers in  and represents the Linn ward on the cityrsquos south side.He has previously served as the Executive Member for Health and Social Care and Chair of Glasgow City Licensing Board, as well as the Councilrsquos Veteransrsquo Champion.Women now fill most of the leadership positions within the Labour Group.Cllr Cunning said: ldquoI am honoured and grateful that my fellow Labour councillors have placed their trust in me to step up as Leader of our group.ldquoIt is less than two years until the next Council election and Glasgow desperately needs an administration that stands up for our city and our communities.ldquoLabour in Glasgow will always put our city first and pursue policies made in Glasgow, for Glasgow.ldquoI look forward to working alongside Councillor Eva Murray and the wider Labour team in holding the current administration to account.ldquoThe proposals revealed over the weekend, to effectively shut Citizens Advice Bureaux across the City, show just how important it is to have a Council that stands up for Glasgow, and against SNP cuts.Cllr Eva Murray, who takes over from Archie Graham, said: ldquoGlasgow has been let down badly by this SNP administration.ldquoTime after time, they have sided with the Scottish Government, while they make devastating cuts instead of fighting for a fair deal for the people of Glasgow.ldquoI want to pay tribute and thank both Frank and Archie for all the work they have done in leading our group both in administration and in opposition.ldquoI have always been appreciative of their support and encouragement since being elected before that, as a young member in Glasgow.ldquoIn the coming months, Glasgow faces perhaps the most challenging circumstances it has ever faced.

TalkRadio, which is also owned by Murdoch, already operates by that standard.

Once you get beyond its traditional reporting slots ndash like the Six OrsquoClock News ndash its current affairs programming is cheap and sensationalist.

The recent row over the singing of Rule Britannia during the BBC Proms was confected nonsense but the broadcaster worked to ramp up the storm in discussion segments.Herein lies the key flaw with the BBC ndash it should stick to reporting the news, not commenting on the news. Itrsquos the BBCrsquos job to tell the nation, impartially and intelligently, whatrsquos going on nationally and internationally through its publicly funded journalism. Itrsquos not the BBCrsquos job to get clicks online and stir up social media rows.Leave the commenting to newspapers. The British press is historically a rambunctious free-for-all ndash in print, the news should be reported with accuracy and balance, but in terms of comment you can fight your political corner as vehemently as you wish, within the limits of libel laws and decency. In contrast, broadcasting rules are very clear on standards of impartiality. And that makes sense ndash a newspaper isnrsquot piped into your home. You chose to read a particular paper. In Britain, you donrsquot chose the BBC ndash itrsquos a fact of le, like death and taxes hellip at least, until the Tories use the licence fee to finish it off.We got a hint that even the BBC sees the writing on the wall with reports that the new director-general, Tim Davie, is apparently lsquoopenrsquo to the broadcaster implementing some Netflix-style subscription model, in the wake of a damaging poll showing ebbing public faith.As an aside, I should point out that while the BBC has pandered to a right-wing agenda, thatrsquos now coming for it, itrsquos also pandered to the so-called lsquowoke leftrsquo, whose activists equally hate it. The BBC tried to play both sides against the middle and failed miserably.A word of advice for the BBC. Forget about social media ndash itrsquos drugged you and your journalists and you can no longer see the wood for the trees when it comes to reporting. Get your staff off Twitter ndash itrsquos not a good look when it comes to impartiality. Stick to reporting the news, not trying to whip up storms through comment on the news.The problem is, itrsquos too late to change the BBC. And that spells trouble for British democracy. The incorporation of Fox News-style TV to Britain will make our current culture wars look like a playground tf. Wersquoll further ide, truth will become ever more remote. Look to America ndash thatrsquos a land we donrsquot want to venture towards as a society. The BBC was meant to preserve Britain from taking this direction, instead itrsquos witlessly colluded in such a fate. It has shamed itself.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

It comes after research found that during lockdown those living in more deprived areas had less access to gardens and green spaces.It is estimated that one in eight households has no garden, making access to parks more important.WWF Scotland said this figure is concerning as multiple studies have shown the benefits of nature to physical and mental wellbeing.The conservation charity says their findings add more weight to a fresh post-Covid campaign to ldquotransformative actions that will help Scotlandrsquos nature and ldquobuild a fairer future for all.Launched by a host of environmental charities including RSPB Scotland, Scottish Wildle Trust and WWF Scotland, it highlights five areas for immediate action from the Scottish Government: restoring and protecting Scotlandrsquos globally important peatlands replacing and expanding native forests improving deer management creating a new system to support eco-friendly farming and linking up wild places through a new Scottish Nature Network.Other proposals include introducing new legislation to ensure all new development is net-positive for nature establishing a Scottish inspectorate to tackle invasive non-native species and committing to at least a third of Scotlandrsquos seas being highly protected.Lang Banks, director at WWF Scotland said: ldquoThese findings make it clear that nature is a boost to peoplersquos wellbeing and that the majority of people in Scotland really valued having the opportunity to get out into nature during lockdown.\"Sadly, we know that not everyone has access to greenspace, with people living in the most deprived areas less able to enjoy nature close to home. Itrsquos in all our interests that everyone is afforded the chance to enjoy easy access to greenspaces and more nature.ldquoThatrsquos why our recent Nature Recovery Plan, calls for a change to planning policy, ensuring that new developments enhance and make space for nature and that habitats across Scotland are better managed and better connected. We need the places we live and work to support our collective well-being where people and nature can thrive.With the current climate and bioersity crises affecting species, habitats and landscapes here in Scotland and around the globe, the survey also found people in Scotland showed great concern for our natural world.Almost three-quarters of those askedsaid the Scottish Government should take decisive action to tackle the nature and climate emergencies on a similar scale taken to tackle the COVID- crisis.A recent study by researchers at the University of Exeter found that spending time in the garden is linked to similar benefits for health and wellbeing as living in wealthy areas.People with access to a private garden also had higher psychological wellbeing, and those with an outdoor space such as a yard were more likely to meet physical activity guidelines than those without access to outdoor space.Britainrsquos parks and fields are also at signicant risk of development, according to new research by the Fields in Trust charity.It estimated that . million people currently lived more than a -minute walk away from a public park, and this figure could increase by a further , in the next five years.The study, which coincides with Field in Trusts annual green space index, suggests that the equivalent of , football pitches worth of green space could be lost in the next  years due to population growth.Earlier research from Fields in Trust suggested that the wellbeing value associated with the frequent use of green spaces is worth more than pound billion each year to the UK.A Scottish Government spokesman said: \"Scotland is an environmental leader and the importance of green space is recognised in our policies from health to regeneration, early years to planning. Such spaces are important for peoplersquos health and our towns and cities boast a wealth of them. Our urban areas are % greenspace and our planning policy promotes these spaces as part of successful place-making.ldquoWe are also encouraging communities to get involved in the design, management and maintenance of greenspaces through our planning advice and funding for community regeneration.ldquoWe are also investing in the quality of our greenspaces, including funding the Central Scotland Green Network, Through the CSGN Development Fund we have invested more than pound million since  in projects that are promoting active travel, woodland planting, community growing and restoring land for the Central Scotland Green Network."},{"url":null,"title":"opinion-andrew-mckie-activists-swapped-politics-cult-membership","story":"Bismarckrsquos career, however, is as good an example as one could present of just how many unlikely things, like creating an empire from scratch, are in the realms of the possible. Bismarckrsquos distinction should really be seen as being between ideas, however bizarre, that are realisable, and those that are merely idealistic.Charles Fourier, one of the godfathers of libertarian socialism, thought that the oceans would turn into lemonade when the workersrsquo paradise was achieved, which seems unlikely. But he was just as thoroughly mocked for some of his other wacky notions, which included feminism , redistribution of wealth, homosexual equality and the foundation of a Jewish state in Palestine.Politics may not be able to contravene the laws of nature, which includes human nature. Attempts to produce ldquosystems so perfect that no one will need to be goodmay be doomed by humanityrsquos instincts towards free association, self-interest, collective action, the desire to trade, to challenge authority or any of dozens of other impulses.But when it comes to redrawing longstanding borders, or throwing out regimes, or even fundamental forms of government, that have seemed invincible, history has no shortage of examples. Indeed, what most of us think of as history is a list of such events: the fall of Rome, the Reformation, the French Revolution, universal suffrage and countless other seismic changes that were thought unthinkable by many, until they happened.In Malcolm Bradburyrsquos novel The History Man, when someone objects to a Marxist studentrsquos assertion that ldquoall forms of knowledge are ideological. That means they are politics, another student asks: ldquoWho is this crazy doll  She says we donrsquot need a revolution.Howard Kirk, the bookrsquos radical protagonist, replies: ldquoThere are people who think like thathellipthere werenrsquot, we wouldnrsquot need a revolution. The historical fact of revolutions is proof that that what once seemed unthinkable is perfectly possible politically. The same is true of counter-revolutions: the historian Richard Cockettrsquos account of the academics and think-tanks that challenged the economic and political assumptions of the post-war period was entitled Thinking the Unthinkable.Yet those ideas about markets and globalisation have been dominant for decades, as was the Clause IV-era of socialism that preceded them .Clearly, these positions are all in the realms of the possible. The error ndash whatever the claims of Marxian historicists, or those who believe in the necessary triumph of liberal democracy , or assert that technology, or laisser-faire economics, can fix anything ndash is to think them inevitable.Despite that, there is a growing tendency among those actively committed to certain kinds of politics ndash notably the Left, though it is apparent on all points of the compass ndash to consider any contrary view unthinkable:not strictly speaking impossible, somehow impermissible.They mostly donrsquot seem to think that because of pseudoscientic Marxist economics or post-Hegelian historical determinism, but because they are incapable of seeing why anyone  might not share their views. Much of the current atmosphere of what passes for political discourse is not about disagreements, however vehement, about basic principles, or even the traditional,sometimes irrational, tribal loyalty of political parties .Instead, justication is by faith alone, and evidence can be cheerfully disregarded when it collides with doctrine. Whatrsquos more, its claims are to be advanced by constant searches for heresy: those who donrsquot share the grouprsquos opinions are not just wrong, but wicked. They canrsquot just be mistaken they have to be thick, or misled by deceitful conspiracies, or fascist.All sorts of people, some of whom previously seemed fairly normal, now operate like this. Ardent Remainers, of course, who think anyone who voted for Brexit was thick, misled, selfish, too old for their views to count and, naturally, racist. But Leavers who now maintain anything except a WTO settlement is a betrayal look very nearly as unhinged.Corbynites, who collectively share the delusion that only a conspiracy of Tories masquerading as members of the Labour Party prevented St Jeremy from gaining a landslide win. Anyone who thinks that the Union, or independence, is a self-evident, easily settled or straightforward issue, even when presented with the knowledge that their side can be no more than a few percentage points ahead. Those convinced of the existence ndash nay, the desirability ndash of identity politics and coming race or culture wars, and who are deeply entrenched in their commitment to one side or the other.All of these groups seem to regard it as an affront, not only to their own opinions, but to the natural order of things, that they might not be on the winning side. But itrsquos not particularly useful to deny reality.Letrsquos take an example I suspect most of us will find uncontroversial. I donrsquot think Donald Trump is a good president. He has a record that ought to make it certain hersquoll lose: unemployment is over  per cent, the economyrsquos in trouble and hundreds of thousands of people have died. He keeps saying things that are demonstrably untrue. He gives plenty of evidence of being an unscrupulous and unsuitable candidate.But I still think Mr Trump might win, yet the reaction of most of his opponents to Joe Bidenrsquos relatively poor polling is to maintain that their man is still ahead, and to deny that Mr Trump can prevail. If he does, they will claim that he has cheated.I can readily believe that Mr Trump would cheat, but that attitude is missing the point. If they donrsquot understand that it is possible for others to disagree with them, theyrsquore not engaged in politics, but magical thinking.

This is only the beginning though.“The plan will evolve and respond to reflect the feedback and the needs of the sector. We are therefore calling for industry to review and contribute to the plan.” The recovery plan is available to view on the CLF website.Feedback can be submitted via the website on enquiries@constructionforum.scot by September .CLF will take all feedback on board to help develop the plan further, with regular updates published on the CLF site.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The infrastructure proposals have been designed to enable Orkney to manage a transition away from fossil fuels, while continuing to generate social and economic benefit from ongoing oil and gas activity.The proposals will have #transformational# impact on Orkney#s economy and society. As well as creating as many  new jobs, there will also be a substantial number of job opportunities during the construction phase.OIC leader James Stockan said: “Our vision is to build a truly sustainable business that is a core economic asset for Orkney, but also a first phase in enabling a scale of investment and logistical capability for the UK, which will be of international signicance.“Prime Minister Boris Johnson clearly welcomed our ambition and Orkney’s potential during his recent visit to our islands, describing as a ‘fantastic idea’ our vision for Orkney as a low-carbon, zero-emissions hub of innovation, with Scapa Flow at its heart.“We believe the time is right to maximise the incredible natural assets and geography of Scapa Flow and Orkney, to ensure a long-term sustainable future for our communities. We are open for business now, and ready to work with potential investors and operators to develop the signicant strategic and international opportunities Scapa Flow offers.“The Scapa Deep Water Quay proposal has been included in the Islands Deal list of projects that has received funding commitment from the Scottish and UK governments, and we are continuing to ensure that the funding earmarked for this will be secured.”Central to the project is the unique geographical advantage of Scapa Flow, described by the council as the largest natural deep-water harbour in the northern hemisphere, as the potential setting for internationally signicant marine logistics to serve the new and emerging sectors, including low-carbon fuel transition and offshore wind developments.Scapa Deep Water Quay is seen as the optimal location for construction and operations and maintenance activities, associated with offshore wind, as well as for a liquefied natural gasstorage and distribution hub. At the same time, this infrastructure has the capability to accommodate semi-submersible s of all types, giving Orkney a unique UK competitive edge within the existing oil and gas market.The project team believes it could be delivered by . Other proposals, such as Hatston and Kirkwall, could take three or four years to deliver.Phase two will ultimately develop the islands’ smaller harbours and piers across the islands.Harbour users and key stakeholders were consulted from the outset, to help gain an understanding of the issues, constraints and opportunities associated with harbour infrastructure around Orkney, through workshops and interviews. The range of stakeholders includes local communities, harbour users, potential funders and environmental bodies such as Scottish Natural Heritage.Harbourmaster James Buck added: “Tackling decarbonisation is the strand that binds these proposals together, providing infrastructure and knowledge for renewable energy developments around our waters will allow us to reach climate change targets. “We will also look at the potential for net environmental gain through habitat reinstatement and enhancement.”According to the OIC, Orkney Harbours is one of the most erse and successful council-run port authorities in the UK, with an annual turnover of £ million and nearly , annual vessel movements.The council added that the exact timing of construction for each of the phase one masterplan proposals is not yet known.This will be determined over the next six to  months, and will depend on a range of factors including market requirements, funding and environmental considerations.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

But what of other aspects What of community resilience, something I suspect will barely register as a priority for most us when deciding on our weekly shop It may be the case that more people will try and grow more of their own food and local produce will, hopefully, be in greater demand.All very welcome. But what’s really needed is a completely fresh approach to our behaviour as consumers.As the pound in our pocket becomes ever more stretched we need to value it in terms of what benefit it can bring to the wider collective # who can it support, what should it support and how can that can bring about greater resilience within our own communities.It’s not radical or revolutionary. It’s just about taking a bit more time and effort to think about where best to spend our cash, especially when it comes to our most basic of needs.It can’t possibly make sense to get your Sunday roast from the supermarketthe same cut of meat is available at your local butcher at a comparable price . And especiallythat butcher has sourced his meat from the crofter down the road.It takes a bit of extra effort to call in at the butcher, for sure, but add in important elements like food miles and provenance and there really is no excuse, except for our own inherent laziness.It has always amazed me how there is any fish at all on the shelves of supermarkets in this part of the world when the local fishmongers offer far higher quality at a lower price.And, in any case, it’s now perfectly possible to buy direct from the fisherman, with many of them now offering sales to the public.That may have come about through the closure of their overseas markets during lockdown, but what better example of necessity being the mother of invention.If west-coast prawns were coveted by sophisticated palates on the Mediterranean, then they should be more than adequate for consumption a bit closer to home.It’s not that long ago that our communities were completely self-reliant in food.We do demand a more discerning choice these days # no-one would want toto a diet made up entirely of fish, mutton and potatoes.But, with an abundance of quality produce on our own doorstep, surely it makes sense to take more advantage of that and in the process create greater community resilience through sourcing from independent, local retailers.If there’s a downside to that approach, I fail to see it.ONE aspect that looks certain to change, certainly for the foreseeable, is that there will be less air travel.Through the lockdown it is estimated that carbon emissions have been reduced by over  per cent by planes being grounded alone.That’s not even taking account of reductions in car journeys and it is a staggering figure from just one simple change.There are certain elements in the environmental lobby who would have you believe that methane emissions from cattle make a signicant contribution to climate change.Never mind that bovineshave roamed the land for thousands of years without causing much harm.Never mind that it’s only the last  or  years, as our economy became ever reliant on fossil fuels, that the damage to our planet has been made.The reduction in air travel will be for economic, more than environmental, reasons.But the staggering statistics of these last few months should at least mean that when it comes to a real determination in tackling environmental damage the finger of blame will be pointed in the right direction.Then again, maybe cows are a much easier target."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image.jpg","title":"royal celtic societys unique music","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineWork has begun on processing the twenty entries received for a unique competition which set the country’s musicians the challenge of creating a new shinty composition.

Clare Cushenan started Special Delivery NI last year.She brings gt baskets packed with items for mum and baby to hospitals for new mothers - along with positive and reassuring information about Down Syndrome.And now she is seeking help from retailers and the public to ensure the caring project goes from strength to strength.Clare explains: “I started Special Delivery NI because when my third child, Aoe, was bornI was given her Down Syndrome diagnosis shortly after her birth.“I was shocked and didn’t know what le with a child who was ‘dferent’ would be like. “How would this affect my family  Would she be able to go to school with her older brother and sister  How would we cope with this ”Clare says she was given lots of leaflets on Down Syndrome which seemed to concentrate on all the ious the health concerns people with DS might face. She added: “It appeared to have her le mapped out. It was overwhelming and unfortunately mainly negative, slanted towards the worst case scenario. The midwives though very kind didn’t alleviate any of my fears - but how could they  “They had no frame of reference, just a memory of the last woman who had a baby with Down syndrome and left with the myriad of leaflets.”Clare remains determined that no mother and family who have a baby with Down syndrome will leavehospital feeling as she did.“I have to leave the boxes in the maternity units and the midwives ask the mothershe wants one. I want them to hear ‘congratulations your baby is perfect’ because they are. “All our worries and concern about Aoe’s future were unfounded. We have a typical family le. “Yes Aoe takes longer to achieve her developmental milestones but she does achieve them. She has taught us all about patience and determination.“The gt baskets contain positive information about Down syndrome. They include a ‘Wouldn’t Change A Thing’ book which seeks to portray the true stories of positive, lived experience typical of the majority of real people with Down syndrome and their families. “There is a letter from me congratulating the new mum and basically saying it is overwhelming but it will be fine - actually better than fine, amazing! And of course the items for baby and items for mum. “I need help from shops and retailers and iniduals, financiallyand also through donating items suitable for the gt baskets.”To find out more and for links to the fund-raising page simply go to the Special Delivery NI page on Facebook.

This report is confirmation of how big a con by republicas that ‘decommissioning’ was.”However, all the weaponry controlled by the IRA was confirmed to have been decommissioned in  when the senior IRA figure liaising with the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning gave an assurance that the organisation’s entire arsenal was put beyond use.The decommissioning process was hailed by the British and Irish Governments, and praise was heaped on the committee headed by Canadian general John de Chastelain.West Belfast-based Catholic priest Fr Alex Reid and former Methodist president Rev Harold Good witnessed the decommissioning.In a statement afterwards, the two clergymen said: “We are satisfied that the arms decommissioning represents the totality of the IRA’s arsenal.”It is claimed that in the MI recordings of the dissident meetings New IRA leaders boast of having raised signicant funds abroad.A source with knowledge of the recordings said: “They boast about raising £m in America and Russia, the bulk of which came from America, but claim they can’t get access to the money.”It is also claimed that the New IRA leaders complain about the lack of respect they receive compared to former IRA leaders.A Glaswegian, Dennis McFadden, was last week named in court as an MI agent by lawyers representing those dissident republicans facing charges following the sting operation in Co Tyrone.Houses were bugged during Operation Arbacia, which has devastated the New IRA.

He also recalled being boozed up from an afternoon in the pub when he was handed the Northern Ireland job by Boris Johnson.The  track performed by German Eurodance group Snap! was an international success when released  years ago.It spent six weeks at the top of the UK singles chart, becoming the second biggest-selling single of , surpassed only by Whitney Houston#s version of I Will Always Love You.Mr Smith revealed his eclectic musical tastes yesterday during the in-depth BBC Radio Ulster Talkback interview with presenter William Crawley, which was intercut with songs specially chosen by the ex-SoS.The programme kicked off with Land of the Mountain and the Flood by Hamish Maccunn, a Scottish overture. Other choices, however, displayed Mr Smith#s love of pop music such as the Pet Shop Boys#  synth number one classic, It#s a Sin.He went on to reveal that listening to dance music has been something of a hallmark of his political career which he continued when he arrived in Northern Ireland.And the one I was listening to the most when I was going through the later end of the Stormont talks - when I was trying to persuade Arlene , when I was trying to call on votes with Michelle , when I was rushing down to Derry to see Colum , was Rhythm is a Dancer, he recalled.I would sit in the back of the truck with the protection people in the front and a special advisor fed up with the sight of me from the long days beside me, with this in my headphones.The MP said he would continue to help Northern Ireland any way he could, describing his  days in the role as a huge privilege.The -year-old said he was offered the role after he had spent the afternoon in the pub drinking far too many beers when he lost his job as Conservative chief whip, adding it was a huge honour to accept the role.It was a joy, it was demanding and it was relentless... I#m really committed long-term to do anything that#s needed to assist a part of the UK that has gone through the most horrendous time, he explained.Mr Smith, who recently enjoyed a holiday here, was replaced by Brandon Lewis in Prime Minister Boris Johnson#s cabinet reshuffle just five weeks after power-sharing was reinstated. He is regarded by the public as one of the most popular Secretaries of State in recent years. Going forward in Northern Ireland, he said he wanted less focus on the constitutional issue and more on the people here.I was really struck when we did the Stormont deal, people were literally coming up to me in the street and just thanking me for getting it back up and running. That was because, not that they didn#t have views on the constitution, but at the moment the focus needs to be on getting stuff done, whether it#s education, healthcare, whatever.Belfast Related ContentNews PremiumexclusiveJulian Smith: #I miss so many things about Northern Ireland... not least the Ulster fries and tray bakes# Northern Ireland is accustomed to Secretaries of State who can#t wait to catch the first plane home when their time is up and never set foot in the place again, butnot this one.Most ReadTerrorist who allowed Newry home to be used for IRA plotting dies suddenlyCoronavirus Northern Ireland: No further deaths and  new cases confirmedI feel the loss deeply, says UUP MLA Doug Beattie after soldiers die by suicide just weeks apartDUP MLA questions police Portstewart promenade closure to put brakes on #boy racers# Sinn Fein members met #MI spy# in loyalist heartland,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Simon Case, who was made permanent secretary at  Downing Street earlier this year, will be announced as the Cabinet Secretary today, according to the Financial Times. Mr Case spent almost two years working as William#s right-hand man before temporarily moving to Number  earlier this year to assist with the coronavirus response. His expected promotion to Cabinet Secretary comes after Sir Mark Sedwill announced he would step down from the post amid reports of clashes with Boris Johnson#s chief adviser. Dominic Cummings was reported to have been unimpressed by the response of the Cabinet Office to the coronavirus outbreak, telling aides a hard rain is coming for the Civil Service. Government sources declined to comment on the reports, but a Cabinet Office spokesman said: An official announcement on the new Cabinet Secretary will be made on Tuesday, September .

Micky Doherty was presented with the Foyle Pride Mark Ashton Award for Outstanding Contribution to the LGBTQ+ community by the citys real Mayor, SDLP Councillor Brian Tierney, at a ceremony at the Holywell Trusts Garden of Remembrance on Saturday night. A spokesperson for Foyle Pride said Mr Doherty, who fronts the citys Pride parade each year, was a truly deserving winner who does so much, for not only the LGBTQ+ community, but also the wider city and district community. Mr Doherty is a tireless charity fundraiser and helped set up a special fund to help local people in need during the oronavirus crisis. googletag.cmd.push Im known in the local area as being a charity fundraiser-theres a charity fundraiser Ill host it, said Mr Doherty. Its just part of me that I like helping people. During lockdown I knew people had started to struggle and they were coming to me and I started to think about how I could help. Because I have been working with charities for a long time people put their trust in me. Mr Doherty was hosting a drive through bingo event last week when he got a phone call to say he had won the Foyle Pride award. I just burst out crying, he admitted. I really didnt expect it so I was just overwhelmed. googletag.cmd.push I just have so much gratitude for the award and for everyone who nominated me and I want to thank them all. Mr Doherty said he wished his late mum, Cathy, could have been there on Saturday to see him receive his award. Its hard to accept that my mammy couldnt be there, he said. Its just not the same without her but I am still filled with so much gratitude for it, he said. Derry LGBT+ campaigner, Suzanna Toland, who passed away earlier this year, was remembered at Saturdays ceremony. It was really nice to see Suzanna recognised for everything that she did, said Micky. She was a very special person.Before she passed away she had set up an LGBT+ disco at Rosie Joes so that people would have a safe place to socialise.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The guidance, announced this evening by Peter Weir, comes into effect from August . The Minister said: “My key priority is that pupilsto school on a full-time basis, as soon as it is safe to do so. “Following further advice which I have received today from the Chief Medical Officer and the Chief Scientic Adviser, I am recommending that pupils and teachers wear a face covering in corridors and other communal areas of post-primary schools from next week when schoolsfull-time. googletag.cmd.push ”This updates the existing guidance on the use of face coverings in educational settings. “The current public health advice is that the use of face coverings provides some benefits, however, it is not a replacement for frequent hand washing, social distancing where possible, covering your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze and regular cleaning of surfaces. “It is also important to remember that evidence suggests that the risk of transmission in schools is relatively low compared to some other settings. “My existing guidance on the reopening of schools already deals with the use of face coverings. “In terms of school transport, the advice remains the same, that we strongly recommend that all pupils wear a face covering on all dedicated school transport including buses and taxis where it is appropriate for them to do so. googletag.cmd.push “In relationto communal areas in schools, the guidance already strongly encourages face coverings for activities that entail large numbers of staff or pupils within an enclosed space where social distancing is not possible.  “Given the risk mitigations in place in schools to limit and contain the spread of Covid-, face coverings are not recommended as being compulsory for routine use in education settings. “However, staff and pupils may wish to use them during the routine school day and this is acceptable. “Schools should also be aware that some personsare exempt from wearing face coverings. “I will continue to keep all guidance in respect of education settings under review in light of the latest medical and scientic advice. Peter Weir added: “The first step in keeping our schools safe is that anyone with symptoms should not attend school. Parents should not send their children to schoolthey have any of the Covid- symptoms including: a high temperaturea new, continuous cougha loss or change to your sense of smell or taste.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It is understood that the mystery vessel was bought for pound with the unknown owner planning to convert it into an Airbnb boat.  Foyle Search and Rescue , the police and other relevant agencies responded to reports of the boat being stuck on Sunday when they offered the crew assistance. The vessel, Day Dawn N , was last known to be engaged in fishing. according to the Marine Traffic website. Another site, Vessel Finder, also states that it received the latest position of the boat at .pm on August . googletag.cmd.push FSR were tasked on Sunday last, following reports of a grounded vessel. Pat Carlin, of FSR, said the boat was likely to be there until mid-September when the tide would be high enough for it to re-float. “She’s stuck solid,” he added. “We went and assessed the boat, determined that the crew were safe and passed that information on to the police service,” Mr Carlin explained “We provided them with some basic supplies that they needed and basically the vessel is grounded and can’t be move until the tide is lted. “All relevant services were notied and are aware that it’s there.” googletag.cmd.push Mr Carlin continued: “I think they were up on the council pontoon and to the best of my knowledge they may have come from outside the area, I don’t know exactly. “They’ll have no choice but to wait, maybe with the sudden floods tonightthey’ll be lucky and might get re-floated otherwise they’ll have to wait until the tides are high enough.” The PSNI confirmed that police assisted partners, including FSR and Coastguard in liaising with the crew. A report from , shows that Day Dawn N  was bought for the purposes of fishing from Portavogie. It was said to be the first time the vessel had been based anywhere  apart from Kilkeel since her arrival in  from Banff where the wooden-hulled boat was built by John Watt  Sons as a trawler. Harbour master at Portavogie, Neil Warnock, yesterday said Day Dawn was based there but left a couple of months ago. “Somebody bought it for a pleasure craft,” he explained. “It’s not a fishing boat any more, the licence on it was sold off a while ago there. “The last I heard the boat was in Portrush, I saw a picture of it at Portrush harbour after it left here.” At Portrush, the assistant harbour master said the boat owner was only there for three days and he believed the man travelled from the Greencastle direction. He was trying to get himself a permanent mooring, he said, but wasn’t able to secure it. The owner left Portrush heading towards Derry where he tried to get a mooring in the town and ended up on the mud flats. “I just know that he bought that for pound. None of the fishermen like decommissioning so they basically would rather they go off. “So I think he bought it for a pound and wanted to change it into an Air B ‘n’ B, but we couldn’t offer him a permanent mooring in Portrush, so he was only here for three days,” the Assistant Harbour Master added. Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Foyle Port added: “Foyle Port is aware that a small trawler has run aground at Madams Bank in the River Foyle. “There is no environmental threat or impediment to other marine craft. “Once conditions are right we expect the vessel to become buoyant again.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Bark n Baths in the Springtown Industrial Estate has four dog washing stations equipped with a professional shower and dryer and specially formulated sham- poos and conditioners.  Co-owner Garaidh Tomas Grfiths said the idea came about after many dog owners had to start washing their own pets during lockdown. “All the dog groomers had to close but they were sharing videos online to show people how to wash and brush their dogs coat themselves, said Mr Grfiths. People had no choice but to do it for themselves, but they were bent over their bath and giving themselves a bad back. googletag.cmd.push Then they had to chase a wet dog around the house to try and dry them before they got that wet dog smell and after all that they had to spend another half an hour cleaning their bath so it could be used by the rest of the family again. Mr Grfiths, who also owns the Canine Lodge doggie day care, hit on the idea of opening a self service dog washing salon. “After lockdown people are looking to save as much money as possible and we are able to offer people the chance to wash their dog from as little as pound. googletag.cmd.push “Its great for people who have taken their dog to the beach or a country park and want to give them a quick wash and get rid of any sand or muck. Every station at Barks n Baths is set up with an industrial shower and dryer, highly absorbent towels, and PH balanced dog shampoo and conditioner and disposable aprons and gloves. A dogs PH level is dferent to a human so using the wrong product can affect their skin, coat and overall health, said Mr Grfiths If we can help someone maintain their dogs health we are happy to do it. A  minute session will cost pound and the price goes up from there to pound for  minutes, pound for  minutes and pound for an hour which would be long enough to wash and dry a big dog with long hair. There is also a private bay for dogs that may be anxious or anti-social. The private bay is partitioned off and has its own entrance so it is perfect for dogs that are nervous or aggressive around other dogs or people, added Mr Grfiths. We have had people come to us who have been told their dog isnt suitable to go to a groomer, so they are delighted this service is here. Bark n Baths is located at Site , Unit  in the Springtown Industrial Estate close to Cable  Accessories.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Derry man Stephen Whoriskey has loved Brooks’ music since she he was a teenager and often listens to it when he is having a tough time. The -year-old has struggled with anxiety, depression and insomnia on and off for nine years and the coronavirus lockdown brought his mental health problems to the fore again. In a bid to give him a distraction, his we Kimberly set him the challenge of learning to play the guitar and promised she would buy him the same model as the country music superstarhe succeeded. googletag.cmd.push Meanwhile, Stephen sent Garth a message on his live Facebook QA page sharing his battle with depression, asking how Brooks kept his spirits up during lockdown and telling him about his we’s guitar challenge. The Derry man burst into tears when Mr Brooks choose his question for a live video chat. “He said me and you have a lot in common, I deal with a lot of stuff too, said Stephen. “And he said he liked being dark for his music, but that the dference was he could switch it off. “I just broke down in tears. I ran up the stairs to my we but I couldn’t speak. googletag.cmd.push “She thought something bad had happened, but I just couldn’t get the words out.” Before signing off, Garth said he would send Stephen a guitar. Weeks had passed and there was no sign of the much-longed-for instrument, but out of the blue he got a call from UPS saying it was being held in customs as it might be made from illegal Brazilian rose wood. A frantic string of phone calls followed until a Garth Brooks impersonator from England, who had the same guitar, confirmed the rose wood was East Indian. Finally, Stephen’s guitar was delivered to his home in the Waterside and he hasn’t put it down since. “I still can’t really believe it, he said. “My two-year-old Aria was always slapping and twanging away at the strings on my old guitar, but she knows not to touch this one,” he laughed. “It shows how much Garth cares about his fans. “He always says his fans made him and they are like his family.” Stephen, who is a youth worker and a performer with ‘In Your Space’ circus said it’s important to him to be upfront about his mental health. “Lock down is so unprecedented, he said. “No one has ever been here before. “It has caused a lot of anxiety and depression. “Because I work with young people I think it’s important to show them it’s ok to talk about your feelings- particularly young men. “Younger and younger people are dealing with stuff like this. “I would say to anyone who is struggling to look for the small things to get you through. “But this, for me, was massive,” he added.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In an article for last weeks Sunday Independent, former Derry player and GAA pundit Joe Brolly stated the Oakleaf board had borrowed a poundk Covid bounce-back loan and the county were currently poundk in debt. In the article, in which Brolly quoted former All-Ireland winning teammates Kieran McKeeverand Fergal P McCusker, who is part of Derrys Finance Committee, he said the board were having serious discussions about the feasibility of entering the senior team in the  championship. However, Derry GAA county board chairman Stephen Barker yesterday said: “The simple facts are: Derry GAA is on an extremely solid financial footing.” googletag.cmd.push Barker said that any talk of not entering a senior team in next years championship was completely farcical. “We are not in debt and any reports which suggest otherwise are completely ,” read a county board statement released yesterday. “Unfortunately, these baseless reports about our financial position are causing serious concern among our members and supporters. It is within this context that we feel it’s necessary to address these unhelpful reports by presenting the facts.” The statement also had an extract from Treasurer Martin Devlin, saying that Derry GAA will have capital assets of poundm by the end of this financial year, with no outstanding debt. googletag.cmd.push Devlin outlined that the countys accounts are annually audited. Derry GAA took out a capital loan of poundk in  to finalise the development of Owenbeg. Both Owenbegs stadium pitch and Celtic Park have had renovation work done on the playing surfaces during lockdown. The venues were in a poor state during the NFL NHL campaigns and subject to pitch inspections. Celtic Park is due to host three games in this weekends championship schedule and the senior hurling final is set for the city venue later this month. “At this time, % of that loan remains and the monies have already been set aside to complete that payment schedule within the next three months,” Devlin stated. As part of this seasons championship, the group games were played on a home, away and neutral basis, with a total of approximately poundk in gate receipts. Clubs were promised all the money from their home championship games. “We generated approximately poundk in gate receipts from the group stages and the county board has taken the decision to redistribute that money back to the clubs. “This should help to alleviate some of the financial pressure felt by our clubs due to the Covid- situation,” Barker points out. We are also planning ahead and have secured an additional facility of up to poundk,required, in line with our strategic plan. At this time, and with current interest rates due to Covid-, this just makes solid business sense. “Derry people are fanatical about the GAA and we are aware that these  reports are causing a lot of concern. We want to allay those fears because we are incredibly well served by our members and our loyal sponsors. “We have revealed these financial figures and released this statement because we want to put all this nonsense to rest.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It is within this context that we feel it’s necessary to address these unhelpful reports by presenting the facts.” The statement also had an extract from Treasurer Martin Devlin, saying that Derry GAA will have capital assets of poundm by the end of this financial year, with no outstanding debt. googletag.cmd.push Devlin outlined that the countys accounts are annually audited. Derry GAA took out a capital loan of poundk in  to finalise the development of Owenbeg. Both Owenbegs stadium pitch and Celtic Park have had renovation work done on the playing surfaces during lockdown. The venues were in a poor state during the NFL NHL campaigns and subject to pitch inspections. Celtic Park is due to host three games in this weekends championship schedule and the senior hurling final is set for the city venue later this month. “At this time, % of that loan remains and the monies have already been set aside to complete that payment schedule within the next three months,” Devlin stated. As part of this seasons championship, the group games were played on a home, away and neutral basis, with a total of approximately poundk in gate receipts. Clubs were promised all the money from their home championship games. “We generated approximately poundk in gate receipts from the group stages and the county board has taken the decision to redistribute that money back to the clubs. “This should help to alleviate some of the financial pressure felt by our clubs due to the Covid- situation,” Barker points out. We are also planning ahead and have secured an additional facility of up to poundk,required, in line with our strategic plan. At this time, and with current interest rates due to Covid-, this just makes solid business sense. “Derry people are fanatical about the GAA and we are aware that these  reports are causing a lot of concern. We want to allay those fears because we are incredibly well served by our members and our loyal sponsors. “We have revealed these financial figures and released this statement because we want to put all this nonsense to rest.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Shortly before nine oclock to be precise. Peter Buzzers back bar in Maghera is sparsely populated. Apart from the commentary, as Gaeilge, from TGs GAA  programme humming out of the TV on the wall, you couldve heard a pin drop. Its a Monday club with a dference. There are no boom boxes, no empty take away pizza boxes strewn around the tables nor half drunk people roaring into your ear while making little or no sense. Less than  hours earlier, two decades of concerted Slaughtneil planning and effort morphed into a slick hunger Loughgiel simply couldnt deal with. By the tenth minute, the maroon and white hooped juggernaut had broken into the orbit of Ulster hurling. Nine points clear and  months after the hurt of an extra time defeat by Cushendall, there was no catching them. googletag.cmd.push In his victory speech, Chrissy McKaigue thanked every man, woman and dog involved in their success. Everyone except Thomas Cassidy, who had passed away days before. He waited until the inner sanctum of a packed Slaughtneil hall later that night, when back among their own. The Four Seasons Cup was clasped by one victorious outstretched fist. The index finger on his other hand gestured to the hall floor scarcely visible below the throngs of fans, where Thomas taught him how to play hurling all those years ago. There wasnt a dry eye in the house. Even the walls wouldve had goosebumps. googletag.cmd.push On the Monday night, his brothers Mark, Declan and Bungazed at Buzzers TV with a look and a body language that money couldnt buy. Slaughtneil were at the top of the tree. The new Ulster champions had many helping hands to shape them along the way. But the Cassidys fingerprints were always prominent. Taking over the mantle of the Kellys, who sowed the seeds in the s. Mark and Declan seemed like eternal minor managers when, in the beginning, silverware didnt always reward their toil. On a monsoon afternoon at Kevin Lynch Park, a saturated Bun thumped the roof of the then prefab dressing rooms to the sound of campeones. A team he managed with former minor winner Eoin McGuigan, that included Cormac McKenna and Chrissy McKaigue, had brought home the bacon. It was another building block. Also seated for that Monday viewing was Dermot Doherty, a selector under Michael McShane who is now running his eye over the minors. The apple doesnt fall far from the tree. His father Barney and the late Eugene Babs Kelly managed the clubs  winning team. It was a fitting reward for Barneys ferrying of average underage teams, year after year, in the back of his blue Mercedes van. Often on the lookout for a th player to make up a team that would iniably be on the end of many a hammering. An U shield at a blitz in Dungiven and a South Derry minor hurling final win against Lavey were the modest s for the effort. A FIRST FEacuteILE Below it all, another batch was coming to the fore to cut new ground. In , under Thomas and Barney and captained by current minor selector Adrian Quigg, Slaughtneil won their first ever Feacuteile title. By minor level, with direction from Mark and Declan Cassidy, back to back Ulster minor titles followed, from a group that also won a football title at St Pauls and lost in the final the following year. A generation that also produced current senior football boss Paul Bradley. Under Thomas wing, they won the senior title in  before being beaten out the gate by Dunloy in the Ulster final. It couldve been the beginning of dominance, but instead it was a last senior title for  years as Kevin Lynchs and Lavey ruled the roost. Armed with more coaches coming forward, the Slaughtneil underage hurling production line succeeded Ballinascreens time at the top. No longer was the journey south to the Feacuteile a novelty. It was a permanent fixture in the calendar. With it, came families bonding together and each success inspired the younger teams to follow. A new wave of minor glory at Ballinascreens Ulster tournament followed, but Kevin Lynchs were still the standard at senior level.  was supposed to be the breakthrough year. After winning a league title, Slaughtneils young guns were the pretenders to the Fr Collins Cup only to be sent home with their tail between their legs again by the Lynchs. It was neighbours Swatragh that took the cup for the first of eight seasons into the Granaghan parish where it still remains. The following year, under Mickey Glover, Slaughtneil eventually wrestled clear of Kevin Lynchs on their way to glory. In Ulster, their gung-ho tactics and bravery put Loughgiel to the pin of their collar in a moral victory to ascertain the level required. For the next two years they faced Cushendall in Ulster, but again came up short. All the while the underage production line continued. The Fr Collins Cup was present at one of the underage management meetings, almost as a sign of the level that needed maintained. With every year, came one or two new players into the squad. The fact that Michael McShane handed Shane McGuigan his senior debut in an Ulster final, while still a minor, was a sign of their commitment to growing the team to a height to challenge the big boys. McShane built a management team to match the players ambitions. Every base was covered. Cormac Donnelly came in as trainer. Their games were all analysed. Like the footballers and camogs, the strength and conditioning made them a finely tuned engine. The pre-game routine was planned to the nth degree, so that all the players had to do was turn up and deliver. And they did. Three Ulsters later and their stature on the national stage has soared. Cuala beat them in the manner Dunloy did in . It was followed by defeat to Na Piarsaigh, a game they surrendered from a position of strength. How times had changed. In the s, when Tom Magill had Lavey at their peak, just winning a championship game was a challenge. Now, not being happy after putting up a performance on the All-Ireland stage told enough about the ambition. The Ballyhale game was the greatest statement of intent, taking the giants of club hurling every step of the way. In the physical stakes, they were able to match them and in the skills of the game they were not found wanting either. In an epic, they came so close to the biggest day of all. This weekend, they enter the knockout championship stage again. They will have the favourites tag. There are no two ways around it. Last week, they saw off Na Magha with virtually a reserve team. Only Jerome McGuigan, suspended against Lavey, started from their All-Ireland semi-final team. Thats how far Slaughtneils hurling story has come. From the days when getting  players for a game was an achievement, they have set a standard of skill, attitude and athleticism that the rest of Derry must strive to reach. Success comes in cycles. In recent times, Kevin Hinphey has followed his father into coaching and led Kevin Lynchs to back to back Ulster minor hurling titles. They have been swimming in Slaughtneils wake, searching for ato the top table. The overall Derry hurling landscape needs them, and others, to narrow the gap. To do so, they will need to match an unrelenting hunger for more success. When you have had barren years like Slaughtneil, you wont want to step off the perch anytime soon.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

At the end of a dire game of football, substitute Ciaron Harkin latched onto a cross from Colm Horgan to volley City into the lead with just one minute left on the clock. A clearly dispirited Drogheda then conceded a second in added time as another substitute, this time Stephen Mallon, fired in a second goal to flatter Derry, who responded to their Europa League exit with a valuable win. In a game of few chances, Drogheda were on the front foot early on, showing a lot of energy and enterprise as they did not take Derry settle into the game at all. The home side could well have been celebrating an early goal. Darren Cole gave the ball away down the right and Drogheda countered, with Kane working his way in from the left, and he got a sight of goal only to blaze his effort high and wide without testing Peter Cherrie. googletag.cmd.push It took Derry  minutes to finally threaten the Drogheda goal, and it all came from another brilliant surging run forward from Eoin Toal, this time down the right-wing. Toal’s cross from the right won City the first of two successive corners, the latter of which saw Ada, Hammill cross brilliantly to Cameron McJannett who somehow headed over from under the crossbar when it seemed he must surely score on his debut. City were on the front foot immediately at the start of the second period and Ibrahim Meite, after a quiet first period, went for a spectacular effort almost immediately, his left-footed effort from the edge of the area curling wide of goal without testing Ross Treacy. googletag.cmd.push The visitors were asking the questions at the start of the second half but a Drogheda break, led by Mark Doyle, saw the home side very nearly take the lead. Doyle went on a mazy run through midfield right to the edge of the City penalty area, where his attempted shot was blocked. The ball however ran straight to Brandon Bermingham who tried a low first-time effort which had Cherrie scrambling across goal but it went just wide of the target. The game was heading to extra time before one decisive moment decided it – Colm Horgan breaking into the area and crossing for Harkin to fire in a fantastic finish at the near post with just  seconds left on the clock. There was still time for another goal to really flatter Derry as Meite’s threaded pass put Mallon through on goal and he smashed in his third goal of the season to send the Candystripes through to the quarterfinals. TEAMS DROGHEDA UNITED: Ross Treacy, James Brown, Conor Kane, Jack Tuite , Hugh Douglas, Derek Prendergast, Richie O’Farrell, Mark Doyle, Jake Hyland, Brandon Bermingham , Mark Hughes. DERRY CITY: Peter Cherrie, Ciaran Coll, Cameron McJannett, Eoin Toal, Darren Cole, Conor McCormack, Jake Dunwoody , Joe Thompson , James Akintunde , Adam Hammill, Ibrahim Meite.

He took trains from Milan to Torino, and then up the Susa Valley and around six hours later he was installed in Susa where it was  degrees.Race day dawned without a cloud in the sky and with the temperature already soaring, Hanna joined the front row of the grid designed for social distancing wearing his mask. The mask was obligatory for the first m. Hanna tucked into a front bunch that was a whorsquos who of Italian mountain racing. Hanna covered the first mile in :, and then at km the race became steep. He climbed well, as ever, encountering a dficult patch around the middle and then at about .km he spotted Baldaccini ahead of him, a past winner in  and .By now Hanna was in tenth place and with his climbing legs feeling good again set about moving up the field. He caught Baldaccini and kept pushing and on to the final k, with  flats and true flats at over , feet altitude, Hanna surged to cross the line in a brilliant eighth place.In the process he had taken the scalps of, not just the former winner of the race Baldaccini, but also Puppi, who had taken second place in last yearrsquos World Long-Distance Mountain Racing Championships, and Bernard Dematteis, the former European mountain racing champion.At Down Royal on Saturday, the sound of hi-tec racing flats reverberated around the horse racing turf as the ChampionChip Ireland Road Race Series continued following its event at Eikon, Balmoral, three weeks ago.It was only August , but could easily have been mistaken for late autumn as the blustery conditions from the remnants of tropical Storm Ellen continued to cause havoc in the quest for personal bests.It was a testament to the consistent running many had done during lockdown and throughout the winter before that there were many personal bests achieved.First up was the km, won by Mourne man Andrew Annett in : in a sprint finish with Annadalersquos Eskander Turki . Three weeks ago, David McNeilly, who now graces the ranks of the M category, ran a k PB of :and came home in : for a PB of  seconds dating back over seven years.Next clubman home was Niall Goodman in :, just three seconds outside the time he set at Eikon, he was slightly disappointed but the run consolidates the improvement he has made this year. The ever-improving Francis Tumelty is now in the M category and after just missing out on his K PB three weeks ago with a : clocking in Eikon, he smashed his : from the Bay Road k in  with a : PB here at Down Royal.Fteen year old Tom Crudgington doesnrsquot much like running on the flat mdash instead he loves the hills and mountains. However, hersquos learning that he needs to improve his running on the flat to take it into the mountains and here he set a PB by around a minute with his : time. Phil Murdock broke the -minute barrier for the first time clocking :.Mark Holland has shown steady improvement in training and is another who is getting faster as he gets older, now in the M category. With a previous best of around  and a half minutes, he smashed that with a brilliant : clocking, a fine product for all the work he has done.Nichola Watson has had injury troubles, but over the past couple of months has been training consistently again. Wondering beforehandshe would be strong enough to dip under  minutes, she put any doubt to rest with a brilliantly paced race to record a letime best of :.Also ing to racing, this time less than six months after giving birth to baby Roacutenaacuten, Ashlene Mussen surprised herself in recording a very strong :.Next up was the half-marathon and as ever a glutton for real punishment, Thomas OrsquoGorman toed the line on the back of his :: PB at Eikon three weeks ago.

He found Joe McKenny coming through from midfield and passed to full forward Shea Boyle, who was subsequently fouled and put the ball over the bar to level the match.It was that man Aaron McClements again who scored five of his sidersquos six points by the th minute to put Loughinisland one in front. Eoin Mageean showed guile, skill and composure with a mazy run from wide on the right to the centre and put the ball over from  metres to level things again in the th minute.Ben OrsquoReilly was getting his fare share of possession and fed Conor Megoran to put Loughinisland - to - at the second water break.It appeared the game could swing any way at this stage and Darragh Cross equalised again after Marcus Miskelly scored a magnicent point off the upright from  metres. However, that was as good as it got as Loughinisland dominated the final quarter to secure the win.In a free-flowing move McClements found Ben OrsquoReilly, who scored a delightful point in the th minute. Aiden Nixon came on to replace Rory Deegan for Loughinisland but suffered a reoccurrence of an ankle injury and was replaced by Eddie Nixon just seconds after coming on.Rory Mason scored a great point from  metres with his left foot in the th minute just before Mark McMahon received a yellow card for the Darragh Cross.With victory in sight, Conor Megoran passed to substitute Eddie Nixon and he fisted the ball over the bar for Loughinisland to send his team safely through to the next round of the championship.Darragh Cross: R Miskelly P Branny, M Monan , E Sweeney M Boyle, O McConvey, C Murray M Hardy, J McKinney M McMahon, M Miskelly , J Murray, S Dineen, S Boyle , C Sweeney .

Please try again later.Submitting...The most signicant was the consistencies between the mutineers’ version of Smyth’s Listowel speech and his actual instructions. One example is Smyth’s affirmation that he had ordered the seizure of homespolice stations were burnt and directed that “inhabitants must be turned out of the house on to the street.” The fact of Mee being a spokesman rather than a leader is not a “red herring”. It reveals the extent of the obstinacy Smyth encountered in Listowel.Mee’s and other mutineers’ later statements, whatever their biases, bear this out as does Smyth’s subsequent government briefings.In making these points I rely on close comparisons of first-hand testimony, but I give primacy to Smyth’s accounts.Also, far from claiming that “distinctions” existed between Sinn Fein IRA in , I emphasised that Sinn Fein included the IRA. The IRA was but one component in a broader Sinn Fein orchestrated insurgency. Signicantly, Smyth spoke only of Sinn Fein because he believed that defeating one component was insufficient and that Irish republicanism needed to be rooted out in all its guises.In this, he faithfully adhered to earlier proclamations of Lord Lieutenant French and Chief Secretary Macpherson.Wesley Curry, Belfast BTHate crime: Dissent over gay marriage ‘could see you before NI criminal court’Ramore restaurant row: Stephen Nolan wondershealth workers effectively banned from all restaurants________________________A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Northern Ireland has a proud history of association with the British forces, we have , veterans living in Northern Ireland, male and female, who have served their country in the Royal Navy, the Army and the Royal Air Force. \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...However, it is also reality that a good proportion of those veterans will have suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder , with many having been through ordeals on the battlefield. Brett Savage, who tragically died this weekend while in his early thirties, had spoken out frankly in the past about his own struggles with PTSD. He had served courageously on the battlefields of Helmand Province in Afghanistan, where the Royal Irish Regiment were involved in fierce fighting against the Taliban. It is entirely understandable that veterans not only find it dficult to cope with the memories of the terrible things they sawand experienced, and also that some struggle with ato civilian le. Many veterans feel more able to talk about their experiences in the modern day, but even that is no guarantee that they can put their struggles to bed. Mr Kinahan is right to say thatveterans need help, it should be there for them immediately. Unfortunately that has not always been the case in the past. We wish him well in his hugely important new post. \"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-gxMtzJ sc-dfVpRl dLpuYr\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusGetting outFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

It’s legal by just . metres,the elevation was two metres more it would be illegal. “It’s very flat, it’s very fast andwe get a westerly wind the last six miles will have the wind behind it. Having a fast course is of paramount importance in attracting any international runner. “In my time in the sport it would look to be the greatest ever domestic field for a half marathon in Britain or Ireland. I would include the Great North Run in that.“There’s  Olympians in the race.

 years onMr Evans, of Cardigan in West Wales, but now living in Brecon, said: ldquoIrsquod taken a call back in  to check my availability for a small comedy for BBC Three and set in South Wales.ldquoI met up with Christine Gernonand Ruth Jonesat the Castell Mynach pub near Llantrisant one afternoon to discuss the script and the locations they wanted me to scout.ldquoAn hour or so after the meeting, I got the call from the production company Baby Cow offering me the job.ldquoMy first task was to sit with Dave Ferrisand discuss the vision for Gavin  Staceyrsquos backdrop and get a feel for the key locations.ldquoStaceyrsquos hometown was scripted as a South Wales coastal town, but I was given a free run on this so the hunt took me to Aberavon, Porthcawl, Tenby, Saundersfoot, and Weston-super-Mare - a cheatit had been suitable.ldquoBack in  there were a few areas in Barry which were beginning to look a little tired, but it also came with a timeless charm that provided us with the perfect texture and feel that Dave and I had discussed.ldquoAdded to this was the welcome we were given by residents and, in particular, the support of the local council.ldquoPorthcawl was also a serious candidate for the backdrop to this show, but having scouted tirelessly the whole of Barry and Barry Island, I knew that this ticked every box.Mr Evans said Trinity Street was an instant favourite.ldquoI knew Gwenrsquos house was here, he said. ldquoThe terraced houses on a steep hill and its far-reaching views over to Barry Island and docks meant that no matter which direction the camera was pointing, there would be interesting textures and views.ldquoThe next objective was to get inside as many houses as possible to seeany worked for us as Gwenrsquos house.ldquoI letter dropped about  houses to gauge the interest.ldquoIrsquod heard that Matt Lucas was going to be involved so I used his name get to my foot in the door.ldquoThis usually helps.ldquoIn those days very few had heard of James Corden.ldquoI viewed and took pictures of about five houses on that street and Glendarsquos who was one of the first to contact me.ldquoThe decor and character of Glendarsquos house fitted my brief perfectly, but my first thought was that house was a little on the small side.ldquoTo get a film crew and the actors to work in such a tight space would be quite a challenge, butI could convince our director and designer that it could be achieved Gwenrsquos house was found.ldquoI took Dave and Christine along to Trinity Street and both fell in love with the location within minutes.Mr Evans continued: ldquoGlenda was so accommodating.ldquoI remember very well discussing with her the details of how filming on location works, how disruptive the whole process can be and also the location fee.ldquoWhat I do remember was her reaction when I mentioned the amount.ldquoGlendarsquos reply was: ldquoIrsquom so sorry Clive, but I donrsquot think I can cover that.ldquoGlenda thought that she needed to pay for the privilege of having us there and not the other way round.ldquoShe is a lovely lady and still loves being a part of the Gavin  Stacey world.During the locationsrsquo breakdown meeting, we discussed how Pam and Mickrsquos house might look in Billericay so homes were viewed in and around Llandaff and Sully until Dinas Powys was selected thanks to the welcome that was received.ldquoSt Cattwgrsquos Church at Llanmaes was not the first-choice wedding venue for Gavin and Stacey, Mr Evans said. ldquoThey were due to be married at St Nicholas Church at the village of St Nicholas, but a last-minute change of heart by the Church in Wales meant that we needed to find an alternative at the th hour.ldquoA friend and another locations manager called Chris Hill pulled in a favour and we were able to use St Cattwgrsquos.ldquoI dont recall any candidates other than Island Leisure .ldquoWhile filming on the front, Marco opening up early for the crew to be able to get a nice coffee as the weather was pretty unkind.ldquoWe didnt use the interior of the coffee shop as a location in series one, but as it was so cold when we filmed on the seafront the coffees were very welcome.ldquoWe also filmed at the Vale of Glamorgan Resort for the exterior of the wedding fair.ldquoThe interior was shot at the Copthorne Hotel at Culverhouse Cross.ldquoWhile at the Vale resort, the Wales rugby team came into the reception of the hotel.ldquoRuth Jones askedIrsquod be able to set up a photograph of the cast with the Welsh team.ldquoWe got them to agree so out there somewhere are pictures of the Gavin  Stacey cast with the Wales rugby team.ldquoUncle Brynrsquos house was only an exterior in series one so very little was involved in its search.ldquoQuiz night at the Colcot Arms was interesting.ldquoWe were close to completing our filming when the pub opened to the public - so the last few shots took a little while longer than wersquod planned.Mr Evans lives with his we Rhiannon and daughter Cerys Mim and runs his own Film and TV Facilities company.He added: ldquoThe actors usually donrsquot get to see the locations beforehand.ldquoThey are brought to set, run through a quick rehearsal then go for the real thing.ldquoThey then have to go through the whole thing over and over with the camera shooting from dferent angles.ldquoIt is a slow process and  hours on camera gives us around three minutes of footage.ldquoI get a real buzz from seeing locations that I have found on TV, but when it comes to Gavin  Stacey the story I always bring up is that while scouting in the very early days with the series producer in the car he askedI would consider reading for Dave.ldquoMy le could have been so dferent, but I have no regrets as no-one could have played it better than Steffan Rhodri.ldquoMy daughter Cerys Mim was born during filming and James Corden was the first to congratulate me when I ed to work on the show after her birth.ldquoHe joked about us naming her Nessa or Stacey.ldquoBarry and the Vale have always provided me with a fantastic hunting ground for film and TV locations.ldquoIts a huge contributor to South Wales becoming a hotspot for filming in the last decade or so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

More than half of the children with covid- reported no symptoms.However, the study found that gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea and vomiting were the most common symptoms of covid- in children, ahead of cough or changes in their sense of smell or taste.The findings also showed young children under  years of age were just as likely to have evidence of prior infection as older children, and that asymptomatic children were just as likely to develop antibodies as symptomatic children.Executive director of Public Health for Cardf and Vale University Health Board, Fiona Kinghorn said: ldquoCovid- remains a relatively new virus to us, and it is important that through valuable research studies such as this we continue to increase our understanding of it.ldquoI would like to thank my research colleagues here at Cardf and Vale UHB for their excellent contribution to this study, and congratulate everybody involved for their role in these important findings as this research continues to monitor community transmission of the virus in children.Paediatric research nurse specialist, Zoe Morrison added: ldquoThanks to this study we now better understand the prevalence of covid- in children after the first wave of the pandemic, and know that while the majority of children with Covid- will display no symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea and vomiting could be a sign that they are infected with the disease, and must now consider the value of refining the testing criteria for children to include these symptoms.ldquoThe interest in participating in this clinical trial has been unprecedented and we would like to extend our thanks to all the children and their parents who have volunteered to take part in this study, helping us gain important insight into how this virus behaves among children.CYARU were able to input into the study thanks to funding for research equipment from the Noahrsquos Ark charity.The team will also be using samples collected during the study to test the efficacy of new antibody tests that are developed, as well as monitoring the longer term behaviour of the antibodies to understand whether they reduce in numbers orchildren can lose them over time. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Over my years as principal, we have had great support from the club and some of our past pupils have gone on to represent their county.For me, the notable achievement has been to see the way in which past pupils have progressed in a iety of chosen careers and been successful in so many walks of le.Another achievement is the way in which the staff both past and present have worked together as a team to have accomplished so many things over the past  years, not least to have been awarded Outstanding in our last inspection report.The development of the St. Cairealls Community Playschool on the school site has also brought me great joy over the past ten years to see it now as a successful pre-school provider with DENI status and funding for our local children.Having spent so many years of my le in St Cairealls P.S., it has become a second home and the staff and pupils a second family. Retiring for me brings mixed emotions. However , I am looking forward to having more time to spend with my family, my husband Kevin, our daughters Emer, Niamh and Fionnuala and their partners. Also our son Michael and his partner and my two precious grandsons Micheal and Braidan. Mrs McHugh concluded: I want to offer good wishes to the future of this very special school – St. Cairealls Primary School, Aghyaran and success and happiness to my successor, Mrs Michelle Ellis.  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_dfdbeccbbeffed   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_fcccdcbdaf   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1598431969897.jpg--post_primary_pupils_now_to_wear_face_coverings_in_corridors.jpg?159843197000","title":"post primary pupils now to wear face coverings in corridors ","story":"Education Minister Peter Weir has announced that guidance on face coverings will be updated to include wearing them in corridors of post-primary schools. This will come into effect on  August when schoolson a full-time basis. The Minister said: “My key priority is that pupilsto school on a full-time basis, as soon as it is safe to do so. “Following further advice which I have received today from the Chief Medical Officer and the Chief Scientic Adviser, I am recommending that pupils and teachers wear a face covering in corridors and other communal areas of post-primary schools from next week when schoolsfull-time. This updates the existing guidance on the use of face coverings in educational settings. “The current public health advice is that the use of face coverings provides some benefits, however, it is not a replacement for frequent hand washing, social distancing where possible, covering your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze and regular cleaning of surfaces. It is also important to remember that evidence suggests that the risk of transmission in schools is relatively low compared to some other settings. “My existing guidance on the reopening of schools already deals with the use of face coverings. In terms of school transport, the advice remains the same, that we strongly recommend that all pupils wear a face covering on all dedicated school transport including buses and taxis where it is appropriate for them to do so. “In relation to communal areas in schools, the guidance already strongly encourages face coverings for activities that entail large numbers of staff or pupils within an enclosed space where social distancing is not possible. “Given the risk mitigations in place in schools to limit and contain the spread of Covid-, face coverings are not recommended as being compulsory for routine use in education settings. However, staff and pupils may wish to use them during the routine school day and this is acceptable. Schools should also be aware that some personsare exempt from wearing face coverings. “I will continue to keep all guidance in respect of education settings under review in light of the latest medical and scientic advice. Peter Weir said: “The first step in keeping our schools safe is that anyone with symptoms should not attend school. Parents should not send their children to schoolthey have any of the Covid- symptoms including: a high temperature a new, continuous cough a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste.” The Department’s New School Day Guidance will be updated to reflect this recommendation.  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_dfdbeccbbeffed   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_fcccdcbdaf   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
