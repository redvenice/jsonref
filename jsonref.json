On average, such dresses and other products are discarded by consumers after five weeks.Missguided, an online rival to Boohoo, which also sources products from Leicester, took the low pricing even further this week by promoting a £1 bikini, which proved so popular with customers that the website crashed.But behind the price tag there is an environmental and social cost not contained on the label of such products. “The hidden price tag is the cost people in the supply chain and the environment itself pays,” said Sass Brown, a lecturer at the Manchester Fashion Institute. “The price is just too good to be true.”\u0027Fast fashion\u0027 is a phrase coined to describe inexpensive clothing produced rapidly by mass-market retailers in response to the latest trends. Critics say that the industry has a large carbon footprint,\u0026nbspand creates water and air pollution. Clothes are often manufactured in poor working conditions.Garments are manufactured cheaply, and are expected to have a short life. One in three young women, the biggest segment of consumers,\u0026nbspconsider garments worn once or twice to be\u0026nbspold. UK consumers sent 300,000 tonnes of textiles to be burned or dumped in landfill in 2018.Without rapid reform, the fashion industry - of which fast fashion is the dominant player – could be responsible for\u0026nbspa quarter of the Earth’s carbon budget by 2050.Socially, the booming fast fashion industry is often built on low wages paid to women working in factories abroad but also increasingly in the UK, in cities such as Manchester, Birmingham, London and Leicester. There is no evidence that factories in the Boohoo and Missguided supply chains pay illegal wages. However, some garment workers in Leicester are paid an average of £3 an hour – way under the national minimum wage – MPs heard in evidence.MPs found that the Modern Slavery Act was not robust enough to stop wage exploitation at UK clothing factories. There was a lack of inspection or enforcement, allowing factories – none of which are unionised – to get away with paying illegal wages.In the UK, we buy more clothes per person than any other country in Europe – five times what we bought in the 1980s, which creates 1.3m tonnes of waste each year, some 350,000 tonnes of which is dumped in landfill or incinerated.Yet despite the overwhelming evidence gathered by the environmental audit committee (EAC), ministers this week rejected every recommendation for tackling abuses across the fashion industry, including a ban on incinerating or landfilling stock that can be recycled and a 1p charge on each garment to raise £35m a year for better clothing collection and sorting, a move supported by many in the industry.Theresa May said in parliament the government already had measures in place, including a multimillion-pound grant scheme to help boost the recycling of textiles and plastic packaging.But the response of the government was met with anger by many within the industry, where ethical fashion firms come up against others who produce at lower costs on the back of exploitative wage structures and environmentally damaging production models.Phoebe English, the English fashion designer, said: “It is extremely alarming to see that our government has failed to grasp the true extent of the consequences of the fashion industry carrying on the way it is.“It is a vastly damaging industry that has been spiralling unchecked for far too long. The Earth and the people on it are exploited and damaged at every single step of the chain, and this culminates with unimaginable mountains of unused excess stock or badly made broken waste clothing with nowhere to go other than landfill or incineration.”English said it was up to the industry to pull together to regulate itself and urgently put an end to bad practice.But others are less sure that voluntary measures will tackle what they say is a systemic power imbalance between brands and manufacturers, which leads to worker exploitation, or address the enormous environmental footprint of their trade.“The knowledge is out there. We know the scale of those impacts and we know what some of the solutions are,” said Dr Mark Sumner, a lecturer in retail and fashion at the University of Leeds. “What we need is the government to come up with some clear policy, whether it’s around legislation, or voluntary initiatives to incentivise a change of behaviour by brands.”With growing scrutiny of their business model, brands are beginning to promote an ethical face. This week Boohoo promoted its recycled brand For the Future, using fabrics made from synthetic waste saved from landfill.“They are moving in the right direction, but this is a micro-percentage of their output,” said Brown. While Boohoo is promoting its “green” credentials, repeated attempts by the trade union Usdaw to talk to workers at its delivery centre in the UK about union rights are being rebuffed by the company. Mary Creagh, the chair of the EAC, said: “If brands want to be ethical, they should start by allowing a trade union into their premises rather than barring the door.”Prof Nikolaus Hammer, associate professor in work and employment at Leicester University, carried out research into the fashion industry in Leicester, where he found employees working in appalling conditions, with no employment contracts, earning on average £3 an hour. It was the brands, he said, who held all the power over manufacturers to keep cutting their prices. “They will go to the manufacturer and say that person down the road can do it for 1p less, and they get the job,” he said.He doubted that any greening measures by brands could make them ethical and sustainable while still fulfilling the model of fast fashion.“The fundamental problem with much of fast fashion is that its social and environmental costs are not taken into account. The environmental costs of materials and fabric are mostly offshored. The production that takes place in the UK often only pays half the legal minimum wage.“So who is accountable for water and chemical pollution abroad, precarious work and employment, the undercutting of compliant manufacturers, the pollution from delivery and lack of recycling at home? Brands might find it difficult to make £5 fast fashion dresses and be socially and environmentally sustainable.”Carol Kane, the co-founder of Boohoo, told MPs the £5 dress was a “loss leader” drawing people to the website. She said the company employed three people in Manchester, three in Leicester, and 10 in China to carry out audits at their producer factories each month to ensure proper working practices.

Last week it was reported that the infant mortality rate (IMR) in England and Wales had worsened, for the third year in a row.The report from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), covering 2017, said that “the infant mortality rate increased to 3.9 deaths per 1,000 live births compared with 3.8 in 2016”. In 2014, it was 3.6 deaths per 1,000. The situation had been improving steadily until 2014, when it went into reverse. This should not be happening, especially in one of the largest economies in the world. Alarmingly, when declines such as this have occurred elsewhere, for example in the Soviet Union in the 1980s, it has been an early marker of severe problems in society. But while these figures are sufficiently concerning in their own right, they are national averages and the situation is even worse in some places. In the most deprived areas of England, babies were more than twice as likely to die within the first year of life (5.2 deaths per 1,000 live births) than those in the least deprived areas (2.7 deaths per 1,000 live births). Equally concerning, the UK now lags well behind many other European countries, with 24 nations achieving better rates out of the 42 with available data for 2017.Prof Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said: “To address the UK’s dismal infant mortality rates, it is paramount that the government take immediate steps to tackle social inequality and improve maternal and early years care.” This is not the first time urgent action has been called for.While the latest report focuses on the deaths of babies, there are signs that not all is well at older ages. As with infant mortality, improvements in life expectancy have stalled, peaking in 2014 and so far failing to return to that level. What is especially worrying is that life expectancy at older ages has actually been worsening, again an extremely unusual situation. Meanwhile, a recent report from the Nuffield Trust showed that death rates in those aged 20 to 24 increased between 2013 and 2016. More young people are dying, more babies are dying, and we can expect to live shorter lives.Life expectancy, mortality rates and infant mortality are the most important statistics a nation can produce about its health – and the UK’s are not only stalling, but worsening, falling behind international trends.These developments must surely be a concern for an incoming prime minister, but what can be done? The first priority must be to determine why they are happening. We can exclude some obvious explanations. While flu may explain some of the increasing deaths at older ages, it cannot explain them all, and it certainly cannot play a major role in the increasing deaths at younger ages. Nor have any data errors or mass population changes been reported. Global heating is undoubtedly of concern, but this did not suddenly occur in 2011. We are left with the inescapable conclusion that what has happened since 2010 is most likely to reflect the deliberate and sustained diminution of public services. Rising homelessness, food bank use, and deaths from those wrongly denied welfare support are just a few of the signs.In a few weeks Jeremy Hunt or Boris Johnson will be declared leader of the Conservative party. And unless a significant change of course using substantial public service investment is implemented by whichever one of them becomes the next prime minister, he, too, will add his name to the list of leaders who have overseen the worsening health of the people they represent, obliterating the key part of the social contract a government holds with its electorate: to protect the health of the nation.• Lucinda Hiam is a GP and honorary research fellow at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.

But it has the potential to change everything in the long run.The impressive margin is first due to people’s sense of injustice, triggered by the decision to repeat the elections. A share of the vote even shifted directly from the AKP candidate to the opposition Republican People’s party (CHP) candidate. Polling by Istanbul Economics Research suggests that the motivation for this shift was the perception that İmamoğlu’s win had been unfairly challenged.But he was also able to develop a conciliatory narrative that appealed to these voters. He provided a fresh alternative to inhabitants of Istanbul fatigued from years of acrimonious and exclusionary political rhetoric. (As a result, İmamoğlu’s campaign should be examined closely for its global implications in the fight against populism.) Last, he was particularly effective in coalescing Turkey’s fragmented opposition, which included this time the CHP, but also the secular nationalist İyi party, as well as the pro-Kurdish Peoples’ Democratic party (HDP).The wide margin of the opposition’s win precludes a new challenge scenario. İmamoğlu will become, once more, the new mayor of Istanbul. And his victory constitutes a clear longer-term threat to Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s hegemony.New contenders are also likely to interpret this outcome as a window of opportunity. In particular, the political movement rumoured to have been set up by the former AKP minister Ali Babacan will be encouraged by this clear sign of growing grassroots disenchantment with the ruling party.More importantly, Sunday’s result is likely to lead to a rethink by the AKP leadership. The shock must be momentous. It is surely the most severe interruption in Erdoğan’s electoral winning electoral streak. The future of Turkish politics will depend on how this result will be interpreted by Erdoğan himself and the lessons that this experienced and able politician will draw from this reversal of his political fortunes.At stake may be the future of the AKP’s alliance with the Nationalist Movement party (MHP). One conclusion could be that this coalition has become too constraining for Erdoğan. For instance, the overhyped nationalism influencing the conduct of Turkish foreign policy is a byproduct of this political arrangement and so is the hardline approach to the Kurdish question both domestically and in Syria. Even more importantly, the political leadership may be compelled to question the benefit of the extreme centralisation of power ushered in by the transition to a presidential system a year ago. For a majority of the Turkish population, the presidential system does not seem to be functioning as advertised.These are admittedly difficult questions for any political leader. And so shall they be for Erdoğan. But his answers will define the longevity of his political movement at a time when İmamoğlu has emerged, with his remarkable win in Istanbul, as a credible contender for Turkey’s leadership.• Sinan Ülgen is the executive chairman of the Istanbul-based Edam thinktank and a visiting scholar at Carnegie Europe"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7697c04cc323f1c0cd8b09133a713f53e32eff95/1_0_4030_2419/master/4030.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3e8ed35b66e3e8d48ad049ae146d08d4","title":"the guardian view on female voice assistants not ok google","story":"Within two years there will be more voice assistants on the internet than there are people on the planet. Another, possibly more helpful, way of looking at these statistics is to say that there will still be only half a dozen assistants that matter: Apple’s Siri, Google’s Assistant, and Amazon’s Alexa in the west, along with their Chinese equivalents, but these will have billions of microphones at their disposal, listening patiently for sounds they can use. Voice is going to become the chief way that we make our wants known to computers – and when they respond, they will do so with female voices.This detail may seem trivial, but it goes to the heart of the way in which the spread of digital technologies can amplify and extend social prejudice. The companies that program these assistants want them to be used, of course, and this requires making them appear helpful. That’s especially necessary when their helpfulness is limited in the real world: although they are getting better at answering queries outside narrow and canned parameters, they could not easily ever be mistaken for a human being on the basis of their words alone.There is solid psychological research to show that voices of lower pitch are perceived as more authoritative by both men and women. Higher-pitched voices are associated with submissive, helpful and caring characters. These are all impressions that make the voice assistants more often used and ultimately more profitable. In the late 1990s, BMW had to withdraw and reprogram the satnav system in one of its models because German drivers complained that they did not want to take instructions from a female voice. The automated call centres for brokerage firms in Japan give stock quotes in a female voice, but confirm transactions in a male one.In these instances, the technology adapts to pre-existing stereotypes, and so helps to perpetuate them. This will become increasingly important as children learn from their own interactions with a voice assistant. But this gendering is not inevitable.In some markets, Britain among them, Google offers a male voice for its assistant, though Alexa and Siri are always female.Male voices are also used by assistants in Arab countries, in many of which gender equality is not a mainstream ideal. A recent Unesco report also draws attention to the counterintuitive gendering of the field of computer technology. In Arab countries, and indeed in India, there is a far higher proportion of women studying computer science than in the west. It is those countries where gender equality is most advanced that have the greatest imbalance of male over female students of computer science and, consequently, of software developers.This was not always the case. Software was once a field in which women worked on equal terms with men. A woman, Grace Hopper, gave the world the term “bug” – as necessary to computer science as zero is to mathematics. But within a generation, from about 1980, the profession became overwhelmingly male. These were also the years in which programming became associated with the acquisition of huge fortunes. Bill Gates may not have been a better programmer than Admiral Hopper, but he certainly ended up a whole lot richer. This imbalance is wrong, and it matters. As voice assistants move into bedrooms and kitchens and follow us around on our phones, conscious effort will be needed to eliminate prejudice that harms both men and women whether they’re building the software or using it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e869ced2f9404773d28e2a00e432535d0c9e855/0_70_3559_2135/master/3559.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f03ea2b29a61d2483616826ce592b4a5","title":"the guardian view on tory leadership politics may not survive brexit","story":"The threat by a Conservative minister to bring down the government of the next party leader if he attempts to leave the European Union without a deal shows how the Brexit virus, having hijacked the Tory machine, could end up shutting it down. It would be wrong to regard such warnings as a bluff. When push comes to shove, such MPs are likely to be in no mood for compromise. This attitude will have been hardened if Boris Johnson becomes party leader despite his obvious flaws – especially since Brexit has radicalised Conservative members so much that they would rather break up the United Kingdom than not leave the EU. Depressingly the no-deal option is openly flirted with by both leadership candidates, shamelessly proffered to Tory members in exchange for their votes.It is important to remember that even with the DUP’s support, a few Tory rebels can bring down a wayward government by leaving it. What also seems clear is that the new Conservative leader will not have a majority for either his central policy or for his government. That means Theresa May will in all probability have to assess which party leader will command a majority in the Commons. If it is not the Tory leader then it will be Jeremy Corbyn. If neither can put together the votes then Britain will be heading for a general election. Where Tory rebels would go from there is a tantalising question. Some have argued that the shape of the civil war in the party resembles the infighting that was a prelude to Robert Peel’s 1846 repeal of the Corn Laws, which protected British grain against cheaper imports. Peelites such as William Gladstone, who split the Tories by defecting to what ended up as the Liberal party, could justifiably claim to be on the side of the future rather than the past. That is still a seductive argument that could be used by their would-be heirs today.However, the recent experience of Change UK has shown that while there are many contenders for the inheritor of Gladstone’s mantle, their claims have yet to be realised in substance. Well-established mainstream parties are not given to significant splits in the modern era – not least because no substantial breakaway has given rise to a significant new competitor or one that could ally with an existing rival. Both Labour, which endured a traumatic schism in the 1980s, and the Tories are being stretched by Brexit. For the Conservatives there is a more existential threat because it faces a surgent rightwing nationalist Brexit party of Nigel Farage."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f857caab081a06e58ebf6bb3cf8028626b4d0934/0_36_2150_1291/master/2150.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c259d76acbdcd679aba87e5e82252a29","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of needle","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘needle’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘needle’.Share your photos of what needle means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 26 June at 10am.

But, 15 years later, he’s part of a movement intent on taking it to EuropePlaying tape-ball in Lahore, joining a game in a Leyton car park, coaching at Lord’s – it’s not a bad trajectory.Adnan Choudhry, one of the UK’s strongest proponents of a relatively unknown version of cricket called tape-ball, refers to his sporting journey as a “remarkable thing”.Although relatively few fans in England are aware of tape-ball, the sport – a version of street cricket developed in Pakistan – is growing considerably, both in its country of origin and farther afield.The name comes from the use of electrical tape to cover a tennis ball this ensures players have the opportunity to experience all aspects of hard-ball cricket – just with less outlay and less risk.Costly pads, helmets and gloves are not required, as the ball poses less of a threat than the traditional, leather-bound wooden ball. “Cricket is an expensive sport to play, but tape-ball makes it much easier,” says Choudhry. “You just need a bat, ball and tape.“You can play in a car park, a normal park, any place where you can run around a little. You don’t need gear or even 11 players – just a few friends. But you use the same type of skills that are used in hard ball cricket.”As a young child growing up in Pakistan, Choudhry was first introduced to tape-ball by his uncle, who played for his work team. Fascinated by what he was watching, the 10-year-old began playing with his uncle on the dusty neighbourhood streets.At the time, it was a sport played mainly for fun, but over the past decade it has grown in popularity, and sponsorship has made tape-ball cricket a fully professional sport in Pakistan.“I played mostly with my friends when I was younger,” Choudhry says. “It was popular then, but now it’s grown all over south Asia and is expanding beyond the continent.“Players who are good enough are now able to play it professionally and choose it as a career. There are lots of tournaments and events, the players get paid, and there are coaches specifically for tape-ball.”When Choudhry arrived in England in 2004, at the age of 19, to study business at college, it was the first time he had ventured away from his family and his country.He knew there would be plenty of competitive hard-ball cricket played in his adopted home, but imagined tape-ball hadn’t been exported to the UK.But a friend from Lahore knew where there was a tape-ball game being played in a car park in Leyton, London – and it was this that helped Choudhry find his feet. “Playing cricket – tape-ball in particular – is how I made friends and connections. It opened up new doors for me,” he says.That first game in the car park quickly became a regular event, with spectators becoming players. “We created a team, and through tape-ball we were able to connect with some local clubs,” he says.Ace Avengers Lions – the club Choudhry helped form in 2016 that also plays T20 and T10 cricket – has grown in the past four years from just two friends to more than 100 members.Its creation was partly driven by the knowledge that children in his local Walthamstow area were unaware of pathways to playing cricket, or being able to easily find a club to join.Choudhry also works as a cricket coach and engagement officer for Capital Kids Cricket, an organisation that delivers cricket-related projects in London, as well as coaching on the Chance to Shine Street programme. Both organisations focus on providing disadvantaged people with the opportunity to participate in healthy, physical, activity.Once Waltham Forest council became aware of the work Choudhry was doing, it was keen to get behind the initiative and provide added resources and support.“This area is quite deprived, and a few years ago the kids here did not have easy access to sports. We are trying to bring tape-ball to a school level and introduce it to kids at a young age,” says Choudhry.It’s an aim shared by NatWest, who have spent almost 40 years championing cricket as a sport for all by partnering with organisations such as Chance to Shine. The national children’s charity engages young people in communities across the country, and uses cricket to create positive opportunities and show the sport is available to everyone.This year, Choudhry helped host a tape-ball event for the local community that was sponsored by Essex Cricket and Leyton Orient FC – with the football club hosting at their ground.Local primary and secondary school pupils participated, and 50 visually impaired students from nearby Joseph Clarke school also played an adapted version of the game.Later in the day came the main event, The Tornado Tape Ball World Cup – an eight-team tournament in which Choudhry’s Ace Avengers were victorious.It was a day filled with pride for Choudhry, who now has ambitions beyond the UK for tape-ball. “In the future, there are tape-ball teams from Germany, France and Belgium that we are hoping to bring over here to play, or we can travel to play them.”Playing and coaching cricket has enabled Choudhry to play at some of the sport’s most iconic grounds – the sort of thing most lovers of the game dream of – and he understands how fortunate he has been.“Now I do coaching sessions at Lord’s, and I’ve played at the Oval too. It’s a big leap from that car park. I can’t quite put it into words how amazing that journey has been.”For almost four decades, NatWest has supported cricket, with a mission to make the game easier for everyone to play and enjoy. A proud partner of the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) and the charity Chance to Shine, NatWest champions cricket at all levels – from grassroots support for local clubs and getting more people involved in the game to supporting current and future England stars and helping fans cheer on their teams, however and wherever they choose.With NatWest, cricket is a game that has #NoBoundaries.

The former House of Cards actor Kevin Spacey supported her following the death of her husband, Michael Williams, in 2001.In 2018, it was alleged that Spacey invited the actor Anthony Rapp to a party at his home in 1986, when Spacey was 26 and Rapp was 14. Rapp alleged that Spacey lifted him on to his bed and tried to climb on top of him.Spacey responded to the allegations at the time saying he did not remember the incident, but apologising for it nonetheless.In an online statement, he said: “I honestly do not remember the encounter, it would have been over 30 years ago. But if I did behave then as he describes, I owe him the sincerest apology for what would have been deeply inappropriate drunken behaviour, and I am sorry for the feelings he describes having carried with him all these years.”Spacey has since faced other allegations about sexual misconduct. Following the claims, a special Emmy award that was due to be given to Spacey was revoked. The Old Vic, where Spacey was artistic director between 2004 and 2015, expressed its dismay at the allegations against him.Dench was one of the first celebrities to publicly denounce Weinstein after claims against him, saying she was “horrified” by his alleged behaviour.Weinstein was removed from the board of his company and stripped of many accolades after dozens of women came forward to allege that they were sexually assaulted or raped by him.He was indicted on charges of rape and a criminal sexual act in 2018 but pleads not guilty to the claims against him, and has denied any non-consensual sex.In a wide-ranging interview, Dench also spoke to the Radio Times about losing her eyesight and having to stop driving.“I can’t read the paper now, I can’t do the crossword, I can’t read a book,” she says, “but, you know, you cope. I’ve got people who read to me and coach me with my lines,” she said.She dismissed the discomfort, putting it down to being part of her job: “On a film set you learn where everything is. It’s OK if you can get away with it. It’s all acting, after all. Fooling people. It’s what I do.”But she described the realisation that she would have to stop driving as traumatising.“It was absolutely appalling,” she said. “But I just know I’ll kill somebody if I get behind the wheel of a car now.”Dench does not know what will happen to her eyesight but said she feels more comfortable not knowing the prognosis.“I don’t want to know,” she said. “There’s nothing you can do. You adapt to it. So I ignore it altogether.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1f1a0139c4acae8fbaa0c00279c1ce7b370a727/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4cebc09472be637110780c868e925a52","title":"kx marks the spot how kings cross became londons newest creative neighbourhood","story":"With the arrival of shopping and dining district Coal Drops Yard, King’s Cross has cemented its place as one of London’s most exciting destinations – for work and playMove over Shoreditch, make way Marylebone high street, fashion and design has found a new home in the capital: King’s Cross. Formerly known as the badlands of the city, the area has now transformed into a lively neighbourhood.Following the , who moved into the music and art hub Kings Place in 2008, the legendary fashion and design school Central Saint Martins, which counts Alexander McQueen and Stella McCartney among its alumni, took up residence in neighbouring Granary Square in 2011. More recently, big cultural players including Google, the House of Illustration, Universal Music, the Knowledge Quarter and Time Out have also arrived – bringing with them more people, ideas and creativity.But King’s Cross is far from “all work”. Making use of the Victorian brick viaducts that once held London’s coal store, the bright and airy 20,000 sq ft Coal Drops Yard has taken on a new life as a shopping and dining nirvana. The impossibly stylish redesign – undertaken by the award-winning King’s Cross-based architect, Thomas Heatherwick – is topped off with an already iconic “kissing roof”, which will soon be home to Samsung’s new flagship store.And hang out they do. King’s Cross, which is home to one of the capital’s main railway arteries and the Eurostar terminal at St Pancras, has always been busy with people passing through but, now, it’s a destination in its own right.Already home to an enviable collection of foodie hotspots and cultural highlights – from the KERB food market that sets up for lunch service in Granary Square three days a week, to the nearby British Library and Wellcome Collection, both just a short walk away – when Coal Drops Yard arrived in October 2018, it was seen by many as the icing on the cake. Home to more than 50 stores and restaurants, many of which are young, independent businesses, every archway is filled with thought-provoking products and tantalising flavours.When it comes to fashion, Coal Drops Yard is definitely adding to the conversation, with a unique and eclectic range of brands and boutiques from a three-storey Cos store (which doubles a space to celebrate the art and design that inspires their clothes) and stylish Fred Perry outlet, to independent boutiques such as S120 and Form\u0026ampThread, and menswear heavy-hitters, Universal Works, to name but a few.“We’ve always envisioned King’s Cross as a microcosm of the city – it’s a erse community where people live, work, study and socialise,” explains Anna Strongman, partner at Argent. “In Coal Drops Yard, we’ve aimed to create a unique destination that connects all types of visitors through our combination of shops, restaurants and a vibrant year-round cultural events programme.”With so much change taking place in such a short space of time, it’s fair to say the area’s blossoming into a creative neighbourhood has taken some people by surprise. “When I first moved to London almost seven years ago, I wouldn’t have imagined King’s Cross would be considered a ‘fashion hub,’” says Central Saint Martins alumni and 10 Magazine’s fashion and features assistant, Helena Fletcher.Not everyone is as shocked by the area’s metamorphosis, though. “Generally, when creative industries move into a space in any city, that space then becomes desirable over time,” explains Adam Murray, fashion lecturer at Central Saint Martins.For Henry Graham, creative director and co-founder of Wolf \u0026amp Badger, which has a three-storey concept store in the main yard, Coal Drops Yard is a destination that really stands out from the competition. “In what is an increasingly homogeneous retail landscape, the King’s Cross Central Limited Partnership should be applauded for their courage in proactively seeking out innovative and unique fashion and lifestyle retailers, all of whom, through their stores in Coal Drops Yard, bring a new experience not only to the immediate area but London as a whole,” he says.To discover more about Coal Drop Yard’s unique stores, restaurants and packed diary of cultural events, head to coaldropsyard"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f3d097778ab111c26c86e3b8fe5fea864eccf22/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c1e58e11bb84077052d628a1977cda3b","title":"what 14bn buys 1800 miles of cycle lanes or one big roundabout","story":"Greater Manchester’s Bee Network has just £160m of the cash it needs, unlike a junction near BedfordAlmost exactly a year ago, Chris Boardman – the Olympic champion turned walking and cycling commissioner – unveiled a bold vision: Greater Manchester was to turn itself into a Dutch-style cycling paradise by building a 1,000-mile network of walking and biking routes called Beelines, after Manchester’s civic symbol, the worker bee.A year on, the scheme has changed its name to the Bee Network after a rather embarrassing copyright infringement, and has expanded to cover 1,800 miles. Yet so far, work has only begun on one tiny section – a bit of towpath in Wigan known as the “muddy mile” – and the first wodge of money has already gone.Boardman said from the start that it would cost £1.5bn to build the network. This is not much, he will tell you, pointing out the government has agreed to spend £1.4bn upgrading a roundabout near Bedford and building a new 10-mile dual carriageway. That is £1.4bn on a project engineers boast could save drivers a whole 10 minutes.So far, Boardman has been given £160m – a brave move by Greater Manchester’s mayor, Andy Burnham, who was under pressure to spend it on roads instead, but far short of the full amount.That sum is now allocated, according to a report to be discussed by Greater Manchester combined authority on Friday. Over the past year, the 10 constituent councils have been submitting bids for the cash to pay for their parts of the Bee Network. More than 50 schemes have been granted “programme entry” so far, including a jazzy cycle bridge from Stockport railway station to the town centre and the creation of a “mini Holland” in a residential neighbourhood in Levenshulme.Assuming the GMCA approves the latest tranche of Bee Network schemes – which includes an “active neighbourhood” in Urmston, Trafford, a revamp of Ashton-under-Lyne town centre in Tameside and links to the new RHS garden in Salford – the £160m pot will already have been overspent by £74m.So where is the money going to come from? No one seems sure. Speaking on Monday at the launch of Our Network, Burnham’s vision for an integrated transport system, Boardman reiterated the full £1.5bn cost.He hopes the government will listen to a plea he made last week to consider the negative effect car-centric planning has on the environment and people’s health. In a letter to the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, he argued current economic appraisal models used by the Treasury to decide whether to fund a new motorway or a segregated cycle lane “do not take full account of the negative consequences of making private car use easier, nor do they take full account of the benefits of walking and cycling on our health, wellbeing and environment”.Burnham seemed to agree, saying on Monday: “Ask yourself this: which form of transport investment delivers the most benefit? Build roads and you may get an economic benefit but not an environmental benefit. If you invest in link, you deliver economic and environmental benefits. But if you invest in a walking and cycling network, you get economic and environmental but also health benefits.”Why then, you might ask, is Burnham exempting private cars from his forthcoming clean-air charges? He says it is because the levies would punish the least wealthy drivers in society, who cannot afford to upgrade to cleaner vehicles.But driving is already the preserve of the rich, with the most disadvantaged people disproportionately likely to live near the busiest roads with the dirtiest air. In south Manchester, one primary school cannot open its windows because the air is so polluted from the neighbouring Princess Road.In 2016, the Royal College of Physicians estimated ambient air pollution causes 40,000 premature deaths a year in the UK, at an estimated social cost of £22bn per year. Adjusting these figures proportionally to account for population, this means there are 2,000 premature deaths in Greater Manchester per year, where child asthma rates are already twice the national average. Then there is the cost to businesses of congestion, estimated at £1.3bn a year.“We have to stop building for cars,” said Burnham, as he plugged an as-yet-unfunded plan to bring the UK’s largest public bike-hire scheme to Greater Manchester next year.It is all fine talk. But until the government starts to see investments in cycling and walking as more important than making car journeys 10 minutes quicker, we will continue to risk life and limb on unsafe roads, breathing filthy air."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb801e3b2837b7c2ad5ce642a796b3c99d7ed555/0_186_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d64c9da2b7f88c543376346112f67d5c","title":"annabelle comes home review creaky funhouse horror threequel","story":"The Conjuring universe offers up another handsomely made yet astonishingly empty chapter about the havoc-wreaking demonic dollThere’s an extraordinary amount of creaking in demonic doll threequel Annabelle Comes Home, a schlocky horror set in a world where every door and cupboard hinge could do with a healthy smattering of oil. But perhaps the loudest creaking comes from the film’s overarching Conjuring universe, a loosely fact-based $1.5bn franchise that’s finding it harder to justify each expanding new chapter.This is the sixth instalment in said universe (seven if we’re counting this spring’s The Curse of La Llorona which boasts a cameo from an Annabelle character) and while the original Conjuring might still possess an undeniable air of menace, as well as a relatively substantial true story at its core, everything since has felt comparatively superfluous. The original Annabelle, based on a character who initially cropped up in the first Conjuring movie, was a critically loathed spin-off but one that proved to be hugely lucrative nonetheless, leading to the slightly more enjoyable, yet still to my mind incredibly hollow, prequel Annabelle: Creation. Audiences swarmed yet again and now in Annabelle Comes Home, we’re returning to the house of the Warrens, the real-life paranormal investigators who inspired the entire universe of interconnected movies.But while Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson, as Lorraine and Ed Warren, do make an appearance, it’s only in brief bookended cameos and instead the plot focuses on their daughter Judy (child star Mckenna Grace, impressive, recently seen as a young Captain Marvel). Bullied at school because of her parents’ affinity for the supernatural, she’s also struggling with her growing awareness of a similar ability to see into another world. While her parents are away for the night, she’s left with babysitter Mary Ellen (Madison Iseman) and her friend Daniela (Katie Sarife), who find themselves curious to know more about the nature of the Warrens’ investigations. Through a rather convoluted, and audible audience reaction-inspiring, set of circumstances this results in Annabelle being unleashed yet again.What I often find frustrating about films in the Conjuring universe is the disparity between what’s initially promised and then what’s ultimately delivered. As well-budgeted and slickly directed studio horror pics, they’re a striking rarity and I admire how they lean into the style of the era they’re set in. Annabelle Comes Home is no different, with care employed in its period recreation, as firmly rooted in the specificities of the 60s as something carrying far more prestige. But once the initial foreplay is over, teasing a stylish and substantive alternative to its more simple-minded genre peers, it falls into the same old routine. There’s a handsome framework but nothing at its centre, a script that quickly eschews anything resembling a plot, choosing to bombard us with cheap funhouse trickery instead.While the decision to return events to the house of the Warrens allows Warners the chance to provide another bridge back to the original franchise, it also allows them to do something far more devious. Annabelle and last year’s smash hit The Nun were based on characters originally introduced in the first two Conjuring films (a third, The Crooked Man, based on a Conjuring 2 villain is on the way) and by locating the new Annabelle sequel back with the Warrens, it allows the writers and universe-constructors to toy with the idea of even more spin-offs. While admittedly, now that we’re familiar with their game, there might be no deft way of doing this, writer-director Gary Dauberman throws in so many clumsy introductions that I half-expected release dates to pop up in the corner alongside. I would bet money on either The Ferryman, The Wedding Dress or The Black Shuck getting a green light in coming weeks and while I almost admire the business behind it, it just takes me away from the story as a viewer.Dauberman, who also co-wrote the recent iteration of It, uses a similar strategy here in how he exploits scare tactics: throwing everything at the wall in the hope that some of it will stick. While that worked to some extent in It, even if the script still felt like a collection of scenes rather than an actual plot, Annabelle Comes Home is hopelessly light on scares. Like other Conjuring entries, there’s some nifty camerawork at play during some of the suspense sequences but nothing comes close to evoking genuine fear and the audience I saw it with reacted with more annoyance at the dim-witted behaviour of the leads over any actual shock.The astounding box office success of the Conjuring universe can also, in my mind, be attributed to its deep-rooted belief in the power of God. In this chapter in particular, faith is the most important weapon against evil and it’s easy to see how well these films would play to Christian audiences who might otherwise reject the idea of an R-rated horror film. But for non-believers, it can often border on propaganda, especially when trying to use fear as a way to make us believe. There’s not even anything here that will convert a Conjuring universe non-believer let alone an atheist. Ultimately, the scariest thing about Annabelle Comes Home is that despite its utter emptiness, more sequels, prequels and spin-offs will follow regardless."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2aaec8d749e846e8f141924ce71068024d41f187/0_18_2364_1418/master/2364.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=249a86c8a06ad189c24fe5ce35ca67a2","title":"teenagers in films coming of age good boys stand by me boyhood","story":"Like Eighth Grade, Boyhood and the new comedy Good Boys, the most authentic coming-of-age movies feature casts still in the throes of adolescence Film has a sometimes troubling relationship with authenticity. However, in coming-of-age films, the authenticity of having child actors in the roles gives the films a certain flair that makes them shine. One notable example is the forthcoming Good Boys, a raucous coming-of-age film for tweenage boys. It features three lead actors who are only a few years older than the 12-year-olds they are playing. There is a touching innocence that marks their performance and produces memorable scenes, such as mistaking their parents’ sex toys for nunchucks and indoor swings. In films about the experience of growing up, there is a certain flavour that can be mimicked but not recreated by older actors.Eighth Grade is another film to be applauded for its awkwardly sweet look at what it means to be a schoolkid in the digital age. Elsie Fisher slots naturally into protagonist Kayla’s hunched posture and curtain of hair that protects her from the outside world. Having started filming almost immediately after finishing eighth grade herself, her performance as Kayla is all the more riveting for the way she taps into her own recent experience. This is what creates the film’s cringey charm.This is hardly a recent phenomenon. Garance Marillier was only 18 when she played Justine in Raw, the French feminist cannibal phenomenon that shocked Cannes with a ferocious portrayal of burgeoning teenage sexuality. Stand By Me has stood the test of time because of the boyhoods of River Phoenix and co, endearing them to new generations of audiences. Richard Linklater’s Boyhood went a step further, taking 12 years to film, while boy actor Ellar Coltrane grew into a young man. Comparing these films to Good Boys and Eighth Grade, it is encouraging to see that the essence of growing up hasn’t changed, even if most of it is now done online.This isn’t always the case. There are a slew of coming-of-age films that feature young adults playing teenage characters – Beanie Feldstein and Kaitlyn Dever in Booksmart, Saoirse Ronan in Lady Bird, even Rachel McAdams in Mean Girls. They give no less convincing performances because of their age, but there is a subtle difference: because they are recalled rather than recent, their performances are overly enhanced versions of how an adolescent might act. Stockard Channing was 33 when Grease was filmed this reveals itself in Rizzo’s knowing attitude to sex, which stems from Channing’s age and experience. While this makes Rizzo a fan favourite as someone to aspire to, it creates a fiction of adolescence that isn’t realistic for any teenagers watching the film.It doesn’t always work flawlessly. Early Harry Potter films are more vital for their nostalgic value rather than the young trio’s acting chops – but a film series about a young boy navigating his way through wizarding school would have felt false with an adult actor in the main role. We were all teenagers once and have our own experiences of what that was like there is something special that can be learnt from allowing the young to take centre stage."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/816aafe8b4009e762fe8267bd04d55ac75f67be8/0_129_2970_1782/master/2970.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f77464666591446e89054d178dd9a45c","title":"england croatia european under 21s championship group c match report","story":"England Under-21s signed off the European Championships just as they started with careless mistakes and a chaotic finale allowing victory to fall from their grasp. Three times Aidy Boothroyd’s side led Croatia. Three times they squandered the initiative. They have been consistent in Italy and San Marino but being winless and error-ridden was not what England set out to achieve.Inexplicable lapses in concentration were features of defeats to both France and Romania. They resurfaced here as defending that left the head coach struggling for answers enabled Croatia to cancel out goals from Reiss Nelson, James Maddison and Jonjoe Kenny. This has been a steep learning curve for players with designs on full England honours in the near future. In 10 unbeaten qualifiers England conceded four goals. In the heat of three tournament group games they have conceded nine. Switching off has been a pattern of their play throughout.“It’s the story of the tournament for us really – wonderful attacking play but basic, fundamental defensive errors with poor passes and decisions,” said Boothroyd. “At least we are getting one part of the game right but, with this team, conceding goals has undone us.“There is obviously a concentration issue but it’s been different players who have been doing it, not just one guy over and over again. When we go through it all there will be plenty to learn. The main thing is that you stay in the game mentally, you score a goal and instead of relaxing you need to treble your efforts. That is all over the pitch. When you look at the calibre of players who are making the mistakes it doesn’t make sense. There will be reasons and we will get to the bottom of them with a new team next time around.”Nelson, Tammy Abraham and Lloyd Kelly were handed first starts and each impressed initially. The Arsenal forward Nelson posed a constant threat from the right and his quick feet won an early penalty when he was clipped inside the area by Branimir Kalaica following a slick passing move involving Kieran Dowell and the recalled Phil Foden. Abraham was England’s designated penalty taker but Nelson took it, and scored confidently, without consulting Boothroyd. “They’d not told me,” he said. “I haven’t got to the bottom of it yet.”Abraham struck a post with an impudent flick from Maddison’s pass but, just as England were in control, their defensive problems appeared. Josip Brekalo was afforded far too much space on the left and accepted the invitation to attack Kenny. The Wolfsburg midfielder feigned to go outside the new Schalke loan signing only to cut inside and drive a fine finish into the far, top corner of Dean Henderson’s goal.Nelson was heavily involved again when England retook the lead. The 19-year-old breezed beyond Marijan Cabraja on the right before floating an inviting cross to the back post. Filip Uremovic should have cleared but, under no pressure, directed a tame header straight at Maddison’s feet. He had time to pick his spot and found the roof of the net from 12 yards out.Once again, however, England gifted their opponents a way back. Kelly seemed to have cleared the danger after Foden had been dispossessed in central midfield, showing good pace to beat Lovro Majer to the through ball that followed. But Bournemouth’s recent recruit undid his good work with a careless pass back to Majer. He found Sandro Kulenovic, the powerful striker laid the ball off to Nikola Vlasic and the former Everton midfielder curled a delightful finish into the bottom corner. Cska Moscow’s new £14m signing was caught by Ezri Konsa and had to be carried off on a stretcher.Kenny thought he had given England victory with a thunderous 25-yard drive when Maddison’s corner was headed into his path. But they blew it a third time when Henderson’s clearance was returned with interest by Croatia and, with the right-back caught upfield and Fikayo Tomori too deep, Luka Ivanusec released Brekalo to score his second of the game. A deflating end to a tournament to forget for England."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7fc5bb80c9d0d3d1ed734ac53bddbcbb1ec2d826/0_172_5470_3282/master/5470.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3abb5ec06bfaa797edb61a11100ab33b","title":"rafael benitez control freaks newcastle united mike ashley","story":"Last season was drawing to a close when Rafael Benítez stood in a quiet corridor at St James’ Park briefing a small group of newspaper journalists on his seemingly interminable negotiations over a new contract with Mike Ashley.Little of substance was said but, as the conversation drew to a close, something unusual happened. Instead of the customary thumbs up or little wave as Benítez turned on his heel and wandered off there were firm handshakes and, for this reporter, a kiss from Newcastle United’s manager.It could have been something or nothing but, at the time it rang slight alarm bells. Was Newcastle’s best manager since Sir Bobby Robson saying “goodbye?” Had the erosion of trust in his relationship with the club’s owner dictated that Benítez would not be returning to the city he had fallen at least half in love with and the club he once dreamed of leading back into Europe?Discussions with Ashley dragged on and talk – yet again – of a potential Emirati takeover promised, tantalisingly, to change the narrative but, on Monday the fears raised in that corridor were realised.Some of those who know the Spaniard well are convinced he has had at least one foot in the departure lounge for a good couple of months now and few could blame him. At 59, Benítez feels he has another decade left in management. As a serial winner of trophies who thrives on big European nights, part of him knew his talents were in serious danger of being wasted on Tyneside.The frustration is that so much was perfect the 52,000 full houses, the almost unconditional love from fans who repeatedly chanted “Rafa Benítez we want you to stay,” the citadel-like stadium situated right in the city centre.As a city Newcastle shares many similarities with Liverpool and it was no surprise it seemed like a natural habitat for a man who enjoyed one of the happiest, and most successful, periods of his career on Merseyside, where his family home remains.Indeed, Benítez had long had a soft spot for what would become his adopted home on Gallowgate. During an interlude as Chelsea manager, he stood in that aforementioned St James’ corridor following a defeat inflicted by Alan Pardew’s then side and, as he debriefed reporters, there was a definite sense that he rather envied Pardew’s job.So much so that when Ashley sacked Steve McClaren, Benítez swiftly made it clear he was available – it was not long after his departure from Real Madrid – and rather fancied stepping in. Initially he joined on a nine-game contract but when, through no fault of his own, Newcastle were relegated that season, he shocked a lot of people by agreeing to drop down into the Championship with them.Promotion swiftly followed – but the celebrations had barely subsided before things started to go wrong. Benítez and Ashley are both, to differing degrees and in contrasting ways, control freaks, both men are enigmatic and their partnership was never going to be straightforward.Twitter: follow us at @_sportFacebook: like our football and sport pagesInstagram: our favourite photos, films and storiesYouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channelsPerhaps fearing that Benítez’s political manoeuvres might push him into unwelcome corners, Ashley managed things by very rarely speaking to, and almost never meeting, his manager. This dysfunctional union was held together by Lee Charnley, the club’s managing director, who frequently struggled to satisfy two such invariably incompatible masters.Money is Ashley’s main motivator and possibly he struggled to understand why Benítez’s £6m-a-year contract was not enough. But the manager did not like the retail tycoon’s policy of signing players only aged 25 and under so that they possessed decent resale value. He wanted to leaven youth with experience, to revamp Newcastle’s academy and radically overhaul a training ground which, compared with those of some Premier League counterparts, was more functional-yet-tired mid-range hotel than modernist six-star spa resort.And then there was the budget: the owner envisaged spending around £50m on transfers this summer, his head coach would have preferred at least double that amount. But it was more than merely about pure figures Benítez became increasingly disturbed by how long it took Ashley to execute any potential deal, how everything had to go through not just Charnley but the owner’s fixer, the lawyer Justin Barnes.The striker Salomón Rondón became a bit of a cause célèbre for Benítez’s philosophy. The West Brom forward who joined on loan was much too close to 30 for Ashley’s liking but his goals and all-round excellence at centre-forward played a big part in preserving Newcastle’s Premier League status for a second season running and the manager believed it was imperative he should be signed on an expensive, permanent deal.Ashley, though, could not seem to understand why the former Champions League-winning coach was so hooked up on the player and his reluctance to spend the money on the Venezuelan quite possibly kiboshed any hopes of a contract extension.If part of Benítez always knew he was leaving this summer, maybe another part hoped Ashley would finally blink first. When, a couple of weeks ago, his camp started briefing that Chelsea might, slightly startlingly, want him back it appeared part of a classic game to push Ashley into accepting his demands.The news that he could command a £12m-a-year salary in China looked a similar ploy but the resultant headlines failed to produce the desired breakthrough and Newcastle are left seeking a new manager able to reprise Benítez’s feat in somehow avoiding relegation by coaxing one of the Premier League’s weakest squads into significant overachievement.That newcomer can expect to meet closed hearts and minds on Tyneside. The emotional barriers threaten to be formidable whoever they are and however good they may be, they will not be Rafa Benítez.Maybe one day Ashley will reflect on precisely how he let the best manager he ever had slip through his fingers. First, though, he will need to understand why Benítez spent more than three years trying, forlornly, to tell him that it really is pointless knowing the price of everything if you don’t appreciate the value of anything."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a6d963d97fd90d81cd275c48156dc483291a7a8/0_157_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=241a15cf38fbfc0a13d2d6e075839f82","title":"sweden canada womens world cup match report","story":"Stina Blackstenius fired Sweden into the quarter-finals of the Women’s World Cup but they needed a penalty save from Hedvig Lindahl to beat Canada 1-0 in Paris.A slow-burner finally came to life in the second half, with Kosovare Asllani at the heart of it. Asllani raced downfield and played an inch-perfect pass for Blackstenius to score – with the game’s first shot on target just shy of the hour mark.But it was also Asllani who was penalised for handball eight minutes later, before Lindahl denied Janine Beckie from the spot.The crowd had taken to Mexican waves to entertain themselves during a dismal opening half but there were plenty of talking points after the break.Canada were the first to finally have a shot, with Christine Sinclair bending a free-kick wide in the 53rd minute.But Sweden broke the deadlock just before the hour when Asllani charged down the left before sliding the ball across for the on-running Blackstenius to chip it over Stephanie Labbé.That brought Canada to life and they had their chance with a little over 20 minutes to go when Desiree Scott’s shot struck Asllani on the arm from point-blank range.Beckie stepped up and struck her penalty well but not well enough to beat the quick e of Lindahl, who was soon swamped by teammates.Sweden then thought they had a penalty of their own when Ashley Lawrence went through the back of Fridolina Rolfö but VAR determined there was an offside in the buildup.The decision offered Canada some hope, though they rarely looked likely to capitalise as Adriana Leon and Shelina Zadorsky squandered late chances."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/356b1c3afb7038d8364fb873457b9c77cc86de8c/0_41_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bbe0c9eda306093dbc3585de531ee129","title":"women world cup 2019 cameroon england judge game","story":"Some of the behaviour we saw from Cameroon’s players and their coach in their game against England was shocking, but it is important to make it clear that it was not an indictment of the women’s game. It is an indictment of Cameroon specifically, and it was a game I can only hope their players watch, cringe, are honest about and learn from in the future, to understand the weight of responsibility that comes from representing your nation with pride and professionalism.They had complained about the refereeing of their last game, against New Zealand, and I think they probably came into the England match with that perceived sense of injustice bubbling just below the surface. Their coach did not do a good job of controlling those emotions. The shame is that if they had focused on playing the game they would probably have scored a couple of goals, because England looked very open at the back.Before the game I was singing the praises of the Cameroonian team, ranked 46th in the world by Fifa, who arrived in the last 16 with strong performances in their group, having tested Canada (ranked fifth), scored against the Netherlands (eighth) and beaten New Zealand (19th), thanks to a late strike from Ajara Nchout that is a contender for goal of the tournament. Unfortunately the protests and petulance of the Cameroonian players will be the lasting impression of their nation’s time in France.Twitter: follow us at @_sportFacebook: like our football and sport pagesInstagram: our favourite photos, films and storiesYouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channelsWe see some despicable behaviour in men’s football – ing, horrible fouls, racist abuse, players arguing with opponents, with the referee and sometimes with their own manager – but somehow on those occasions we are able to restrict our judgment to the iniduals involved, rather than the entire sport.Yet some people who saw this game, one wild match in a tournament that has given us moments of greatness and also of disappointment, have announced that it proves women’s football cannot be taken seriously. I think they are watching it the wrong way. It is as if people are not just watching women’s football and enjoying it, they are sitting in judgment. If every time you turn on the TV you need to be persuaded that the women’s game is good enough, it’s probably not for you.Having come through this test, England are now preparing to play a Norway team that are proving themselves among the very best at the World Cup, with an in-form front line and intelligent defence. If England play against Norway as they did against Cameroon they will need a lot of luck to get to the semi-finals.On Sunday night Phil Neville was mostly asked about Cameroon, and he spoke honestly and truthfully. This has been one of his most impressive traits as England manager, and I think we can assume, based on everything we have seen from him so far, that he was as honest with his players when they got back to the team hotel. They need to examine every mistake they made against Cameroon, so they’re ready to show their best against a flourishing Norway team. If England allow Guro Reiten or Isabell Herlovsen on the left-hand side for Norway the kind of space they got against Australia, they will cause a lot of trouble. If they allow or Caroline Hansen the space on the counterattack to run at the back line, they will struggle.I have praised the midfielders Keira Walsh and Jill Scott previously in this tournament. Scott in particular has been in excellent form, and against Cameroon broke Peter Shilton’s record for the most appearances for England in World Cup finals. But in a 4-2-3-1 or 4-1-2-3 formation Walsh is meant to be a defensive midfielder, who sits in and protects the backline, while Scott is a box-to-box player, tucking in defensively and getting forward to break into the opposition penalty area.Against Cameroon both players were too high and left a lot of space in behind them in midfield. One pass and their line was beaten, and it happened a number of times. That is dangerous, because once you beat the midfield line the defence is completely exposed. Against pace, which Norway have got in abundance, this is asking for trouble. A pass to either flank or a through-ball to Herlovsen, and they’re in on goal. The move that led to Nchout scoring, though the goal was disallowed by VAR after the tightest of offside calls, showed how England allowed themselves to be carved open against a Cameroon side that lacked quality in the final third.Lucy Bronze was guilty of overdribbling, carrying the ball into midfield where she was out of position and losing it would cause immediate danger. She is undoubtedly one of the best players in the world, but there is a fine line between confidence and arrogance and sometimes she finds herself on the wrong side of it. Her assist for Ellen White’s goal showed her using her abilities perfectly, exposing the opposition defence before playing a great pass, but sometimes she can be guilty of playing her team into danger, leaving space to exploit on the turnover.White has now scored four goals in France, and is in wonderful form. But Maren Mjelde and Maria Thorisdóttir at the heart of the Norwegian defence were exceptional against Australia and controlled the best forward in the world in Sam Kerr. If England are going to get past that pair White’s movement has to be exceptional, and Fran Kirby will have to help her out with runs from the No 10 role. England will need more than one player to be affecting those two, because the Chelsea pair are smart, experienced defenders who will be familiar with the English forwards.At the same time England’s back four needs to be at the top of their game to deal with Herlovsen, who is in clinical form, Hansen, who must have put in one of the best performances of her life against Australia, and Reiten, a tricky left winger who is about to join Mjelde and Thorisdóttir at Chelsea. When they played Japan in the group stage England were much more tactically disciplined than they were against Cameroon. Japan played a lot of pretty football but didn’t really get anywhere, because England made themselves hard to break down. That is the kind of organisation they will need to show on Thursday.It can be hard, in the middle of a tournament, to turn a poor performance in one game into an excellent one in the next. That is the challenge England face now. The only way to achieve it is to be honest with yourself, to review your mistakes and make sure you don’t repeat them. That is the process Phil Neville and his team have to put themselves through if they are to earn a place in the semi-finals."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56f65f36f98f5c08449ef6b7852b0c3bf1b6e835/0_300_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6073d16bfca977095068f6ec2cddbd7f","title":"andy mcnab at the age of 16 i learned to read and that knowledge was everything","story":"When he joined the army, the author had the reading age of an 11-year-old. But he can still remember the pride he felt at reading his first bookI joined the army straight out of juvenile detention at the age of 16. I was no criminal mastermind – I burgled the same block of flats repeatedly and was always going to end up getting caught.The education system had failed me I had attended nine schools in seven years and I didn’t see the point of it. I wanted to be a panel beater or a tube driver I had heard they made loads of money and you didn’t need much education for those kind of jobs. So that was it – why bother going to school? All I needed was to get a council flat, and I had that cracked because my parents were already on the list. All that was left was a Mark II Ford Escort and that would be me made.As it was, I was heading down a path that eventually led me to prison. Despite what Only Fools and Horses would have you believe, Peckham was never full of Del Boy cheeky chappies, having a laugh on the market then going off to drink cocktails in the pub. It was full of unemployment, drugs, guns and mindless vandalism. As a teenager I felt angry with people who had shiny new cars or spotless motorbikes, simply because they had stuff and I didn’t. So I used to kick their cars and bikes in, just because I could. I would vandalise people’s shops and mess up their goods, because they had it and I didn’t.It was while I was in juvenile detention that the army recruitment guys turned up and offered us an early release if we joined up. It sounded better than prison, so off I went. But the army turned my life around by opening my eyes and showing me that there were opportunities if I took the initiative and made something of myself. If I was willing to put in the effort.When my world truly changed for the better, I was in a classroom, alongside about 20 other boy soldiers, with an old sweat of a captain standing up front. He pointed out of the window, towards the barbed wire fence and the real world beyond, saying: “Out there, they think you are all thick. But you’re not. The only reason you can’t read or write is because you don’t read or write. But from today that all changes.”And it did. I soon learned that the reason I hadn’t been able to join the army as a helicopter pilot, as I had hoped, and had ended up in the infantry instead, was because I had the literacy and numeracy levels of an 11-year-old. I had no idea that I had a reading age that low I had just made words up when I didn’t know them, and usually ended up getting them wrong.It was just before I turned 17 that I read my very first book: Janet and John Book 10. I can vividly remember the sense of pride and achievement I felt. It was meant for primary school children but I didn’t care. I had read a whole book, and I was hooked. From then on I read anything and everything I could get my hands on. Of course it took me a while to catch up with where I should have been, but whether it was a tabloid newspaper, a car magazine or a book, I just wanted to try to get as much knowledge as I could.I learned in those early days at the army education centre, and then again when I joined the SAS, that the most important thing you have is knowledge. There are always people falling over themselves to help you and teach you stuff, and you are never going to progress unless you keep learning. Literacy and numeracy levels for the average infantry recruit joining up now are still relatively low, and the incredible educational opportunities that the army offers makes it one of the few places with decent social mobility in the UK.For me, improving my literacy levels had another more surprising outcome. When I left the SAS, I was asked to write an account of the Bravo Two Zero mission and that led to the unexpected career change of becoming an author.I have spent quite a bit of time over the past few years visiting schools, prisons and workplaces, as well as army bases and businesses, to talk about my past and encouraging others to start reading and writing. The guys joining up now still have the opportunity to change their lives, just as I did. The message I give to all the lads that I chat to is that if I can do it, anyone can. If that is a message that even one of them takes on board and uses, then it has been worthwhile.

While his passing is unlikely to attract the kind of accolades given to many deceased musicians, Bartholomew was a giant, a man who helped shape the sound and direction of both rhythm and blues and rock’n’roll while indirectly helping shape ska and, much later, rap. Bartholomew liked to state, “I invented the big beat”, and this was no idle boast: if any one musician can be given credit for shaping the sound of the US after the second world war, it was Bartholomew.Bartholomew was born in Edgard, Louisiana, in 1918: a small town whose African American populace worked in sugar mills or on the docks servicing the river boats. Bartholomew’s father played tuba with jazz bands, shifting the family to New Orleans in 1933, where he worked on river boats and in bars. Here, the musically precocious youth began playing trumpet in local jazz and brass bands. He served in the US military during the war, returning to New Orleans in November 1945. Forming his own band, Dave Bartholomew and the Dew Droppers – named after the locally famous black music hotel and nightclub, The Dew Drop Inn – Bartholomew forged rhythm and blues out of jump blues and swing. A local reporter wrote of Bartholomew’s band in 1947: “Putting it mildly, they made the house ‘rock.’” Within a decade the western world would be rocking to Bartholomew’s sound.In 1947, Bartholomew made his debut record for DeLuxe Records. It sold well locally and he scored his first national hit in 1949 with the suggestive Country Boy. That same year, while playing in Houston, Texas, Bartholomew was approached on the bandstand by Lew Chudd of Imperial Records, a fledgling, Los Angeles-based independent record label then concentrating on selling Mexican records Chudd asked Bartholomew if he would be interested in working with him.Soon Bartholomew would serve as Imperial’s New Orleans A\u0026ampR man – scouting and signing talent, then producing, arranging, often songwriting for and playing on the sessions. In 1949, Imperial’s first two R\u0026ampB chart hits both featured Bartholomew’s many talents: Jewel King’s 3 x 7  21 and Fats Domino’s The Fat Man. Bartholomew had found Domino playing in local bars and recognised the portly youth’s star quality: together the two men adapted Junker’s Blues, a song about heroin addiction, into The Fat Man. Lew Chudd initially hated it but it was an immediate hit with black listeners, selling over a million copies. The Fat Man is now often called “the first rock’n’roll record”.Bartholomew left Imperial in 1950 after a dispute over money and concentrated on making his own records, cutting the street party anthem Shrimp and Gumbo, proto-rap The Monkey and the innuendo-laden My Ding A Ling (the tune Chuck Berry would make his only ever UK No 1 in 1972) while also producing Lloyd Price’s 1952 debut single Lawdy Miss Clawdy (a R\u0026ampB No 1 that would soon be recorded by everyone from Elvis Presley and the Beatles to the Replacements and Lemmy). Imperial lured Bartholomew back in 1952 and, in 1955, he and Domino would set off on an extended run of hits – Dave producing and co-writing the songs and leading a band that featured several musicians now hailed as pioneers (drummer Earl Palmer, saxophonist Lee Allen, and guitarist Walter “Papoose” Nelson). They made Fats a superstar and introduced the world to New Orleans R\u0026ampB.Bartholomew kept busy throughout the 1950s, issuing both his own records and producingwriting others – these include Smiley Lewis’s One Night (later a hit for Elvis Presley) and I Hear You Knocking (a 1970 UK No 1 for Dave Edmunds) and Shirley \u0026amp Lee’s Let the Good Times Roll (producerband leader only). In Jamaica, Bartholomew’s productions were hugely popular and early ska developed directly from New Orleans R\u0026ampB.The British Invasion that began with the Beatles in late 1963 shifted listeners away from the warm, horn-heavy New Orleans music Bartholomew specialised in, and Chudd sold Imperial to Liberty Records that same year. Bartholomew continued to work as a producer and band leader – once Domino began touring the world it was Bartholomew who lead his magnificent band – but, by the late-1960s, had cut back on his workload. He had over 4,000 songwriting credits and some of these proved extremely lucrative. In recent decades he lead his own Dixieland jazz band, playing the music he had grown up learning from his father, a New Orleans homeboy to the end.Bartholomew’s immense musical talent was matched by his self-confidence and discipline. He succeeded at a time of extreme racial segregation and brutally exploitative recording deals, yet never lost control of his publishing or the direction he wanted to take. A tall, proud man, he did it his way – RIP, Mr Big Beat."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58794d1a2f6ccd87cc31f385c2067b4f8b2bf0a2/0_68_5470_3283/master/5470.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c9fc4b5503162d5c4ef3e3ea141b73e","title":"iran rejects fresh uk call to release nazanin zaghari ratcliffe","story":"Foreign minister Andrew Murrison’s diplomatic visit to Tehran falls flatThe Iranian foreign ministry has dismissed a fresh UK call to release Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the Iranian-British dual national in jail on espionage charges, despite it being delivered personally by a Foreign Office minister.Andrew Murrison made the appeal for Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s release on his first visit to Tehran, where he quickly discovered the low standing with which Britain is held in Iranian government circles.Iran’s deputy foreign minister, Seyed Abbas Araghchi, said Zaghari-Ratcliffe would have to serve her sentence, denouncing a hunger strike by her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, outside the Iranian embassy in London as “blackmail”.Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe is arrested at Imam Khomeini airport as she is trying to return to Britain after a holiday visiting family with her daughter, Gabriella.Her husband, Richard Radcliffe, delivers a letter to David Cameron in 10 Downing Street, demanding the government do more for her release.She is sentenced to five years in jail. Her husband says the exact charges are still being kept a secret.Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u0027s health deteriorates after she spends several days on hunger strike in protest at her imprisonment.Iran’s supreme court upholds her conviction.Her husband reveals that Zaghari-Ratcliffe has fears for her health after lumps had been found in her breasts that required an ultrasound scan, and that she was now “on the verge of a nervous breakdown”.New Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt meets with Richard Ratcliffe, and pledges We will do everything we can to bring her home.She is granted a temporary three day release from prison.Zaghari-Ratcliffe is on hunger strike again, in protest at the withdrawal of her medical care.Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt takes the unusual step of granting her diplomatic protection - a move that raises her case from a consular matter to the level of a dispute between the two states.The UK upgrades its travel advice to British-Iranian dual nationals, for the first time advising against all travel to\u0026nbspIran. The advice also urges Iranian nationals living in the UK to exercise caution if they decide to travel to Iran.Richard Ratcliffe joins his wife in a new hunger strike campaign. He fasts outside the Iranian embassy in London as she began a third hunger strike protest in prison.Araghchi said: “The Islamic Republic of Iran’s judiciary will not be influenced by such acts of blackmail, and those convicted of espionage must serve their terms.”Ratcliffe, a tireless campaigner for his wife’s release from a Tehran jail for the past three years is on the 10th day of a hunger strike in solidarity with his wife, who is protesting against her conditions in Evin prison. She was arrested in April 2016 and given a five-year sentence for espionage, a charge she denies. At times the Iranians have threatened a second set of charges.Their five-year-old daughter, Gabriella, has been deprived of her weekly visit to see her mother in jail, possibly because the Iranian authorities are angered by Richard Ratcliffe’s high-profile protest. Araghchi also criticised the UK government’s support for the US, saying: “It appears that the British government’s entanglement with the predicament of Brexit has prevented it from having a correct understanding of the global realities. Immature companionship with America’s bully-style measures will result in nothing but an increase in the Iranians’ historical aversion to the UK policies.”He also raised the UK’s outstanding £400m debt to the Iranian nation going back more than 40 years, which is related to the British government’s refusal to honour a contract for Chieftain tanks sold to the Shah of Iran in 1976, but never received. Araghchi called for an immediate settlement of the debts, stressing that the UK government’s refusal to do so was not acceptable or justified.The debt issue has been a running sore between the UK and Iran, with Iran pursuing it through the courts for years only to be met with UK resistance over whether it was legally able to pay the debt to entities that were subjected to sanctions. Boris Johnson, when he was foreign secretary, once briefed newspapers that the UK had decided to pay the Iranian debt – it then emerged he had failed to win Whitehall’s agreement.Murrison, on the first of his round of visits, was also given a lecture on Britain’s historical interference in Iran by Kamal Kharazi, a senior foreign policy adviser to the country’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.Kharazi told the UK minister: “Britain has a very negative perception in the minds of people of Iran.”He cited the first world war when the UK entered Iran and caused a famine the 1901 agreement of an oil monopoly in the country given to William Knox D’Arcy the granting of a tobacco monopoly in 1891 the British-backed coup against the former Irainian prime minister Mohammad Mosaddegh in 1953, and the support for Saddam Hussein during the Iran-Iraq war.Kharazi said: “I explained these reasons for this perception and said that the British government must take serious steps to offset this perception.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42510a6b2fc6aed8b3f89c954d587b2e94d3bff4/0_361_3626_2176/master/3626.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=af6d59a02c381a1eb53277be0d4f5490 960w","title":"hmrc pushes massive vat increase for new solar battery systems","story":"Homes hoping to shrink their carbon footprints by installing a solar-battery system face a steep VAT increase from October under new laws proposed by HMRC.Meanwhile, home coal supplies will continue to receive the lower VAT rate.The Renewable Energy Association (REA) said the rise “contradicts the government’s commitment to tackling climate change” only weeks after parliament declared a climate emergency.It also warned that the move would push back the take-up of solar-battery systems by years even as the UK works towards becoming a net zero carbon economy by 2050.Nina Skorupska, the REA’s chief executive, said the increase would “create a barrier to British homes and businesses who are seeking to take action on climate change and reduce their bills by installing solar with battery storage”.She said the government “should be doing all it can to install these technologies rather than enacting barriers”.HMRC has blamed EU tax laws for the planned rise because they rule out lower VAT rates for energy saving equipment under state aid rules.The European court of justice ruled in 2015 that energy saving materials should not have been receiving the reduced rate of tax. This led to an increase in VAT for solar systems installed at new-build homes in 2016, but did not affect the majority of houses which would require retrofitting. Those houses will now be affected by the higher rate.The REA has called on HMRC to cancel the latest increase, which would come into effect as the UK prepares to leave the EU. Any rise should be cancelled as soon as possible after Brexit, the trade group added.The calls have won the support of more than 11,000 members of the public who have signed a petition by the green energy supplier Good Energy to call off the increase.Juliet Davenport, Good Energy’s chief executive, said the rise was “possibly the worst way to respond to a climate emergency”.“The government should be seeking to be a world leader in renewable technologies, but it’s damaging our successful solar industry and putting green jobs at risk. We urge the Treasury to listen to the thousands of petitioners who want to play their part in fighting climate change,” she said.HMRC brought the secondary legislation to parliament on Monday after carrying out an industry consultation on the plans in April and May this year. It has said it is offering as much tax relief as possible for home renewable energy systems while ensuring the UK is in line with EU law."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be0d7a831f0ba9a41a39d126ad63c1439f61229e/0_117_6720_4031/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a6a70fd3ae4d7641ac6a07f469e5f9fd","title":"however look logic brexit backstop refuses to yield irish","story":"None of the options proposed as a solution to keeping the Irish border looks workableThe question, set less by Brussels than the logic of Brexit, is how the UK government can in one move leave the European union’s single market and customs while also maintaining the flow of trade and people on its one land border with the bloc in IrelandThe fact that the existence of the land border in question cost more than 3,600 lives over 30 years led to the British government in December 2017 restating its commitment to avoid “a hard border, including any physical infrastructure or related checks and controls”.Avoiding a backdoor for smugglers into the single market is additionally regarded as essential by Dublin and the European commission, as is avoiding crippling extra bureaucracy on Irish businesses.The so-called Irish backstop in the 585-page withdrawal agreement – to remain in place “unless and until” an alternative solution for keeping the border open is found – offers one solution by doing two key things.First, Northern Ireland stays within the EU’s regulatory regime, and under direct jurisdiction of the European court of justice, so as to allow a single market for goods on the island of Ireland.Second, the whole of the UK shares a customs territory with the EU to avoid any checks on goods both between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, and Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom.But rejected three times by the Commons on the grounds that the UK could be tied into the backstop indefinitely, leaving the government unable to sign its own comprehensive trade deals, the withdrawal agreement is said by Boris Johnson, still the frontrunner in the Tory leadership battle, to be “defunct”.What is the alternative? In recent days, Johnson has suggested that the EU and UK could give themselves more time to work on the problem by relying on “Gatt 24 or whatever it happens to be” to provide for a “standstill in our current arrangements”.Under article XXIV of the general agreement on tariffs and trade, tariffs would remain at zero even under a no-deal exit on 31 October for up to a decade, it is said. The agreement could additionally leave the Irish border open while the two sides sought a new accommodation.The problem for Johnson, in the words of the trade secretary, Liam Fox, is that this “isn’t true”. Article XXIV is only relevant if there is an an agreement in principle on a free trade deal. It gives the two parties time to turn an interim deal into a final one.But the EU has said that the first and necessary step towards a trade deal is ratification of the withdrawal agreement. And the Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, has said that without a legally binding guarantee that a hard border will not reemerge there will be no withdrawal agreement.In the light of this, interest has been aroused in a 201-page report published on Monday by a non-government organisation calling itself the Alternative Arrangements Commission.Backed by two former ministers, Nicky Morgan and Greg Hands, it has suggested that by 2022 a solution could be in place using a mix of technology, trusted trade schemes, mobile checks on food and animals within a new joint Irish-British Sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) zone, special economic zones to push customs checks away from the border and a certain amount of looking the other way.The problems with it are legion. By imposing checks within a newly delineated border zone it fails the central task of avoiding new checks, and creates targets for terrorists in the new mobile veterinary vans. The burden of Brexit is put on Irish businesses. The exemptions on checks for many crossing the border will set off alarm bells for those concerned about the integrity of the single market.But the central problem for Brussels is that the plan is theoretical.There remains no certainty at all that the complicated IT systems, democratic consultation on the creation of new economic zones or negotiations with the European commission on the finer detail would be finalised by the end of the transition period of “standstill” relations.The Irish backstop would then have to remain to guarantee the avoidance of a hard border. The Brexit logic remains unyielding."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3072177a30465dde1ed5ee307a24366756aa43f4/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f76abfc3b068894b3e0816d1a99b6935","title":"theresa may yawned god this was dull sketch","story":"Where once Commons jibes might have hurt, now they bounce off. She has a perspective on her lifeHow times change. Two months ago a statement by the prime minister on the latest EU council meeting would have been considered a significant occasion. One worthy of a full House of Commons. Now the government is so marginal – not just to the EU but to the country itself – that the chamber was barely a third full. And those who did bother to turn up were only there because it was a slow Monday afternoon, there was sod all on TV and they had nothing better to do with their lives.Semi-retirement seems to suit Theresa May. When she first announced she had been forced out of No 10, her face and body appeared contorted with grief and anger. As if the loss was unbearable. Time is proving a quick healer. She is learning to cope with the indifference of her Tory MPs by being equally as indifferent to them. Where once their jibes and accusations might hurt, now they bounce off. She has a perspective on her life. She knows she is surrounded by shabby, untrustworthy careerists and she is going to enjoy every second of schadenfreude as her successors inevitably crash and burn.Not that she’s going to let that stop her giving them a little nudge towards the edge of the abyss. Why deny herself such pleasures? May began by trying to rack her brains for anything that had happened in Brussels the previous week. To be honest, she’d been a bit demob happy, helping herself to several too many glasses of wine and hadn’t really paid attention to a word anyone had said. What was the point? It wasn’t as if either she or the UK were going to be involved for much longer.“Er … ” she said. There had been some chat about the climate crisis and something about Turkey drilling in the eastern Mediterranean she hadn’t quite followed. Ah yes! There had also been something about disinformation and fake news and how it was generally a bad idea.Why only that morning there had been a photograph of Boris Johnson and Carrie Symonds on the front page of the Evening Standard that had been photoshopped from the front cover of Nadine Dorries’ latest tear-jerking novel about a pair of star-crossed lovers who surmounted impossible odds to find true happiness in Downing Street. The prime minister was so outraged she was thinking of reporting Johnson to the Independent Press Standards Organisation for breaching his own privacy.In reply, Jeremy Corbyn chose to focus on Brexit. Could May think of anything useful that had happened over the past three years? Did she regret legitimising a no deal for either of the two idiots in line to succeed her? Did she agree that Johnson clearly had no idea what he was talking about in regard to both tariffs and an implementation period in a no-deal Brexit? Philip Hammond, the only member of the cabinet who bothered to turn up – presumably he’s making the most of his time on the frontbench before he too is fired – nodded enthusiastically in responseRead my lips, May yawned. God this was dull. Why was she even here? There had been no discussion of Brexit because the EU was sick to death of the UK. They’d fallen over themselves to be accommodating but now just wanted us to piss off. The sooner the better. We were an embarrassment to them and to ourselves. So she really didn’t have anything to say about Brexit. But since she was here and only had a few more weeks of this shitshow to get through, she’d offer some thoughts. Of course Boris was an incompetent liar who didn’t have a clue what he was doing. That was the whole point of him. So good luck to the Tory party and the country.Sensing there was going to be no pushback, the SNP’s Ian Blackford joined the pile-on with a dig about Johnson’s record as foreign secretary. May smirked. Yes, she admitted. It had been a terrible decision to appoint him to a job that required concentration and diplomacy. It had always been the government’s view that Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been visiting Iran on holiday and she’d been horrified when Johnson had apparently tried to get her banged up in jail for longer. And don’t get her started on his trip to Myanmar.The session ended with Chris Bryant and Sarah Wollaston asking if the new prime minister would address parliament before the recess. May shrugged. This was above her pay grade. It was down to whoever took over from her. But if, as looked likely, it turned out to be Johnson, then the answer was almost certainly no. He had a lot of holiday booked. Fences to mend. Children to count. Somewhere secluded and quiet. Somewhere no one could hear you screaming."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/213e7f21e20882072c9ed72e5b326e92c0ed8167/0_41_4841_2905/master/4841.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=60a6fc39869c5c9f26569e544ae97707","title":"mars rovers large methane discovery excites scientists","story":"Curiosity’s record-breaking measurement fuels speculation it is from microbial MartiansNasa’s Curiosity rover has detected its largest belch of methane on Mars so far, fuelling speculation that the robot may have trundled through a cloud of waste gas released by microbial Martians buried deep under the surface.Mission scientists announced on Monday that Curiosity had measured a record-breaking 21 parts per billion (ppb) of methane in the air in Gale crater, the rover’s landing site and area of exploration. The level is substantially more than the 5.8ppb it sensed on 16 June 2013.Curiosity touched down on the red planet in August 2012 and has recorded a number of sharp spikes in methane and a fluctuating background level of the gas that appears to rise and fall with the seasons.The latest measurement has excited some Mars enthusiasts because on Earth, much of the methane in the air comes from living things that release it one way or another as waste gas. But methane can have far more mundane origins than microscopic Martians, such as reactions between water and certain types of rock, and Nasa’s rover cannot distinguish between these.While Mars was once warm and home to coursing rivers and giant lakes, it is now exceptionally dry and battered with intense radiation. If any life exists on the planet, it would probably have to be sheltering deep underground.“With our current measurements, we have no way of telling if the methane source is biology or geology, or even ancient or modern,” said Paul Mahaffy from Nasa’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt in Maryland, US.The methane spike was recorded by the rover’s sample analysis at Mars (SAM) tunable laser spectrometer. After noticing the methane surge in data beamed back to Earth last week, mission scientists commanded the rover to perform follow-up experiments over the weekend.The measurement deepens the mystery of why a European Space Agency probe sent to Mars to nail down the origins of the planet’s methane has so far found no traces of the gas. One possible explanation is that any methane released on the planet is broken down before it reaches the altitude of the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO).In April, a team of Italian scientists traced a plume of methane on Mars back to a particular spot on the surface where the movement of a geological fault may have released bubbles of the gas trapped in Martian permafrost.Manish Patel, an Open University researcher who works on the TGO mission, said the latest detection by Curiosity was what the European team had been waiting for. Until now, the TGO has not looked for methane on Mars at the same time as Curiosity. “The previous ‘discrepancy’ in findings was always complicated by the fact that we never made measurements at the same time,” Patel said. “There was always a possibility that something was occurring in the atmosphere to trap or remove the methane before we arrived to measure it.”He added: “Now that both Curiosity and TGO are active on Mars, we have the chance to compare measurements made at the same time, which will allow direct comparison. Curiosity will likely continue to make measurements, and it will be interesting to see whether they still see the methane, or whether it disappears immediately.” In the meantime, scientists on TGO will examine their own data to see if any trace of the methane was picked up by their own instruments high above the Martian surface."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf4e303285161fad0c3d4a7c3e924e751667741b/0_0_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=021fb721b2212a5b5aea6275acb0e8aa","title":"tell us has your camhs record affected future employment","story":"As part of an investigation into the issues people who have completed treatment face we would like to hear your experiences Hundreds of thousands of young people pass through the UK’s Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (Camhs) each year.

Pakistan have been traditionally variable. Sri Lanka put in some feeble performances before swarming the tournament host. West Indies flattered, then were flattened.And when England play Australia at Lord’s on Tuesday, there is a sense that it will answer questions about both teams. For England’s part, whether they will flourish or falter when the pressure really starts to build. For Australia’s, whether this current team can really mount a credible challenge for the trophy.For Australia, there is at least no intimidation at untrodden ground. Winning the thing is almost humdrum. “The fact that we’ve got six guys in our squad who were part of the 2015 World Cup win is really valuable,” said the captain, Aaron Finch, in understated fashion. “We’ve also got Ricky Ponting with us, Brad Haddin with us, as coaching staff who have won World Cups, and multiple World Cups as well.”Last year Finch’s team looked like a rabble and even through this tournament there has been a sense of disjointedness to how the batting order is composed and what roles batsmen are there to play. Yet the team have found a way past most opponents. “I think over World Cup history Australia have had that record of peaking at the right time of the tournament,” said Finch.Taking on England will offer a test of whether that is the case this time round. Of the other teams in the top four, Australia were well beaten by India and are yet to play New Zealand. England, despite stumbles against Sri Lanka and Pakistan, are still a power-packed lineup that do not take kindly to defeat, with a recent record of bouncing back after a lost match in spectacular fashion.Lord’s, though, is far from the best venue for the kind of high-risk, high-reward approach of modern England. The pitches tend to be slower and scoring rates lower, especially for new batsmen.On the evidence of the venue’s first World Cup date, when Pakistan beat South Africa, these pitches are taking spin as well. With fast bowlers going for plenty of runs and Imran Tahir low on overs, South Africa turned to Aiden Markram’s very part-time spin through the middle overs of Sunday’s game and found he turned the ball appreciably. Pakistan’s spinners also made telling contributions.“I think we saw as the game went on it started to turn a little bit more than we probably expected,” Finch said. “It looked like there was a little bit in it to start with, and then it dried out and sort of powdered up and started turning.”The logical upshot is Australia might have to defy their own convention and play the off-spinner Nathan Lyon alongside the leg‑spinner Adam Zampa. Lyon has had nothing to do in this tournament except sing anthems and ferry beverages. Nathan Coulter-Nile, the first choice for the third fast bowler, has contributed only four wickets in five matches and has often struggled with his accuracy, while Lyon has recently shown a mastery at suffocating the scoring through the middle of an innings. In the warm-up match against England in Southampton Lyon got through his 10 overs at a cost of 37 runs.Of course, Australian managers are more conservative than any in routinely picking three fast bowlers, especially if Ponting in his coaching role is currently as influential as it appears. Ponting captaining spinners was like a grumpy cop in a buddy comedy teaming up with a flamboyant lounge singer or a rascally dog: he didn’t want them, didn’t trust them, and grudgingly accepted their presence to get a job done. Except in Ponting’s film there were no eventual scenes of bonding and acceptance, where the real Ashes were the friends we made along the way.Adaptability has not necessarily been a strong point for Australia in this campaign, with wins coming match by match based on the pure quality of some of the players, rather than a finely tuned execution of strategy. But against England’s aggressive batting, having the ability to change things up is key.The blue-chip pace pair of Mitchell Starc and Pat Cummins pick themselves, but the supporting cast of Lyon, Zampa, medium pace from Marcus Stoinis and more spin from Glenn Maxwell might be the more useful mix than the standard three-pronged pace. Whether selectors can be that adaptable is a different question.It is the old question of what your opponent would least prefer you to do. Given the home team’s stop-start campaign, their recent record at Lord’s, and the nature of the wicket on Sunday, an answer isn’t too hard to guess. With four wins in the bank, two more needed, and three games to play, England in this World Cup are very close to having a problem. Australia have the chance to prove they are once again the team to create one."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab1a5eaa060e3f0596a3c27f66c2119eda4eed5d/0_142_3400_2040/master/3400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef47fca8e5cd7c1c8ca4119103dbc713","title":"bangladesh shakib al hasan afghanistan","story":"If England needed a reminder of just how fragile their hopes of making the World Cup semi-finals currently are, the presence of Bangladesh breathing down their neck in the standings following this convincing win against Afghanistan provided it. Roared on by a boisterous army of Tiger-clad fans, Bangladesh produced a performance that has infused them with genuine belief they can reach the last four of this tournament.They now sit fifth in the table on seven points, one behind England and with matches against India and Pakistan remaining. If Bangladesh win both, Eoin Morgan’s team will need to win two of their final three group matches to beat them to a place in the top four. With games against Australia, whom England face at Lord’s on Tuesday, followed by India and New Zealand that is certainly no given.What will worry them most is the momentum and confidence this victory will hand Bangladesh. Beating Indiathe at Edgbaston next Tuesday may seem like a tall order for Mashrafe Mortaza’s side. Yet with Shakib Al Hasan in this kind of form they will believe anything is possible. Here was more evidence to back up the claim he is the best all-rounder in the world as he became only the second player in World Cup history to score a half-century and claim a five-wicket haul in the same match.“Shakib has been fantastic throughout the tournament, he’s been phenomenal,” said Mortaza. “We’ll try our level best against Pakistan and India. It’s still wide open. You never know.”Bangladesh’s man of the moment was equally buoyant about his team’s chances of progress, Shakib saying: “England have three matches left and we have two so it’s difficult mathematically. But having said that anything can happen. We have to believe.”Shakib’s day started with a fifth 50-plus score of the tournament that saw him overtake Australia’s David Warner as the World Cup’s leading runscorer. Those 51 runs – plus a composed 83 from Mushfiqur Rahim – helped Bangladesh post a total of 262 for seven on the same pitch that was used when Afghanistan fell 12 runs short of chasing down 225 against India on Saturday.This contest was nowhere near as close thanks in large part to the left-arm spin of Shakib, who ripped the heart out of Afghanistan’s pursuit of 263 with a haul of five for 29 – the best inidual bowling figures of the tournament so far.They included the key wickets of the captain, Gulbadin Naib, and then Mohammad Nabi for a duck in the space of three balls during the 29th over. It reduced a team who were already struggling to keep up with the required run rate to 104 for four. By the time Shakib struck again four overs later, tempting Asghar Afghan into a slog sweep that saw him caught in the deep, they were even further behind.A brilliant direct hit from Liton Das at midwicket that ran out Ikram Alikhil all but ended this match as a contest as Afghanistan limped to 132 for six, still needing 131 from 89 balls to pull off an unlikely win.In the 43rd over, Shakib struck for the fifth time, Najibullah Zadran stumped after being flummoxed by a quicker arm ball. Zadran’s dismissal saw the Bangladeshi emulate the all-round feat of Yuvraj Singh against Ireland in 2011 – the Indian having scored an unbeaten 50 after taking five for 31 on that occasion.Mustafizur Rahman’s two wickets and another for Mohammad Saifuddin then polished off the tail as Bangladesh bowled out their opponents for 200 in 47 overs.Afghanistan have yet to register a victory at this tournament and they did themselves no favours in this match after deciding to bowl first on a used pitch. It allowed Bangladesh to control the contest from the very start, taking few risks as they successfully calculated a score of around 250 would set up victory.The Afghan fielding – summed up by Dawlat Zadran’s drop of Saifuddan in the final over of the Bangladesh innings – was again poor here as it has been for much of the tournament.Yet even if it had been flawless, Afghanistan would still have been powerless to stop the force of nature that is Shakib."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c965a2239a47002276b410024d7c96ba62719e74/0_236_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5acb32a3f1aa152f7355254a259e4c4b","title":"england cricket world cup news australia","story":"Eoin Morgan has declined to join the chorus of voices asking supporters not to boo Steve Smith and David Warner, adding that the pair may have served bans for last year’s ball-tampering scandal but rebuilding public trust takes longer.Speaking before Tuesday’s World Cup group game between England and Australia – which Jason Roy will miss with a hamstring injury – Morgan was asked if he would follow India’s Virat Kohli and Justin Langer, the Australia head coach, by requesting that fans go easy on Smith and Warner.But despite 15 months having passed since the Cape Town incident that led to the Australian batsmen being stood down from leadership roles, suspended from international cricket for a year and the subject of widespread public criticism, Morgan believes it is not in his remit as England captain to issue orders to fans.“Who knows how long it will take? I don’t think I could do anything, or should so anything, to try influence the fans to change their mind.”Morgan admitted Kohli’s much-praised intervention during India’s win over Australia a fortnight ago, in which he asked fans to clap Smith, prompted him to consider a repeat, only to decide on reflection that “it didn’t sit right with me”.Jonny Bairstow, who struck up a friendship with Warner during this year’s Indian Premier League, used his Daily  column to allude to double standards on the issue, chiefly that Darren Lehmann, the former Australia coach, urged home fans to make Stuart Broad “cry” during the 2013-14 Ashes trip.While England have already faced the pair during a warm-up match in Southampton, Lord’s is the first meeting in an international. The stewards have been briefed to be on the lookout should any booing directed at Smith and Warner turn into personal abuse if so, it may violate ticketing terms and result in any offender being ejected.The Australia captain, Aaron Finch, who has heard booing directed at the pair throughout their time in England, said: “It hasn’t affected our boys one bit. I can honestly say that, if anything, it’s given them a bit more motivation.“If a handful of people or a whole stadium are booing them, it doesn’t make any difference to how hard they watch the ball or whether they doubt themselves or anything like that. I think it’s a bit of white noise, to be fair.”Warner has certainly appeared unaffected, scoring 447 runs in six innings, including two centuries. The 32-year-old has been more watchful in doing so but Morgan said if he does switch to his more typical aggression, England’s bowlers have plans.Morgan is once again without one of his own incendiary openers. Roy had a fresh scan on his hamstring tear on Monday morning but despite netting afterwards, Sunday’s meeting with India at Edgbaston is now the revised goal.The injury gave rise to talk of whether Alex Hales, who was “de-selected” from the World Cup due to a recreational drug ban, could return. Morgan is unable to state on the record that the right-hander is now ineligible but said, after speaking to the national selector Ed Smith, that the pecking order of replacements remains the same.This probably means Joe Denly and Dawid Malan, who featured before the tournament, are next in line. In Roy’s absence, James Vince once again gets the chance to prove his obvious talent can translate into an innings of substance from 12 ODI caps to date, the stylish right-hander has only one half-century.Vince is the junior member of a batting lineup that is looking to make amends following Friday’s collapse to 212 all out against Sri Lanka in Leeds, a 20-run defeat that increases the pressure as they look to secure a semi-final spot.“Guys have performed under pressure for a very long time,” said Morgan. “They have performed under the pressure of being favourites for the last two years in series, both away from home and at home, and I have no question mark about producing under pressure.”Finch added: “We are expecting England to come out ultra-hard and take the game on, which has been one of their main traits over the last couple of years. I think the pressure is increasing on everyone.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/587e8ef27665a93f28adf26cab324166ef328b0b/0_188_5647_3388/master/5647.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ad907b6ce79f6f719696bf7e79eed710","title":"idris elba kwame kwei armah tree interview bereavement","story":"The actor celebrates all big events in his life by wrapping his arms round a sturdy trunk. With the help of director Kwame Kwei-Armah, he has turned his obsession into a showIdris Elba has a thing about trees. He’s got a tattoo of one on his left arm, partially hidden today by a black T-shirt – but that’s not all. Whenever Elba needs to mark a major event in his life – birthdays, new years, that kind of thing – he heads outside and wraps his arms around a trunk. “I just feel a massive connection to the roots that are underneath, which are very high and wide, and to the oxygen that comes from the top,” he says. “And then there’s me in the middle … Idris Elba, tree-hugger!”He lets out a burst of laughter, as does the director Kwame Kwei-Armah. The pair are here today because they’ve collaborated on a new project called, funnily enough, Tree – an ambitious mix of music, dance and drama set to premiere at this year’s Manchester international festival. The pair have known each other for decades but this is the first time they’ve worked together. “The seeds are laid right,” Elba says, and the metaphors continue, with much talk of “cultivating” and “planting” in their creative process.The production’s “deepest roots”, says Elba, grew from his experience in South Africa playing Nelson Mandela in the film Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom. For inspiration on how to emulate the man, Elba had looked to his own father, who shared Mandela’s infectious smile and similarly pointed with his middle finger – yet shortly after seeing the movie, his dad died. Elba felt compelled to revisit the country and make an album in his father’s honour – 2014’s Mi Mandela – that featured a song called Tree, “which is sort of on the nose, a love letter to my dad”.Now the two men are working with a cast that includes Alfred Enoch, the young black British actor who went to the US to star alongside Viola Davis in the hit series How to Get Away With Murder. Kwei-Armah smiles: “Alfie came to an early workshop, he got off the plane from Brazil, hadn’t even looked at the script. Thank God, because it was really bad then. I completely rewrote it.”Was the script a collaborative process, too? “We did it together,” Kwei-Armah replies, as Elba points towards Kwei-Armah and stage whispers: “He wrote it.” Not for the first time, they both laugh. Kwei-Armah continues: “Alfie came in, and literally within an hour, our magnificent choreographer, Gregory Maqoma, was holding him upside down.”The immersive nature of Tree has leaked into the rehearsal process, with the creators operating a rehearsal room where people are regularly invited in — including me. During the company’s morning briefing, which involves everyone in the space holding hands in a large circle, Kwei-Armah asks how everyone is. One performer speaks candidly about an encounter that reminded her how grateful she feels to be in the space. Another, Patrice Naiambana, mutters an in-joke under his breath that makes Enoch crack up laughing. Elba tells a story about being confronted by South Africans for playing Mandela despite not being of South African heritage.Earlier, he’d recounted how people had told him he shouldn’t be playing Mandela. “They said, ‘We’ve got actors in South Africa who are qualified.’ And our director was white, and our producer was Indian.”Eventually they won people over. “At the end of the process, people that were on that cusp about whether I should be there or not, were like, ‘Thank you, I can see you just as being a vessel in playing that.’” As with Kaleo, the protagonist in Tree, there was a sense of “coming home. You get what I’m saying?”Kwei-Armah does. “Not only do I get what you’re saying, I wish I had articulated that to the cast on day one. The beautiful thing about the DNA of this, the DNA of our lead character, is going, ‘Whoa, where is my legitimacy here, I’ve got to find my way home.’”But right now they’re just excited to present Tree to the world. “It’s lovely to be able to see something you’ve planted the seed of,” says Elba. “And repot it into a different form”.Kwei-Armah laughs once more: “This is why we’re going to keep working together. We’ve got to keep these garden metaphors going!”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5af76842044f5720b37f968a6f160bfb10a68afc/0_286_4284_2570/master/4284.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8a36219b5d1d7fa154d42053c69caf1f","title":"the unwanted the secret windrush files review who could feel proud of britain after this","story":"Theresa May’s hostile environment was a full 70 years in the making, argues this damning, devastating documentaryAs the Empire Windrush made its way from the Caribbean to Britain in 1948, politicians in Westminster were frantically scheming about how they could prevent a ship carrying hundreds of black immigrants from docking in the UK. The Labour prime minister Clement Attlee described it as an “incursion”. A meeting of the government’s economic policy committee discussed whether it might be possible to ert the ship to east Africa, and make its passengers (a well-qualified group of electricians, mechanics, welders and carpenters) take work there, picking peanuts. Eleven Labour MPs delivered a letter to Attlee warning that “an influx of coloured people” would “impair the harmony, strength and cohesion of our public and social life and cause discord and unhappiness among all concerned”.Anyone who thought that the introduction of the hostile environment was one of Theresa May’s few clear, tangible accomplishments will need to reconsider. It turns out that even this unpleasant creation is not something she can claim as her core legacy, since it had already been 70 years in the making.Although the postwar government estimated Britain needed 1.3 million extra workers to help rebuild a country shattered by five years of war, officials turned out to be more welcoming to ex-SS soldiers from Germany than British subjects from the Caribbean. In his powerful film, The Unwanted: the Secret Windrush Files (BBC Two), the historian David Olusoga manages to explain complex immigration law and decode dense documents from the government archives in an arresting way. He pulls out devastating passages from forgotten files to showcase the hostility of successive governments to non-white settlers.Everything begins with the British Nationality Act of 1948, which confirmed the right of all British subjects to move freely and live anywhere they liked within the newly created Commonwealth. But the act, Olusoga argues, was intended to ensure frictionless travel for the large white populations of Canada and Australia. “No one imagined that black and brown people from Asia, Africa and the West Indies would use their rights under this act to come and settle in Britain.”Incriminating archival material reveals the scale of official panic about immigration and the underhand measures taken to discourage residents of Britain’s colonies from settling. Crucially, politicians wanted to restrict access without actually appearing to be racist. The film exposes their shameful contortions as they scrabbled around to justify their prejudices.We learn how ministers in the 1950s commissioned researchers to come up with reasons for concluding that non-white immigration was problematic, with senior civil servants instructing dole officers to conduct secret race surveys to see if there was any truth in the assumption that migrants were coming to live off the welfare state, and asking police chiefs around the country leading questions such as: “Is it true that they are generally idle?”, “Do they have low standards of living?”, and “Are they addicted to drug trafficking and other types of crime?” Winston Churchill was obsessed by the “considerable” number of “coloured workers” employed by the Post Office, and, by 1955, was suggesting to ministers that they should fight the next election on the slogan “Keep England White”.This gradual tightening of immigration legislation exploded in the hands of Theresa May’s government last April, with the Windrush scandal – when thousands of Caribbean-born citizens, legally settled here since childhood, found that they had been silently transformed into illegal immigrants, and threatened with deportation, detained, sacked from their jobs or made homeless.Olusoga shows how the roots of the scandal lie in a single line from the 1971 Immigration Act, which put the onus on iniduals to prove that they are here legally – something so many people were unable to do, with devastating consequences. “Who keeps receipts from the 1970s?” Anthony Bryan asks, explaining how he was detained for five weeks and booked on a flight back to Jamaica. A letter from the Home Office to his lawyer demands more proof: “Your client has stated that he has been resident in the UK since 1965. As such, the evidence submitted must be continuous, and cover the entirety of the 51 years that your client has claimed to reside in the UK.”The most moving parts of this film are the interviews with three Windrush victims (all of whom helped expose the scandal in the ). “It was a country I was proud of, but now I don’t think I feel proud of it,” Sarah O’Connor says, after being wrongly classified as an illegal immigrant, despite her 51 years in the UK. “At times I got so low I wanted my life to end.” Sarah died before the film was finished. No one could feel proud of Britain after watching it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b80d891ac0d9fb1ef8fbf0e310c85f83b9675bd0/0_200_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=588a999e9c802820356d7785f98e945b","title":"mike pompeo us saudi arabia talks iran united arab emirates tensions","story":"Sanctions target supreme leader and eight commanders of Iranian Revolutionary GuardDonald Trump has ordered new sanctions against Iran’s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, and other officials including eight Revolutionary Guard commanders in the latest step of an escalating pressure campaign.Iran’s foreign minister, Javad Zarif, will also face fresh sanctions in a few days, US officials said. He negotiated the 2015 nuclear deal with the US and other major powers, and has spearheaded Iranian diplomacy since.Signing an executive order in the Oval Office, Trump called the increased sanctions “hard-hitting”, saying they would deny the supreme leader, his office and and those closely affiliated with him access to key financial resources. “These measures represent a strong and proportionate response to Iran’s increasingly provocative actions,” Trump said.“We do not seek conflict with Iran or any other country,” the US president added. “I can only tell you we cannot ever let Iran have a nuclear weapon.”Standing alongside Trump, the treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said the measures would freeze billions of dollars in Iranian assets.But analysts said their impact on an already heavily-sanctioned country would be limited“The newly announced Iran sanctions are symbolic,” said Jarrett Blanc, a former senior state department official now at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “This is certainly true … because the newly sanctioned people and entities are already insulated from the international financial system.”Tensions between the US and Iran have soared, with Washington dispatching warships to the Gulf, and Tehran threatening to resume higher uranium enrichment.John Bolton announces the deployment of the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group and a bomber task force in response to \u0027a number of troubling and escalatory indications and warnings\u0027.Iran vows to enrich its uranium stockpile closer to weapons-grade levels if world powers fail to negotiate new terms for its nuclear deal. The US responds by imposing sanctions on Iran\u0027s metals industry.The EU urges Iran to respect the nuclear deal and says it plans to continue trading with the country despite US sanctions.\u0026nbspThe US says it will move a Patriot missile battery into the Middle East to counter threats from Iran.The UAE says four commercial ships off its eastern coast \u0027were subjected to sabotage operations\u0027.Yemen\u0027s Houthi rebels launch a drone attack on Saudi Arabia, striking a major oil pipeline and taking it out of service.Saudi Arabia blames Iran for the drone attack on its pipeline.A rocket lands near the US embassy in the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, without harming anyone. It\u0027s not clear who is behind the attack, but after the initial reports, Donald Trump tweets: \u0027If Iran wants to fight, that will be the official end of Iran. Never threaten the United States again!\u0027Semi-official media in Iran report it has quadrupled production of the low-enriched uranium used for civilian applications. Iran is allowed to enrich uranium, but increased production could lead it to exceed the stockpile limits in the nuclear deal.Senior Pentagon officer Vice-admiral Michael Gilday says the US has a high degree of confidence that Iran\u0027s Revolutionary Guards were responsible for the explosions on the four tankers in the Gulf of Oman.Saudi Arabia\u0027s King Salman hosts high-level summits in Mecca. He calls on the international community to use all means to confront Iran and accuses them of being behind \u0027terrorist operations\u0027 that targeted Saudi oil interests.Saudi Arabia says 26 people were wounded in an attack by Yemen\u0027s Houthi rebels on an airport in the kingdom\u0027s south-western town of Abha.Two oil tankers near the strategic strait of Hormuz were reportedly attacked in an assault that left one ablaze and adrift as 44 sailors were evacuated from both vessels and the US navy assisted.Iran’s Revolutionary Guards say they have shot down what they called a US \u0027spy\u0027 drone they claim was flying in in the country’s airspace. The US military confirm one of its drones has been taken down, but say it was in international airspace.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspA treasury statement said eight senior commanders of the navy, aerospace and ground forces components of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) were also being targeted.“These commanders sit atop a bureaucracy that supervises the IRGC’s malicious regional activities, including its provocative ballistic missile program, harassment and sabotage of commercial vessels in international waters, and its destabilizing presence in Syria,” the statement said.Trump said he was willing to pursue dialogue with Tehran without preconditions, but the sanctions appear to make such talks even less likely, at least in the short term, particular if the US follows through its threat to sanction Zarif.The Iranian ambassador to the UN, Majid Takht-Ravanchi, said: “No one in clear mind can have a dialogue with somebody who is threatening you with sanctions as long as that is still there is no way we can have a dialogue.”Ravanchi instead urged the UN secretary general, Antonio Guterres, to broker regional talks involving Iran and its neighbours.Khamenei and his family are said to control a business empire worth tens of billions of dollars.“The supreme leader’s office has enriched itself at the expense of the Iranian people,” the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said. “It sits atop a vast network of tyranny and corruption that deprives the Iranian people of the freedom and opportunity they deserve.”Tension has been mounting in the Gulf since Trump withdrew the US from a multilateral deal in which Iran accepted strict limits on its nuclear programme in return for sanctions. Those tensions have culminated in the sabotaging of tankers in the Persian Gulf, and the shooting down of a US drone on Thursday. Trump ordered airstrikes in reprisal, but then cancelled them.“I think a lot of restraint has been shown by us, and that doesn’t mean we’re going to show it in the future,” Trump said on Monday.When confirming he had aborted the attack on Iran on Friday, Trump had said he would be imposing new sanctions, but he said the measures against Khamenei and others were not specifically linked to the downing of the Global Hawk drone.“You could probably add that into this” he said, but added: “This was something that was going to happen anyway.”Earlier on Monday Brian Hook, the US special envoy on Iran, said he had been holding extensive talks with US allies in the wake of the Gulf of Oman tanker attacks, when two vessels were damaged by explosions. He believed a global coalition to protect shipping was required.“There have been too many attacks. We could have had an environmental disaster and extensive loss of life due to reckless Iranian provocations,” he said.Hook said the G20 summit this week in Japan would be a good forum for discussions. As many as 17 countries had been adversely effected by the recent tanker attacks either directly or through crew, insurance or contracts, he said, and an international force might isolate Iran diplomatically as well as make it more perilous for Tehran or its surrogates to mount further attacks.Iran has denied responsibility for the blasts.Hook, seen as one of the hawks on Iran inside the US administration, said Tehran faced a choice: “They can either start coming to the negotiating table or they can watch their economy continue to crumble.”Tensions with Iran have been mounting since Donald Trump withdrew the US from the 2015 nuclear deal last year and began applying pressure on Tehran through economic sanctions.Trump tweeted that other countries, including China and Japan, should protect their own oil tankers in the Middle East. “Why are we protecting the shipping lanes for other countries … for zero compensation,” he wrote.Meanwhile, the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, met Saudi Arabia’s king and crown prince for talks on Monday as the US sought to promote an anti-Iran alliance.“You are a dear friend,” King Salman told Pompeo, who was due to fly to the United Arab Emirates later on Monday for further discussions.Iran has said it will not enter into discussions until sanctions are lifted. The fresh round of US sanctions is however an attempt to force the Iranian leadership to hold talks with the US. A near-total ban on oil exports is already in place.A drone strike on an airport in Saudi Arabia by Iranian-aligned Houthi rebels, which left one person dead and 21 injured, will have coloured the mood among Gulf states. It follows another attack on 12 June.Hook is also to meet officials from Britain, France and Germany this week, but declined to say what pressure he will putting on those countries to follow the US out of the nuclear deal with Iran if, as Tehran has threatened, it breaches its permitted uranium enrichment stock levels on Thursday.The EU has the choice of either putting the issue in the nuclear deal dispute mechanism, or threatening its own retaliatory measures.Germany appeared cool towards US talk of building a global coalition against Iran. A foreign ministry spokesman said on Monday that Berlin had “taken note via the media” of Pompeo’s comments and added that “our top aim is and remains a de-escalation of the serious situation”.Hook claimed the EU was being subjected to nuclear blackmail by Iran, and claimed Iran had rejected the opportunity to take various diplomatic “off-ramps” in the past year.The UK, France and Germany are urging Tehran to wait for European countries to set up the much-delayed financial mechanism designed to help businesses in Europe trade with Iran, circumventing secondary US sanctions. Iran saw an increase in trade as one of the key benefits of the deal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f423eac20418020498f4959425538dba58df37f3/0_172_5392_3236/master/5392.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b9788ec3edf22d96c12f0d01f392bc30","title":"sanders student loan debt plan","story":"Democratic presidential candidate proposes to pay for plan, which would cost $2.2tn over next decade, through a tax on Wall Street Bernie Sanders on Monday introduced legislation to eliminate the entire $1.6tn in student loan debt owed by 45 million Americans.The Vermont senator announced the move as he vies for the Democratic presidential nomination in a primary contest marked by sweeping economic proposals.This initiative builds on Sanders’ previous higher education plan, and would make two- and four-year public colleges and universities tuition-free and debt-free. The plan would cost $2.2tn over the next decade, a figure Sanders proposes to pay through a tax on Wall Street.“This is truly a revolutionary proposal which accomplishes three major goals,” Sanders said in Washington on Monday.“In a highly competitive global economy, it makes certain that all Americans, regardless of income, can get the college education or job training they need to secure decent-paying jobs by making public colleges, universities and trade schools tuition-free and debt-free.”Sanders was joined in his new effort by congresswomen Ilhan Omar and Pramila Jayapal, who have introduced parallel legislation in the House.“Free college tuition” was a hallmark of Sanders’ insurgent campaign for the Democratic nomination against Hillary Clinton in 2016 and it remains a priority as he faces increasingly tough competition from his closest ideological rival, Elizabeth Warren.Sanders’ plan is decidedly more ambitious than the one introduced by the Massachusetts senator, who has built momentum in the primary race by steadily introducing new policy ideas.Warren’s plan would cancel most student loan debt and also eliminate undergraduate tuition at public colleges and universities. Under the Warren plan, $50,000 in student loan debt would be eliminated for every person with a household income of less than $100,000.The issue of student debt and the cost of college has become central and contested in the Democratic primary, with most leading candidates addressing it in some form. Sanders and Warren have presented by far the most detailed proposals.As the first Democratic debates approach, Warren has closed the gap on Sanders in national and state polling.

Gone are the days when couples would be satisfied with a single black and white photo to commemorate their weddingChinese couples used to be satisfied with a single black and white photograph taken on their wedding as a memento of their special day. But times have changed dramatically, and the wedding photographs, especially pre-wedding photo sessions, have become big business in China.In the main touristic spots in different cities across China, it is easy to see couples having their pre-wedding photoshoots, which become the must-have for every Chinese couple before their marriage. Unlike western weddings, where couples usually have their photos taken on their wedding day, for Chinese people it is quite popular to have their day-long photo sessions way before their actual weddings. Sometimes it can be half a year or even a year in advance of the ceremony.Some couples even choose other countries for their pre-wedding sessions. Often for their photoshoots couples go for traditionally romantic cities such as Paris.Those who can’t afford such a trip to have pre-wedding photos with the Eiffel Tower can have their photo taken in front of Chinese replicas of the main world’s tourist sites.Other couples prefer more traditional outdoor locations, like Beijing’s Hutong neighbourhood, or to be surrounded by nature like in Dali, where lots of couples do their pre-wedding photography next to Lake Erhai.These sessions can range in price from a few hundred up to thousands of dollars, with companies providing clients with everything from outfits to makeup and transportation. Brides typically have at least three dress changes per shoot. Inspired by the traditional western style, many choose a flowing white wedding dress, a Chinese-style red gown, and something more modern.The shoots are just one part of a booming industry in China. A wedding for most newly married couples can run from 50,000 yuan (£5,700) to 200,000 yuan, with larger amounts not uncommon in big cities like Beijing or Shanghai. China’s wedding industry was valued at 1.46tn yuan in 2017, and it is expected to grow to 3tn yuan by 2021."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/994e0064395501366d07a5546fa8999b58d28818/26_0_1483_890/master/1483.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=99a777f5c487fd3ccb4755b547d47b82","title":"google toronto smart city sidewalk project alphabet redevelopment","story":"Stakeholders say unanswered questions remain over scale of Sidewalk Labs’ hi-tech redevelopment scheme for city’s waterfrontThe Google sister company behind a controversial, hi-tech redevelopment scheme for a swath of Toronto’s waterfront has released the first detailed outline of an ambitious project, but stakeholders say that unanswered questions remain over data collection and the scale of the plan.The 1,500-page plan unveiled in Toronto on Monday reveals that Sidewalk Labs intends to spend C$1.3bn (US$900m) on the project that will involve “raincoats for buildings”, heated and illuminated sidewalks, affordable housing, tall timber structures and innovations to support sustainability and environmentalism.It claims the 77-hectare (190.19-acre) project – valued at C$3.9bn – will create 44,000 jobs, generate C$4.3bn in annual tax revenues and add C$14.2bn annually in gross domestic product for Canada.The plan shows Sidewalk hopes to earn money from real estate (including rental income, condominium sales and the sale of buildings), the deployment of its technology and payments – probably from the government – for hitting performance and growth targets.About five acres, known as Quayside, and another 7.8 hectares (19.27 acres) called Villiers West will be developed by Sidewalk Labs and local partners, yet to be named. If innovations piloted there are successful, Sidewalk Labs will give the government the option to expand them to a surrounding parcel of 64.2 hectares (158.57 acres).That scope has prompted questions from Waterfront Toronto, an organization formed by Canada’s three levels of government whose stamp of approval Sidewalk Labs needs to move forward. Waterfront Toronto requested for proposals for the land and awarded Sidewalk Labs the chance to develop a plan for it in late 2017.Waterfront Toronto’s board chair, Stephen Diamond, said Sidewalk Lab’s plan is “impressive” but said he was still seeking more information than the plan provides.“The scale and size of the project does raise some serious issues for us,” he said. “We should be looking for support first on Quayside.”Despite Waterfront Toronto’s worries about the plan, Sidewalk Lab’s CEO Dan Doctoroff told the  he is confident he can earn its approval and that of three levels of government, which need to sign off on his proposal for it to become a reality.“My expectation is that we will be able to work through the issues,” he said. “If I didn’t think that then I certainly wouldn’t waste our time moving forward.”If there are objections to the plan, there is room for change, he acknowledged, but said if the project can’t meet goals Sidewalk Labs sets for sustainability, mobility and economic growth then “we are not interested” because “this doesn’t make sense anymore”.He said he was unsurprised by the feedback he has heard so far.“If we really want to create a new path for inclusive, urban growth, you can’t just wave a wand and say it would be nice to do this,” he said. “You really have to think through the problems.”Some of those problems have been raised by Jim Balsillie, a former Blackberry CEO who previously authored scathing editorials about Sidewalk Labs’ intellectual property and data proposals. Balsillie has dismissed Sidewalk Lab’s plan as a “grab for more land, more power and more control” that follows “an ugly 18-month public relations charade that weaponized ambiguity”.“This is not a road map for a smart city, it’s an assault on our democracy,” he wrote in an email to the .The project has long been a lightning rod for criticism, even attracting a petition calling for Waterfront Toronto to head back to reset the process and seek new proposals for the land.The project was already a lightning rod for criticism before Diamond’s remarks.Several high-profile members of a board established to guide the project have resigned, while others have questioned Sidewalk Lab’s hope to earn a fraction of property taxes and development fees in exchange for building a transit line to the neighbourhood and funding underground infrastructure.Critics have also questioned how Sidewalk Labs will capture and use data in the neighbourhood and how intellectual property rights will be handled.Sidewalk Labs has indicated data collected by cameras and sensors throughout the neighbourhood could be used to help create new technologies, develop efficiencies in city planning and aid sustainability efforts.According to the plan released on Monday, the company will use an independent data trust that would set the rules around data use, make it accessible and offer privacy protections. The trust would also ensure Sidewalk Labs does not receive any special status or rights when it comes to data access.Sidewalk Labs also vowed in the plan not to sell personal information, use such info for advertising or disclose the data to third parties without explicit consent.Diamond said Waterfront Toronto would like more information on data collection and use and digital governance and will continue reviewing the plan and seeking public feedback in the coming weeks.The plan will need approval from three levels of government in addition to Waterfront Toronto and construction probably would not start until 2022.Doctoroff said Sidewalk Labs will also spend more time listening to the public and working with government to reach approval. If the project moves ahead, construction probably would not start until 2022."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3936361.1561410687!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"without consent five women who had gynaecological work to be contacted","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSt Luke’s Hospital, Kilkenny. Once the issue became known, the hospital stopped the tests, seized the equipment and informed the patients.  Women who underwent gynaecological “exploratory work” without their consent at St Luke’s Hospital, Kilkenny, are being contacted by the hospital group about the incident.Ireland East Hospital Group is in the process of contacting the five women in relation to the incident, which happened nine months ago. The women are being told they will be briefed on the contents of a report into the matter before it is published.Minister for Health Simon Harris said on Monday evening that his officials have sought assurances from the hospital group that the women’s care needs are being met.“The Department of Health has been advised by the HSE of a review of hysteroscopy procedures in St Luke’s Hospital, Kilkenny. The HSE has stated that the review and its recommendations are being considered by the Ireland East Hospital Group. It is important to await the outcome of this process and the Department is engaging with the HSE in this regard,” he said. Appealing for the privacy of those involved to be respected, Mr Harris said his immediate concern was for the patients involved. ‘Open disclosure’“The HSE has advised that open disclosure has taken place with all patients involved.”The hospital group says it received the report by gynaecologists Prof Donal Brennan of UCD and Dr William Boyd of the Mater Hospital late last week.Prof Ray O’Sullivan, the obstetrician at St Luke’s who carried out the tests, has said he did not feel he needed to obtain consent beforehand. The hospital maintains he should have obtained consent, has sought his suspension and has reported the matter to the Medical Council. The tests were stopped last September after nursing staff raised concerns over whether the required consents had been obtained from a hospital ethics committee and from the patients themselves.The tests involved flushing the vaginas of the women with water, inserting a miniature scope for monitoring and measuring the pressure within the vagina. The equipment involved, including tubes and pressure gauges, was brought in from outside the hospital.Speaking to The  on Sunday, Prof O’Sullivan said the issue “had more to do with preliminary, exploratory work – as to whether you need consent for that before you engage in an actual clinical trial. It was more technical than anything else”.Asked if he felt he needed consent, he replied: “I felt I didn’t need consent. I didn’t because we weren’t actually doing the research. We were just seeing if a particular procedure that we were planning on doing as part of the research could be done”.Stopped the testsOnce the issue became known, the hospital stopped the tests, seized the equipment and informed the patients, who were told investigations into the matter would be completed within weeks.Prof O’Sullivan stressed that no patients were harmed, adding “they didn’t even know it’s been done”. “You can’t innovate within the HSE without having to mind your Ps and Qs,” he said.In a statement, the Ireland East Hospital Group said its chief executive had commissioned a review of “a research study undertaken in Kilkenny Hospital on the hysteroscopy procedure”. It said the chief executive was carefully considering the review’s findings and any recommendations or actions arising from it would be implemented fully “having regard for due process”. “Arising from the media coverage of the issue today, IEHG contacted the patients comprehended by the study today to share the findings and to provide information and reassurance.” "},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Referees\u0026rsquo society condemns \u0026lsquoepidemic\u0026rsquo of poor treatment of match officialsIrish businessman claims he is a non-resident as he is based in MaltaPatients to be briefed on contents of report before it is publishedDeath of two pregnant patients prompted outside investigations into St Luke\u0026rsquos Hospital, KilkennyEntire Killarney system backed up last year causing sewage to flow into a local riverCompany to tell TDs it can do rollout much cheaper than \u0026euro5bn National Broadband PlanProf Kinsella will suggest the introduction of new \u0026ldquofiscal stress tests in order to better prepare for a downturnHeavy rain to be replaced by sunshine this week, with temperatures to reach up to 27 degreesDutch cycling expert measured air pollution in Dublin at three times Utrecht levelDisabled parking bay is the first of four planned spots, with two more due to open before SeptemberNo major complaints from teachers about Monday\u0026rsquos examsGovernment facing budget deficit if UK crashes out of EUTrio who were working as gamekeepers convicted over animal\u0026rsquos death in Co WaterfordTributes paid to \u0026lsquoleading light\u0026rsquo in Irish motorsportUK to crash out of EU in October, predicts Douglas CarswellWomen\u0026rsquos council calls for State survey into sexual violence to include analysis of dating appsBord Plean\u0026aacutela says proposed 222 units would fail to provide acceptable living environmentMark Menezes says Ireland should switch to liquified natural gas (LNG) and nuclear"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3935980.1561390158!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"inquiry into kerry sewer network after major blockage","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA toxic blue-green ‘algae’ appeared last year on Killarney’s largest lake, Lough Leane. Photograph: FacebookThe entire sewer network in Killarney, Co Kerry, is to be investigated in response to a major blockage that led to sewage backing up and flowing into a river last year. Irish Water and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said the “significant” blockage on April 30th of last year was in the main caused by a piece of timber and exacerbated by fats, oils grease and baby wipes building up in an overflow chamber linked to the main sewer. The incident, which occurred between Woodlawn and Muckross, led to the main public sewer backing up and sewage entering the river Flesk near Lough Leane without passing through the local water treatment plant.Warnings about toxic algal scum have been erected on the lake shore in recent weeks after the death of a dog from suspected poisoning encountered along the Deenagh river, a major tributary of Lough Leane, which is the largest of Killarney’s lakes.Kerry County Council said blue-green algae had been detected and the signs were a precautionary measure. However, Irish Water and the council both insisted the Killarney waste water treatment plan was working well.BlockageThe EPA sent an inspector to the site of the blockage and it later raised a concern about the wider sewer network in Killarney. It issued Irish Water with instructions after discovering there was no screen at the storm water chambersump near the Flesk.The “series of requirements” posed by the EPA to Irish Water included to establish if there were any other storm water chamberssumps in Co Kerry similar to that which saw the discharges into the river and to “ensure that they are part of a proactive inspection and maintenance programme”.Irish Water have also been told to carry out a cleaning programme and install “high-level alarms” in the storm water chamber concerned.Irish Water said the Killarney treatment plant was “operating in full compliance with its wastewater discharge licence and other environmental regulations”. It said no overflow issues had been reported recently in the area and that the operation of all sewers was monitored on an ongoing basis. It asked to public to contact it should any overflows be seen.Future investment“Irish Water, working in partnership with Kerry County Council, has commenced a project, which includes surveying the condition of the existing sewer network in Killarney as part of a longer-term project to determine what future investment is required to improve their operational functionality,” the utility firm said.Irish Water added that this was the first time surveys of this scale were being carried out and that they will allow Irish Water to assess the capacity, condition and performance level of the sewer network.The latest EPA survey of the lakes of Killarney, which was carried out between 2016 and last year, found the overall water quality in the three lakes was moderate to good."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3936296.1561408437!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"donohoe to table tight budget as cash set aside for no deal brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Finance Paschal Donohoe: there will be limited room on budget day for any additional spending or tax measures beyond those already signalled. Photograph: PA   A no-deal Brexit would push the Government towards running an overall budget deficit next year as opposed to a small surplus if the UK leaves the EU in an orderly fashion.Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe will outline the consequences of a no-deal Brexit on the State finances alongside forecasts in the case of Britain leaving the EU with a deal when he publishes the summer economic statement on Tuesday, one of the initial steps in the annual budget process.Government sources said a no-deal Brexit will turn an expected surplus into a deficit in the “range” of “up to” 1.5 per cent for next year.It is expected there will be roughly €2.8 billion in extra money to spend in the budget, of which some €2 billion-€2.2 billion has already been committed in capital spending, public sector pay rises and demographic changes.This means there will be limited room on budget day for any additional spending or tax measures beyond those already signalled.The budget will be delivered on October 8th and the UK is due to leave the EU on October 31st. It is also before a possibly crucial EU summit on October 17th and 18th, which may decide on the Brexit issue.While Taoiseach Leo Varadkar is expected to make a decision in September on whether a deal or a no-deal exit is more likely, the budget will be framed to fit both outcomes.Too generousThe Government want to avoid introducing measures that are too generous and would have to be rescinded if Britain crashes out of the bloc.The other scenario Mr Donohoe is said to be keen to avoid is having a second budget, which is seen as sending a signal of uncertainty. The intention is to table a tight budget that would leave money for increased supports in sectors such as agriculture if there is a no-deal Brexit.Michael McGrath, the Fianna Fáil finance spokesman, who will negotiate the budget with Mr Donohoe, said there was a need to “hold some resources in reserve” and that a “cautious approach” was needed.He said a no-deal Brexit would require “targeted intervention to support certain sectors of the economy that are most exposed”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3936275.1561411055!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eir says it can install rural broadband for less than 1bn","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tCarolan Lennon, the company’s chief executive, will tell the Oireachtas communications committee that “it is clear to us that we can build rural fibre infrastructure at a lower cost than is currently envisaged in the plans”. Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollins Eir will today tells TDs and Senators that it could complete the National Broadband Plan for less than €1 billion, just a third of the sum the State has agreed to invest in the project and a fifth of the estimated final cost. Carolan Lennon, the company’s chief executive, will tell the Oireachtas communications committee that “it is clear to us that we can build rural fibre infrastructure at a lower cost than is currently envisaged in the plans”.“Eir could complete the NBP, based on Eir’s approach to the 300k rural rollout, for under €1 billion,” she will tell the committee, which is holding a series of hearings into the plan to connect some 540,000 rural properties to high-speed internet. The 300k reference is to eir’s current project which aims to make broadband available to more than 300,000 rural homes on a commercial basis. She will also say in her statement that the removal of these 300,000 premises “should have led to a reduction in the overall subsidy” for the National Broadband Plan.Despite reservations among senior civil servants about the affordability, the Cabinet last month approved the plan, which, when private investment is included, is expected to cost some €5 billion. The State is investing up to €3 billion in the plan. Successful bidderMs Lennon will also question whether the gap funding model used by the Department of Communications to deliver the plan is appropriate. This model will see the successful bidder for the contract, a consortium led by Granahan McCourt, rather than the State take ownership of the network at the end of the process. She will say that the model “failed to deliver a competitive outcome” for the procurement process and that “this need not have been the case had different choices been made along the way”. Other models could have delivered broadband “faster and cheaper than the existing process”, Ms Lennon will say. Eir withdrew as a bidder for the contract in January of last year citing “significant commercial issues and a complexity within the tender process”. ‘Driven up costs’Committee members will be told that Granahan McCourt has decided not to use the infrastructure eir built for its 300k plan but to “duplicate” work it has already done which she says “has driven up the costs and associated subsidy”. Ms Lennon will tell the committee that after eir withdrew from the process, its then chief executive Richard Moat wrote to then minister for communications Denis Naughten “outlining our reasons for leaving the process but also offering to discuss with the department alternative ways of achieving the Government’s stated policy objectives”. In a statement in response to Ms Carolan’s comments, a Department of Communications spokeswoman said: “There were two draft bids received in September 2017 at an advanced stage in the NBP procurement process - one from Eir and one from National Broadband Ireland (who were appointed preferred bidder). Both bids were broadly similar in terms of the level of State subsidy sought, with Eir’s bid coming in as multiples of €1 billion.” "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/05/17/TELEMMGLPICT000147339863_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"judges given new expenses policy telegraph discovers judiciary","story":"The Ministry of Justice approved expenses including shampoo and crockery.  Lord Chief Justice, Lord Ian Burnett, pictured, claimed for multiple journeys to and from his homeMinistry of JusticeThe judiciary are to be given a new expenses policy after The Daily  found that Britain\u0027s most senior judges have claimed for crockery, shampoo and a taxi to transport ceremonial robes on taxpayer-funded expenses.Expenses data released under the Freedom of Information Act shows how some of the most high-profile members of the judiciary in England and Wales have had claims for everyday items as well first-class trains approved, even though they receive a salary of at least £180,000.At present, judges are encouraged to follow the expenses policy for Ministry of Justice (MOJ) civil servants, and the judiciary has also set out specific guidance relating to travel, accommodation and relocation....To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Ministry of JusticeDemocrats 2020: Eric Swalwell, the former prosecutor ready to take on the US gun lobbyRoyal Family doubles carbon footprint for travel thanks to worldwide tours by charter planeBritain\u0026#39s new F35 stealth jets used on operations for the first timeWomen in the top jobs less likely to be Oxbridge graduates than male colleagues, research revealsYou cannot be \u0026#39too clean\u0026#39 health experts warn, in bid to debunk mythsFast food outlets will be able to get tax cuts by offering customers salad Public paid £2.4m to renovate Duke and Duchess of Sussex\u0026#39s Frogmore CottageComment: The safety of our children is my most important responsibilityToday\u0026#39s pensioners are earning more than double the income of the elderly 20 years agoPrisoners should be required to work 40 hours a week behind bars, says study to be backed by ministersSajid Javid attacks tech giants over encryption plans that will \u0026#39put our children in danger\u0026#39Men\u0026#39s fertility irreversibly damaged by age of 18 thanks to Western junk food diet, study findsJeremy Hunt pledges extra £15bn for defence to ensure Britain can guard against Russian threatBoris Johnson defends his right to privacy and insists he is not trying to \u0026#39have it both ways\u0026#39 with \u0026#39staged\u0026#39 photoNHS trust baby deaths review uncovers hundreds of new casesDrug addict who pushed former Eurotunnel boss onto Tube tracks jailed for lifeThe inside story of the \u0026#39staged\u0026#39 Boris Johnson and Carrie Symonds picture Comment: No frontrunner can take victory for granted.

Wangige is hardly Helmand, nor, by his own admission, did counterinsurgency work particularly well in either Afghanistan or Iraq.Ex-major Wayne Hennessy-Barrett, 46, served in Afghanistan, Bosnia, Kosovo and Iraq before founding 4G in 2013 in KenyaYet the traditional “microfinance” model of lending to the poor was not working either, Mr Hennessy-Barrett reckoned. Once a buzzword in development circles, microfinance has been hailed by its proponents as a powerful tool in fighting poverty. Tony Blair and Bill Clinton were both fans.The idea was simple enough. Many poor people in the developing world eke out a living as petty traders, but rarely have access to the credit needed to grow their businesses.Microfinance was meant to give them that access through  small loans and low-cost banking services, setting them on the path to self-sufficiency. The model has gone global in recent decades: more than 200m people round the world have been the recipients of “microcredit”.The miracle has largely failed to happen, however. While disagreements about the impact of microfinance abound, studies have suggested that the model has largely failed to lift the poor out of poverty. Many, indeed, have been left worse off because they have been plunged into debt.Mr Hennessy-Barrett reckons the problem largely lies with the model used by most microfinanciers. To keep overheads down, many companies lend through mobile phone apps and have little interaction with their clients or knowledge of what the money is going to be spent on.Wayne Hennessy-Barrett at a market in WangigeOften cash is borrowed to cover unexpected crises, such as funerals and medical operations. Reflecting a growing problem in Kenya, loans to cover online gambling are also increasing, according to government officials.Lacking a sufficient or regular enough income to pay back the loans, many default. More than one million people have been blacklisted by the country’s two main credit ratings, sometimes over loans of less than £5.Credit alone, Mr Hennessy-Barrett realised, was likely to do more harm than good. Only if people borrowed sensibly, and understood how to turn loans into larger incomes, would they have a chance of escaping poverty rather than being sucked deeper into it.“Just shoving money at people is not enough,” he said. “Having a loan to solve a problem is not enough. What you need is a livelihood where you can use credit for leverage. When it it just to live it is a recipe for poverty.“Cheap debt pushed carelessly at poor people keeps poor people poor.”Valentine Nasila, Operations Manager at 4G Capital\u0026#39s head office, speaks with a clientThere was no question in his mind that microcredit was still the key to fighting poverty. In a country where formal jobs are few and far between, three in four working Kenyans are self-employed, scratching a living by selling goods to other poor people.Yet if poor borrowers were to have a chance of success, he concluded, they would need much more face-to-face support from trained professionals who understood the needs and challenges of their clients.It was in attempting to meet this need that Mr Hennessy-Barrett drew on his army experience. In Afghanistan, the British army’s counterinsurgency operations were designed to deny insurgents ground by protecting communities, creating the conditions to let them live normal lives and speaking to people to understand their needs and reassure them.Such skills could also be deployed in peacetime environments, he felt. From the time of its foundation in a small office in Wangige in 2013, his company, 4G Capital, would run along army lines.Wayne Hennessy-Barrett\u0026#39s business is one of Africa’s fastest growing financial technology companies“In Afghanistan we had several teams of elite soldiers operating in multiple places, communing with the population, trying to understand their needs,” he said.“That led to a methodology of having small teams of well-trained, dedicated professionals.”From the outset, Mr Hennessy-Barrett deployed his staff in teams of four and sent them to trawl through the markets using his own interpretation of the army’s “patrol trinity”.In counterinsurgency terms, this meant “intelligence gathering”, “framework protection” and “local assurance”. For 4G, this was reinterpreted as “marketing”, “lending” and “growth and repayment”. Teams would seek to understand the environment they were operating in, lend to iniduals after learning what their needs were and finally helping them to grow their businesses so they could repay their loans.The loans on offer were small, between £40 and £400, and had to be repaid within a month, the intention being to enforce discipline and focus money where it was needed: replenishing inventory, adding stock and growing businesses.Crucially, it also came with basic training, teaching clients how to maximise growth potential, keep books and improve customer care. The mixture of personal attention and computer algorithms to assess the viability of clients’ growth potential means that 92 percent of loans are paid on time, meaning the company has more money to lend.The model appears to have been phenomenally successful. From its original outlet in Wangige, 4G Capital now has 70 more, with more than 300 employees. Expanding into Rwanda and Uganda, it is one of Africa’s fastest growing financial technology companies. It expects to lend £47 million over the next 12 months.Optometrist Tabitha Njeri, 26, borrowed £80 from 4G Capital to start her own optician\u0026#39s storeThe success, Mr Hennessy-Barrett says, has come from “slaving” the company’s fortunes to the fortunes of its clients. It is doing well because its clients have seen their businesses grow on average by 82 per cent since taking their first loan from 4G.Tabitha Njeri, who runs a small optician’s shop in Wangige, is one such beneficiary. 4G lent her £80 towards her startup costs early last year, gave her training in accountancy and business growth skills and rolled over loans to allow her to increase stock from 50 to 150 glasses. She now plans to expand by opening a diagnosis lab.“I used to find it very difficult to raise enough to support my family,” she said. “Now I can. I have financial stability.”Down the road, Patrick Ngore, who runs a chemist’s, says he has been able to increase stock sevenfold with loans from the company. He also credits training in stock management and minimising expenditure in growing his profit margins from 20 to 40 per cent.Others in Wangige tell similar stories.In many ways, the 4G model, although partially reliant on technology,  is a return to the basics of microfinance. Loans have allowed Patrick Ngore, owner of a chemists,to increase his stock sevenfold and boost his profit margin from 20 per cent to 40 per centThe founder of modern microfinance is generally held to be Mohammed Yunus, who started making small loans to the very poor in Bangladesh in 1976. Lending mostly to women, who formed small groups that were collectively responsible for each other’s debts, he found that astonishingly few defaulted.His Grameen Bank has now made more than £7 billion pounds in small loans to the poor, an achievement that secured him the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006.Yet the microfinance model he pioneered would grow increasingly troubled. Irresponsible and often predatory lending to the poor led to debt crises in Bosnia, Morocco and parts of Pakistan. It also contributed to a debtors’ revolt in Nicaragua in 2008 when farmers, backed by President Daniel Ortega, refused en masse to pay back microcredit loans. A microfinance default crisis in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh two years later was blamed for a surge in suicide by farmers.Geoffrey Kamanu runs through a finance training programme with staff from 4G Capital The longstanding problem with microfinance, which is largely driven by private companies like 4G, is that business logic often leads to aggressive tactics in collecting debts, says David Roodman, author of the book Due Diligence: An Impertinent Inquiry into Microfinance.In countries like Kenya many microfinance outfits lend at interest rates as high as 30 per cent because they are forced to raise capital from commercial banks, often placing an intolerable burden on poor borrowers.Mr Hennessy-Barrett says his model is addressing those concerns: interest rates are capped at 13.5 per cent and allowances are made for “bad-luck customers” who encounter unexpected setbacks like illness or a death in the family.Experts in Kenya generally applaud 4G Capital’s model, which has been mimicked by one or two other outfits. But they also raise questions about what impact it can really have.Microcredit | Transforming fortunes and futures in NepalDespite its growth, 4G and its 120,000 customers are still pretty small fry, says Paul Musoke, director of financial institutions at FSD Africa, a UK-funded organisation that looks at ways to financially empower the poor.By contrast, M-Shwari and Tala, two providers of small loans through mobile phone apps, have 11 million between them in Kenya alone. Such “light-touch” models, which use technology rather than people to engage with borrowers are always likely to do better than “heavy-touch” approaches like Mr Hennessy-Barrett’s — except in densely populated countries like Bangladesh.“It makes sense what he is trying to do,” says Mr Musoke. “The question is whether it can be scaled up significantly to make an impact.”The other danger in Kenya is that a microfinance “debt bubble” risks being created because, in a poorly regulated market, there is little to stop poor borrowers from taking loans from 4G and other companies offering unsecured credit at the same time.Microfinancing: revolutionising the health and livelihoods of Nepalese women“The greatest potential for harm has come when you have multiple lenders all growing at once because then almost certainly people are borrowing from one to pay the other,” says Mr Roodman.Mr Hennessy-Barrett’s model seems enlightened, yet it is too soon to tell how effective it will be. History suggests that microcredit often stimulates start-up businesses, but ultimately fails to enrich its owners, becoming more a tool helping to manage poverty than to reduce it. Mr Roodman likens it to a prescription drug “useful in moderation but dangerous in large doses”.While it may not be a panacea, microfinance has given people more choice, whatever the overall risks. If Mr Hennessy-Barrett can tweak a flawed model and encourage others to follow suit, he could yet prove as successful pioneer as Mohammed Yunus.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Banks and FinanceDemocrats 2020: Eric Swalwell, the former prosecutor ready to take on the US gun lobbyRoyal Family doubles carbon footprint for travel thanks to worldwide tours by charter planeBritain\u0026#39s new F35 stealth jets used on operations for the first timeWomen in the top jobs less likely to be Oxbridge graduates than male colleagues, research revealsYou cannot be \u0026#39too clean\u0026#39 health experts warn, in bid to debunk mythsFast food outlets will be able to get tax cuts by offering customers salad Public paid £2.4m to renovate Duke and Duchess of Sussex\u0026#39s Frogmore CottageComment: The safety of our children is my most important responsibilityToday\u0026#39s pensioners are earning more than double the income of the elderly 20 years agoPrisoners should be required to work 40 hours a week behind bars, says study to be backed by ministersSajid Javid attacks tech giants over encryption plans that will \u0026#39put our children in danger\u0026#39Men\u0026#39s fertility irreversibly damaged by age of 18 thanks to Western junk food diet, study findsJeremy Hunt pledges extra £15bn for defence to ensure Britain can guard against Russian threatBoris Johnson defends his right to privacy and insists he is not trying to \u0026#39have it both ways\u0026#39 with \u0026#39staged\u0026#39 photoNHS trust baby deaths review uncovers hundreds of new casesDrug addict who pushed former Eurotunnel boss onto Tube tracks jailed for lifeThe inside story of the \u0026#39staged\u0026#39 Boris Johnson and Carrie Symonds picture Comment: No frontrunner can take victory for granted.

You mean I can no longer bring a six pack of Belgian beer back home in my bag after a trip to Brussels? Is there a way to convince them to change?Maurits Wever said: That\u0027s a pity. We\u0027re going on holiday to the Scottish islands of Arran and Islay. We wanted to buy some local whiskies, but these aren\u0027t allowed on @Eurostar.Rail expert Mark Smith, founder of Seat61, said Eurostar has quietly changed its luggage policy after previously having a fairly easygoing attitude to alcohol which saw only disruptive passengers and those travelling to ski destinations affected.He claimed it will be completely unnecessary to enforce the new measures on all trains.Eurostar has been around for over 20 years, he said. Why is (carrying alcohol) now a problem? I don\u0027t believe society has changed that much.There\u0027s an awful lot of people who are a bit shocked that they could be caught out. They\u0027re shocked that they won\u0027t be able to bring back a couple of bottles of nice wine from Paris or some fascinating Belgian beers from Brussels.He added: It\u0027s going to be inconvenient for a lot of passengers. It might not affect businessmen travelling first class who get (served) wine anyway, but it\u0027s going to be a pain in the neck.I think air travel is a bit of a pain in the neck a lot of the time and we need a bit of respite.A spokesman for Eurostar said its luggage policy was updated last autumn to maintain a pleasant environment on board for all our travellers.Passengers who want to transport prohibited alcohol are advised to use the firm\u0027s luggage service, which charges a minimum fee of £30 per item.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Most women who are successful are typically in their 50s - because that’s how long it’s taken us. We’re just starting to see change.”Karen Gill MBE, co-founder of Everywoman, an organisation which champions women’s career progression, added: “Whilst Oxford and Cambridge both admit relatively equal numbers of men and women it is interesting to see women flourishing in top roles without this elite educational background.“For 20 years we have campaigned to help women from all educational backgrounds advance in their chosen careers and reach senior levels.“Now business leaders must recognise the importance of ersity of thought, skills and experience to be relevant and competitive in today\u0027s world. It appears there is case to afford men from different educational backgrounds the same opportunities as women, getting away from the “old school tie network”.Oxbridge\u0026#039s lack of black students a \u0026#039staggering\u0026#039 failure, says universities ministerThe report’s authors say that the data reveals a pipeline from fee-paying schools through Oxbridge and into top jobs.Sir Peter Lampl, founder and executive chairman of the Sutton Trust, a charity which aims to improve social mobility, said that Britain is “an increasingly ided society”.Divided by politics, by class, by geography. Social mobility, the potential for those to achieve success regardless of their background, remains low. The report makes a number of recommendations in the report to ensure the talents of people from all backgrounds are made use of.These include tackling financial barriers to specific industries and professions, especially by paying internships of significant length, and adopting contextual recruitment and admissions practices.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

He was a lifelong “better off outer”, they said, who tempered his views during the referendum but then prevented Labour from opposing Brexit – thus ceding ground and millions of votes to the Liberal Democrats, Greens and nationalists. This is probably too simple. It seems more likely that Corbyn was always most interested in gaining power, but had a different view of the right way to go about it. Immediately after the referendum, for example, most Labour people thought it was right to accept the result and to press for a soft Brexit. And in the 2017 election, Labour’s policy of a “jobs-first Brexit”, combined with opposition to a no-deal exit, was no obstacle to a stunning electoral performance that deprived Theresa May of her majority.It was only last year – when The Independent started to campaign for a Final Say referendum – that Corbyn’s attempt to straddle Leave and Remain started to cause strains in the party. Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Steph Houghton celebrates with teammates after scoring England\u0027s first goal during the Women\u0027s World Cup round of 16 match against Cameroon at the Stade du Hainaut stadium in Valenciennes, FrancePride marchers at a rally outside the Scottish Parliament in EdinburghThe sun rises between the stones and over crowds at Stonehenge where people gather to celebrate the dawn of the longest day in the UK.

Labour did badly in the European elections, and yet managed to hold Peterborough in the by-election against a strong Brexit Party challenge. The New Statesman reports that one analysis prepared for the shadow cabinet suggested that Labour is losing votes in a 2:1:1 ratio to the Liberal Democrats, the Greens and the Brexit Party. In other words, for every one it loses to the Brexit Party, it loses three to the Remain parties. This suggests that Labour should take up a more explicitly Remain position – which is what Corbyn is now cautiously doing, although his Remainer critics will say it is too little, too late, and still allows the Lib Dems and the Greens to outflank the party on the pro-EU side. But Corbyn’s Leaver critics – the 26 MPs who signed a letter to him today opposing a new referendum – say that he risks the worst of both worlds: losing Leave voters on one side while failing to win Remain voters back on the other. This split is represented at the top of the party, with Ian Lavery, the party chair, posting an angry tweet this morning – which was presumably meant to be a private message – saying that the position of the shadow cabinet supporters of a referendum “really is to head for revoking Article 50”. On the other side, Emily Thornberry’s public support for a referendum exceeded the bounds of party policy, prompting Corbyn to demote her from her role deputising for him in the Commons (sending her to “re-education camp”, as the prime minister put it). She continued to press her case at the shadow cabinet meeting today. What is interesting is that Keir Starmer, assumed to be the leading organiser of Labour’s shift of position, has been less outspoken. Yet he has been drafting and redrafting the words of the policy as it has gradually evolved. The most important force behind the shift has been the views of party members. They are overwhelmingly in favour of a referendum, and of staying in the EU. They were fended off with a complicated policy at the party’s annual conference last year – the compromise once again drafted by Starmer. And the pressure from many of the trade unions – not including Unite, led by Corbyn’s ally Len McCluskey – has added to the feeling that the line could not be held.  In the end, the decisive voice will probably be that of John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor. He has consistently struck a tone more favourable to a second referendum than Corbyn’s, and he spoke at today’s shadow cabinet to say that opposition from members to the existing policy had become so great that it was time to change the party’s position. Despite briefing from the party’s spokespeople that Corbyn’s words to the shadow cabinet do not represent a change in policy, it seems there is no doubt that a policy shift is now under way.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They’re designed to be the equivalent of three A-levels for youngsters keen to embark on a technical rather than an academic path, and they have, in theory, been developed alongside employers.Why then is the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), members of which regularly complain about the difficulty they have when it comes to getting their hands on appropriately skilled employees, getting twitchy about them? Well, for a start, the results of a survey of 1,100 businesses reveal three-quarters either hadn’t heard of them, or recognised them by name only.The promised “revolution” is going to fizzle out faster than a fuse on a rainy day if employers, when confronted with a candidate brandishing a top-class T-level, say great, but what on earth does that mean? What are these T-level things anyway?Given how many haven’t heard of the new qualification, it’s no wonder 41 per cent of respondents told the BCC their businesses currently have no plans to offer placements. That’s a problem, because a 45-day placement with an employer is a key part of the programme. “The results reveal a clear communication void with business ahead of their roll-out,” the organisation says. The BCC believes the government needs to get its skates on for the new qualifications to succeed with their laudable aims. It has a point.Poor communication with business has bedevilled another flagship policy designed to help improve Britain’s lamentable record when it comes to training and the development of its workforce’s skills: the apprenticeship levy. The idea of it is sound. Employers with payrolls of more than £3m pay a 0.5 per cent charge, which is held in a digital fund that can be used to offset the cost of apprenticeship training. It’s also understandable that restrictions were placed on how it could be used to prevent them from gaming the system.Created with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 No deal, no tariffsThe government has announced that it would slash almost all tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

Flybe said it cancelled 994 flights in the three months to 31 March, compared to 372 in the same period last year.Business complaints further need to be considered against a backdrop of their own lack of investment in training without which the levy wouldn’t have been necessary. But when you have an insurer saying to the BCC that the measure has “effectively stolen” the industry’s investment into the Chartered Insurance Institute training scheme, resulting in fewer young people entering what is one of the UK’s biggest industries, it’s clear some of the complaints have merit and deserve a hearing.Other businesses have regularly raised issues of complex and unwieldy administration and a lack of suitable courses to spend their levy funds on. The BCC says there has been movement on some of the issues it has raised with respect to the scheme, but that it has been too slow. Part of that is inevitably down to Brexit and the general paralysis it has induced in government.Maths A-level exam paper leaked online for third year in rowThe apprenticeship levy is poisoning our economyBusiness leaders call for apprenticeship levy reformThe latter has contributed greatly to the current strained relations with the business community, which is having to deal with the impact of a policy with far-reaching implications. How it will be implemented remains completely up in the air.Combined with a high-handed approach, it is putting at risk the success of policies that might otherwise be seen as rare bright spots. A change of approach is urgently required but given the Conservative Party’s behaviour, and the fact that it may soon be led by a man who had no apparent problem with saying “f*** business”, that doesn’t look likely to happen anytime soon.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

She said everyone knows such photos can be hi- jacked and used to threaten and embarrass.I am sure that Whoopi meant well but it all backfired when an emotional Bella posted a video saying how upset she was at being “shamed” by the presenter and actress, — calling her actions “sick and disgusting”.I find it utterly baffling that Bella was more distressed by the words of a middle-aged woman who had her best interests at heart than the saddo who tried to embarrass her by releasing nude photos on to the internet for all the world to see.It’s a great shame this has now escalated into a row between the two women, because I truly admire Bella for how she has handled the whole potential blackmailing situation.It was a masterstroke and instantly took all the power away from the snivelling little git who was hassling her. Bella was not ashamed or embarrassed by the intimate pictures and would not be held to ransom. Good for her.But surely it was far more upsetting to be the victim of a potential crime than receiving a slight scolding from Whoopi for being naive enough to take and keep those sorts of images in the first place.Bella had a right old rant on Instagram and has vowed never again to appear on The View — a chat show co-hosted by Whoopi which is the US version of our Loose Women.I feel very sorry for Bella because she was clearly extremely upset by what Whoopi had to say but I think her anger is misplaced.Whoopi was makIng a really important point, which affects everyone, not only those in the public eye.She was speaking for worried parents of teenagers and twentysomethings everywhere who are concerned that online photos of their children getting drunk, posing nude or even having sex will come back to haunt them.It is one of the real dangers of social media that our accounts are not really secure. they can be hacked with relative ease, falling out of “the cloud” and on to your boss’s Facebook — or, even worse, getting viewed by your mum and dad.There are people who think it is a jolly wheeze to post explicit photographs of former lovers online, or who do it as “revenge” for being dumped.Of course, there are those who have no common sense and post pictures of themselves romping in hotel rooms with girlfriends or boyfriends or boozily feeling each other up on holiday.The authorities are now cracking down. Last August, a man who hacked into hundreds of iCloud accounts of Hollywood actresses and leaked their nude pictures was sentenced to eight months in prison.George Garofano stole private photographs from movie stars including actresses Jenner Lawrence and Kirsten Dunst. It was horribly distressing for these women and I completely sympathise.However, the ease with which that slimy toad was able to access personal images proves thatyou don’t want to have potentially embarrassing photos put out there, then don’t take them in the first place — or just press the delete button.Maybe even go back to the Dark Ages, invest in a Polaroid camera and keep your naughty pictures under lock and key. The hackers are vile, but let us not give them the ammunition. And take heed of the advice from wise women such as Whoopi.I SINCERELY hope the latest rumours from the troubled set of the new Bond film prove to be without foundation.It’s being claimed that the film’s director, Cary Fukunaga, held up cast and crew during a complicated shoot because he was playing video games on his PlayStation.Apparently the production crew and actors were not amused at having to hang about for three hours because Cary wanted to play with his toys. I don’t blame them.I cannot believe someone would be so inconsiderate to fellow professionals.I was, however, more aghast at finding out Cary isn’t a spotty teenage geek, but a -year-old man.Surely he should have outgrown PlayStation by now – especially when he is already in charge of the world’s best video game, involving Aston Martin car chases, shootouts, beautul women and dastardly villains.WILLIAM and Kate showed how royals should react when their lestyle causes harm to a member of the public.Widow Irene Mayor, , was hit by a police motorbike escorting the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge to Windsor Castle. She is in hospital with serious injuries.As soon as Wills and Kate found out, they sent flowers and a hand-written note and have told Irene’s family they want to visit her whenever she is ready.I HAVE never watched Love Island. So it’s odd to see images and videos of strange, orange people with impossibly white teeth, like Molly-Mae Hague on my online news feeds and splashed across magazines when I haven’t a blinking clue who they are.And it is utterly bizarre that they all look and sound exactly alike.To be honest,I really need to see fit youngsters strutting around, uttering meaningless sounds and having sex, I will tune into a David Attenborough documentary.THE Fab Five presenters on makeover show Queer Eye are making the world a better place – one scruffy, messed-up person at a time.Makeovers are hardly a new concept but this series does much more than give someone a new outfit and haircut.The hosts lovebomb shy misfits who ask for help, as well as big-hearted people who just neglect themselves – then change their lives for ever.It’s a show full of heart and soul and I blub during every episode.This week I met the British star of Queer Eye, delightful Tan France, from Doncaster. He had a hard time growing up in a world where he had no role models and he feels a huge responsibility to young gay Asian men such as himself.Tan and the Queer Eye boys feature in the video for Taylor Swt’s new single, You Need To Calm Down, with some of my favourite people including RuPaul and Ryan Reynolds.The song hits you over the head a bit with its inclusivity – no bad thing – but the Queer Eye boys do it better just by being themselves.I HAD to look twice at this gorgeous selfie posted by This Morning’s Alison Hammond.She’s glowing with confidence and happiness.After becoming the spokeswoman for a slimming club Alison has lost so much weight and looks stunning.She has talked about being “embarrassed” by weighing st. But I’m so glad she lost weight gradually with a healthy eating plan and doing exercise she loves.I wish Alison all the best with her battle towards being happier, healthier and fitter and I know she will have helped other women with their weight issues too.I BLOODY love Matt Lucas. The Little Britain star saw on Twitter that Amy Dunn was being bullied because she had lost her hair and was being derided as a “Matt Lucas lookalike”.The comedian immediately sent the -year-old a message of support telling her she was beautul and how flattered he was to be compared to her.Amy, who suffers from alopecia, has had people laughing and pointing at her in the street because she happens to have a condition that means she is bald.I hope having Matt on her side has cheered Amy up and given her the confidence to ignore the morons who hurled abuse, and maybe even feel sorry for them for being such ar**holes.Matt is right. Amy is beautul, and so is he.I’M very much liking the look of Beecham House, the new ITV drama set in th Century India that airs tomorrow night.The trails look sumptuous and now Poldark’s Aidan Turner has gone all grungy, leading man Tom Bateman is a most welcome piece of eye candy.Beecham House is on ITV tomorrow at pm.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Boris will only be our th Prime Minister since the very first, Robert Walpole, who was in office from  to .The fact that more than a third of them went to Eton , suggests that social mobility in this country is in terminal decline.Indeed, when it comes to the children of ordinary homes reaching the highest office in the land, social mobility is stone-cold dead.Fee-paying privilege provides the fast-track to power. Yet it wasn’t always this way.There was a golden age of ­meritocracy in the last century when it was normal for our PMs to be educated by the state.Eton was still a bastion of academic excellence in those happy years. So was Harrow, which has produced seven Prime Ministers, and Westminster, which educated six.But between  and , there was enough healthy social mobility in this country for Harold Wilson, Ted Heath, Jim Callaghan, Margaret Thatcher and John Major — all educated at state schools — to become Prime Minister.Major and Callaghan didn’t even go to university. Callaghan couldn’t afford it, while Major left school at  with three O-levels.All five came from modest ­backgrounds, although Wilson, Heath and Thatcher were clever enough to get into Oxford University.For more than three decades, state-educated politicians competed with those who were the product of expensive private educations — and beat them to the top job.This is not an argument against Boris Johnson becoming Prime ­Minister simply because he went to Eton. Boris seems like the man most likely to prevent a Marxist government. This would destroy our economy — a fate far worse than either staying in or leaving the European Union.SoI was a Tory MP or party member, then I would probably prefer Boris to take on Brussels, Corbyn and the Brexit Party.But yet another old Etonian in  Downing Street proves that social mobility is nowhere near what it was in the last century. Andwe care about a fair and equal society, then that should concern us all.It feels signicant that the first candidate to be eliminated from the Tory leadership race was Esther McVey — the candidate from  the least privileged background, reinforcing the belief that Westminster is a closed shop.But when it comes to getting on in le, and even getting to Downing Street, it should not matter a damn where you were born.Your ability — and your willingness to graft — should matter far more than Mummy and Daddy’s bank ­balance.Le can never be totally fair. But two Old Etonian PMs in less than ten years is grotesque.  If there is to be a bright, shining future for this country after we leave the EU, there MUST be more social mobility.Once he has sorted out Brexit  and buried Corbyn, perhaps our Old ­Etonian PM will do something about it. Because inequality is still entrenched at birth.And that stinks.WHAT is mankind’s greatest invention  The Internet  The printing press  The steam engine  Penicillin If, like me, you are allergic to penicillin, then the gold shorts that Kylie Minogue wore in her Spinning Around promo probably have the edge on all of them. Kylie’s gold gear might make a comeback when she plays Glastonbury next Sunday.And  years after their debut, nobody has ever developed an allergy to them.As the wolf evolved into the dog, it sussed that making its eyes bigger made the humans go all soft and gooey inside.Dr Juliane Kaminski, of the University of Ports- mouth, says: “The evidence is compelling that dogs developed a muscle to raise the inner eyebrow after they were domesticated from wolves. It seems to elicit a strong desire in humans to look after them.”Those puppy-dog eyes are designed to make your heart melt.Certainly when Stan, our Cavalier King Charles spaniel, looks at me with his enormous, big round peepers, I understand the three little words he is trying to say.Give. Stan. Cheese.IT is weird the way even the greatest TV series can go off the boil.On the surface, the second series of Killing Eve has everything that made the first such a blast.Jodie Comer is still brilliant as psychopathic assassin Villanelle, doing a iety of convincing accents and changing her clothes more often than Diana Ross in concert.Sandra Oh is again wonderful as the sexually confused, domestically challenged spook.But I have watched the entire second series now and it just doesn’t catch fire the way the first did.And that is because the first series of Killing Eve had three female stars in Jodie Comer, Sandra Oh and – behind the scenes – Fleabag creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge, who wrote the script.Now Waller-Bridge has gone off to save the screenplay of the next James Bond movie.And Killing Eve badly misses her magic dust.JEW-HATING has become the racism  that is permissible.The Prime Minister of Malaysia, Mahathir Mohamad, told the Cambridge Union debating society that his Jewish friends: “Are not like the other Jews – that’s why they are my friends.”He got a laugh.If he had said “black” or “Muslim”, he would have been nicked.THERE are some scary TV shows out there.Doing Question Time is daunting because you can be certain that at least half of the audience will hate your guts.Have I Got News For You  is forbidding because the ageing team captains and presenters have been doing it since the dawn of time and are used to the show’s format .But nothing comes close to the terror factor of Mastermind.To sit in that black leather chair as the lights go down is to know true stage fright. So Hamish Cameron must have been a very brave man indeed.Hamish held the record for the most appearances on Mastermind –  – and after filming the final last November, he learned he had terminal cancer.Shortly before the final was broadcast last week, Hamish died at the age of .The BBC had considered postponing the broadcast as a mark of respect but Hamish had instructed his family that he wanted the show to go on.As someone who vowed “never again” after sitting in that hot seat just the once, I can only salute Hamish’s courage.The Mastermind catchphrase “I’ve started so I’ll finish” could have been invented for this fearless man.IF Heathrow gets a third runway, then the impact on the environment will be huge, with hundreds of extra flights landing and taking  off every day.And that’s just for Emma Thompson!Their honeymoon must have been filthy.ANDREA LEADSOM says she was told by senior Tory women that they could not back her because the party couldn’t have “another woman” Prime Minister so soon after Theresa May.But the Tories’ past willingness to be led by a woman is surely something to celebrate.  The Conservatives will almost certainly be on their third female Prime Minister before the -year-old male-dominated Labour Party has its first.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So why feel guilty about watching it The appeal of this show is fairly obvious — it’s the intimate access you get.Viewers feel like they’re on holiday on on the island too, as invisible guests.The ultimate fly-on-the-wall experience.We hear the most private of conversations, witness the most explosive fallouts. We even get in the shower with them.It’s so intimate that it feels the same as when you read someone ’s diary.Of course, we are watching insanely beautul people parading around in tiny scraps of swimwear. But no matter how gorgeous the contestants, each one is revealed to be as fragile as the next.I think that is where our real fascination lies.Surely they should all be full of confidence, looking the way they do  And yet they seem to be just as insecure as the rest of us.I like the fact that the show is a portal into a generation to which I no longer belong.I’ve learned so much about how young men and women behave and, until Maura uttered the words, I didn’t even know it was possible to have “fanny flutters”.Another thing I like is the escapism. Surely it’s no coincidence that Love Island is at peak popularity during a time when the news is totally dominated with gloom, doom — and Brexit.Personally, I’m also intrigued by the fake hair and nails — and the very y process of getting ready for a night out. I’m luckyI put a comb through my hair.The amount of make-up they manage to get on to their faces is astonishing — although the irony is that the one girl all the guys seem to like, Lucie, is a surfer chick who doesn’t wear make-up.There is also a real cruelty to the show, though. There is always someone better, someone more chosen. The voting process is brutal and leaves all of the contestants anxious about whether or not people like them.This show strips people of everything that is important, other than their body. They are measured on what they look like and little .As a result, lots of people have questioned the damage caused to the mental health of the contestants.There have been more than , complaints to Ofcom about this series already.But there are good things about Love Island.While it’s not exactly the kind of equality that women have been fighting for over the past  years, there’s no denying that female members in the house are as free as the men to proposition members of the opposite sex.In my day, all we had was: “My mate fancies you.” But Maura said of one guy that he gave her “fanny flutters”.When my daughter Sophia was asked to go on the show, she thought it would be fun to be on a free holiday. You can see her point.But no mother wants to watch their child on Love Island. We all know there are plenty of things our kids do that we don’t know about — and that’s the way it should stay.But it’s not just that. One reason I enjoy being part of the Apprentice is because it celebrates young people for their skills, ambition and what they achieve.They know they aren’t being valued for their looks — they are being valued for so much more than that.That said, no one’s self- esteem should be based on how others value us.I’ve often thought that my biggest superpower is that I really don’t care what people think about me.When I’m on the beach I’m not bothered about which bits and pieces are jiggling.Why  Because there is so much more to me than what I look like in a bikini.Or, rather, as a footballer’s we once said to me: “All I’ve got is my looks — at least you’ve got your personality.”I know it was a back-handed compliment. But you know what, I’m fine with that.LOTTIE Moss said on social media that she feels “uncomfortable” with her weight at the moment – as she posted a picture of herself in a dress on a night out.My first thought was she’s going to look back at those photos when she is in her fties and wonder how she could have felt uncomfortable when she looked like this.My second was she can’t worry that much because the dress she’s wearing is almost completely see-through.BOSSES of the Isle of Wight Festival have been criticised by two mental-health charities for banning Jess Glynne for le after the singer cancelled her show at the last minute, owing to anxiety.Anxiety is a debilitating condition which blights the lives of many people.I’m sorry to hear that Jess is one of those people.But when she knows she suffers from this condition, her choice to stay out partying with the Spice Girls until am on the day she was due to perform seems, well, questionable.Having been out drinking all night before work is enough to make even the most level-headed person anxious.To then go on social media advertising that fact, before effectively phoning in sick to work, is also a tad foolish.By doing that, Glynne gave the impression she chose partying over a commitment – and that is not a good look.If we have one job to do as parents, it is to teach our kids the importance of doing the things that need to be done, when they need to be done, whether you like it or not.When I see a young person doing what they said they would do, despite challenges, I know they’ve got backbone.It’s called resilience, grit, determination, and it’s about being irrepressible. Those are some of the most admirable traits a person can have.Anxiety is awful but it’s certainly not helped by partying until the early hours of a work day.THIS week there has been good and bad news for Boris Johnson. The good news is that it looks ashe is going to be our next Prime Minister.The bad news is not that early-hours row with his partner – it’s his new haircut.He used to have “The Trump”, a sort of comb-forward that hid his balding. But his barber has cut it off and, instead of the long-haired blond bombshell look, he’s now a blond basin with thinning top.Boris, please take it from me, when you go into a hairdresser’s the first thing you do is check out the hairstyle of the person holding the scissors.Anyway, I guess it grows back – and soon will be the haystack it’s always been. Now all Boris needs is a new suit.OOPS! My heart goes out to the mum of the rampaging toddler at a Swiss art show who knocked over a sculpture of a fly worth £,.My main question, though, is how a plastic sculpture of a fly could be worth so much money Someone, somewhere, is having a laugh. Right I WAS trying to work out what was unusual about the recent photo of actor Rob Lowe on the red carpet.I realised it’s this. He is a handsome, successful star who is still with his we – Sheryl Berkoff – after  years without trading her in for a younger model.And they look happy.A rare sight in Hollywood, so good luck to both of them.TO be fair, Sofia Richie pretty much pulled it off when she sported the latest bicycle shorts onesie – the trend you prayed would never happen.But all I can say is, I’m glad I don’t follow fashion.WHAT’S in a word  You might think nothing much. And it’s a small thing in a way, but Sainsbury’s needs to be called out for assuming on its hair-removal product that all doctors are male.Its instructions say: “Consult your usual doctor and show him the packaging.”No doubt lots of people will respond by saying that us women are far too easily offended.But it is assumptions such as this behind the fact that, for every £ a man makes, a woman only makes p.We have to stamp out this unconscious bias by calling it out every time we see it.AMAZING that it’s  years since Friends hit our TVs.But judging by pictures of its stars Jenner Aniston, , and Courteney Cox, , on vacation in their bikinis, they still look fantastic.Even more amazing is that they are genuine friends.It just goes to show thatyou eat well, work out and look after yourself, you don’t have to be fat and flabby at .*Note to self – eat better and go to the gym. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Last year, they even found a bullet on their doorstep after a mass shooting nearby.Another resident found  bags of cannabis with a street value of £, dumped in a skip.Despite loving her home, Mel admits shes too scared to go outside at night.She says: “It’s quite intimidatingyou’re a woman on your own and you walk out in the dark and you’ve got big groups of teenagers hanging outside.

If it is appropriate for us to use it, we will use it.Dramatic footage released last November showed Scotland Yard’s Scorpion pursuit teams hitting mopeds and sending suspects sprawling over car bonnets and flying across the tarmac.However, under existing laws, cops chasing moped thugs are subject to the same legal test for careless and dangerous driving offences as members of the public.Eventhey escape prosecution, cops can be investigated for gross misconduct and sacked.Cops who face charges often have to wait years before having their names cleared.The Home Office has insisted it is “reviewing” the law to give officers greater protection but critics said they must push through new legislation as a priorityThe documentary also interviews members of moped gangs who commit crimes and vigilantes who risk their lives to hunt the yobs.Scotland Yard introduced the bold new tactic of ramming moped thieves to widespread acclaim after violent gangs wreaked havoc on the streets of Lawless London in a terrying crime epidemic.The growth of moped crime - in which some criminals have stolen up to  phones in an hour - has exploded by , per cent across the UK in the past three years.And Lawless London has seen the highest spike in moped muggings, where over , separate offences were recorded last year alone.Victims are often targeted as theyre coming out of tube stations and other transport hubs where theyre more vulnerable to attacks.Thieves snatch handbags, watches and other expensive items before making an easy getaway.Cops had been criticised due to a widespread belief that they werent allowed to pursue a suspect on a mopedthey werent wearing a helmet.But proposed changes in the law make it explicit that specially trained police drivers can chase a rider without a helmet.Forces have previously unveiled other tactics to fight moped crime, like automatic tyre deflation devices and DNA tagging spray.And the tactics appear to be working - while there were , offences of moped crime in London between January and October last year, the same period has seen , offences this year - a reduction of  per cent.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Fexofenadineis a fantastic antihistamine that is only available on prescription. In my experience is one of the most effective around.And whilst some antihistamines are marketed as non-drowsy, some iniduals are particularly sensitive, and will still find themselves experiencing some fatigue.Some lesser known side effects include a dry mouth throat, dry eyes and blurred vision.Medications that block histamine receptors help allergic conditions, but these types of medications can reduce mucous and aqueous production, which cause dry eye and mouth complaints.Adding eye drops to your regime can be really useful to help combat the itchy eyes.Nasal decongestants are often combined with anticholinergic medications which together contribute to dry eyes, dilated pupils and decreased response to bright light.The dilated pupils interfere with your ability to focus on objects and can, therefore, contribute to blurry vision.Boots pharmacist Natalie Masters said: “You may have seen reports on rising pollen counts this weekend.If you’re a hayfever sufferer, don’t panic. When there’s more pollen in the air, your symptoms may worsen, but there are lots of steps you can take to alleviate these.Prevention is key, which means avoiding coming into contact with pollen in the first place.Grassy areas are often best avoided andyou can, don’t spend time outdoors at the times when pollen counts are highest, typically the early morning and late afternoon and evening.If you need to go outside, applying a petroleum jelly balm to the inside of your nostrils or using an allergy barrier nasal spray can help prevent pollen from entering your nostrils, whilst larger wraparound sunglasses can help stop pollen from irritating your eyes.There’s also several products you can purchase which can help to alleviate your symptoms when they start flaring up.Speak to your pharmacist about anti-histamine tablets, hayfever eye drops or a suitable steroid nasal spray.If you’ve been outdoors when the pollen count is high, make sure to shower and wash your hair once you get home to wash away any stray pollen particles.Regularly vacuuming and dusting your house with a damp cloth and washing and drying your clothes indoors may also help to keep your home a pollen-free zone.Importantly, try not to be worried or stressed about your hayfever. It has been claimed that hayfever can be exacerbated by this, so try to keep calm and consider dferent products and methods – hopefully you’ll soon find what works best for you.”Boots is currently has their own brand hay fever products on offer for  for £, including Boots One-A-Day Allergy Relief mg tabletsand  Boots Hayfever Relief for Adults  micrograms dose Nasal Spray  Metered Sprays .Branded products are also on offer at two for £.Nasal Sprays are particularly helpful for the rhinitisor blocked nose symptoms, which antihistamine tablets may not always take care of. Beconase is always a good start, but mometasoneor Fluticasone based sprays such as Avamys and Dymista, can provide that next step for relief.But in some iniduals, nasal sprays can cause some localised irritation within the nostrils, and even nose bleeds.The most important thing about nasal sprays is ensuring you are using them correctly. It is worth noting that they do not work immediately, and their effects are cumulative, meaning the longer you use them, the better the response – so you’ll need patience before you see results.Prolonged use of over the counter decongestant nasal sprays can create a rebound rhinosinusitisused for too long – in essence, they can make symptoms worseused for more than  or  days.What should you do should you experience any of these symptoms Dr Fenton says thatyou experience any of these side effects, its important to discuss them with your GP.He said: There is a multitude of alternative antihistamines, spray and drops that may be more suited to you.Alternatives include using medications used for asthma, such as Montelukast, which is excellent for the runny nose component of hay fever.In addition, some well-known antacidsdespite mainly being used for acid reflux and heartburn, can actually have great antihistamine effects.When all  fails, you may consider the hay fever injection, which is a steroid-based injection. This is not to be taken lightly, as is not without risks, but it can be beneficial to those with sever hay fever.Dr Fenton added: The truth behind hay fever treatment is that it can be trial and error.You have to take the time to find the right combination of treatments for you.Speaking to your GP is useful, as they will take you through all of the options and recommend, prescribe and administer the correct hay fever medications as needed."},{"url":null,"title":"sunny beach nightclub bulgaria holiday","story":"Den Glade Viking is one of the many party bars at the Sunny Beach resort - a huge party town by the Black Sea where young Brits flock for the summer.In pictures taken at the bars many events and parties, ladies and gents can be seen frolicking together and dancing scantily-clad on top of the bar.Speaking to the Daily Star, a spokesperson for the raunchy club said that dancing naked on the bar was encouraged.He said: Anyone can dance naked on bars.Our slogan is the only place where it’s allowed to dance naked on the bar’.Events at Den Glade Viking include the UV party - where teens draw rude images on each other with brightly coloured pens.The bars spokesperson added: “There’s tonnes of mischievous sex games going on during the beach parties and Full Moon Parties.“Your typical - crowd games.”After her visit, Shannon Currie, from Wigan in Greater Manchester, left a positive review on the bars Facebook page and said its the only place that allows a naked dance on the bar.She added: I cant wait to be back.Other young Brits on Facebook have raved about the party bar too, calling it the best place to party in Sunny Beach and saying they had some of the best nights of their le there.The bar is part of a pub crawl run by workers at the resort.Den Glade Viking is one of a few stops that offer free drinks and shots to young people who come along for the party.The nightclub has a pool that is frequented by hardcore party-goers during the day.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We need another show with a big house and a strong, silent, topless gardener who gallops around searching for love, fulfilment and all that toss.”So we’ve now got this six-part series fronted by Tom Bateman, who actually made a promising start to playing soldier-turned-trader John Beecham.He got shot.I’d have run the closing titles right there and then and promised viewers: “ITV willin about , when it’s got some new ideas.”According to the caption, however, “three years later” John Beecham was back and he’d brought his extended family with him to fill the big house.They include: His dear old racist mum, played by Mrs Patmore off Downton, a motherless baby, wayward brother Daniel, some pot-stirring French git called General Castillion and two underwhelming bits of female love interest, who won’t get any bloke switching over from Love Island in a hurry. Also present is Citizen Khan himself, Adil Ray, who’s moved in next door wearing a glued-on beard that last saw serious action in Carry On Up The Khyber.So I hope no one was expecting a laugh, or a plot. Because Beecham House hasn’t really got one, apart from the baby issue and Beecham’s grovelling desire to be granted a trading licence, which both generate lots of sarky backchat from the locals, but not much .It all stands or falls then, almost entirely, on the leading character.And, oh boy, does this one ever fall.As absolutely everyone’s noticed, for the want of charisma they’ve had to dress the poor bloke up as Indiana Jones, which can’t be a lot of fun in that climate.Even with the overcoat, cowboy hat and women throwing themselves at him, John’s brother still thinks he’s “the dullest man in Delhi”.The thing that really weighs him down, though, is Empire guilt. The righteous berk can hardly look at an Indian without apologising.“Your Imperial Highness, I implore you judge me by my actions not my flag.”“I am not like my countrymen.” “Their hypocrisy sickens me.” “The East India company’s policy of expansion is shameful.” “I love your country and believe India should be ruled by Indians.”  He’s so woke he could be reading last night’s Channel  News.An approach that’s unlikely to win the show many friends, I’d have thought, or stop the more right-on viewers accusing him of having “big white saviour syndrome”.Ultimately, though, I have absolutely no real idea whether John Beecham will strike a chord with the viewers, because, like most shows broadcast in the Sunday night pm to pm slot, I am not part of the target female audience.All I’m meant to do is sit dumbly and join in the apologetic Empire chorus.I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m not sorry at all.TIPPING Point, Ben Shephard: “In Only Fools And Horses, who plays the character known as Del Boy ”Ben: “David Frost.”Fteen To One, Sandi Toksvig: “What is the two-word term for a flashing orange globe mounted on a striped pole, used at pedestrian crossings, named after a s minister of transport ”Kresha: “Traffic light.”And Love Island, Molly-Mae: “What is the capital of France ”PSYCHOPATH With Piers Morganrequires expectations to be managed, because it’s barely a minute old when Porky-Talkie reveals: “The prison considers Paris Bennett so dangerous they insist I interview him behind toughened glass.”Andthat’s not health-and-safety gone mad, I dunno what is, frankly.RE: Love Island. If Joe and Lucie were “Jucie” and Jordan and Anna “Jordanna”, did that make Elma and Scottish Anton “Elma Fud” NEVER a good sign when you can tell a show’s going to be a disaster just from the furniture.But that was the case with last Tuesday’s big political bun fight, on BBC, which looked more like a dating show or fire sale at Louis Walsh’s gaff than a debate to decide Our Next Prime Minister.It sounded like it as well, from the way host Emily Maitlis kicked off, barking: “Five men. One job.” A phrase I don’t think I’ve heard any presenter utter since Kerry Katona was fronting ElimiDate, back in .Long before it got to air, Maitlis and the BBC had also clearly decided Boris was the “Islamo- phobic” booby prize, because not one of the researchers saw any warning signs being given off by Abdullah, from Bristol, who’d deactivated his Twitter before appearing on the show. The prize guy, naturally, was meant to be Rory Stewart, who liberal political commentators all think would make a great Conservative Party leader, in the same way they probably think Iggy Pop would make a great lead singer of One Direction.Turned out, though, he’s a fidgeting little oddball who was political toast long before he sighed at Boris: “I’m sure, like me, you’ve been in Enniskillen sitting with sheep farmers.”So, by the end of the night, an attempted BBC stitch-up had accounted for: Rory Stewart, one anti-semite, from Bristol, some other bug-eyed Corbyn cultist demanding an early election and probably Emily Maitlis’ credibility as well.Boris, meanwhile, just ploughed on regardless.Well done, everyone.Celebrity Crystal Maze, Gemma Collins: “Just being honest, it’s an honour for you to have me.”And The Last Leg, Alex Brooker: “The problem with me swimming The Channel is I can’t swim.”Problem how ON Thursday’s Shopping With Keith Lemon, former market trader Rob Beckett claimed: “I used to sell compost and you can’t up-sell a bag of s***, can you ”Yet it never stopped him trying on All Together Now.IT’S nearly six months since that great foghorning orca, Gemma Collins, last made an exhibition of herself on television.So I suppose we were overdue Friday’s appearance on Celebrity Crystal Maze, where she rumbled round the course, like Indiana Jones’ concrete ball, alongside Carol Vorderman, Ellie Taylor, Rick Edwards and her on off boyfriend Arg.And how that pair avoided wedging themselves inside one of the show’s duct shafts will remain for ever one of the Channel  show’s great mysteries.Gemma bellowed over everyone, insulted her co-stars, threw a hissy fit inside one virtual reality game – “Nah, sorry. Stop the game” – and told host Richard Ayoade: “You must be clever ’cos I’ve got the mind of a genius and you’ve made me laugh.” She also attempted to create some sort of mystique around “The GC” tag, claiming it was nothing to do with her initials and inviting alternative suggestions from Carol, who remained diplomatically silent, evenI’d swear you could see in the thought bubble above her head  . . . “Gigantic consonant vowel consonant consonant.”THE Real Chernobyl proving the perfect accompaniment to Sky Atlantic’s show of the year.Susanna Reid’s digestive tract going into deep spasm when Geoffrey Boycott asked her out for lunch, on another unmissable Good Morning Britain.Top Gear’s Chris Harris attempting to drink a glass of water while being electric-shocked by Freddie Flintoff and Paddy McGuinness.And Alien Fun Capsule host Harry Hill responding to Stephanie Beacham name-dropping former Dynasty husband Charlton Heston: “Yeah, Charlton Heston.

Here, its author tells the true story behind the film.One April morning in , a sardine fisherman spotted the corpse of a British soldier floating in the sea off the coast of Spain — and set in motion a chain of events that would change the course of World War Two.Operation Mincemeat was one of the most successful wartime deceptions ever attempted — and certainly the strangest.It hoodwinked the Nazi espionage chiefs, sent German troops hurtling in the wrong direction and saved thousands of lives by deploying a secret agent who was dferent, in one crucial respect, from any spy before or since: He was dead.His mission was to convince the Germans that instead of attacking Sicily, the Allies would invade Greece.The taking of Sicily was key, as it helped to secure the Mediterranean and paved the way for an assault on mainland Italy.The brainchild of an eccentric RAF officer and a brilliant Jewish barrister, the hoax involved an extraordinary cast of characters.They included the inventor of James Bond, a beautul secret service secretary, a submarine captain, an angry admiral and a dead Welsh tramp.Using fraud, imagination and seduction, Churchill’s team of spies spun a web of deceit so elaborate and convincing they began to believe it themselves.The hoax started in a windowless basement beneath London’s Whitehall. It travelled from the capital to Scotland to Spain to Germany — and ended up on Hitler’s desk.Operation Mincemeat originated in the mind of Ian Fleming, the creator of Bond, who worked in naval intelligence during the war.Soon after the conflict was declared in , Fleming drew up a list of possible deception operations for his demanding boss, Admiral John Godfrey, the model for M in the spy films.Onewas to find a dead body, equip it with  papers and leave it in a place where the Germans would find it.The most obvious place was Spain, which was teeming with Nazi sympathisers. If the body and fake documents could be made to fall into the right hands, they would certainly be passed to the Germans.The plan was put into action before the invasion of Sicily in .British and US troops were massed in North Africa, preparing for the invasion of southern Europe, but the target was obvious. Churchill said: “Anyone but a fool would know it’s Sicily.”The challenge for British intelligence was how to convince Hitler that the Allies did not intend to attack Sicily — and then attack Sicily.The two architects of Operation Mincemeat were lawyer Ewen Montagu of Navy intelligenceand an RAF officer working for MI, Charles Cholmondeley.Early in , they were tipped off that the body of homeless man Glyndwr Michael had been brought into the mortuary at St Pancras in London.He had killed himself with rat poison. After consulting with Sir Bernard Spilsbury, Britain’s top forensic expert, the spies decided the Germans could be fooled into thinking he had drowned at sea.Glyndwr’s body was put in the mortuary fridge and they set about inventing a fake personality for him as Major William Martin, of the Royal Marines.They constructed  identity papers, a unorm and orders indicating he was an important courier transporting vital military documents.He would also be carrying letters from his bank manager, a receipt for an engagement ring and theatre ticket stubs.Many years later, Montagu wrote: “We talked about him until we did feel that he was an old friend. Major Martin had become a real person to us.”They also faked love letters from a non-existent fiancée named “Pam”. “Bill darling, do let me know as soon as you get fixed  can make some more plans.”In the dead man’s wallet they included a photograph of Pam, actually Jean Leslie, a young and attractive secretary in MI.The most important fake documents, in an attaché case chained to the dead man’s wrist, were marked “personal and most secret” and indicated that the Allies intended to invade Greece in the eastern Mediterranean, and Sardinia in the west.A second forged letter, from Lord Louis Mountbatten, then chief of combined operations, contained the phrase: “Let me have him [Martin] back as soon as you are finished with him. He might bring some sardines with him.”Sardines, of course, come from Sardinia. Montagu wrote: “I thought that sort of joke would appeal to the Germans.”The bluff represented a serious gamble. If the Germans realised they were being deceived, then instead of reducing troop numbers in Sicily, they would bolster them, with bloody consequences.The body would be transported to the shores of Spain by HMS Seraph, a submarine under the command of Captain Norman “Bill” Jewell.While Seraph awaited her unlikely cargo on the West Coast of Scotland, the team constructed an airtight steel canister, six feet long, in which Major Martin would lie, packed around with dry ice to slow decomposition.Meanwhile, MI confirmed a particularly active German spy was known to be operating in the Huelva region in southwestern Spain — the perfect target for the deception.On April , they dressed Glyndwr in the unorm of William Martin, defrosted his frozen feet to put on his stf army-issue boots, placed the body in the steel container labelled “optical instruments” and loaded it into the back of a van.Shortly after am on April , the Seraph surfaced off the coast of Spain and the corpse, fitted with a lejacket, was slipped gently into the sea. Captain Jewell sent a wireless message: “Mincemeat completed.”Through MI’s files and wireless messages intercepted by codebreakers at Bletchley Park in Buckinghamshire, it is possible to reconstruct in detail the progress of Operation Mincemeat, from Huelva, to Madrid, to the German High Command.After being dragged from the sea by the fisherman, Glyndwr’s body was buried in Huelva cemetery under a marble gravestone that read: “William Martin. Born th March, . Died th April, .Meanwhile, German spies had intercepted the briefcase and fake contents and sent them to Nazi High Command.Goebbels, Hitler’s propaganda chief, had his doubts, as revealed in his diary.But most of the top Nazi generals were fooled by the documents. General Jodl, head of the German Supreme Command Operations staff, declared: “You can forget about Sicily. We know it’s in Greece.”Hitler was convinced by the deception. As they picked up the messages revealing the Nazis had fallen for it, MI sent a coded message to Churchill: “Mincemeat swallowed whole.”The results were extraordinary. The First German Panzer Division of tanks was moved to Greece from France to defend against the expected landing.German minefields were laid off Greece. An entire group of torpedo boats was redeployed from Sicily to the Aegean, and two more Panzer isions were moved from Russia to Greece just as they were most needed in the battle at Kursk,  miles from Moscow.By coincidence, the assault on Sicily was spearheaded by HMS Seraph under Bill Jewell, which planted buoys to lead the invaders to the beaches.In the early hours of July , Allied troops poured into Sicily, meeting little resistance. The surprised Italian defenders swtly surrendered.For two weeks, the Germans remained convinced the main attack would come in Greece and waited for an invasion that never came.Half a century after Operation Mincemeat, the British government added a new line to the headstone in Huelva cemetery: “Glyndwr Michael, served as Major William Martin.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Resign!” were directed at the homelessness minister Heather Wheeler.In an email written before she took up the role, Wheeler described rough sleepers in her constituency as “the traditional type, old tinkers”.The words were leaked and, lo, the outrage flowed hot and predictable. The Big Issue Foundation’s chief executive raged that such language, “has no place in this day and age” and so Wheeler should stand down.A travellers’ charity called her words “racist”, adding that “Irish traveller children should not have to grow up in a society where government ministers show such contempt for their culture”.Yes, Wheeler’s language was wince-worthy, but the leap to “racism” highlights the way race is used as a shield to protect the lestyles of some gypsy, Roma and traveller people from legitimate criticism.Recognised in the Equality Act of  as ethnic minorities, a force field of cultural sensitivity surrounds them. Any discussion of their culture can be labelled racist.Recent reports have found that travellers have it worse than the rest of us: Higher infant and maternal mortality rates higher prevalence of depression higher rates of chronic illness.They are likely to die more than a decade earlier than non-travellers.The educational outcomes for their children are terrible: The lowest attainment of all ethnic groups throughout their school years.They are far more likely to be excluded, and while  per cent of white British children stay in education past , only  per cent of Irish traveller children do.Officialdom’s response to these findings has been to blame officialdom or racial discrimination.The chairwoman of the Commons Women and Equalities Committee, Maria Miller, thinks travellers have been “comprehensively failed by policymakers and public services for far too long”.Always, the blame is directed at “the system”.Always, there is the retreat into the safe language of “vulnerable” people and “marginalised communities”, because politicians are terried of asking dficult questions about why travellers are over-represented in prison, or why many of their children are failing at school.Such questions would only spark accusations of racism and discrimination.This is not to suggest that gypsies, Roma and travellers live free from prejudice.There is discrimination which is real and cruel: Allegations of holiday camp operators having traveller blacklists pubs refusing to serve traveller families children bullied in school.Yet whose interests do we servewe pretend that all of this is down to straightforward racism The usually sensible Trevor Phillips, former chairman of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, has said that for gypsies and travellers: “Great Britain is still like the Deep South for black people in the Fties.”His analogy fails because it suggests the prejudice suffered is all about ethnic heritage, unconnected to the lestyle pursued by many travellers. This is nonsense.Though politicians will not dare say it, many in this country have negative perceptions of these groups because of their experience of illegal encampments on their local playing field: The littering, disruption and what might politely be termed “antisocial behaviour”.They see a group of people refusing to live by the laws the rest of us abide by: Trespassing on land with the police seemingly powerless to stop them breaking locks with no one prepared to arrest them parking on private property and not being towed away.It’s not racism driving this anti-traveller sentiment.It is fury that one community seems to live apart from the rules that govern the rest of us.The authorities seem pitully weak when it comes to evicting these camps. Councils must assess the welfare needs of those on the site before they can get an eviction order.Public money is sprayed on legal fees before the caravans move to a dferent illegal site, where the whole thing starts again.The authorities’ methods might be motivated by a desire not to “marginalise” travellers further, but it isn’t working.We need an approach which, while reconciling travellers’ desire to live on the move, recognises the desire of the rest of us to see the rules of the land enforced fairly.Part of this approach must be to make the process of evicting illegal camps surer and swter.But it’s no use simply wielding this stick without a carrot.The complementary action must be a building programme to create more authorised traveller pitches.Critically, each could have contact points with the local authority, with education and health systems, to catch these families in the net of public services .With more information on who lives where, the authorities could keep better tabs on who is educating their children, who is paying council tax, and so on.This issue may not make the hustings in the Tory leadership campaign, but it matters to the kind of country we are.Sensitivity to dferent cultures is right, butobjectionable or illegal behaviour cannot be dealt with for fear it will look racist, we are in a very strange place indeed.Giving one group a politically correct free pass denied to others is not fair, it is discrimination.Conservatives always talk about the importance of everyone “playing by the same rules”.Here’s a chance for the next leader to show he means it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But accounts yesterday revealed the refurbishment of the property near Windsor Castle cost £.million  in the financial year to April alone.Any work carried out since then has not been included, and the exterior has yet to be repainted — so the true cost is expected to be closer to £million.The books revealed major work was undertaken to turn five properties back to a single home.A luxury kitchen was installed, while an existing studio with a bedroom was renovated, and fireplaces, floors and staircases replaced.Meghan chose eco-friendly, toxin-free and vegan paint for the redecoration, which was reportedly overseen by designer Vicky Charles. She was responsible for the interiors of Soho Farmhouse in Oxfordshire, a hotel and members’ club popular with celebs.Revealing the royal accounts yesterday, Sir Michael Stevens, Keeper of the Privy Purse, insisted that Frogmore Cottage had been neglected and needed doing up.He said: “The property had not been the subject of work for some years and had already been earmarked for renovation.”He added: “The building was ed to a single residence and outdated infrastructure was replaced to guarantee the long-term future of the property. “Substantially all fixtures and fittings were paid for by Their Royal Highnesses.”A royal source said defective wooden ceiling beams and floor joists were replaced, while inefficient heating systems were also updated. The home also needed substantial electrical rewiring and new gas and water mains installed.The main renovation took around six months but some work is still outstanding, such as repainting the exterior and landscaping the grounds.Palace sources said that cost will not be revealed as it is “part of a five-year repainting and repair programme”.They also said there was a cap on installations such as kitchens and bathrooms, and the couple had to pay extrathey wanted a more bespoke version.Accounts for the Sovereign Grant, which funds the Queen and her household’s official expenses, show the monarchy cost the taxpayer £.million in  , or £. per person in the UK.It spent £million of that — a year-on-year rise of almost £million — thanks partly to work at Buckingham Palace.The latest revelations sparked fury among republican campaigners, who called for an inquiry into a “blatant misuse of public money”.Graham Smith, of the Republic pressure group, said: “This year’s increases are outrageous at a time of widespread spending cuts.“If even one school or hospital is facing cuts we cannot justy spending a penny on the royals.“Yet with all public services under intense financial pressure we throw £.million at a new house for Harry.”Prince Charles used the train to travel back from his Scottish home Birkhall to London on - September at a cost of £,. He also used the train - December at a cost of £, to visit Cardf, and again in February this year to visit Port Talbot.The Queen used the train just twice in the last financial year — in March this year to visit Somerset and in June last year to visit Cheshire with Meghan.THE royals’ carbon emissions almost doubled — mainly due to royal air travel.Accounts revealed their greenhouse gas output increased by  per cent  year-on-year.This was blamed on the “higher usage of chartered fixed-wing aircraft for foreign business travel” and there were “five such overseas visits in - compared to one in -”.Charles and Camilla had three big overseas tours last year, including Africa and the Caribbean, while William went to Israel and Jordan.Palace officials said the Foreign Office chose where to send royals on tour.

The home in which my own grandmother-in-law spent her latter years preserved her safety and her dignity. Lots of care homes across the country have been proactive in installing cameras themselves. For too many others, however, it a dferent story, a problem scandalously still not adequately addressed.Health Secretary Matt Hancock , now back to his day job after his opportunistic bid to be Prime Minister, has been broadly supportive of CCTV. Former Tory attorney general Dominic Grieve also called last year for legislation to make it compulsory in all care homes.Health and Social Care Minister Caroline Dinenage, however, believes the decision should be left up to inidual care home providers. In other words, lots of talk but no action. It is remarkable that an outcry from animal welfare activists led to CCTV in all abattoirs last year, yet for our elderly in care no such protection exists. No longer should anxious sons, daughters, sisters and brothers have to do their own detective work to expose abusers. They need help. And the Government needs to give it to them.

The dramatic growth has seen a  per cent increase of self-professed vegans in the last  years, according to the Vegan Society.While vegans were once the butt of jokes, preconceptions have changed about those that swear off meat, dairy, and animal products, with more and more changing diet in a bid to improve our health as well as being kinder to the planet.Switching to veganism can see  fewer animals slaughtered yearly for meat, and thereaposs also plenty of evidence to show that a meat-free diet is the single biggest way to reduce our impact on the earth.HullLive reporter Anna Riley decided to give the vegan diet a go for a week - hereaposs how she got on.   It was tough at first The whole premise of  veganism  is a way of living which seeks to exclude, as far as is possible and practicable, all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose. This means eating a plant-based diet, avoiding all foods such as meat, fish and shellfish, dairy, eggs and even honey as well as animal-derived materials and products tested on animals. As commendable as this lestyle is, for a le-long meat eater, as well as often eating eggs and a LOVER of cheese, the challenge to go coldturkey was certainly a tough one. It was dficult at first to think of tasty vegan recipes to make for my meals that would be tasty compared to the meat and fish that were staples in much of the food I was used to eating.  Luckily, my almost vegan friendhelped me out when I asked for advice on what to shop for, and advised me to eat fruit for snacks, as well as stocking up on vegetables, nuts, beans and pulses to make a iety of meals that she sent over, including stews, curries, salads, stir fry and more. She also signposted me to plenty of vegan inspired recipes to look at online for inspiration.    It was more expensive and took time to shop Because I needed to replace all the dairy items that I normally had with vegan alternatives, my shop cost me nearly £ just for staples and snacks, much more than it normally wouldI was buying ordinary milk, cheese, butter, yoghurts, crisps and chocolate. Along with spending more on these items, there was also a much more limited selection on offer. I could only find two ieties of vegan cheese in the Tesco extra store in Hull St Stephenaposs Centre, which I was surprised by, and there was only a small selection of dairy free yoghurts. I went to Aldi for my main fruit and veg shop and was happily surprised to find a vegan section there, which included curry pots, sweet potato and beetroot burgers and red pepper and butternut squash sausages, as well as low calorie vegan pea snap crisps, so I snapped all of these up along with the lentils, beans, tinned tomatoes and spices in my trolley. As I wasnapost buying meat or fresh fish, which can add up, and instead bulking up on veg, Iaposd say that in the end I spent roughly as much as normal on my shop,not a little more for the vegan alternatives and ready meals. It also took me more time than normal to shop, as not many products are already labelled aposveganapos, so I had to scour the back of many packets to check that they contained no animal product at all, and even accidentally ended up getting cereal bars that werenapost vegan, as they had honey in them. One evening on my late sht I also had to grab something at Tesco for tea on my break but there were no vegan sandwiches in sight, as egg and cheese were the only meatless options, so I ended up shelling out £ for a tofu ready meal that was granted very tasty, but also very costly.    Tea rounds and office snacks were a no go Not wanting to bring a large carton of dairy free milk to work just for hot drinks for myself, I didnapost join in with the tea rounds other than to have a black coffee, and even then my colleagues would forget that I was aposoff milkapos and accidentally add it to my drink when they were making me one. Food Reviews  I also had to dodge the snacks that my kind colleagues brought into the office such as chocolate doughnuts and cakes, as they were also made with dairy products. Clearly, dairy is a lot more prominent in our everyday lives than I once thought. The food was tasty    I thought that I would be hankering for meat throughout the week, being used to eating it on a regular basis, but the food I made and ate was actually delicious - and the vegan cheese was even palatable, but of course not as good as the original version. There was plenty of iety in what I had and I didnapost feel like I was missing out with the vegan diet. The only thing that I did yearn for towards the end of the week was eggs, as I do enjoy them now and again for breakfast or in a fritatta or quiche. The vegan ready meals from the supermarket are definitely something Iaposd eat again, and Iaposd make some of the same recipes again, including the butternut squash bangers and mash, veggie stir fry, lentil stew, ratatouille, and curry, with plenty also for leftovers the next day. I also didnapost miss milk or yoghurt, with the dairy free alternatives tasting just as good andnot better in my porridge, tea, coffee and smoothies, and the dairy free butter even being nice on toast. The vegan chocolate also went down well, and I couldnapost get enough of the pea snack crisps. Other than the taste, another thing I noticed about the vegan meals was that I was not as full as I normally would be when eating a non-plant based meal, and felt hungrier than normal, perhaps because I wasnapost getting enough protein or eating enough carbs. Eating out was dficult    Despite their being places in Hull that cater for vegans , it was dficult to find a iety of choice when eating out at restaurants which cater to mainly meat eaters. I felt very picky when I went out for dinner to a aposnon-veganapos eatery, and was disappointed at the menu choice for my needs. Luckily there are places near me like Zoo Café which have a wide iety of veggie and vegan meals and donapost serve meat, but it would be nicer to see more vegan options on the menu at other restaurants around the city. I avoided wine and beer  Much to my dismay, and previously unbeknown to me, I found buying beer and wine a faff, as it can be processed using animal products such as isinglass , egg whites, caseinand even bone marrow, making it non-veganprocessed in this way. There are several common fining agents that are animal-friendly and used to make vegan wine and beer like limestone and silica gel as suitable alternatives, but it takes time to look for this on the back of a bottle, and is often more expensive, so I just gave booze and the pub a swerve for the week. But fortunately, virtually every brand of hard liquor like bourbon, whiskey, vodka, gin, and rum is vegan, so I took heart in this should I have wanted a drink. I felt better for it  Throughout the challenge, I actually had more energy through following the vegan diet, which gave me the boost to exercise more, and by the end of the week Iaposd actually lost weight and felt much better in general. My skin was also clearer, perhaps because I was eating healthier, and sorryitaposs oversharing, but I also noticed that I went to the toilet a lot more because I was consuming more fibre through all the veg, which may have also contributed to the weight loss. I also felt better morally that I was doing my bit for the planet and animals through the diet. Final thoughts  Even though I found the concept of going vegan for a week quite daunting, and found it dficult at first, I actually really benefited from the experience and would recommend everyone to at least give it a try to see how they get on. Iaposm certainly not saying that Iaposm going to turn my nose up to a crispy bacon sandwich from now on, or demand a nut roast instead of traditional old chicken, nor will I refuse a sausage and a beef burger at a barbecue, or shun a pizza topped with all the cheese. But living off a purely plant based diet has made me think just how much we rely on animal products, and how ingrained they are in our daily lives, which can be at times unhealthy. Iaposll happily give up milk, yoghurts and butter from now on, as I felt much better for consuming the non-dairy alternatives, and Iaposm going to make more of an effort to make more vegan meals as they taste great, and are better for the environment.

The council scheme - launched five years ago - is way behind schedule because of legal issues and red tape and at the time of filming last autumn, just  of the allocated  £ homes had been finished.One of these belongs to  childhood sweethearts Mel and Rob Hilton , who were prominently featured working to transform their £ house.   The first series also showed them dealing with some of the anti-social issues surrounding the area - including finding a bullet on their doorstep and witnessing a woman defecating in the street outside their home. In the first episode of the new series, which airs on Channel  at .pm tonight, viewers can see the remarkable progress Mel and Rob have made on their home. Where they were once surrounded by collapsed floors and rubble, they now have a beautul family home for their two children.    But some of the issues that faced them in the local area have not gone away. In the first series, the childhood sweethearts made the shocking discovery of a bullet on their doorstep and saw a woman defecating in the street outside their home.

One scene filmed on the infamous aposmischief nightapos on October  shows large groups of youths firing fireworks and causing problems around the Webster Triangle, with Mel and Rob talking about the effect it can have on their family.

The four-year-old is the spitting image of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridgeaposs second child, and her mum believes she looks more like her than the aposofficialapos lookalike. Her mum Gemma, , first noticed the similarities after someone pointed it out in Primark last year. She said: Marcy looks more like Princess Charlotte than the official lookalike does. People stop us as weaposre walking past and say aposoh, she looks so much like Princess Charlotteapos or admit theyaposve had to do a double take.    The first time it happened we were in Primark in Meadowhall and the woman serving us said aposoh god your daughter looks like Princess Charlotteapos. I donapost know why anyone would think she would be in Meadowhall in Sheffield without her mum - Iaposm not Princess Kate! It never clicked until she said it, it was only when I looked at pictures of her that I realised she does. The checkout girl at Birmingham Airport last year when we went on holiday to Turkey was checking her passport and did a double take too. Itaposs very flattering, Princess Charlotte is such a lovely little girl - always good fun and always looks beautul, itaposs a very nice comparison.    Marcy, who lives in Sheffield with her mum and dad Dylan Culverwell, , is  months older than her royal lookalike and even likes to dress in similar outfits. She hates wearing trousers and is happiest in skirts and dresses, similar to little Charlotte. Gemma said: Marcy gets very upsetyou put her in trousers. She likes wearing skirts and dresses because she says she doesnapost want to look like a boy. If we go to the soft play Iaposll say she canapost wear a skirt because she would burn her bum on the slide or flash [people] and that she needs to have trousers on but it isnapost worth the hassle. At that point I just say aposput what you want onapos. She has a wide iety of clothing. I like things off eBay or Primark and then higher end designer items - I like to do a mixture for her. One of her nanas goes to America a lot so she brings her loads of clothes back from there.    I wouldnapost go to the extreme of dressing her like Princess Charlotte but itaposs nice when people comment. Gemma said that more and more people have started commented on the similarity between her in the last year - both online and in person. And although not signed up with an agency Gemma said sheaposs open to little Marcy doing lookalike work. Gemma said: People have commented on photos Iaposve shared on social media saying how much she looks like her. Marcy didnapost look like her when she was a baby but has started to now that sheaposs older.    I put up a picture of Marcy next to a picture of Princess Charlotte and those who already thought it agreed. Other people commented saying they didnapost realised how similar they were until I put them together. I even had a woman message me and say aposI nearly stopped you in the school yard the other day to tell you how much she looks like Princess Charlotteapos. Sheaposs not signed with anyone but we are open to the possibility of doing lookalike work in the future. Princess Charlotte is known for her confidence, and Gemma said her little girl has a matching aposfeistyapos personality. She has been competing in pageant competitions for the past year which her mum thinks has helped her come out her shell.    Gemma said: She can be quite shy when you first meet her and then she never stops talking. She loves having her picture taken - singing and dancing and doing little shows. The pageants sheaposs been doing for the last year have brought her on loads with her confidence and itaposs lovely watching her on stage performing. Marcy has quite a feisty edge to her but Princess Charlotte has too - theyaposre like your modern-day princesses. Iaposve showed Marcy pictures of her and said aposthis is who people think you look likeapos.

Fares and routes would be regulated and bus firms would have to bid for franchises, making public transport less “fragmented and unreliable”. Labour and transport campaigners said Mr Burnham’s scheme could be a “blueprint” for other city regions, such as Bristol, Liverpool, Peterborough and Cambridgeshire. Mr Burnham said: “People’s patience has run out here and they want affordable buses linked to the train system, serving communities.” He will ask the Greater Manchester Combined Authority to approve the plan on Friday, then go to public consultation, with a final decision next year.    Greater Manchester would be the first city region outside London to use the Bus Services Act  to take control of regulating its buses.

Becki Van der Land is looking forward to meeting both babies despite discovering weeks into her weekend that one would not make it.Becki and her husband Cees were overjoyed to learn that they were expecting both a son and a daughter earlier this year, reports the Chronicle Live .But at the -week scan the couple, from Allendale, Northumberland, were told the girl twin was much smaller than her brother and showing signs of struggling. Tragically, her heart stopped beating five weeks later due to a genetic translocation.    As well as coping with the death of daughter, the devastating news also meant that Becki, , was at risk of losing the boy baby as well. But after more anxious weeks, he is growing well, and the plan is for dental technician Becki to carry both babies to full term. Sheaposll be born at the same time as her brother, hopefully in four monthsapos time, said Becki. It shouldnapost impact the birth too much, except psychologically. Iaposm feeling really positive - itaposs what you make of it, so itaposs still a very positive experience. Itaposs going to be the only time we get to spend any time with her.    Becki and Cees, an earth sciences lecturer at Newcastle University, had dreams of starting a family when they married two years ago. It was part of our wedding vows to have children, and we were thinking three, said Becki. Their dream came true for the first time  months ago when she gave birth to their daughter Ottilie. Becki said: Then we were ecstatic to find out we were expecting boy girl twins earlier this year. I sort of knew straight away it was twins because it felt completely dferent to my daughter. I also had a strange feeling that something wasnapost quite right.    On the first scan they both looked perfect, but at  weeks the little girl looked smaller, so we had scans every week. They said she was showing signs of struggling and was quite a bit smaller than her brother. What followed was two months of tests at the Fetal Medicine Unit at Newcastleaposs Royal Victoria Infirmary. Unfortunately at  weeks the family learned that the little girlaposs heart had stopped beating. They have since found out that she had chromosomal translocation called q-qter deletion syndrome and had lost her IGFR gene, which meant she had severe interuterine growth restriction. Becki said: Grieving for your lost baby whilst still carrying her and her co-twin is a bittersweet and unexpected situation to find yourself in. We were really upset but at the same time we were in quite a privileged position in that we had time to prepare ourselves for the sad news. The death of a twin puts you at high risk of also losing the surviving co-twin so we were again warned to prepare for the worst.    But I am still pregnant and growing rapidly with our surviving boy twin. He is thankfully looking strong and healthy. Carrying le and death now continues to make this pregnancy very special but in a completely dferent way to what we envisaged.

Researchers discovered taking children on day trips, buying video games and magazines, and the extra cost of childcare will set mum and dad back £ over the six-week break. And they’ll shell out more than £ per child just on food and drinks, including meals out, lunches during trips, as well as snacks and treats. The average summer holiday, either in the UK or abroad, will set families back a further £. per teen. More than four in  parents admitted being ‘worried’ about affording a summer’s worth of entertainment for their family. It also emerged nearly a quarter of a parent’s income goes on entertaining their teen over the long summer holiday, in a survey of , parents of teens aged - who are in education.    Chris Brown, director of sales programme recruitment at National Citizen Service– a three to four week summer programme which helps --year-olds gain confidence, build le skills and become more active citizens in their communities, said: “Our research has highlighted an issue for many parents across the country who are unsurprisingly worried about the cost of the summer holidays. “With the long break fast approaching, parents want to ensure that their teens are spending their time productively, without breaking the bank. The study also found the phrase parents fear most – “I’m bored” - is likely to be first uttered just eight days into the holidays – with fteen per cent of parents hearing it after three days or earlier.  This is despite kids being treated to special, yet expensive, day trips nearly nine times each over this summer’s six-week school vacation. Panicked mums and dads also admit to running out of ways to keep their child entertained only two-thirds of the way through the summer holidays. And it’s felt by the teens too, with four in  teenagers admitting they get bored over the school break. Another six in  admitted they want their summer holiday to be aposproductiveapos, while more than half also wished there was aposmore to doapos over the summer holidays. The research also revealed it takes less than three weeks for parents to hit breaking- point and wish their teens would hurry up and go back to school. One in ten parents admitted they don’t know how to advise their teen to make the most of the summer holidays.  Three in  worry their child will waste hours on social media and  per cent don’t think they will get enough fresh air. Half of the parents polled also admitted being concerned that their child will ‘waste’ the entire summer, according to the OnePoll research. Ellie Smith, mother of NCS participant Bradley Smith, , said: “Like many of the parents surveyed, I always wanted to make sure that Bradley was spending his school holiday productively. “I can definitely relate to the  per cent who admitted to being ‘worried’ about affording a summer’s worth of entertainment. “We didn’t have the money to send Bradley on a big residential trip or pay for lots of small activities so when the opportunity to go on NCS came up, it was ideal. Ellie, , of Bradford, West Yorkshire added: “NCS is a fantastic and financially feasible way for parents to ensure that their children have a fun, productive summer without having to spend hundreds of pounds. “I’ve seen a huge change in Bradley since his time on the programme - it was le changing for both of us.” Chris Brown added: “With summer holidays set to cost parents over £,, programmes such as NCS can help them not only save money, but also ensure their teens are spending the summer building skills that can help them in the future.”Places are still available for - year olds to take part in NCS.

The warnings are in force today and tomorrow, with the risk of homes flooding and travel chaos. A thunderstorm weather warning remains in force for almost all of England - apart from the south-west - and north-east and central Wales. Earlier a storm alert was issued for north-east, east, central, south and south-east England tomorrow. There is a chance of flooding in the areas affected by the weather warnings. Flash floods in Edinburgh this afternoon forced drivers to stand on the roofs of their cars to escape.    Roads were described as aposimpassableapos by residents, due to the depth of the floodwater. Vonny LeClerc, who posted a video of people standing on the roofs of their cars on Twitter , wrote: Unbelievable scenes in Edinburgh. The roads are literally bursting open like geysers.

There is a small chance of fast flowing or deep floodwater causing danger to le Where flooding occurs, there is a slight chance of delays or cancellations to train and bus services. Spray and flooding could lead to dficult driving conditions and some road closures.  Things will start to pick up on Wednesday as the country basks in sunshine. The mercury should rise to around C in south England, C in south Wales and C in parts of Scotland. Thursday looks set to be a gloriously sunny day for the whole of the UK, although it will not be quite as hot as the weekend, with the mercury rocketing from Friday onwards. The weekend heatwave will take hold on Friday as temperatures soar to C in London and then reach C on Saturday. The scorching heat in the south-east will subside on Sunday, dropping back down to a maximum of C, with theof cloud.  Met Office chief meteorologist Dan Suri previously said: “It’s going to feel much hotter for most areas across the UK this week. Our latest forecasts show the highest temperatures are expected towards the end of the week, most likely across central and southwest England, where temperatures could rise into the low s Celsius. “This will be in stark contrast to the low temperatures we’ve had  so far this June .  It’s also going to feel humid and quite muggy - especially at night time - as temperatures could remain in the high teens or low s Celsius in places. Whilst some places within warning areas could miss thunderstorms altogether and enjoy a warm, bright day, where they do develop torrential downpours, hail, lightning and gusty winds are likely and a few spots could see as much as -mm of rain in one hour – which is very unusual for the UK.

Police eventually found more than  men and women cooped up in a three-bedroom terraced house in Barking, east London, which was infested with cockroaches. There was a curtain in the middle of the room where they had beds and the curtain was separating the couples from the men, the woman, who was recruited from a bar in Romania, said.    I said four because in fact there were many more and I was never sure of the names. You can imagine I would change in the bathroom, but I could not sleep in at ease in my PJs. The curtain would move it would be pulled across because they had to get to the door. There was hot water, but it would stop precisely when you were having a bath. We were given a ration. The main part for switching the water on and off was in the kitchen.

Natasha Biran, from Manchester, had moved to Israel in August , where she met her husband Yair and now they have two children, Maoz, five, and two-year-old Geshem. Natasha has always loved travel and even went to the University of Birmingham to do a degree in American Studies, because it included a sandwich year away in Arizona, USA. In May , Natashaaposs father died and the family of four took a sudden and expensive trip to England for his funeral. The visit inspired them to want to travel the world with their two children in tow. The couple were both already working and making money online as translators, editors and writers and so were in the perfect position to become digital nomads.    A digital nomad is someone who can make their living online and so is free to move where they wish, thus being location independent, but internet dependent. I love peace and quiet but Iaposm also really sociable. The most important thing to me is to live my le with gratitude and love, Natasha said. Iaposve always loved travelling. I chose my degree in American Studies with Literature, History and Politics based on the sandwich year in Arizona, USA. It was the best decision ever. We spent a small fortune flying to England for his funeral and from there our journey just began on its own.  We didnapost make any special steps to save money to pay for our travels but we make enough monthly to cover all of our costs. Besides being a full-time mum, Iaposm also a part-time translator, editor and writer. Yair and I work together and all our work is done online. This gives us the flexibility to work and travel. Since the family left Israel they have travelled to England, Germany, Thailand, Sri Lanka and India. One of the biggest lessons of their travels has been how to keep their relationship strong while being around each other all day, every day. Theyaposve improved their communication skills and learnt to take time out for themselves. I think the main challenge of our lestyle choice is when Yair and I have our moments. Weaposre really committed to creating a harmonious environment for the family but naturally when we spend most of our time together, conflicts do arise.  The children have adapted amazingly. They love travelling. Geshem was really little when we started travelling so this is just le as she knows it. Maoz tells me he wants to travel forever. He has been on a total inner journey, heaposs become really flexible and open. The journey has created so much space for meaningful interaction between our children and their relationship has really developed, they are really close and share a lot of love and fun together. I home school my children on the road. This is also known as road-schooling and thereaposs a strong element of un-schooling weaved in there. Maoz is only five and back in Israel kids donapost actually start school until they are six years old. Theyaposre both really sociable and curious about the world and learn so much from all the experiences and people they meet along the way.    She added: We donapost know how long we will keep travelling for, we are always checking in with ourselves that our hearts are leading us and that our actions feel right for us as a family. Weaposve learnt not to make any sweeping statements about the future as we never know what will happen. We live a lot in the present and usually book our flights to new places about a week before we travel. Our family have been supportive, but they really miss us. We equally miss them a lot too and really hope theyaposll come visit us soon. You can travel the world without tons of money. Our hearts are the wisest compasses in the history of humanity and weaposll all be happierwe listen to them.

Another entry read: “I am no psycho, I feel too much. I always have.” He also wrote about embracing his darkness and animal instincts. Harvey contemplated his financial future after eliminating his family. “I have a good job … I am not rich but far from poor,” he wrote. “I won’t have much money when I leave.”  The day before he butchered his family, Harvey and Maria went to the bank and she signed a form allowing him to use the funds without her.

I love you so much.” Harvey stayed in the house for days before going to see his parents and eventually handed himself in on September . Ms Forrester argued Harvey should be “deprived of his liberty for the rest of his days”. “I appreciate it’s a dreadful thing to contemplate, locking up a -year-old for the rest of his natural le,” she said. “But when a person destroys an entire family in the way he has — in a premeditated, violent, callous way — then community interest requires that.” His defence lawyer said Harvey was young and was remorseful for his crimes.

The customer, Caleb Jeffrey Lee, from Petaling Jaya, Malaysia was disgusted to find dozens of slimy creatures crawling through the chicken meal he purchased on  June. He ordered the meal from Sari Ratu Prima restaurant in the city of Petaling Jaya, in Western Malaysia’s Selangor State using popular food delivery service GrabFood. In a video he posted online, the larvae can be seen roaming in the chicken flesh near the bone. Mr Lee made a complaint to delivery service GrabFood and brought the matter to Malaysiaaposs Ministry of Health and the Kuala Lumpur City Hall.   Mr Lee wrote on Facebook : WTF! Halfway eating and I saw this...This was ordered from Sari Ratu Prima - Jalan TAR using Grab Food delivery. Grab has responded to my case and will be providing a full refund. Theyaposre investigating the case with the restaurant operator. Iaposm not putting any blame on Grab since theyaposre only the delivery service provider. The entire blame is on Sari Ratu Prima as they were the ones who prepared the food. Will share once Grab responds with more updates. The Ministry of Health said they would launch an investigation into the incident, Mr Lee was told.  GrabFood has since issued him a full refund and claim they will investigate the case with the restaurant operator. Meanwhile, Sari Ratu restaurant has invited Mr Lee for a face-to-face meeting next week to apologise over the incident. In a separate Facebook update, Mr Lee added: Grab called me to apologise, and to convey apology from Sari Ratu.

France does not allow women to wear the burka. Many pools in France likewise ban the burkini. Burkinis, a mix of the words burka and bikini, are marketed to Muslim women as a way for them to swim in public while adhering to modesty edicts.    It remains controversial in France, where authorities in several French towns have proposed banning the garment altogether. Proponents of the nationwide ban on the full-face veil have cited security concerns. The swimmers were warned by leguards that wearing the burkini - which does not cover the face - was an offence.    But the women who took part in the protest at the Jean Bron pool in Grenoble on Sunday were happy to accept the fines they received from police in order to make a stand. According to news website France Bleu, officers fined the women  euros . Citizen Alliance said the women had been inspired by Rosa Parks to carry out the protest, which came ahead of what is expected to be a remarkably intense heatwave in France and other parts of Europe.    One of those involved, Taous Hammouti, said the women did not want to accept another summer deprived of access to public pools. It comes  years after their inspiration, Ms Parks, was arrested for refusing to give up her seat to white passengers while riding on a bus in Montgomery, Alabama. Her defiance led to a boycott that eventually led to the end of racial segregation on buses in the US.

Especially here, where they have an extensive menu dedicated to them categorised by flavour and even offer “cocktail experiences” for those looking to learn from their mixologists. Our waiter recommended a real fruit mocktail with lots of real crushed fruit and berries and juices to provide a thirst quenching mix without the alcohol .We relaxed into the quiet and sipped our drinks in the sun as we pondered over the vast menu options.The venue’s interior is a mix of classic wooden floors with soft leathers and muted tartans in greys and brown, combining traditional charm with modern comfort. vw, px\"  The menus are bound in heavy leather books, and there was plenty of choice.My other half ordered bruschetta to startwhich, of course, we ended up sharing. Well, I am eating for two!Who knew that three simple slices of toasted bread with oils and tomato could be so delicious  Also, both of us were pretty in awe of the little yellow tomatoes – spot the uncultured pair.I toyed with the idea of my usual steak pie-pick and even deliberated a fish dish, but in the end we both went for the same main course of chicken tikka curryand it was presented beautully.The plate held rice and naan with a small dish of mango chutney and a large dish of gorgeously bright-coloured chicken tikka.The chicken was wonderfully soft and the tikka sauce was full of flavour, not too salty with just a bit of zing. vw, px\"  I’m notoriously soft when it comes to anything spicy, but this was just enough for me and I only needed water for my tingly lips towards the end of finishing the plateful.We were both equally surprised at the portion size from the Caird. Although it felt upmarket, there was no scrimping on the food.I chose the brownie for dessert and my partner the sticky toffee pudding . Again, both platefuls looked almost too good to eat.My dark chocolate brownie was topped with drizzled caramel sauce next to a scoop of vanilla ice cream with sprinkles of crushed chocolate and chocolate sauce. Strawberries and homemade fudge was presented to the side in a design with shards of wafer and small dollops of salted caramel and strawberry mousse. It sounds like a lot of flavours and it was, but in a good way.My partner’s slab of sticky toffee pudding was also teamed with a large scoop of ice cream, crushed chocolate, a large wafer and a couple of raspberries, sprinkled with icing sugar.We both finished the lot.The whole evening was lovely and relaxing. We could hear the live musicians in the bar from where we were seating which provided great listening.

An implementation plan was produced in December  to cover the years -. Who in Argyll and Bute is responsible for this plan  How many of the outcomes have been achieved As someone who has been involved with autism personally and professionally for many years, I find it extremely disappointing there seems to be an inability by those in authority to get organised enough to address the issues and provide services for autistic people and their families.There is no need for further drafts and consultations.Someone in the authority needs to take responsibility for the existing strategy and implementation plan and get on with it.Maureen Mackintosh, Ardrishaig.Sir,Scotland’s small building firms had a strong start to , in contrast to the UK construction small and medium sized enterprisesector, according to the Federation of Master BuildersScotland.The FMB State of Trade Survey for the first quarter of , the only quarterly assessment of the UK-wide SME construction sector, showed SME workloads declined for the first time in six years.In Scotland, however, there was a jump of  per cent compared with the previous quarter. Thirty per cent of weighted responses were positive, up from  per cent from the fourth quarter of .It is encouraging the Scottish construction industry is bucking the wider Brexit trend with workloads and enquires in rude health. The UK-wide picture is very dferent, with the construction SME sector overall contracting for the first time in six years.Scotland’s good fortune could be due to fewer EU workers being based north of the border compared with other parts of the country, like in London where one in three construction workers are from the EU.Relying less heavily on migrant workers has meant the Scottish construction industry hasn’t fallen foul of thousands of EU workers ing home during the long march to Brexit due to no longer feeling welcome in the UK or sure of their future here.Scotland’s builders, however, must not be complacent. Looking ahead, the First Minister has indicated thatthe UK does leave the EU later this year, she wants a second independence referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in . This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next. For construction SMEs, this is particularly concerning as their prospects are vulnerable to dips in consumer confidence as so much work comes from the private domestic sector.Gordon Nelson, Director of FMB Scotland.Sir,I was joined by my fellow Conservative councillors in Kilmory recently as we discussed atthe numerous challenges facing Argyll and Bute.Ferry sailings, roads, education and the SNP#s late single farm payments were all mentioned.With the SNP hammering local authority spending and cutting our budgets, challenges in delivering services will become more prevalent.Despite this climate of cuts from the separatists, Conservative councillors are delivering for Argyll.

There will also be opportunities for farming and we must ensure that we make the most of these opportunities to build a forward-looking, progressive and resilient sector that benefits farmers and consumers throughout the UK.We would like to invite all UK MEPs on to farms in their local areas to discuss a range of priority issues and to answer any questions that they might have. We are also inviting them to meet with us in person in Brussels and with our permanent staff in our Brussels office, the British Agriculture Bureau.Andrew McCornickMinette BattersJohn Daviesand Ivor Ferguson "},{"url":null,"title":"show us your mojo","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowDon#t miss out on your chance to play on MOJO#s unique live stage on October  in Ardfern.Bands have only three weeks left to enter their demo on to MOJO organisers, so don#t delay to be part of this exclusive night of original live music.

Design fleets comprising the Sigma s, Sonatas, Etchells and Hunter s joined the racing at Tarbert.Amid a flurry of rib activity laying and moving marks, it was not long before the CYCA  passage race fleet approached the finish line.The teams later caught up in the bar for the day one prize giving as new event chairman Glenn Porter welcomed everyone to Tarbert. With a number of races omitted due to protests, it was a nice easy start for Glenn.The Hunter s and Sonatas saw a spread of results after some close racing. The CYCA class  fleet on the Largs passage race was won on corrected time by Celtic Spirit. Additional prizes were awarded to Encore for the passage race line honours and Shona of Ashton for toughing it out at the rear of the passage race.Saturday was a much more challenging day on the water with a light wind and dreich drizzle.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"monsters and magic come to lochgilphead booksigning","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead#s Argyll Book Centre is holding a book signing with Lari Don.The Secret of the Kelpie author will be in the indie book shop on Saturday June  to read her new book to eager ears and talk to readers about their favourite folk tales and inventing monsters.After a quick break, Lari willto read excerpts from her spellbinding Spellchasers trilogy to inspire you to imagine magical adventures of your own and tell one of your favourite myths.Born in Chile, Lari Don was brought up in Scotland where she has worked in politics and for the BBC.

However, he followed that bogey by birdieing the second, third and fourth holes to take him to two-under-par through four.Another birdie on the eighth took him out in  shots, three under par. Turning for home, his round really caught fire with a fantastic eagle three at the par-five th.He then birdied the th and th to take his score to seven under par after  holes.The course record at Machrihanish is held jointly by George MacMillan and Stuart Campbell at seven-under-par s and Niels had the record firmly in his focus as he came down the home stretch.The disappointment of a bogey five at the tough par-four th was soon extinguished with a birdie two at the short th as Niels continued to blaze a trail over the magnicent Old Tom Morris-designed links.His sizzling round continued with assured pars at the th, th and th holes to finish with a course record equaling seven-under-par .A club spokesperson said: #This is an incredible achievement by the young golfer, whose record will take pride of place on the wall beside the cards of great champions, Stuart Campbell and George MacMillan, in the new clubhouse once it is ready.#George started his round early on Saturday and was the leader in the pro-shop after his own fantastic round of two-under-par .

Stuart lost a little more ground after a nine-over-par  on the tough second day.The third and fourth rounds of the championship are next weekend on Saturday and Sunday, June  and .Niels holds a six-shot lead over George and is  ahead of Stuart in third place.The spokesperson added:#The three will play together in the top group and it will be intriguing to see how the youngster copes with having two club legends chasing him down in the final two rounds.#Donald Laing, home from France for the championship, won the Jim Scally Trophy for the two best handicap rounds over the first two days with -- in round one followed by -- for an excellent combined total of ."},{"url":null,"title":"junior championships well under way","story":"The lead in the -hole championship is shared between Murdo McLean and Fraser MacBrayne who both had s.

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack. The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area. In the winter one would have to wear a wetsuit, of course, but the conditions are ideal and the wave forms have great potential # after all, they are coming straight in from the Atlantic over the north of Ireland.#What I#d like to see is a surf club established in Campbeltown. It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week june 7 2019","story":"As I retreat into the comfort of a warm house and an even warmer coffee, I wonder what it must have been like for Columba and his fellow monks as they made their way from the shores of Ireland to the wilds of Argyll.The fragile shell of a coracle was not the most effective shelter against the wildness of our coastline.Yet they came.

There are several factors influencing this, but the major factor which has tipped the balance is the extended funding hours and the negative impact this is having both financially on small businesses, like Mary Poppins, and to the quality of early learning and childcare.New Scottish Government policy instructs councils to increase their funded childcare hours from  to , by . This move also includes longer opening hours and a move from term time to year-round opening hours to attempt to make childcare more nationally accessible.Ms Dewar said: ldquoThe money received for funded places does not cover the costs of providing the quality of early learning and childcare which we want and are required to provide, especially with regards to staff costs.ldquoThe timescales and measures that the Scottish Government has put in place to educate a workforce to meet the increased requirements are insufficient, and there is a serious shortfall to meet the requirements of the extended funding.ldquoEast Lothian Council indicated it estimated it would require approximately  staff to facilitate the increase in funded hours in East Lothian. The majority of these posts are early learning and childcare practitioners.ldquoThe local authority advertises early learning practitioner posts at between pound. and pound. per hour. Private nurseries are unable to compete with these rates of pay due to the funding rates we are allocated.A group of parents and staff, including Ms Dewar, are visiting county MSP Iain Gray to discuss the problems, but Ms Dewar added that unless he can ldquowork a miracle and change the policy, then it is unlikely the decision to close the nursery will be reversed.When asked about the nursery, Mr Gray said: ldquoThe loss of any nursery provision is disappointing, particularly with the Governmentrsquos , funded hours policy set to be implemented next year.ldquoIn the case of the Mary Poppins Nursery, the owner has highlighted a number of factors that have contributed to their decision to close.ldquoI have written to East Lothian Council about some of these issues.ldquoHowever, there are also wider issues at play here. The nursery sector has been warning the Scottish Government that private nurseries are struggling in the run-up to the roll-out of its flagship , policy from August .ldquoMinisters must act quickly to address the sectorrsquos concerns and ensure that the capacity exists to deliver the funded hours next year.A Scottish Government spokesperson said: ldquoIt is, of course, concerning to hear of any nursery considering closure, and the obvious effects this might have on staff, parents and children.ldquoEast Lothian Council has provided assurance that they will support families to find alternative early learning and childcare places for children who had been expecting to use the Mary Poppins Nursery from this August.Ms Dewar added: ldquoI am distraught that circumstances have forced me to this decision and that such a wonderful place for children to experience their early years is to close.The decision was met with an outpouring of grief on social media.The nurseryrsquos recent th birthday was marked with a garden party.The nursery was founded by Sue Armstrong, affectionately still called lsquoMiss Suersquo, after she had written to Mary Poppins author P L Travers to askshe could use the name.Miss Sue said: ldquoI received many letters from P L Travers about the nursery.ldquoAt the beginning, she wanted to know what the nursery was going to be like. She had no objection to me using the name, she just wanted to find out more. I ended up meeting her as well.ldquoWe were hoping to get her to come and open the nursery  years ago, but her arthritis was bad. We stayed in touch, however. I would send her letters about how the nursery was getting on along with photos, and she would write back saying how she liked it, and ideas of what to do.ldquoShe said that the children should be encouraged to make up their own stories. lsquoChildren like doing that,rsquo she said.Miss Sue sold the nursery to Ms Dewar in  as she was ldquosick of all the paperwork.She said. ldquoWhen I heard it was to close down, well, itrsquos just all so sad really. Itrsquos such a terrible shame.ldquoIt is such a nice and happy place for the children, homely and warm.

Five minutes in a car can cover a distance which would represent a fairly long walk.Itrsquos kind of a simple principle, I know, but one I sometimes forget, as I did a couple of weekends ago. We set off from an event at Amisfield Walled Garden for a walk. My idea was to walk along the River Tyne to Hailes Castle and thenndash by car a -minute round trip.We had some supplies in the form of fruit in my bag and a little water. It was a sunny and warm day and so we set off on our adventure.We began the walk at the old Abbey Bridge which spans the Tyne close to Amisfield. As you walk under its ancient ribbed arches of this late medieval bridge, you get a real sense of its age and the beauty of its construction.The path beyond follows the river and it is almost impossible now to imagine that a great abbey once stood here, with connections to the infant Mary Queen of Scots. A ruined old mill of later centuries still stands here. I reflected on the stories of this location: a courageous nun who defied a flood in the th century and a gruesome murder in the th century and just visible in the near distance the old graveyard, now ringed with trees and almost unrecognisable as a resting place for the dead.A labourer once thought he saw a ghost at the graveyard, but it proved to be something , and I had a wry smile at that tale of a drunken evening over  years ago. These are all tales I have already told here, but they entered my head as we wandered to the gate that led along the northern bank of the river.Hailes Castle is on the southern bank of the river and I knew that there was a bridge that would takes us over. So we set off to find the bridge.But it took us over four hours.It was a stunning walk, with wild flowers and trees decorating the riverbank almost all the way. A grey heron seemed to follow us perhaps he was warning us that the walk was longer than Irsquod anticipated.It is a walk decorated with history too, of course. A stone in the corner of the field by the first gate caught my eye. Deeply ingrained groove marks on it intrigued me. I was later told that it could be the marks of a plough, as the tips of the plough have scraped over the stone a ploughman unwittingly leaving evidence of his unrecorded toil.Halfway along the walk we arrived at the small hamlet of Sandyrsquos Mill. The cottages and mill itself have been beautully restored. The th-century mill still has its waterwheel, although itrsquos now embedded in silt. The mill ceased working  years ago and was transformed into a residential property, but with much of the old machinery inside still intact. It appears to be a very sympathetic and sensitive restoration.It was beyond Sandyrsquos Mill that the distance began to take its toll. The young kids were tired and desperately looking for the bridge. I spotted Traprain Law some distance away and realised that I had badly misjudged the distance and time it would take with wee ones. We had to sit and have a rest and story, with that grey heron listening, to gather the energy to continue.The kids didnrsquot complain much as we wandered along the still-beautul path, now desperately looking for the bridge. As we had rested wersquod phoned for friends to come and lsquorescuersquo us at Hailes Castle with chocolate and water, and we knew they were there waiting for us.Irsquove never been quite so pleased to see Hailes Castle. It loomed suddenly from across the river. I had never approached it from this direction and it certainly did its best to impress. The bridge was just a wee way further and we finally crossed it with a sense of relief.When we arrived at the castle, the kids devoured the chocolate and water, in a way that reminded me of a scene in the movie Ice Cold in Alex. Thank goodness for good friends.Wersquod made it and what a sense of adventure ndash and an achievement!I sat with the kids and told stories as my we went with the friends to retrieve our car. Hailes Castle drips with history but they wanted tales about giants.The day was a lesson for me: to think more carefully about distance when setting on a walk! I thoroughly recommend the path, especially on a lovely summerrsquos day. But itrsquos going to take half a dayyou have kids. So prepare for that!Unbelievably, the kids later wanted to go to a playpark. ldquoWhere do they get the energy  my we asked.ldquoFrom us!

Frequency should be half-hourly.Councillor Tom Trotter, who represents Haddington, backed the station bid.He said: ldquoIt is a good idea, especially with the town expanding as it is.ldquoIt would be a tremendous asset to have.However, the councillor felt it was more likely the station would have to find a new site, such as Alderston, to the north of the town.He added: ldquoIn the short-term it is unrealistic, but hopefully in the longer term things can be put in place to make it a realistic possibility.ldquoIt is a great idea and Irsquom sure it would get support from all the local ward councillors, but where it would go and how much it would cost are questions."},{"url":null,"title":"preview-prestonpans-gala-2019","story":"This year is the th anniversary of Prestonpans Childrenrsquos Gala.On gala day itself, the festivities kick off with the crowning ceremony at am at Prestonpans Community Centre.There is then a fancy-dress competition at Middleshot Square at noon before the parade heads off through the town.From Middleshot Square, it heads along Hawthorn Road and down West Loan to the war memorial, then along High Street before turning up Redburn Road, then along North Grange Avenue, where it ends at Mary Murray Park, behind the community centre.The park hosts the gala dayrsquos family fun, which includes a funfair with a host of rides, as well as old favourites such as hook the duck.There is also a vintage fire engine on display, as well as an American police car, motorbike displays, ponies, birds of prey, beat the goalie, Zorbs, safe archery, NERF guns, crazy golf, a tombola and a gala raffle, not to mention ice cream vans, tea and coffee, Mr Donut Man, crepes, waffles, hot dogs, nachos, a burger van, La Favorita pizzas, stalls selling gts, sweets and cake.Gala day marks the beginning, not the end of Prestonpansrsquo week of fun and activities.Events are as follows:Saturday, June Monday, June Tuesday, June Wednesday, June Thursday, June Friday, June "},{"url":null,"title":"bid-to-turn-former-rbs-in-north-berwick-into-a-house","story":"The townrsquos Royal Bank of Scotlandclosed in June last year.

Even customers buying it as a ready made kit still have to assemble it themselves.He said: ldquoThat is a deliberate and interesting move because it shows computers are not just black boxes, but have dferent components that are brought together.ldquoWe need people to understand that computers are not magic and not something to be apprehensive about and this is something that people can play with and use without being scared of breaking it.Mr Upton created the Raspberry Pi in  while at Cambridge University, originally as an inexpensive tool to teach children how to code.Over the last  years more than  million units have been sold to a wide iety of users including computer enthusiasts, academics and businesses, often to monitor environmental factors such as temperature or to control cameras.The company currently sells six million devices a year, giving it just over two per cent of the global PC market."},{"url":null,"title":"pensions-agency-needs-23m-after-bungling-it-plan","story":"The Scottish Public Pensions Agency , which runs the retirement schemes of teachers, NHS staff and emergency workers, spent pound.m on integrating IT systems without a clear business case, after accepting an ldquoabnormally low bid with an ldquounrealistic time scale.Contractor Capita then failed to hit any project milestones and the plan had to be scrapped, and the SPPA now needs poundm of public money to get back on track.Auditor General Caroline Gardner said Capitarsquos inability to hit its targets was ldquothe main contributor to the failure, but also blamed the SPPA for not setting objectives for the project, failing to scrutinise it, and a debilitating churn in its leadership.The Scottish Tories said it was ldquoyet another botched IT contract on the SNPrsquos watch, while Labour accused ministers of letting the SPPA get away with ldquoextreme negligence.The SPPArsquos problems go back to a  plan to integrate its pension administration and payment systems to achieve efficiencies and meet new pension rules.However there was ldquono evidence of a clear business case to justy the route taken, ldquonor evidence that it had fully considered other options.Because Capitarsquos tender price was so cheap, it was officially classed as ldquoabnormally low and the SPPA had to checkit was a ldquovalid bid.The SPPA warned the Scottish Governmentrsquos Legal Department that it didnrsquot have the skills to interrogate the tender deeply, but the SPPA then ldquotook no further action and accepted Capitarsquos reassurances.A rival bidder even issued, then withdrew, a legal challenge to the SPPA decision as the bid was so low.The SPPA awarded Capita the contract in October , with the project due by March .Despite the -month target, the SPPA chose not to extend its existing systems in case of delay, which auditors called ldquoa high-risk approach with an unrealistic timetable.By May , Capita was warning it would miss its first milestone, with further failures forcing the SPPA to extend the le of systems at an unplanned cost of poundm.By late , the project was two-and-half years behind schedule, and in January , amid growing concerns, the SPPArsquos chief executive pulled the plug.Of the pound.m spent on the project, pound.m went to Capita, with the rest spent on extending existing contracts, staff costs, software licences and specialist help.Although it recovered pound.m from Capita after a financial settlement last November, the SPPA has written off pound.m in assets it will never use.It now estimates it needs pound.m capital and pound.m revenue funding from the Government over the next five years to modernise its IT systems properly.Ms Gardner said: ldquoThe public sector is under pressure and we are seeing more instances of bodies embarking on IT projects without the necessary staff and assurance arrangements in place to manage them properly.ldquoIn this instance, I found no evidence of a clear business case for a new integrated system, which was pursued at a time when the SPPA was going through signicant change.ldquoThe result was a project that failed to provide value for money and has considerably set back the SPPArsquos planning.Tory MSP Bill Bowman said: ldquoThe Nationalists should have learned lessons from similar failings with farming payments, NHS  or even Police Scotland. But instead, we have another shambles which is draining the public purse when it can least afford it.ldquoThis report poses some serious questions for the SNP government.ldquoIt has allowed this agency to get away with extreme negligence, and seems to have watched on while an agreement which was patently too good to be true was signed.Scottish Labour MSP James Kelly said: ldquoThis is an absolute mess which has cost taxpayers millions of pounds. Auditors found that the SNPrsquos cuts to public services has left them under pressure and under staffed, leading to botched projects like this.ldquoWe now know Derek Mackay is sitting on half a billion pounds of unspent money.

Mr Sherpa estimated  tents had been left on South Col, and as much as ,lbs of refuse.Bringing it down is a herculean task, when any misstep at such altitudes could be fatal.It is impossible to know exactly how much litter is spread across Everest because it only becomes visible when the snow melts.At Camp , two levels higher than Base Camp, the campaigners believe that around ,lbs of human excrement were left during this yearrsquos climbing season alone.Some climbers do not use makesht toilets, instead digging a hole in the snow and letting the waste fall into small crevasses.However, rising temperatures have thinned the glacier, leaving fewer and smaller crevasses.The waste then spills downhill toward Base Camp and even communities below the mountain.People at the Base Camp use melted snow for drinking water that climbersrsquo toilets threaten to contaminate.For the Nepalese who regard the mountain as ldquoSagarmatha, or Mother of the World, littering amounts to desecration.Climber Nima Doma, who ed recently from a successful ascent, said: ldquoEverest is our god and it was very sad to see our god so dirty.ldquoHow can people just toss their trash on such a sacred place "},{"url":null,"title":"stuart-waiton-why-are-football-fans-treated-with-such-contempt","story":"With only , of the , tickets being made available to the Liverpool and Tottenham fans and with predictions of , Liverpool fans travelling, there was a clear need to help facilitate the watching of what is one of the biggest games in world football.But, rather than extend the fan zones, install more big screens around the parks in Madrid and encourage the celebrations, UEFA instructed the Madrid authorities to close the fan zones at pm and banned the showing of the game on any big screens, leaving fans to aimlessly walk the streets in search of a bar that wasnrsquot already packed out.The first Irish bar we tried was full, the owner pointed to other streets and bars but the bouncers shook their heads.

We... want a third runway  I mean, I cant speak for anyone I know because the topic of Heathrows third runway has absolutely never come up in conversation with friends, not at the dinner table, not at the bar, never in the office. I may, of course, be in the minority of Scotland-dwellers who fail to prioritise money spent on infrastructure  miles away in London.I am, though, certainly in the minority of people I know: I quite like connecting through Heathrow. I have never heard anyone Scottish ever express this preference - they quite emphatically try to avoid Heathrow, in fact.Perhaps the Foreign Secretary has been reading the prophetic, but lesser known, words of the Bard ahead of his trip to Scotland: \"Some hae flight but cannae skite, and some wad skite that want it. If only Heathrow had wan mare runway, we could, to Hunt, be thankit.\"And then, his spectacular misread of voters desires made public, Mr Hunt lands in Peterhead clutching a can of Irn Bru and a fish supper. The scene was obviously staged - there is no way in hell that fish supper would have been safe from swooping North Sea seagulls for more than mere moments. It begs the question, did Hunt have minions with Super Soakers warding off the birds It is the only explanation and one that bursts the myth of him as man of the deep fried dinner people. Yet it gets worse.Who, one must ask, advises Westminster politicians that supping Irn Bru will give them an instant in to the Scottish populace Hunt, who said he would, \"Protect the union with every drop of blood in my veins,\" during his visit, is pictured with a can of the fluorescent orange national drink having made mention of a Scottish great-aunt and childhood summers spent in Aberdeenshire.\"You can trust me,\" hes trying to say, with his can aloft, \"I love Jockland. Im just like you. Mmmm, tastes like girders.\" Actually, he described it as \"very pleasant,\" damning with faint praise.Hes not the first. A can of Irn Bru has become a political barometer of cross-border desperation. Forget his weak line on Brexit, it was the beginning of the end for Jeremy Corbyns relationship with Scotland when he was pictured smirking on a train with a bottle of Bru.SNP MP Deirdre Brock was quick to criticise his \"silly grin\" and tactless misstep.Boris Johnson, too, has been foiled by a faked preference for Irn Bru. He was pictured in a stage-managed stunt enjoying the luminous elixir from a glass.This was his Scottish downfall. No self-respecting Irn Bru drinker would decant it its straight from the bottle - or can, at a push - but a true Scot would never use a glass.Irn Bru is no plaything, as surely any basic research from an advisor would find out. Whitehouse relations fell to a perilous low when Trump Turnberry banned Irn Bru for its deleterious effect on the resorts carpets.\"We canrsquot have it staining when to replace the ballroom carpet would be pound, alone,\" Turnberryrsquos general manager, Ralph Porciani, said. \"We have villas here with Irn-Bru stains in the carpets which I canrsquot let.This is so obviously fake news as to be painful.

Maybe not shirts. Perhaps his fake tan begins at the neck and wrists, the rest of him as peely wally as his Scottish heritage would ensure. Let us not dwell too long upon this thought.Give a Westminster politician an Irn Bru and he will magically assimilate, seems to be the thinking. The Scots will view him, can in hand, as a man of understanding.

Bailies of Bennachie outreach officer Fiona Cormack said: “It was a special moment to have everyone joined together around the top of the hill.“Participants sang along to the sound of the Kintore Pipe Band playing Scotland the Brave, Flower of Scotland and Auld Lang Syne.“Some did a Mexican wave, others swung arms and some took a little time to reflect on their reasons for doing the walk.“One family from New South Wales in Australia took part and there was great support for this community event from the towns and villages around Bennachie.”“Mither Tap means ‘mother’s breast’ and that led us to raise money for breast cancer care and the University of Aberdeen Development Trust’s research into cures for breast cancer through this event.“We know that many people who have been affected by the disease took part in the walk.”One of the participants, Kate Brosman from Daviot, said she was last up Bennachie after her diagnosis and before her treatment.She explained: “I promised myself that I would come back once I was through the other side. It has been a while and I wasn’t sure that I would make it to the top but I was just up in time for the bosie and feel I have parked the whole experience there.”Funds raised will be spilt after costs between the two breast cancer charities and the Aberdeen Mountain Rescue Trust who provided marshals on the day.The Kemany Scout group also came out to help with members assisting with car parking and marshalling. data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Gerry Stephens, Financial Director for Mackies of Scotland, Cllr Anne Simpson, Aberdeenshire Councils Culture and Sport sub-committee vice-chair, Cllr Gillian Owen, Aberdeenshire Councils Education and Childrens Services Committee chair, Cllr Anne Stirling, Aberdeenshire Councils Communities Committee chair and author Vivian French\"  Scoop up books to win ice cream prize viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"After the bosie walkers ed to the field at the Back of Bennachie where they rested in the sunshine and enjoyed pizza, ice cream and coffee and cakes provided by local caterers.

This year local Scottish Fire and Rescue team will once again have a fire engine at the clinic to help draw attention to the clinic.Councillor Drever added: #The safety checks are carried out by a specially trained Good Egg Safety expert, not police officers # so people should not feel they are at risk of getting into trouble.“Rather it#s an opportunity to get some reassurance that your car seat is compatible with your vehicle, and to get tips and advice on any adjustments that would improve the car seat’s performance. We#d urge anyone who drives children about # whether that#s childminders, grandparents and parents or wider friends – to drop into the clinic. It is five or ten minutes of your time well spent.”The Good Egg Safety Child Seat clinic will be held in the Tesco car park in Kirkwall on Wednesday July , running from am to pm. There#s no need to book — just look for the Good Egg rep in the Tesco foyer, or head for the red fire engine.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

They want to hear from the owners of all kinds of properties, from urban studio flats to historic country piles. From Shetland to Stranraer and Orkney to Oban, prime properties from all over Scotland will be in the frame.Jo Street, commissioner for BBC Scotland, said: “We’re delighted to announce a second series of Scotland’s Home of the Year. It isn’t just about showing off million-pound properties – it’s about truly celebrating what people have done to turn their house into a home, expressing their iniduality through their design, flair and imagination. We saw some cracking houses over the course of series one and there are far more gems to uncover for series two.”The first series of Scotland’s Home of the Year was broadcast on the new BBC Scotland channel in April and May this year.The series has since seen its audience continue to grow on iPlayer with requests to view so far hitting more than a quarter of a million – ,.The format saw three judges – architect Michael Angus, interior designer Anna Campbell-Jones and lestyle blogger Kate Spiers – travel theand breadth of Scotland to discover architectural gems and unearth some stunning interiors. Both traditional and contemporary properties were put under the microscope and judges considered everything from a one-bedroom apartment to a centuries-old country castle … and everything in between.Each home was scored on ality, distinctiveness and clever design and from seven finalists, one clear winner of series one was chosen – the White House in Kirkcudbright, Dumfries and Galloway, created by proud owner Lesley Smith and her late husband Mike.Series two will have a slightly longer run than series one with nine -minute heats, each featuring three properties from a specic part of the country. The  houses featured will then be whittled down to a final nine which will go under the spotlight in an hour-long final episode.Gerard Costello, executive producer, IWC Media said: “We are thrilled that Scotland’s Home of the Year is ing to the BBC Scotland channel. The first series was a joy to make and we have only scratched the surface of the beautul and distinctive homes Scotland has to offer. We can’t wait to get started.”If you’d like to be considered for the next series of Scotland’s Home of the Year, you can get in touch at scotlandshomes@IWCMedia copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Providing practical training for riders where they can improve their skills and understanding of risks through controlled exercises is a vital part of this strategy.“Motorcyclists are vastly over-represented in serious road injuries, so I hope that Orkney’s motorcyclists will take up this opportunity to both become a safer road user and improve their overall riding experience through better bike handling skills.”Anyone interested in attending the course should email: operationriderrefinement@scotland.pnn.police.ukcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Not content with writing just one book, he decided to author two: one will be the scuttle story in photographs, From Scuttle to Salvage, which will be launched this Thursday, June . The  other, The Last Days of the High Seas Fleet, is the more in depth story of the German Naval mutiny, and how the Fleet came to be interned in Scapa. Both are on sale at the Orcadian Bookshop.As with Jutland, Nick decided to tell the story in film. He is passionate about passing history on to his childrens’ generation, and says he felt that this would be a best way of reaching younger people who prefer video to text. The -minute animation has already been seen by more than , people online, and was made possible through crowdfunding and the help of numerous museums and archives, the Kirkwall Library and Archives being among them.Nick will be talking about the scuttle on June  at pm at the St Magnus Centre, where with him, many of the descendants will participate.

Admirers of the high art of comedy may be familiar with an especially brilliant sketch written and performed by David Mitchell and Robert Webb. The pair – dressed in Germany army unorms – are on a World War Two battlefield, preparing an attack. Webb’s character, puffed up and confident, puts down a field telephone, and declares, “They’re coming. Now we’ll see how these Russians deal with a crack SS ision.”As distant gunfire echoes, Mitchell’s character approaches, nervously clears his throat, and begins, “Hans…”“Have courage, my friend,” says Webb’s alpha.“Yeah, eh, Hans, I’ve just noticed something,” comes the reply.“These communists are all cowards.”“Have you looked out our caps, recently ” asks Mitchell’s beta.“Our caps ”“The badges on our caps, have you looked at them ”“What  No… a bit.”With an anguished look on his face, Mitchell’s character continues, “They’ve got skulls on them. Have you noticed that our caps have actually got little pictures of skulls on them ”“I don’t, um…”“Hans,” Mitchell’s soldier continues, tentatively, “…are we the baddies ”There is more to come and I urge you,you haven’t seen it, to seek out the sketch, online. It is masterful stuff that endures almost  years after it was first broadcast on the double act’s BBC Two sketch show.Perhaps what makes this sketch so timeless, beyond the excellence of the performances, is that it captures something with which we can all identy. Which of us hasn’t, at some crucial point in our lives, been stricken by a moment of crushing self-doubt  Which of us hasn’t wondered whether, maybe, we are in the wrong I watched the sketch again last week and it occurred to me that it could not be more relevant, right now.Self-examination has never been so unfashionable uncertainty is a weakness to be deplored . Among the political classes, absolute certainty must be maintained, even in the face of crushing evidence that destroys one’s assertions.Think of the bluster of former SNP leader, Alex Salmond, who led the war against nuance during ’s independence referendum campaign. Any dficult question about how he might oversee the break-up of the UK was dismissed by Salmond as part of a “Project Fear” campaign designed to terry voters who might not have believed independence to be in Scotland’s best interests. Salmond’s aggressive reaction to legitimate inquiry created a culture in the Yes campaign where the done thing was not to consider the question but to question the motives of the questioner. After all, since we could be certain that independence would be a very good thing with no downsides, anyone who suggested otherwise must have had malice in their hearts. Of course Scotland would retain its EU membership after voting Yes, insisted Salmond, in the face of remarks from the EU that contradicted him. Of course an independent Scotland would enter into a currency union with what was left of the UK, despite assurances from the then chancellor and his Westminster shadows that no such arrangement would or could take place. Of course Scotland, standing proudly alone, would be wealthy and prosperous, even though the price of North Sea oil – on which this assertion was based – was plummeting.This absolute certainty infected the Yes campaign which, often, mistook angry shouting for debate and went on to discover that it needed more than blind faith to persuade a majority of Scots to support the independence project.A year later, as Donald Trump ramped up his campaign to become American President, dangerous certainty reached a new, even more disturbing level. Evidence of Trump’s misdeeds – things like film and audio recordings and paperwork that, by any standard, proved he was unsuitable for the role he sought – was rejected by the candidate as “fake news” and his supporters, so utterly convinced that Trump would make good on his promise to “make America great again”, accepted his words as truth. To question Trump’s claims was to be a traitor.And in , the same characterisation of doubt as weakness proved invaluable to Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson as they bluffed their way to victory in the referendum on EU membership. Their every proclamation about “freedom” and “sovereignty” was accepted, without question, by their disciples. Self-reflection can be a painful business it’s hardly surprising that we are so uncomfortable about doing it. It’s so much easier to blame a former partner for the break down of a relationship than it is to consider whether our own behaviour might have played its part. It’s comforting to think that we missed out on a promotion because the interviewer had it in for us rather than because, maybe, another candidate was better suited. Over recent weeks, we’ve listened as contenders to become the next leader of the Conservative Party and, by extension, Prime Minister of the UK, have set out their “plans” to achieve Brexit where Theresa May failed. With the honourable exception of Rory Stewart, whose decision to engage with reality rather than to rely on fantasy ruled him wholly unsuitable for the \u2028job, these men relied on loud declarations of certainty to maintain their campaigns.The final two candidates – Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt– are still at it. They’re still telling us they can get a new deal out of the EU, even as the EU insists the withdrawal agreement struck with Theresa May is the only one available.Hunt and Johnson – or, more accurately, the parade of lickspittle MPs who have appeared in the media in his stead while he hides from scrutiny –continue to assert, with bullet-proofed certainty, that they have plans to make a success of Brexit when all the evidence says that they damned well do not.The certainty of politicians comes with a large dollop of nauseating moral superiority on top.

Only delivering Brexit on  October cannormality to British politicsExactly three years ago this morning I walked out of Milbank Tower, Westminster, after an all-night party arranged to take in the results of the UK’s EU referendum.I had a smile as bright as the dawn and wide as the Thames itself. We had only gone and done it the campaign to leave the European Union had blown the bloody doors off. British politics would never be the same again.I was always confident about the outcome of the referendum and repeatedly cheered-up my less optimistic colleagues that they were in the process of making history. Although behind in the polls for most of the campaign the cross-party and non-party coalition of Leave supporters had at least three advantages that gave us an underlying edge. The first was Prime Minister David Cameron had been poorly treated by the European Union’s political elite who stupidly dismissed his attempt to show he could win reforms. This was a serious political misjudgement by Merkel, Hollande, Juncker, Tusk and their aloof colleagues, displaying a symptomatic arrogance and condescension that continues to this day. Had they conceded deliverable reforms demonstrating a willingness to decentralise and loosen their inexorable drive towards ever closer union then the Leave campaign would have had a far harder fight on its hands.• : Nicola Sturgeon: Chances of no Brexit now more likelyAlthough Cameron’s shuttle diplomacy is mostly forgotten now its repudiation set the context in which the referendum would be played out – the British looking for the repatriation for more controlsagainst a European establishment who had stopped listening and paid only lip-service to keep troublesome natives docile.The second advantage was that there was not one campaign to Leave – but many. While Vote Leave eventually won the official designation to run the Leave campaign the competition to win the designation that came first from Leave.EUand latterly from Grassroots Out, meant there was not one strategy reaching out to voters but three. In addition, a long list of dedicated groups that had been campaigning for at least a generation, such as The Freedom Association, Bruges Group and Global Britain had been joined by the likes of Labour Leave to reach out to people that might otherwise have fallen off a centralised campaign grid. Together with UKIP members – a party originally founded by the Scot Professor Alan Sked in response to the Maastricht Treaty, and then made politically successful by Nigel Farage – they also provided boots on the ground that were willing to work with the many Conservatives who took the brave pills and opposed their leader and Prime Minister.It is thanks to the happenstance of this hydra-headed approach that the Leave result was achieved despite the official campaign, rather than because of it.• : Brexit deal is dead: Prepare for No Deal vs No Brexit – Brian WilsonThe third advantage was the solely negative approach taken by the Remain group, which learned nothing from the almost fatal negativity of the Better Together campaign in the Scottish referendum. After dropping any mention of Cameron’s fudged and worthless reforms George Osborne, Nick Clegg, George Carney and their lieutenants relied upon a constant feed of scaremongering and doom-laden reports, forecasts and supercharged extrapolations of unreliable predictions to frighten voters of what might come – not just in the future but “immediately following” a vote to leave. Just as many of the similar threats did not cut through in the Scottish referendum they failed dismally to motivate support for the European project that had been the common purpose of the global political elite and their civil servants since the Second World War. Even rolling out President Obama worked against British pugnaciousness. Most economic threats were seen as out of touch and simply not believed, but where they might have ben effective were still dismissed as irrelevant – people wanted control of their lives back. That is why cities such as Sunderland and Derby with their Nissan and Toyota car plants, or Redcar with its closing steel mill, still voted Leave – and still support it today.That the UK should go on to create over , new jobs in the following three years and maintain its lead in attracting Foreign Direct Investment ahead of Germany and Francedemonstrated who really lied in the referendum. Nor should we forget the Remain campaign outspent the Leave campaign by £.m to .m not counting the Government’s own pamphlet that cost £.m to print and distribute to m households before expenses rules kicked-in. The result was determined not by money but by having messages that chimed with what ious voters thought.The fallout since that day three years ago has been immense.Cameron broke his promise to stay only for another remainer, Theresa May, to replace him unchallenged. Her litany of broken promises are well recorded and I offer no sympathy for it must be understood, she dealt her own hand and then played it badly. It was she who relegated her government from a working majority to an imploding minority she who chose the strategy of repeated concessions over the advice of her ministers tasked with the negotiations and she who refused to listen when confronted with defeat, after defeat, after defeat.Instead of capitalising on the Conservative failure Jeremy Corbyn has preicated so often that Labour politicians compete to claim which direction he faces– Leave or Remain, second referendum or general election  Likewise the SNP has become trapped in the Leave headlights, fooling itself that Brexit can deliver independence rather than seeking to deliver a successful government.Having retired, believing his job was done, Nigel Farage has come back and formed the Brexit Party which has earned him the plaudit of bringing down two prime ministers without him even being in the House of Commons. Now he must hold the feet of Boris Johnson orJeremy Hunt to the fire.

Abandoned - BlissThe first dog to arrive at the centre was -year-old Spaniel Grace, found by a member of the public at the side of the road. She was taken to the vet immediately, but after an owner didn’t come forward, she was brought to Dogs Trust.Two weeks ago, another Spaniel - aged eight and nicknamed Bliss by the team - was found tied to a fence not far from the rehoming centre. Like Grace, the Spaniel has not been microchipped, which has been a legal requirement for all dogs since  and the easiest way to identy a dog who has become separated from their owner. Shockingly just one week later, a Cairn Terrier - less than a year old, was found by a rehoming centre staff member at the very same spot where Bliss was left. Terrier Rizzo was lucky to be found as she is quite small and it would have been easy to miss her in the long grass.The most recent addition to the ranks of abandoned pooches is Sally, an eight-year-old Collie cross, who was found as a stray by a member of the public and brought to the rehoming centre.Abandoned - RizzoOonagh Philips, Rehoming Centre Manager said: “We want to remind anyone who no longer feels that they can care for their dog to contact their local rescue organisation for support. When a dog is abandoned on the road side, it not only puts them in danger, but also drivers.

We could tell Rizzo hadn’t eaten in a while, which could have resulted in a deterioration of her physical health.

As a result of its strategic importance both sides concentrated some of their best armoured regiments and equipment in this area. The Guards Armoured Brigade comprised of three tank battalions and had been set up and trained in England. The three battalions were the nd Battalion of the Grenadier Guards, the st Battalion of the Coldstream Guards and the nd Battalion of the Irish Guards. The Irish Guards were recruited from Northern Ireland and the nd Battalion contained men from the Province. You can see it in the tank commanders names. We have Agnew, Brennan, Carson, Connolly, Healy, Harbinson, Mahoney, McCorkell, McGuire, McHugh and Robinson amongst others.The nd Battalion Irish Guards was equipped with American Sherman tanks. These were  ton Medium tanks and mainly equipped with a  mm gun, a useful weapon against infantry but not entirely satisfactory against tanks. The battalion was organised into sub units. There were three squadrons in the battalion, each composed of four troops and each troop had four tanks. The Irish Guards named their tanks after towns and the nd Squadron named theirs with B’s. So we have Ballina, Bangor, Bantry, Belfast, Benbane and Ballynahinch. We also have Ballyraggett and BallymenaBallymena was a special Sherman tank. Ballymena did not have the standard  mm gun. The inconvenient truth for the Allied tank crews was that their tanks were not as good as the best of German ones. A German Tiger tank, for example could destroy a Sherman tank at a distance of over a mile. A Sherman on the other hand would be lucky to harm a Tiger at  yards.  The Britsh crews themselves had already concluded that a Sherman tank was not considered as safe a location as many would have been believed. Hence they covered the front with extra metal tracks and the propensity of the Sherman to do a “Ronson”, that is light up, encouraged the crew to get out very quickly.To deal with the stronger German tanks the Allies devised a way of mounting a bigger gun on some of the Shermans. This new gun was so big it meant redesigning the tank and reducing the size of the crew. These Shermans, now armed with a  pounder gun, which referred to the weight of the shell it fired, were nicknamed FireflyThe Irish Guards arrived in Normandy  days after the initial D Day landings. Caen had still not been completely captured so the Irish Guards eere given a mission to help bypass the city of Caen by gaining ground to the east of the city and drive towards the village of Cagny. This was Operation Goodwood, named after the racecourse in England.Undercover of darkness on the night of th July, Ballymena and the other tanks moved over the River Orne on newly constructed bridges and prepared for battle.The smoke, noise and movement of the battlefield created chaos. Units became mixed up and both sides sometimes got lost. This led to one of the most famous incidents of the battle. By the middle of the afternoon of July th the Irish Guard’s assault is under fire, stalled and mud bound outside the village of Cagny. Lt John Gorman of B Squadron th troop commanding a mm armed Sherman called “Ballyraggett” gets slightly ahead of his comrades and spots a German King Tiger at about yrs. Knowing his gun could do little damage to the King Tiger, Lt Gorman chose a dramatic course of action. He had previously briefed his crew Gunner Albert Scholes, Driver James BaronRadio operator Agnew, and told themhe got the chance they would adopt “Navy tactics”. He instructed Baron to drive at full speed ahead and prepare to ram the German tank. Firing a high explosive shell at close range stunned the inexperienced German crew but had little impact on the tank. However, the high speed collision effectively immobilized both tanks. The Sherman and the King Tiger were abandoned and their crews hid in the fields.Lt Gorman realising the King Tiger was still a viable threat ran towards the nearest Sherman Firefly, in the knowledge only a  pounder gun on the Firefly could do any meaningful damage. This was Ballymena. Some of Ballymena’s crew were already either dead or injured but Gorman jumped in and directed fire on the abandoned King Tiger.  The fighting continued for a while but eventually Gorman was able to rescue his own and other crews and get back to safety.For his exploits Gorman - later Sir John - was awarded the Military Cross. Editor’s note: Sir John, who died aged  in May , was a Northern Irish Roman Catholic Unionist with an unflinching sense of service.After the war he joined the Royal Ulster Constabulary before becoming a senior manager with British Overseas Airways Corporation, then head of the Northern Ireland Housing Executive. Finally he was elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly as the sole Roman Catholic member of the Ulster Unionist Party, and served as Deputy Speaker until the Assemblys suspension in . He was a frequent visitor to Ballymena during his time with the NIHE and he never failed tomention that he had married a Ballymena woman, Norah Caruth. Lady Gorman, passed away peacefully in Ringdufferin Nursing Home in .

At the time it was taken in the iconic Flamingo Ballroom, they were members of local rock’n’blues band, Tailor.The band was formed in the early s by Tucker McIlwee and John Tennant.“Other band members who played with Tailor over the years were Ronnie McAuley, Hubert Dunlop and Ricky Maybin, Henry McQuillan, Dave Moore Trevor Erwin andGerry McNeely. We were transported to and from the gigs by Brian Surgenor, ” says John.“Our first gig was at a place called Betty Staffs in Belfast but we travelled throughout Ireland playing most of the towns on the circuit.“Amazingly, we had never played in Ballymena until Sammy Barr of the Flamingo approached our manager to offer a booking.”It transpired that Tailor were playing on the same bill as Rory Gallagher. As you would expect, the group were excited but, in their own words, ‘not overwhelmed.’John remembers: “We met with Rory and his band during set up,. Rory was a very down to earth guy. We discussed what songs we were going to play as we were going to have a one hour set. The Flamingo was full to the brim, the crowd were electric and Tailor recieved a tremendous welcome.“Following the gig we met with Rory for the photo call. The rest is history. Tailor continued to travel theand breadth of Ireland entertaining the young and not so young ravers until the group members went their seperate ways after six years of traveling on the road.”After years of inaction the group reformed to play two gigs for Cancer research, The Countryman Inn and the Telecom Club were filled to capacity for the night of nostalgia and entertainment. pound was raised for charity.And John ponders: “Will the group do it again  Watch this space!”Rory Gallagherwas an Irish blues and rock multi-instrumentalist,songwriter, and producer.Born in Ballyshannon, County Donegal, and brought up in Cork, Gallagher recorded solo albums throughout the s and s, after forming the band Taste during the late s. His albums have sold over  million copies worldwide.Gallagher received a liver transplant in , but died of complications later that year in London at the age of .He began playing after school with Irish showbands, while still in his early teens. Having completed a musical apprenticeship and influenced by the increasing popularity of beat groups during the early s, Gallagher formed The Taste, which was later renamed simply, Taste, a blues rock and RB power trio, in .Performing extensively in the UK, the group played regularly at the Marquee Club, supporting both Cream at their Royal Albert Hall farewell concert, and the blues supergroup Blind Faith on a tour of North America.After the break-up of Taste, Gallagher toured under his own name. The s were Gallaghers most prolic period. He produced ten albums in that decade, including two live albums, Live in Europe and Irish Tour . November  saw the release of the album Deuce. In the same year he was voted Melody Makers International Top Guitarist of the Year, ahead of Eric Clapton. Though he sold over thirty million albums worldwide, it was his marathon live performances that won him greatest acclaim. He is documented in Irish Tour , a film directed by Tony Palmer.During the heightened periods of political unrest in Northern Ireland, as other artists were warned not to tour, Gallagher was resolute about touring Ireland at least once a year during his career, winning him the dedication of thousands of fans, and in the process, becoming a role model for other aspiring young Irish musicians.

Parishioners and well-wishers packed into Corpus Christi Church for am Mass as the Springhill congregation came together to give thanks for Fr Des’ dedicated service to the West Belfast community.Parish Priest of Corpus Christi Fr Paddy McCafferty, who celebrated the special service, praised Fr Des’ “immense strength and dedication” within and to the community and said the depths of gratitude felt towards him are “immeasurable.” “Fr Des is a champion of the people, Fr Des saw was needed to be done and did it, he is a man without equal.”“Fr Des co-ordinated, instigated and educated the community. I’m almost lost for words when it comes to describing him. I was looking up the meaning of the word ‘platinum’, it means hard wearing, hard, Fr Des was rock hard in his work for the community. What would people have done without him ”On celebrating his Platinum Jubilee Fr Des said: “I never thought I would get this far.“There were more than  priests ordained the same day as I was, most of them are gone from this world, a mere handful of us laughing about which of us will reach the th birthday first.“What I want to do now, most of all is to thank God for allowing me to live among such good family, friends and neighbours during those years. You taught me what le means you taught me that especially during the bad, sad times. I believe we are seeing the beginning of a renewed Ireland, a renewed Christianity, a renewed city of Belfast – and we are privileged to live in one of the most beautul parts of the city – between the beautul mountain that is full of surprises like the feast of bluebells in the beginning of summer to the snow topped hills in winter, between the sweeping magnicent valley of the Lough and the Lagan,” he said. “This must surely be one of the most beautul places for a city to be in.”Fr Des continued: “This is where I learned the best lessons about le and I am grateful to family, friends, neighbours who taught me and even had great patience when I learned so slowly. I learned how good people show their dignity even during the hardest of times, show it most of all during the hard times. “So I am grateful to God for being here, grateful, to all whom I have had the privilege of being family and neighbour to. And very, very hopeful for the future.“Coming out of the worst of times we could now be facing into the best of times. May God and good people make it so. Father Paddy, like our friend Father Aiden, you are with us all at the beginning of a newly awakened Church and a people refreshed by what they have suffered and achieved together. We have good reason to be thankful for that and for each other.#"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"from detroit to north belfast how a big name does a big job","story":"TO say the name Kronk Boxing Gym is iconic in the sport would be an understatement. Located in Detroit and once led by trainer Emanuel Steward, the name is a household word in the sport of boxing.But North Belfast has its a Kronk Boxing Gym, located in the Duncairn Centre on Duncairn Avenue.Formed as Belfast ABC over  years ago by Bobby McAllister, one of the best coaches in Ireland at the time, the club has come a long way since.In December , former secretary of the gym, Damien McCann, played a pivotal role in Limerick boxer Andy Lee turning pro. He then negotiated a lucrative financial management agreement for Lee to turn professional with Emanuel Steward from the world renowned Detroit Kronk Boxing GymLee was Ireland’s rising amateur boxing star and when he beat USA champion, Jesus Gonzales in the semi-finals of the World Junior Championship, a new relationship between Steward and Kronk in Detroit was born with Belfast ABC gym, hence its name today, Kronk ABC Belfast.Past professional coach Tony Dunlop has been a key figure throughout the history of Kronk ABC Belfast and spoke about the club’s illustrious time.“This place started over  years ago when Bobby McAllister walked past the building which was derelict at the time and thought it would be perfect place for a boxing gym,” he explained.“He asked people in the community who were very positive and said that it would be great for young people in the area.“After a period of time, a lot of kids came through the doors. Ryan Burnettt and Paddy Barnes both started off here.“Burnett was groomed from his early days in here to become a superstar. He left here at  fights undefeated and was one of the best in the world at just  years old.“The turning point I suppose was when Emanuel Steward from Kronk gym in Detroit, which is the best gym in the history of boxing, got in touch.“He saw some of the work we were doing and Belfast Kronk Boxing Gym was born –the rest is history as they say.“We have continued to bring through a lot of champions including professionals James Tennyson and Daniel McShane.“Tommy McCarthy is also here now fighting professional.”Today, the club is going from strength to strength under the stewardship of a new breed of coaches in the shape of Paddy Saunders and Martin McCullough.The duo have embarked on a new programme of coaching young people from North Belfast with the aim of using boxing to their benefit.Tony added: “Paddy Saunders and Martin McCullough are both fantastic coaches. They are flying the flag for Belfast Kronk Gym today.“They have started off a new programme with the youth of the area. They are both giving it a million per cent. I’ve never seen two coaches work as hard. Kronk Gym could not be in better hands.”Classes for - to -year-olds take place every Monday, Wednesday and Friday from .pm to .pm with classes for  years and older from .pm to pm on the same days.Paddy Saunders explained: “Many of the kids have behavioural problems and some suffer from autism.“These classes are an outlet and something to focus and concentrate on.“It is not all about boxing but something for them to do. They don’t miss classes.“If we get a few champions out of it, then brilliant, but it is for the kids.“Most boxing clubs don’t take kids at eight years old, but we do.“All the kids start off exercising and running about the big hall before they come into the boxing gym itself.“They are putting their energy into something positive instead of being on the street and engaging in vandalism and anti-social behaviour. I believe there is a bright future for boxing in North Belfast. We have a top-class facility and there are a lot of good kids in here.”To find out more about the club and to get involved, check out the new Kronk ABC Belfast Facebook page."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"local mla gets brexit safety alert","story":"POLICE have delivered an extraordinary advice list to the West Belfast home of a Sinn Féin MLA suggesting ways in which he can improve his and his family’s personal security post-Brexit.The document has already been delivered to the homes of all  MPs across the United Kingdom, but officers who called to the home of Máirtín Ó Muilleoir said they are widening distribution of the document to take in Brexit spokespersons of parties in the north. The leaflet – headlined ‘When It Goes Too Far’ – outlines steps that politicians should takethey are targeted by extremists in any wave of public unrest that may break out post-October , the latest deadline for the UK leaving the EU.The document – which Mr Ó Muilleoir yesterday branded “Brexit bollox – has been compiled by a number of UK agencies: the National Police Chiefs’ Council, the Crown Prosecution Service, the College of Policing and the Electoral Commission. Despite its wide experience in dealing with public unrest, the PSNI has not been involved in drawing up the guidelines. But local police officers have been tasked with distributing it to MLAs closely connected to the Brexit issue.To the fore in the security advice is what Mr Ó Muilleoir and his family should do in the event of being targeted with a hazardous substance. Police advice is to:• Leave the house and seek fresh air.• Treat itchy or painful skin with water.• Remove outer clothing – but not by pulling it over the head.• Remove any substance that may contact clothing or skin by using a dry absorbent material or brushing it off.Advice is also included on what signs may signal the presence of hazardous substances in the home.The leaflet also advises politicians not to engage with iniduals who may be “stalking harassing” them, either online or offline. It urges them to seek further advice on personal safety and building security from their local police force and to conduct a review of what personal information about them is available online.The leaflet explains that the advice is being forwarded for politicians to consultthey are subjected post-Brexit to “unacceptable levels of harassment and intimidation”. It continues: “In some cases, these behaviours and actions have reached the criminal threshold. The worst examples have led to violence and injury.”The most serious example of Brexit-inspired violence was the murder of Labour MP Jo Cox in June  in West Yorkshire by a gun- and kne-wieldingman holding extreme pro-Britain views. Mr Ó Muilleor said: “It seems preposterous to me that the PSNI is promoting Brexit security advice compiled at the behest of a UK government which for three years has shown itself so thoroughly inept in its handling of the issue. There’s little in this that isn’t already known to most people and no reason why it couldn’t have been emailed to me rather than dispatching a police patrol. There are Catholic families in my South Belfast constituency living under the jackboot of the UVF and the flegger bully-boys. The PSNI would be better advised to protect those folk rather than wasting their time and my time with this Brexit bollox.”"},{"url":null,"title":"9000 in northern ireland apply to secure status after","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

https:t.co QZTQcoK— Prosperity-UKJune , Its interim report recommends:– Investigating the possibility of creating special economic zones to cover the border.– Creating a multi-tier trusted trader programme for large and medium-sized companies, with exemptions for the smallest firms.– Using mobile units to carry out sanitary and phytosanitarychecks – covering food safety and plant and animal health – away from the border.– Drafting an alternative arrangements protocol which could be inserted into either the Withdrawal Agreement or used in any other Brexit outcome.The commission was chaired by Tory former ministers Nicky Morgan and Greg Hands.Treasury Select Committee chairwoman Mrs Morgan said: “The commission has met its three conditions: to uphold the vital Belfast-Good Friday Agreement to harness existing technologies and customs best practice, not any futuristic high-tech unicorns and to be compatible with any of the possible Brexit outcomes, including the existing Withdrawal Agreement.“A successful agreement and roll-out of alternative arrangements would supersede the need for the backstop.”But Owen Smith, former shadow Northern Ireland secretary and a supporter of the People’s Vote campaign for a second referendum, said: “The idea of trying to replace the Northern Ireland backstop with so-called alternative arrangements has already been tested to destruction.“There is no political will to do so from either Ireland, the rest of the EU or most importantly the people of Northern Ireland, particularly those living on or near the border.”He said the commission was “a desperate attempt to make a square peg fit into a round hole in order to try and hold the warring factions of the Conservative Party together”.Naomi Smith, head of the pro-EU Best for Britain campaign, said “a solution years down the line won’t cut it: we have a deadline of October  this year” and the proposals would “wrap the island of Ireland in red tape and bureaucracy – at a hefty cost to the British taxpayer”.“A quicker, cheaper and more efficient option would be to stop Brexit,” she said."},{"url":null,"title":"varadkar casts doubt on alternative arrangements plan for irish border","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

UK’s withdrawal from the EU.If there is a no-deal Brexit at the end of October, Ireland will be under an obligation to protect the single market.Leo VaradkarThe Taoiseach made the remarks at the end of an EU summit in Brussels as European Council president Donald Tusk said Brexit would become “more exciting” than before with a change of British prime minister but that the EU’s position had not changed.Mr Varadkar said: “We can’t accept that alternative arrangements are an alternative to a backstop unless we can see what these alternative arrangements are, know how they would work and see them demonstrated.“That hasn’t been done yet and I don’t see that being done this side of October  which is why we certainly can’t accept the deletion of the backstop.”He added: “For us, a deal without a backstop is effectively no deal because it means that there is no legal guarantee we won’t have a hard border, there is no operable mechanism by which we can avoid a hard border, it would just be a case of trying to pull it off, which I don’t think really is much of a solution.”Mr Varadkar said EU leaders had reaffirmed that the Withdrawal Agreement was not open for renegotiation and they agreed that negotiations would only take place between the UK and the EU.But he said the Irish government would have an “obligation” to protect the single market in the event of a no-deal outcome.“If there is a no-deal Brexit at the end of October, Ireland will be under an obligation to protect the single market, it’s our single market, our economy and our jobs are dependent on it,” he said.“We will have to make sure that Ireland doesn’t become the back door to the European single market.”He added that the only way he could see of being sure of avoiding a hard border was through regulatory alignment.Asked about the Tory leadership race, Mr Varadkar highlighted that both of the candidates, who remain in the running to become prime minister, had voted for the Withdrawal Agreement.He said he looked forward to holding a meeting with the new prime minister and discussing potential changes to the Political Declaration.But he reiterated that there would be “no implementation period for the UKthere is no Withdrawal Agreement and there will be no Withdrawal Agreementthere’s no backstop”."},{"url":null,"title":"brexits impact on many crossborder initiatives

However, the -page mapping exercise gives an insight into the extent we could be impacted.The scope of areas highlighted is broad and includes everything from health, travel, waterways, animal movement and organised crime and drugs to benefit fraud, schooling, library provision and teacher and doctor qualications.For each of the  sectors, the document species the extent to which it is underpinned by the Good Friday Agreement as well as by existing EU legal and policy frameworks.In the case of the North West Cancer Centre, the report points out that the initiative was based on an intergovernmental agreement between Health Ministers from both jurisdictions.It says the centre at Altnagelvin Area Hospital, which opened in November , \"offers radiotherapy services closer to home for many patients from the north west, reducing their travel time signicantly\".Similarly, the All-Island Congenital Heart Disease Network is identied as ensuring that \"vulnerable children\" receive treatment on the island of Ireland.

Other less obvious areas mentioned in the report include the operation of cross-border taxis repatriation of waste and cross-border movement of waste, and even the management of Lough Erne eel stocks.It also species areas such as invasive alien species, chemicals regulation and wildfire initiatives.DUP MEP Diane Dodds said that in the majority of areas ongoing cross-border cooperation would be addressed by retaining the common travel area and pursuing an agreement on free trade and customs. \"In many cases, where frameworks are highly integrated, the circumstances are not unique to our province,\" she said.\"For instance the conditions required to operate both the Enterprise service between Dublin and Belfast and the Channel Tunnel will require a very similar technical agreement with Brussels. Genuine concerns in areas like agri-food and healthcare must be taken seriously.\"Sinn Fein MP Chris Hazzard said an expert  is not needed to show how disastrous a no-deal Brexit will be. He said: \"The British Government has now convened a  of experts to determine the impact of a no-deal Brexit on the North. \"It neednt have bothered as a range of experts have already given dire warnings of the disastrous impact a no-deal Brexit will have on the Norths economy, our rights and the Good Friday Agreement.\" Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington said the documents were part of \"initial scoping work\" by the Government, supported by the Civil Service here, the European Commission and the Republic.Mr Lidington said they were intended to form the basis of discussion and not final products.

It is for democratic politicians in the democratic world to do so,” he said.The chairman of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee Damian Collins said Sir Nick was wrong to say there was no evidence that Russia used Facebook to interfere in the referendum.“He is technically wrong on that point which he should know,” he told BBC Radio ’s Today programme.“We asked Facebook whether there was any evidence of Russians buying ads during the referendum.

He repeated his call to meet diplomacy with diplomacy, noting that Iran dismissed it two weeks ago as “inflammatory”.Mr Ravanchi said he agreed with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres’ call to de-escalate tensions in the Gulf region, but said that was up to the United States, not Iran.He ruled out any talks with the Trump administration.“You cannot start a dialogue with someone who is threatening, who is intimidating you,” he said, accusing the US of trying to destroy Iran’s economy.Mr Ravanchi urged the UN chief to initiate “a genuine regional dialogue on regional security … so that we will see a new region for the generations to come”.....Sanctions come off Iran, and they become a productive and prosperous nation again - The sooner the better!— Donald J. TrumpJune , The Security Council issued a statement condemning the latest attacks on oil tankers and urging all parties “to exercise maximum restraint and take measures and actions to reduce escalation and tension”. The statement made no mention of the drone attack.France, Germany and the United Kingdom issued a separate statement warning that increased tensions in the Gulf since the drone attack “risk miscalculation and conflict”.The three countries called for “de-escalation and dialogue” and reiterated their support for the  Iran nuclear deal that Mr Trump pulled out of last year.Responding to the US administration’s “maximum pressure” campaign against Iran, French Ambassador Francois Delattre told reporters: “The message of France is we’re in a time where maximum pressure only makes sense with maximum diplomacy. So that’s where we must go.”Russia’s UN ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, also referred to the US desire for dialogue with Iran.“Some of the Iranian officials recently said that you cannot have a dialogue with a kne against your throat,” he said. “What kind of dialogueyou are introducing the worst kind of sanctions ever ”"},{"url":null,"title":"mike pompeo looks to build coalition amid tensions with iran","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Freedom of navigation is paramount. pic efuZqEOpK— Secretary PompeoJune , The US announced additional sanctions Monday on Iran aimed at pressuring the Iranian leadership into talks. The sanctions, re-imposed after Mr Trump withdrew from the nuclear deal, have crippled the Iranian economy and pushed up the cost of living. Iran has decried US sanctions, which essentially bar it from selling its oil internationally, as “economic terrorism”.Mr Pompeo, considered a hard-liner in Washington, referred to Iran as “the world’s largest state sponsor of terror” before he embarked on the hastily arranged Middle East stops on his way to India, Japan and South Korea.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo exits the plane at sunset as he arrives in Abu Dhabi He said he would be speaking with leaders in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates “about how to make sure that we are all strategically aligned, and how we can build out a global coalition … not only throughout the Gulf states, but in Asia and in Europe” that is prepared to push back against Iran.But Germany, France and Britain, as well as Russia and China, remain part of the nuclear accord that lted sanctions on Iran in exchange for set limits on its uranium enrichment levels. Mr Trump pulled the US out of the deal last year.Germany, Britain and France have sent envoys to Tehran recently, signalling they remain committed to diplomacy and dialogue. They cautioned against moves that can lead to conflict between the US and Iran.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Iranian merchants conduct their business at a carpet market of the old main bazaar in Tehran, Iran Berlin appears cool toward US talk of a global coalition against Iran as it tries to salvage the nuclear deal. German media have drawn parallels between Mr Pompeo’s talk of a coalition and President George W. Bush’s “coalition of the willing” against Iraq in , which Germany and France opposed.German foreign ministry spokesman Christofer Burger said his country had “taken note via the media” of Mr Pompeo’s comments and that Germany’s “top aim is and remains a de-escalation of the serious situation”.On Monday, Mr Trump tweeted that China and Japan depend on the security of the Persian Gulf waterways for the bulk of their oil imports, and he asked why the US is protecting the shipping lanes for other countries “for zero compensation”.“All of these countries should be protecting their own ships on what has always been a dangerous journey.” He said the US doesn’t “even need to be there” because it produces much of its own energy needs.Brian Hook, the US special envoy for Iran, said one option could be to “enhance” an existing multinational maritime force of about  countries that currently fights drug and arms smuggling in the region.Alternatively, he said allied nations with commercial interests in the oil-rich region could launch an all-new maritime security initiative.Another option could be military ships patrolling the Gulf waters and equipped with surveillance equipment to keep watch on Iran.The narrow Strait of Hormuz, which lies between Iran and Oman and opens to the Persian Gulf, is paramount for Asian oil importers. An estimated  million to  million barrels of oil, much of it crude, pass through the strait every day.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  This map provided by the US department of defence shows the site where they say a US Navy RQ- drone was shot down The US Navy, which has its th Fleet based in Bahrain to protect the strait, escorted oil tankers to ensure American energy supplies in the s when Iran and Iraq were targeting each other’s exports, but the US is no longer as reliant on Arabian producers.Today, any conflict that threatens tankers would badly disrupt crude supplies for energy-hungry countries like China, Japan, South Korea, Singapore and Indonesia, which are among the top five importers of Arabian oil.After his meetings in Saudi Arabia with King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Mr Pompeo tweeted that he had a “productive meeting” with the monarch and discussed “heightened tensions in the region and the need to promote maritime security” in the Strait of Hormuz.Mr Pompeo then travelled to neighbouring Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates, another close US ally.The regional stops may be aimed at reassuring Washington’s Sunni Gulf Arab allies that the White House remains committed to keeping pressure on Shiite Iran following Mr Trump’s decision against retaliation, which likely raised questions about US willingness to use force against the Islamic Republic. \" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo meets with Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman On a visit to Israel on Sunday, US National Security Adviser John Bolton, also considered a US hard-liner, said Iran should not “mistake US prudence and discretion for weakness”.Iran’s naval commander, Rear Admiral Hossein Khanzadi, declared that Tehran is capable of shooting down other American spy drones that violate its airspace, saying “the crushing response can always be repeated.” He spoke during a meeting of defence officials in Iran.Mr Trump has wavered between bellicose language and actions toward Iran and a more accommodating tone, including an offer for negotiations. Iran has said it is not interested in a dialogue with Mr Trump.One last visual: Red dot is the impact point of the trespassing drone against the border of Iran and the border of the United States. pic nqVYIEmkL— Javad ZarJune , Saudi Arabia and the US accused Iran of being behind attacks on tankers near the Persian Gulf in recent weeks, while the UAE has been urging diplomacy to avert a wider conflict.On the eve of Mr Pompeo’s visit to the kingdom, Yemen’s Iranian-allied rebels attacked a Saudi airport near the Saudi-Yemen border, killing a Syrian resident and wounding  other civilians, the Saudi military said.The Houthi rebels claimed they used bomb-laden drones to attack the Abha airport, the second in less than two weeks. Drones were also used against a Saudi oil pipeline last month.Saudi Arabia has been at war with the rebel Houthis in Yemen for more than four years.

Durkan said that many of the  staff at Foyle House, on the Duncreggan Road, will be made redundant as it will be \"impossible\" for them to relocate to Belfast.In  HMRC announced that the Derry tax office would close in  .It came as part of a move to reconfgure its offices into thirteen regional centres serving every nation and region in the UK, with one of these centres being located in Belfast.In July  HMRC declared that its Belfast Regional Centre would be based at Erskine House, Chichester Street, Belfast, and expected to open in late . It is on schedule to open later this year.This week, Sir Jonathan Thompson, Chief Executive and Permanent Secretary of HMRC, sent a letter to Mark H. Durkan asserting that based on current plans Foyle House will close in September , with staff moving, where possible, to the Belfast Regional Centre.There are currently around  staff in Foyle House and Mr Thompson accepted that the majority live outside reasonable daily travel to Belfast.Mark H Durkan had asked that consideration be given to the integration of HMRC workers in Derry into the Northern Ireland Civil Service.Speaking to the Derry News yesterday, he said: “The intention of HMRC to close their offices here in September  is something I have been appealing against since it was announced in November .“I had written to Head of Civil Service, David Sterling to consider the integration of Derry staff to available DAERA positions in Ballykelly. Why this obvious solution has not been given due consideration is beyond me.“And while HMRC have acknowledged a duty of care to ex-employees, the current plan to relocate  staff members to their Belfast offices is a highly impractical approachnot virtually impossible for those with families and caring responsibilities. For many the only option they have been left with is redundancy.“It is a ludicrous and tin-eared approach to remove employment opportunities, chronically lacking in the North West, and in effect to move more of our skilled workers to Belfast.“These experienced and highly competent staff would be an asset to any organisation. The inability to provide these people some peace of mind as well as affording them opportunities to apply their skills in similar roles closer to home, has been completely overlooked.”However, in his letter Mr Thompson said, “regrettably, there are no priority arrangements for redeployment of our staff into Northern Ireland Civil Servicedepartments.“The NICS is entirely separate from the Home Civil Service and, as such, HMRC staff can only apply for roles in the NICS which may be advertised externally, including those at the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs in nearby Ballykelly.”Mr Thompson added that it has always been made clear that HMRC wants as many people as possible to transfer to their new location and continue their careers in Belfast.“That is why we have committed to hold one-to-one meetings between staff and managers around a year in advance of any move, to discuss inidual circumstances.“The meetings will establish who can and cannot move and what level of support will be needed to keep people working for HMRC. The one-to-ones for this office will commence in September ,” he concluded.The letter went on to say that those who decide to travel to Belfast will be given financial support in terms of travel costs and in some cases with home moves.The option of working in other government departments would also be explored.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"creggan men mixing mayweather dream las vegas boxing encounter","story":"A boxing coach and personal trainer from Creggan has spoken about an ‘amazing’ trip to Las Vegas spent in the company of many of the fight game’s legendary characters never mind his best friend who just happens to be international footballer James McClean.James McClean recently decided to celebrate turning  by inviting a few of his close friends and their partners to go on a trip to Las Vegas.

So, my coach and GB coaches suggested I give it a go this year. My shoot was what won the event.ldquoI was neck and neck with the previous British champion most of the way round.

Suzie has an extremely busy summer ahead of her and is so looking forward to the challenges ahead.ldquoMy focus now is Traithle Europeans in June in Madeira, then Worlds in Florida in October.

They have also branded claims the mercury bath poses a health and safety risk as a ldquored herring and fear that replacing the existing mechanism could potentially damage the Fresnel lens.Described as a ldquoworkshop, the January meeting lasted over one hour with the official council record of the debate that ensued only amounting to a paltry two and a half lines.The Lecale Lightkeepers vehemently argued that they had a case for briefing councillors on the impact the loss of the beam would have but, surprisingly, the request was initially rejected.Instead, council officials insisted that officers from the the Commissioners of Irish Lights would be invited to future meetings of the districtrsquos respective DEA Forums to discuss the future of the lighthouse.The local authority said this was to ensure that information could be shared and that local stakeholders and communities were fully consulted on any proposals for the lighthouse in the immediate future, before any plans are finalised.Council officials also insisted that wide ranging public consultation on the future of the lighthouse would take place.Campaigners mdash who were at a complete loss to understand why they were initially refused an opportunity to meet directly with councillors over five months ago mdash have now been told they will get a chance to brief them and outline their case for the retention of the beam.The Lecale Lightkeepers have described the plan to remove the beam as ldquototally inadequate and unacceptable and are looking forward to outlining their case for its retention.They are also pleased that having heard from the Commissioners, politicians can now have face-to-face dialogue with campaigners.Campaigners have held several discussions with the Commissioners and frequently engage with the organisation as part of the bid to retain what they have described as a key facet of Lecalersquos heritage.ldquoWe welcome the opportunity to meet with councillors to demonstrate just how passionate people are about the retention of the beam, the spokeswoman declared. It is a symbol of unity in Lecale and has brought together all sides of our erse community. It must be retained.ldquoMeeting with councillors is particularly important for us. We have put together a detailed presentation on the lighthouse issue and will outline our concerns about the future of the beam which we cannot afford to lose for a whole host of reasons.The spokeswoman said that in the interests of fairness and given the sensitive nature of the beam issue, it was important that they meet with local politicians.ldquoCouncillors have had the opportunity to hear from the Commissioners and it is important that they hear what we have to say as the group representing those opposed to this controversial proposal, she continued.ldquoThe beam must be retained for future generations given that it is an intrinsic part of the maritime history and heritage of the area and is a stunning feature of the Lecale landscape.The spokeswoman added: ldquoNewry, Mourne and Down Council is backing the campaign to retain the sweeping beam and it is it important that councillors hear directly from campaigners. The beam must be retained we simply cannot afford to lose it from this area and see it consigned to the pages of history..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Curran steps down from government association position  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK councillor Dermot Curran is stepping down from his role as president of the Northern Ireland Local Government Association this Friday.The group is the representative body for the provincersquos  councils and Cllr Curran will leave his position at the grouprsquos annual conference which is taking place at Newcastlersquos Burrendale Hotel.The Ardglass man is Northern Irelandrsquos longest serving district councillor, having been elected to the former Down Council in , following the reorganisation of local government.He has served as NILGA president twice describing the accolade as both a ldquoprivilege and a challenge.While stepping down as the organisationrsquos president, Cllr Curran will remain a key member of the NILGA Executive.Cllr Curran mdash who was last month re-elected to Newry, Mourne and Down Council mdash has been a councillor for  years and while already Northern Irelandrsquos longest serving politician, some of his council colleagues believe that he is the longest serving in the British Isles.Dedicated to public service, Cllr Curran said he has ldquothoroughly enjoyed his second term at NILGArsquos helm and looks forward to continuing his work with the organisation.He also believes that local councils will continue to play increasingly important roles in their respective areas and that an opportunity exists to unlock the potential of local government as the hub of public services.Cllr Curran said that over recent years councils had changed dramatically, as had the political, financial and legal environment in which councillors operate.He said while local authorities had more responsibilities and power than before, they were also increasingly stretched in terms of finances and resources, an issue which has been compounded since the suspension of the Assembly.ldquoThe  councils are a key element of investment and public service delivery, but they control just % of the public purse.

However, I doubt many think that it is the cradle of horse racing, but it is.We do of course have a famous racecourse, which has just hosted a festival of racing as part of the DownTime Summerfest.Some of you, dear readers, may even know that there is an earlier racecourse in Downpatrick mdash at Old Course Road. So racing has been going on for centuries in our beautul corner of the world. And we have also played a vital role in the foundation of the Sport of Kings.The breed of horse associated with modern horse racing is the thoroughbred. A mere glance is enough to tell even the casual observer that the thoroughbred does not look like other horses.When compared to a pony or carthorse, the thoroughbred is leaner, taller and sleeker. In fact, these horses are perfectly designed for racing. They have big lungs, a big heart and long, slender legs that can move swtly.They also need special care when compared with native breeds. They have thin hair coats and so need to wear rugs or live in stables in bad weather. They need special food to give them energy to race. So these features tell you that the ancestor of the modern thoroughbred came from somewhere hot mdash from the desert, in fact. The ancestor of our racehorses is from Arabia.Back in the th century, horses were bred for work and war, not pleasure. Officers prized horses that were fast to get them in and out of battle and keep them alive. By this time, the medieval charger of knights mdash the destrier mdash was out of fashion. They were too slow and cumbersome, and soldiers no longer wore heavy suits of armour.So the horse evolved through selective breeding to become fleet of foot. There were no horses faster than the Arabian, which was specially bred to become bigger and faster than its wild cousin. The armies of the Ottoman Sultan developed special studs to create this new war machine.In , one of these fine stallions, known as the Byerley Turk, found himself outside the gates of Vienna. The Ottoman Sultan wanted to capture the imperial capital of the Holy Roman Empire, an objective he failed to achieve when the Polish King John III Sobieski led the greatest cavalry charge in history to defeat the Ottoman forces.The Byerley Turk was captured and eventually brought to England, finding himself in the ownership of one Captain Byerley.His adventures were not over though. Recognising a fine animal, Captain Byerley adopted the Turk as his war horse. In  hewas called to Ireland to fight for King William and in  he fought at the Battle of the Boyne. Indeed, Captain Byerley later attributed his surviving that battle to the swtness of his favourite war horse.After the battle, the Turk was entered in a horse race mdash in Downpatrick. Of course, he went on to win that race and go on to be one of the most famous horses in history. The Flying Horse housing development to the east of Downpatrick is named after this famous race.The remarkable career of the Turk continued mdash and now we come to his ultimate destiny. He was put out to stud in Yorkshire. His pedigree was highly prize and he became the first of only three foundation sires of the modern thoroughbred breed.Genetic testing has revealed it is his DNA that is the most common in all modern racehorses. His progeny are successful right to this day including names such as Dr Devious, Ahonoora and Indian Ridge.And it all started with a fateful race in Downpatrick over  years ago. Needless to say,Downe Vets had been around then and caring for his veterinary needs, we feel he could have achieved more..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Hurlers seeking big upset at Croke Park  ","story":"DOWN senior hurlers go into Saturdayrsquos Christy Ring Cup final at Croke Park against Meath as rank outsiders.Few pundits outside the Down camp expect anything other than a comfortable win for Meath, but say that quietly in and around Ronan Sheehanrsquos new kids on the block.The Newry man, who has close connections to several Cork hurling legends, has engendered a new-found enthusiasm and confidence in his charges.His young hurlers are a real surprise packet this season and getting to the Christy Ring Cup final is a major achievement for his fledgeling side.Sheehan has invested heavily in youth and has two schoolboys in his starting .Downpatrickrsquos Tim Prenter, who plays his club hurling for Ballygalget and Ballycranrsquos Phelilm Savage are both in their final year at St Patrickrsquos Grammar School and De La Salle, Downpatrick, respectively.Both lads were in the Down Schoolsrsquo side that lted the Mageean Cup earlier in the season and both hail from famous sporting families.Prenter, who also won a MacLarnon Cup medal with the Red High a few months back, is the son of former Antrim senior football defender Kieran Prenter and his grandfather Seamus Burns was a well known member of the all-conquering Belfast Celtics basketball team that swept all before them in the s and s.Savage, whose brother Liam is also in the team, is the son of former Ballycran and Ulster midfielder Gary lsquoGazarsquo Savage, who was also a noted centre half with Ballycam Celtic in the Newcastle League.There are also several other young players in the  with Portaferryrsquos Matthew Conlon, Ronan Blair, Darragh Mallon, Tom Murray, Caolan Taggart and Eoghan and Daithi Sands all in their early s.Throw in Liatroimrsquos Oisin McManus, P J Davidson and Ruairi McCrickard and Ballycranrsquos Stephen Keith, Gerard Hughes, Huw Flynn and Liam and Phelim Savage and you have the nucleus of squad that could dominate Ulster hurling for years.In addition to Prenter, Ballygalget provide the squad with, John McManus, Danny Toner, Marc Fisher and Cathal Coulter with Newry Shamrocks providing Paul Sheehan and Jordan Murphy.Helping Ronan Sheehan from the sidelines is Cork legend Diarmuid OrsquoSullivan and the Down manager believes his support has been critical in moving the side forward.ldquoDiarmuid has been doing a bit of defensive coaching for us and he has been there for all of the Christy Ring Cup games, he said.ldquoHe would know a lot of the boys from the development squads because he wouldrsquove come and done coaching sessions down through the years. The first set of minors he was involved with were probably the likes of Conor Woods, so, itrsquos going back a bit.ldquoHaving him there with what people would probably say is a relatively inexperienced management team as well as a relatively inexperienced team on the field of play has become very important, he added.ldquoWe see this as a bit of a journey over the next two to three years and Diarmuid being there to help build along the way will make a massive dference. Sheehan also believes that OrsquoSullivan has made a big impact on the players and he canrsquot praise him highly enough.ldquoIn terms of his knowledge of the game and the wee bits of coaching he does around how to tackle, there have been huge strides, Sheehan said.ldquoTackling was definitely something we felt we needed to work on, we were giving away too many frees in the past. You can see the dference even in the way the likes of Tom Murray, only  and Darragh Mallon at , are playing like demons, he beamed.ldquoThe other thing be brings is a great calmness on match days.The lads respond well to that, when he has a quiet word with them beforehand.This will be Downrsquos fourth appearance in the Christy Ring final, but they have only lted the cup once and that was back in ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"New working group to run local mountain bike trails  ","story":"A NEW working group is to be established to assist with the management of the hugely popular mountain bike trails in Castlewellan Forest Park.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is keen to meet with those who use the trails and organise local events, alongside representatives from Cycling Ireland, to discuss what have been described as a number of challenges in managing the facility and sister trails in Rostrevorrsquos Kilbroney Forest Park.Over pound.m has been invested in developing trails in both parks and together they attract over one million users each year, with pound, invested annually in their management.The success of both authorised and unauthorised trails within both parks presents challenges for Newry, Mourne and Down Council, members of its Enterprise, Tourism and Regeneration Committee were told on Monday.The local authority manages the bike trails under licence from the Forest Service and is also responsible for their maintenance.Politicians were told that in addition to the authorised trail network, an unofficial or lsquonaturalrsquo network also exists and has been in place for many years.

That is not the norm where in the public sector,\" he said.Dr Farry claimed it would have been \"fairly pointless, futile and counterproductive to proceed with the cap\" in August  and would only have led to a huge rush of claims.He said there was \"not a single thing\" he could have done or not done in terms of the PSNI case, and described talk of a cap at that time as \"a complete and utter red herring.\"He insisted that any attempt to introduce a cap at that time would not have got through the Executive, which he claimed was \"extremely dysal\" and \"a transactional clearing house\".Asked would it not have been common sense to discuss the matter with colleagues in the Executive, particularly the then finance minister, before making a decision on the matter, Dr Farry stressed that people in senior HR roles would have been well aware of the Bear Scotland judgement and its potential implications.Denying a suggestion that he was trying to push blame onto civil servants, Dr Farry said: \"This decision was mine. It was my political judgement that I made in the best interests of Northern Ireland and the public interest.\"Man trapped and seriously injured when wall in Luton building collapses Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"He added: \"In terms of my responsibilities, I am happy with the actions which I took. I acted with total integrity and in the public interest in the way I did it.\"On the issue of whether or not the PSNI should appeal the case to the UK Supreme Court, Dr Farry said he was sure the PSNI would be assessing last weeks judgement and will make a decision on it.Askedworkers should claim up to  years of back holiday pay they were legally entitled to, he said: \"I think employers should resolve the issue in terms of their workplaces and come to negotiated settlements with their staff around arrears. Where that doesnt happen I think employees would retain the right to exercise their right to a tribunal.\"Responding to the same question later in the programme, UUP leader Robin Swann said: \"If people are entitled to it legally at this minute in time. Now I am aware this may be challenged in the Court of Appeal. If it is we will see the outworkings of that. Butthey are entitled to it at this minute in time then they are legally entitled to it.\"Commenting on Dr Farryrsquos appearance on the Nolan Show, TUV leader Jim Allister said he should have directly informed the then Department of Finance and Personnel about the potential impact on the block grant of not proceeding with a cap.Commenting on the Alliance deputy leaders reference to the dysal Executive, Mr Allister added: ldquoOnce more the dysality of our failed system of devolution is set to cost the public dear.\"try catch  TrendingN.I. railway line reopens after tragic incidentExclusive: Joey Dunlops family issues plea forof highly sentimental items belonging to five-time world championBody recovered from N.I. riverWillie Frazer critically ill family lsquodevastatedrsquo by VSSTwo people found dead in N.I. house -

As anticipation builds for next month’s Open at Royal Portrush, the veteran radio and TV presenter visited the host course as well as clubs like Royal Belfast, Royal County Down and the town of St Andrews in Scotland – recognised internationally as the home of golf. Gery Kelly and Bill MontgomeryGerry starts his journey at his home club in Ardglass tracing the beginnings of golf in Ireland and reveals a few surprises as he discovers the relatively unknown Ulster-Scots golfing pioneers who helped establish the sport here.He visits stately homes including Mount Stewart on the shores of Strangford Lough and Grey Abbey House – chatting with Lady Rose Lauritzen and William Montgomery – and travels to St Andrews to explore how the Scots claim to have invented the sport and what part they played in bringing the game across the Irish Sea. .ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p He also sets out to finally answer the age-old dispute about which club is actually the oldest in Ireland. Gerry, who has been playing golf for over five decades at Ardglass Golf Club, said: “Before I began filming for the programme, despite playing the game for most of my le, I actually knew very little about its history, and that’s a shame because there are few sports with as long and as rich a history. Gery Kelly at St Andrews“The thing that amazed me the most was the fact that golf was played in Scotland in the s and it took over  years before it came here. With all the movement of people between the two countries, that Ulster-Scots connection, why did it take so long for the game to be finally organised here ”Gerry, who has been playing golf since he was a teenager, said: “Golf is a sport you can get easily hooked on. It’s a game for le. I know people still playing in their nineties.“For me it’s not so much now about that standard of golf now. I used to play off single figures, now I’m a teenager , it’s about the craic with your fourball. “We would get out once or twice a weekend and play for a fiver.

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

Take the proposals around car parking charges, or the closure of Llancarfan School. I donrsquot think anyone outside of the Civic Offices believes that those decisions werenrsquot already done deals, and thatrsquos simply unacceptable.ldquoAnother good example is the councilrsquos failure to listen to the public over Penarthrsquos original Victorian lamp posts.ldquoIrsquove been criticised for wanting to listen to the people who elected me, and I make no apologies for that. Under my leadership, thatrsquos exactly what would happen and whilst I do accept that there are dficult decisions to be taken, we have to take the public with us - not ignore their legitimate concerns. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

People should be able to disagree with each other without resorting to abuse.Devolution is a journey not a destination.

People should be able to disagree with each other without resorting to abuse.Devolution is a journey not a destination. I am proud of what we have achieved over the last  years, making a real dference to peoplersquos lives.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John. He really made an impact on our wards and with our patients who listened to his shows.ldquoItrsquos such a lovely way to mark not only Johnrsquos birthday but also to mark the contribution he made as a volunteer during Volunteersrsquo Week. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people. We have to say these are the facts and whether we like it or not we will have to do some things dferently or not at all.Cllr Burnett added. ldquoBut we have to be honest about the levels of pressure on local government.ldquoOur priority has to be services to the most vulnerable.The Labour-led coalition includes members of the former Conservative cabinet, which quit the party when former leader John Thomas was deposed as leader of the Vale Tories. The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for. It will be realistic and fair for everybody.School improvementsThe new cabinet says delivering on major new school buildings is a priority for the new administration.Developments in the pipeline include new builds forPencoedtre and Whitmore High Schools, and expansion and refurbishment of Ysgol Gymraeg Bro MorgannwgAgeing schools in the Vale are set to get a pound. million cash boost for repairs.Llancarfan Primary SchoolLlancarfan Primary School was set to be lsquoclosedrsquoand moved to a new pound million facility in Rhoose.The previous cabinet had approved the plans despite protests from parents and campaigners.Cllr Moore said Llancarfan School move was ldquopremature - but did not commit to scrapping the plan entirely.ldquoIf itrsquos justiable itrsquos justiable, he said. ldquoIf itrsquos not, we will look at alternatives.ldquoItrsquos not an easy decision to take. Itrsquos something we have to take some time about.ldquoWhat Irsquom not going to do is jump or kowtow to people who shout the loudest.Cllr Burnett has previously tweeted the closure of Llancarfan ldquowouldnrsquot be happeningLabour were running the council.New roadsWork continues on outline business cases for two major new roads being proposed ndash the A to M link around Pendoylan and Dinas Powys Bypass between Barry and Cardf ndash but no decision has been made whether either will actually go ahead.The future of both roads rests on whether Welsh Government and the council deem them viable, and whether ministers cough up the cash to fund them.But Cllr Moore said he doesnrsquot think Welsh Government will find the money required for the Dinas Powys Bypass.ldquoItrsquos out of our hands, he said.IncineratorCllr Moore said he believes Welsh Government will order the Barry Biomass incinerator to carry out an environmentalimpact assessment.Cllr Moore, who has previously attacked what he termed ldquoscaremongering and lies around the biomass plant, said he did not want the facility in Barry Docks.He said: ldquoWe opposed it vehemently, both as a council and as a party and personally. It shouldnrsquot be there.ldquoBut now it is there it has to operate within legal parameters.ldquoIf it does, therersquos nothing anyone can do about it.The council refused the original planning permission for the facility, but a planning inspector allowed it in  following an appeal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Abandoned - BlissThe first dog to arrive at the centre was -year-old Spaniel Grace, found by a member of the public at the side of the road. She was taken to the vet immediately, but after an owner didn’t come forward, she was brought to Dogs Trust.Two weeks ago, another Spaniel - aged eight and nicknamed Bliss by the team - was found tied to a fence not far from the rehoming centre. Like Grace, the Spaniel has not been microchipped, which has been a legal requirement for all dogs since  and the easiest way to identy a dog who has become separated from their owner. Shockingly just one week later, a Cairn Terrier - less than a year old, was found by a rehoming centre staff member at the very same spot where Bliss was left. Terrier Rizzo was lucky to be found as she is quite small and it would have been easy to miss her in the long grass.The most recent addition to the ranks of abandoned pooches is Sally, an eight-year-old Collie cross, who was found as a stray by a member of the public and brought to the rehoming centre.Abandoned - RizzoOonagh Philips, Rehoming Centre Manager said: “We want to remind anyone who no longer feels that they can care for their dog to contact their local rescue organisation for support. When a dog is abandoned on the road side, it not only puts them in danger, but also drivers. We are so thankful that all four of these dogs were found when they were.“Grace and Bliss were very shaken up by their ordeal when they came into our care and it took them a couple of days to build trust around people again. We could tell Rizzo hadn’t eaten in a while, which could have resulted in a deterioration of her physical health. Sally is incredibly sweet natured, and just like the others, will make a wonderful addition to the right home.“We are not sure why there has been a recent influx in dogs being abandoned. We always remind people that ‘A Dog is for Le®’ but we understand that le happens, and places like Dogs Trust are there to support any dog owner who experiences a bump in the road and needs our help. Sometimes the most responsible thing we can do as a dog owner is admit that we aren’t coping with our pets, but it is important to ensure they are kept safe and not left to fend for themselves.”If you

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/bbobb.jpg","title":"coffee chain bob and berts creating  new jobs","story":"Posted on Monday  June  by John Mulgrew A Northern Ireland coffee shop chain is creating  new jobs as its expands it reach across the UK with eight new stores, it has emerged.
