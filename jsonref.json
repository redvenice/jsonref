The Omicron variant is rampant, spreading through every part of the population, and no amount of self-isolation can halt it. But we also know that Omicron is very mild.Without any further restrictions being introduced over the Christmas and New Year period, hospitalisations have remained steadily below half the levels seen last winter, when we were in a full national lockdown.And of those who are admitted into hospital, many fewer require critical care. We know that the vaccines are doing their job and are protecting the vast majority.While the daily number of new infections may sound alarming, most people with Omicon are experiencing nothing more than cold-like symptoms – if any at all – and yet are still being forced to sign off work for at least seven days. There is a glimmer of hope, however, with unnamed ‘Whitehall sources’ hinting at the weekend that the policy of providing unlimited free lateral flow tests to the public has to end.       So far £6billion has been spent on these kits. Think how much could have been saved if tests had only been provided to places where identifying potential infections really matters, such as care homes and hospitals, as opposed to mass DIY testing in the population at large.Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi also struck a note of good sense yesterday, when he suggested the seven-day isolation period for people with Covid should be reduced to five. But really, that’s the least we can do.As the former chairman of the UK’s vaccine taskforce, Dr Clive Dix, said, Britain now needs a major rethink on its Covid policy, with a move towards treating the virus as similar to seasonal flu.Our hospitals are under immense pressure – but not from the predicted wave of Covid patients. That has not materialised.The real harm is done by forcing NHS staff with mild or no symptoms to stay off work.This crisis is self-inflicted – and one we must act to limit now.Professor Angus Dalgleish is an oncologist at a London teaching hospital. "},{"url":null,"title":"Ritzy San Francisco condo tower leaning 26 INCHES","story":"Share this articleDelays in Millennium-Fix Pile Process May Explain Additional Sinking, Leaning – NBC Bay Area"},{"url":null,"title":"Mary Berry judge competition dessert fit Queen Platinum Jubilee","story":"Share this article   The Platinum Jubilee Pageant, which will see thousands of performers, dancers, musicians and military personnel unite to tell the story of the Queen\u0027s 70-year reign is also asking for schools across the country to get involved by helping to design silk banners that will process down The Mall in London.Primary and secondary schools are being invited to enter designs incorporating their hopes and aspirations for the planet over the next 70 years.

Photograph: iStockThe  2021 Feeder School list, published today, provides new insights into the education pathways taken by thousands of students who have completed the Leaving Cert cycle. The following are five of the key take-aways from this year’s data:1. Class a determinant At a macro level more students from Deis schools (3,524) secured places on high points courses in 2021 than from fee-paying schools (3,392).The undoubted success of investment in Deis schools these figures reveal is tempered by the fact that the numbers are a proportion of Deis 10,540 school leavers, whereas the fee-paying numbers are drawn from a much smaller cohort of just 3,912 school leavers.At a micro level it would appear that fee-paying schools still dominate our most sought-after courses. Ten of the top 15 boys’ schools in terms of progression to third level are fee-paying colleges. The five non-fee-paying schools in this category, Ard Scoil Rís, Limerick Oatlands College, Mount Merrion St Benildus Stillorgan, Capuchin Rochestown Cork and Christian Brothers, Mitchelstown, mostly draw their pupils from families with similar social class backgrounds to their neighbouring fee-paying schools.Interestingly, only seven of the top 15 girls-only second-level schools are fee-paying, with three of the four most successful colleges being non-fee paying. 1st Salerno in Galway, 2nd Loreto Dalkey (fee-paying), 3rd Coláiste Muire Ennis, 4th Coláiste Íde, An Daingean.Again social-class background rather than attending a fee-paying college seems to be the determinant factor governing levels of progression.2. Most students are choosing to apply to their local or regional colleges  Irish young people, unlike their compatriots in the UK, tend to apply for third level places at their local colleges. Research carried out with those who have progressed to third level indicate that most Irish school leavers apply to attend colleges where they can continue to socialise with their peer group.There is also a growing economic factor causing students to select their local institutions, driven in large part by the soaring cost of accommodations in our towns and cities: living away from home adds hugely to the cost of attending college.There are significantly lower third level progression rates among students in counties or geographic locations, which do not have access to third level institutions and who are therefore unable to attend a chosen course without living away from home. Contrast Kilkenny 68 per cent, Longford (68) and Laois (70) with Galway (81), Donegal (84), and Clare 86 percentage progression rates to third level.3. Progression by post code Apart from the school a child attends, where families live also seems to determine overall third level progression rates. The most affluent parts of the capital city, such as Dublin 6 and Dublin 14, saw 104 and 96 per cent respectively of the total numbers of 2021 6th years who sat the Leaving Cert in schools within these postal districts progress to third level this year.In other postal districts of the city Dublin 11 and 7, the proportion of Leaving Cert students progressing to college in 2021 were 54 and 64 per cent respectively. The ide is also stark when the figures are broken down into those who secured places on higher points courses. Some 96 per cent of school leavers in Dublin 6 went on to one of these programmes, compared with 46 per cent in Dublin 11.4.We still want to pursue the CAO route The current year’s numbers reveal Ireland’s exceptionally high third level participation rate, which is among the highest in the world.Ireland also continues to have one of the highest retent- ion rates in second level across Europe: that is the proportion of students who stay in school until the Leaving Cert.5. The growth of full-time senior cycle grinds schools While pupil numbers sitting the Leaving Cert continue to increase annually due to demographic factors, our figures show that numbers sitting the Leaving Cert in 143 second-level schools (composed of nine fee-paying, 44 Deis and 90 non-fee paying institutions) dropped by more than 15 per cent this year, compared to their 2020 numbers.So what may be driving these numbers? Firstly, the country was still in recession when this year’s cohort of Leaving Cert students started second level in 2015. Specifically, in relation to the lower numbers sitting the Leaving Cert in fee-paying schools in 2021, the downturn hit family incomes in 2015, adversely affecting enrolment numbers in these schools at that time.Secondly, and probably more importantly, the presence of full-time grind schools in our major cities offering a two-year Leaving Cert programme seems to be drawing some families who can afford the fees for the final twothree years of second level education.Some parents believe that the grind schools offer a more flexible range of subject choices than those available in their child’s second-level schools. Furthermore, many students want to escape what they perceive to be restrictive rules and regulations central to our second-level school cultures."},{"url":null,"title":"no justification for hybrid leving cert exams this year says one teachers union","story":"TUI says it is already receiving reports of students disengaging because of an expectation that they will not have to sit examinations.   The traditional leaving cert exams must take place this year and there is “no justification” for offering additional options to students, a teachers’ union has said.Opposition politicians have in recent weeks renewed calls for a hybrid model of examinations this year - a choice between exams and accredited grades - to account for the disruption caused by Covid-19. However, in a statement on Monday, the Teachers’ Union of Ireland (TUI) said it would not support any options other than the traditional exams.The recent contributions from politicians around the issue are “unhelpful and will inevitably lead to more uncertainty in school communities”, the union said.“We are already receiving reports of students disengaging because of an expectation that they will not have to sit examinations. This is very damaging to the education system and to the prospects of those students.”The TUI said schools have remained open throughout this academic year, despite the challenges of high levels of community infection with Covid-19 and isolation rules.“The scheduling of orals and music practicals in the traditional Easter break has created additional tuition time that would not previously have been available, balancing somewhat the losses in time that students have experienced,” it added. The standardisation process used for predicted grades over the past two years requires junior cycle data, however due to the pandemic, some of the current leaving cert students did not sit those exams.“Advocates for a repeat of the emergency methods are therefore advocating for something that is either impossible or else will be radically changed and involve historical school data that would be hugely unfair for many students,” the TUI added.The union said it will continue to engage with stakeholders, adding that further consideration could be given to extending the breadth of topics covered in papers or adjusting marking schemes to account for this year’s circumstances.Paul Crone, director of the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals (NAPD), said there needs to be something additional to this year’s exams to account for the Covid disruption.“We don’t know exactly what that should look like, or what’s possible, but what we’re saying is we should put students first,” he said.“A lot of them didn’t sit a junior cert, lost time last year and are losing time now due to isolation. Anything would be helpful, and we’re willing to sit down and engage with all of the stakeholders to see what’s possible.”Secondary students also want additional choice in this year’s Leaving Cert exams to compensate for Covid-related disruption to school, according to the Irish Secondary Students’ Union (ISSU).Donnchadh Ó Laoghaire, Sinn Féin’s education spokesman, is among those who has called for a hybrid approach. He believes students do want to sit exams, but believes giving them the hybrid option is the fairest way to do it due to the time they have missed as a result of the pandemic.He acknowledged that a proportion of these students have not sat a junior cert, which would have an impact on the standardisation process, but said there should be “discussions” around the modality of the system, adding it is not an “insurmountable challenge”.It remains Government policy to return to traditional written junior cycle and Leaving Cert exams this year, with additional choice of questions to take account of the disruption to learning.It is intended that two sets of Leaving Cert exams will be run in the summer for students affected by Covid and other illnesses."},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: The small tortoiseshell can become confused by central heatingStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"lack of accessible covid 19 test and vaccine centres for people with autism","story":"Jane Johnstone from Baldwinstown, Co Wexford, with her son Evan (21).

However, she was advised by the HSE to go to a mass vaccination centre in Enniscorthy to receive her booster. “Hannah has behaviour problems. There will be queues to get vaccinated... it will take a long time for Hannah to feel comfortable.”Ms Hennessy rang her doctor, who agreed to vaccinate her daughter. “The doctor is going to have to vaccinate her in the car park in the car... if I was to bring her into the doctors ... she would get very distressed.” Sharon McManus from Salthill in Galway has a son (10) with autism. Myles was tested for Covid in a large centre. “We met one staff at registration and I told her that Myles had autism and was worried about the test. She didn’t reply to this at all.” EncouragingHowever, Ms McManus says the tester was encouraging and talked Myles through the process. Myles became distressed at one point during the test and shouted out. “The tester appeared apprehensive during the process but did a great job.”Ms McManus would like to get a vaccine for her son, but she would prefer to bring him to a GP clinic or pharmacy where she could explain his needs in advance.She also thinks there should be a way to include additional information before testing and vaccination. “It is not appropriate to have to impart sensitive, personal information as you queue in an open area. There is no privacy, and these conversations can increase anxiety for the child.”Jane Johnstone from Wexford has two sons with additional needs. Her son Evan is 21. He has autism and an intellectual disability. He was initially vaccinated through his day service. Daniel, her other son, is 17 and also has autism. He got his initial dose of the vaccine in a mass vaccination centre.While she says the vaccination staff couldn’t have been nicer, Daniel became overwhelmed by the strange environment and engaged in self-harming behaviours. “He became very distressed in the cubicle. People were looking in. I know it is only human nature, but where is his dignity and privacy?”The nurse who was vaccinating Daniel reassured him and he got the vaccine, but the 15-minute wait after the jab was also very tough, she says .“Once we got back into the car, I put on my sunglasses and a few tears rolled down my face. Why couldn’t we do it in an environment that was more familiar? Such as in respite or school, or a clinic specifically for people with a disability?”Both Daniel and Evan got their boosters in the car park of their GP which was best for their safety but lacked privacy, she saysBespokeIn a statement, the HSE said the appointments offered to vulnerable adults were predominantly through vaccination centres, but there were some bespoke, onsite and GP clinics.There is also a standard operational procedure for the vaccination of children with additional needs, and the HSE said parents can request these accommodations by contacting HSE Live, who can alert the vaccination centre in advance of their child’s appointment.The HSE added that there are also some specialist clinics available, such as t Citywest in Dublin and a centre in Limerick. “In addition to this, any children (or adults) who are unable to leave their homes to receive a vaccination will receive their booster vaccine in their own homes.

It is worth having the discussion,” he told Newstalk Breakfast.Minutes of a meeting of Nphet on December 16th reveal that mandatory vaccination was considered by the team.“It was noted that the Nphet will discuss the issue of mandatory vaccination at a later date and this discussion will be facilitated by a forthcoming paper from the Department of Health on the relevant ethical and legal considerations pertaining to this topic.”Prof Fanning pointed out that there was already mandatory vaccination (for other diseases) “in some form” in healthcare settings, so it was “not correct” to say that it was not already in place.“Some professions have to have the Hepatitis vaccine,” he said, while visitors to certain countries also needed vaccines against tropical diseases which indicated that mandatory vaccination was acceptable in certain circumstances.

Photograph: Andrew DownesPA Wire What did we learn from Day One of the Great Golfgate Trial?We found out that lawyers – if the legal heavyweights who turned up in force for a district court case in Galway are anything to go by – have a rather sniffy attitude to golf. Not quite their cup of tee.And that the Oireachtas Golf Society was a hitherto unrecognised major force in Irish political history until it hit the headlines last year due to the “Golfgate” furore.We learned that the size of a gap in a partition is a moveable feast. It certainly was moveable at the particular feast under the spotlight in Judge Mary Fahy’s courtroom on Thursday.We discovered that the annual President’s Prize dinner was not a “frivolous” event in 2020 and that the traditional presentation at the 19th hole after a convivial day on the links was anything but “a frolic”.That this event was, in fact, “poignant”. This is because it was held in honour of a politician who was behind the much-underestimated Golfing Revival Era in Irish politics 50 years ago. The late Mark Killilea was a driving force in the resurrection of the Oireachtas Golf Society, which had fizzled out after it was founded by a TD called Major Somethingorother in 1929.We heard that the then captain of the guard in Leinster House, an enthusiastic member of the society, had two breakfasts and one evening meal in the hotel which is now at the centre of this court case. And that a member of the Seanad and his wife left the dinner before the formalities commenced because “we’re not dessert people”.And that guidelines issued with the “imprimatur of the State” and bearing the harp of Rialtas na hÉireann on printed communications may, or may not be, worthless.We also learned on the opening day of the trial of politicians Noel Grealish and Donie Cassidy and hotel bosses John and James Sweeney for allegedly contravening the Covid emergency health act by holding a dinner indoors for over 50 people, that all of the witnesses called by the prosecution had nothing but praise for how the defendants managed the event.Bending the rulesThe story of the Oireachtas Golf Society’s now-infamous dinner hit the headlines late in 2020. In the early days of the pandemic, claims that politicians had been bending the strict rules painfully and dutifully observed by wider society caused uproar. But the lawyers acting for Grealish and Cassidy set out from the start to show how their clients acted with the utmost propriety at all times and their actions have been gravely misunderstood by the public.Which brings us back to something else learned on Thursday: when push comes to shove, it’s all the media’s fault. In this case, according to Donie Cassidy’s lawyer Colm Smyth SC, for getting involved and then “public hysteria was whipped up and hysteria was whipped up”.This, he said, led to “a lot of very good people” having “to resign from their positions”.Near the end of the first day, Martin Brett, a Fine Gael councillor from Kilkenny who was at the golf outing and dinner in Connemara, said he didn’t even know how many people were at the function until he read it in the paper.“Don’t believe what you read in the newspapers and the journal,” said Eoghan Cole BL, for the State.Barrister Cole was up against it. A lone ranger on the DPP’s side against the heavy guns hired by the defendants. The place was coming down with junior and senior counsel and instructing solicitors.Smyth, for Donie Cassidy, made the most running on day one, with bracing interventions from Senator Michael McDowell SC (for former PD colleague and now independent TD Noel Grealish) and the country’s leading libation lawyers Constance Cassidy and Eddie Walsh (for James and John Sweeney, respectively).Bewildering meanderThere isn’t much you can tell those two about the licensing laws. When Constance, in the midst of a bewildering meander through statutory instruments and hospitality regulations, talked about “the consumption of intoxicating liquor”, you knew it wasn’t the first time she said those words.Among the ranks of the BLs was junior counsel Willie Penrose, the former Labour TD. He is part of the Cassidy squad.As for the journalists sent to cover this trial of the half-century (50 years a-fourballing, and all that), there was no room in the court building for them. Two were allowed inside to hear the proceedings, the rest given a video link to download and hope for the best.Enter the hero of the hour: Fergal McGrath, brother of former TD Finian, who runs the Town Hall Theatre opposite the courthouse. Fergal made a room available to the hacks (which is more than the Courts Service could manage, despite this being a case of national interest which was flagged months ago).Business for Fergal has been hugely impacted by Covid, but he has a tasty line-up of events coming in the new year. The panto, sadly, had to be cancelled so all the kiddies in Galway missed out on the fairy godmother saying: “You shall go to the (golf) ball!”After a morning spent mostly in legal discussion, Colm Smyth got round to telling us of Donie Cassidy. A man who has never been before the courts in his life, has had a distinguished political career and is the owner of four hotels in Dublin, and that’s just for starters. “A lawmaker, not a lawbreaker.”Donie, in Colm’s words, sounded like Santa. Before the event, “he checked the regulations. He checked the guidelines. He consulted with people.” Probably to make sure nobody would be naughty and everyone would be nice.Former TD and senator Cassidy was president of the society. His co-defendant, TD Noel Grealish, was captain on the night.No hand, act or putterMichael McDowell said this was very important because his client’s position is that president Cassidy organised the do as it was his dinner. Noel Grealish, as captain, had some involvement in organising the first day of golf but “I just want to be 100 per cent clear” he had no hand, act or putter in organising the shindig on the second night.Eddie and Constance, meanwhile, said that the “company” as opposed to the two Mr Sweeneys should have been charged.Then Colm Smyth started talking about “potentially an unsavoury aspect” to the prosecution, without explaining entirely what he meant.“Substantiate the unsavouryness,” challenged Eoghan Cole, for the State.The witnesses so far are all people who attended the golf dinner.They were blown away by the Covid prevention measures taken by management.The mainly retired minor politicians who attended this dinner were “exceptionally impressed”. But then, they don’t get out as much as they used to. There would be no “intermingling” at this hooley in Connemara.One of the guests recalled the rigid attention to the pandemic prevention rules on the night.“A waiter said to me: table service only. You don’t move unless you go to the toilet.”One of the lawyers pointed approvingly to “the liberality of sanitisers and so on”.There was some discussion as to whether they were separated by a “partition” or “a solid wall” but there was a definite ision until the gap appeared at prize-giving.It was seven to eight feet on either side of a pillar, according to one witness, and “probably the width of a person”, according to another.But did two separate rooms of people attending the dinner constitute a single event or multiple events? It’s a bit like St Patrick and the shamrock – three leaves on the one stem. St Donie and the dinner – two rooms on the one feed.Judge Fahy will have to decide.She admitted she isn’t much into golf, with the course in Ballyconneely more “the Dublin fours”. Michael McDowell and Eddie Cassidy were similarly unmoved by the joys of the game.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"foreign meddling behind kazakhstan unrest putin claims","story":"Russian president Vladimir Putin:  “We would not let anyone destabilise the situation at our home and implement so-called colour revolution scenarios.” Photograph: Alexei NikolskyEPASputnikKremlin pool Vladimir Putin has claimed the unrest in Kazakhstan last week that killed at least 164 people was the result of foreign meddling, and said a Russian-led military bloc should take steps to ensure future attempts to interfere in the region failed.“The events in Kazakhstan are not the first and far from the last attempt to interfere in the internal affairs of our states from the outside,” said the Russian president, who was speaking at a video conference of leaders of the Russian-led Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO), a military alliance that deployed about 2,500 troops to Kazakhstan last week at the request of Kazakhstan’s president, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev. The CSTO, which also includes Belarus, Kyrgyzstan, Armenia and Tajikistan, has never before deployed troops, and many in Kazakhstan expressed extreme unease at having Russian troops on the ground.“The measures taken by the CSTO made it clear that we would not let anyone destabilise the situation at our home and implement so-called colour revolution scenarios,” said Mr Putin.The Russian president believes former Soviet nations should fall into Moscow’s sphere of influence, and has frequently dismissed popular uprisings as “colour revolutions” organised and financed from abroad. Mr Putin also said the events in Kazakhstan showed the dangers of social media and unrestricted internet use.Mr Putin’s words came as negotiations in Geneva began between US and Russian delegations, after Russia demanded a new security deal with Washington and amid fears that Mr Putin is poised to order a further incursion into Ukraine. Violent groupsThe fast-moving events in Kazakhstan took the Kremlin and other regional players by surprise. Protests began over a sharp rise in fuel prices, and quickly spread across the country, but they were taken over by violent groups who stormed government buildings and the airport in Almaty, Kazakhstan’s biggest city. Widespread looting followed.At the CSTO meeting, Mr Tokayev described the protests against him as a coup, launched by unspecified internal and external forces.“Under the guise of spontaneous protests, a wave of unrest broke out . . . It became clear that the main goal was to undermine the constitutional order and to seize power. We are talking about an attempted coup d’etat,” he said. He also claimed trained Islamist fighters were involved in the unrest.Mr Tokayev has repeatedly described violent protesters as “bandits and terrorists” and said on Friday he had given an order to security forces to shoot to kill without warning. Although the country is getting back to normal, Mr Tokayev said the hunt for “terrorists” was continuing.On Sunday, Kazakhstani authorities said 164 people had died in the violence, including three children. The interior ministry announced on Monday that security forces had detained nearly 8,000 people, a number that is rising sharply each day. It is not clear how many of them will be charged.Concerns about how transparent the investigation process would be arose when state television aired footage of a bruised man who said he had been paid to travel from neighbouring Kyrgyzstan and take part in violence.Jazz musicianViewers in Kyrgyzstan quickly identified him as Vikram Ruzakhunov, a well-known jazz musician who frequently toured Kazakhstan. After sustained protest, Ruzakhunov was reportedly released on Monday.Last Mr week, the powerful head of security services, Karim Masimov, was relieved of his duties and then arrested on suspicion of treason. While there has so far been no evidence presented about foreign backing for the unrest, many have speculated that the protest movement was used by groups inside the Kazakh elite to settle differences.Some sources have pointed to recent disagreements between Mr Tokayev and figures close to his predecessor, Nursultan Nazarbayev, who ruled the country from independence in 1991 until 2019 and handpicked Mr Tokayev as his successor. Mr Nazarbayev holds the honorific title of leader of the nation, and the country’s capital was renamed Nur-Sultan in his honour in 2019. He was removed by Mr Tokayev as head of the national security council last week, and has still not spoken or appeared in public. – Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"nato stands ready for conflict in europe says alliance chief as us russia talks begin","story":"Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg:  “We have to hope and work hard for the best, but be prepared for the worst.” Photograph: John ThysAFP via Getty ImagesNato has warned Moscow to abandon its belligerent foreign policy and co-operate with the West or face a military alliance steeled for conflict on the eve of a week of intense diplomacy aimed at averting a Russian assault on Ukraine. Jens Stoltenberg, Nato secretary-general, said the US-led defence pact was prepared for “a new armed conflict in Europe” should negotiations fail, as western officials readied for potential discussions with Moscow on reducing the size of military exercises, arms control and a pledge not to deploy US missiles in Ukraine.Russia has deployed about 100,000 troops at locations close to its border with Ukraine in recent months, sparking fears that it is planning a fresh attack on a country it invaded in 2014, with the annexation of Crimea.President Vladimir Putin has denied any plan to invade. But he has warned of possible military action if the US and Nato ignored Moscow’s demands for defence agreements that would severely reduce US and Nato capabilities in Europe. Russia claims those capabilities are a threat to its borders.“It is possible to find together a path, a political way forward, and also to address Russia’s concerns . . . But there continues to be a risk of conflict,” Mr Stoltenberg said in an interview. “Nato’s deterrence is credible and strong . . . We have to hope and work hard for the best, but be prepared for the worst.”His warning came ahead of formal talks between Russian and US officials in Geneva on Monday, followed by a meeting of the 30-member Nato alliance and a Russian delegation on Wednesday. A third meeting hosted by the broader Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe is set for Thursday.‘Businesslike’On Sunday evening, Russia’s lead negotiator and deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov met his US counterpart Wendy Sherman, deputy secretary of state. He said their conversation over dinner in Geneva “was difficult, but businesslike”.“We plunged into the matter of the upcoming affairs. I think that tomorrow we will not waste time,” he said in comments reported by Russian state news agency Ria. “I never lose my optimism, I am always guided by it.”US state department spokesman Ned Price said Ms Sherman had “stressed the United States’ commitment to the international principles of sovereignty, territorial integrity, and the freedom of sovereign nations to choose their own alliances” and “affirmed that the United States would welcome genuine progress through diplomacy”.Mr Price added that Ms Sherman had “underscored that discussion of certain subjects” relating to European security would be reserved for multilateral talks involving Nato this week.Russia’s demands include a ban on Ukraine and other countries joining Nato and a Kremlin veto on alliance activities in member states that joined after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Mr Stoltenberg said both conditions were unacceptable because they breached Nato’s “core principles” of offering membership to all and defending allies equally.Instead, Mr Stoltenberg said the US and Nato were prepared to speak with Russia about possible risk-reduction measures such as “arms control, on efforts to try to have more transparency on military activity, exercises, and also on lines of communications”.Ruling out US missile deployments in Ukraine and discussing broader rules on missile systems in Europe were two areas where Washington saw possible scope for agreement, a senior Biden administration official said ahead of the talks, adding that it would be dependent on whether “Russia is willing to make a reciprocal commitment”.Troop numbersWashington has firmly denied media reports that it could offer to pull back some troops stationed in eastern Europe in exchange for Russia scaling down its deployment on the Ukrainian border. Instead, officials said the US and other Nato allies were ready to increase their presence if Mr Putin took any military action.The US, EU and other western partners have warned that they will impose financial sanctions on Russia in the event of military escalation. Officials said yesterday that the US was ready to “immediately impose severe and overwhelming costs on Russia’s economy”.The US is also preparing potential trade curbs on Russia and has been discussing the possibility of a range of export controls with allies and partners in Europe and Asia, according to people familiar with White House thinking.While the Kremlin has voiced hope for quick solutions from the talks, Mr Stoltenberg said he expected it would take “a series of meetings” to find any mutually acceptable outcomes.“We are ready to strive for a better relationship,” said the former Norwegian prime minister. “We have proven before that we are able to make compromises and find solutions with Russia.” – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2022Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"African country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"must listen south african scientists omicron","story":"‘There are several things we don’t know about omicron,” a sombre Professor Sir Chris Whitty told the nation in the week before Christmas, “but all the things we do know are bad.”His comment puzzled many people at the time, given that scientists in South Africa, where omicron was first identified, had reported that it appeared to be less severe than the then-dominant delta variant of Covid. Surely that was good news?Three weeks on, Sir Chris’s determination to dismiss the encouraging data coming from South Africa seems even more baffling. Instead of the post-Christmas lockdown that came to be regarded almost as an inevitability, Covid rules are now being eased. The NHS did not collapse, and the number of patients requiring ventilation remains less than a quarter of the peak a year ago.Legitimate questions are now being asked about why Britain was so dismissive of the evidence from South Africa, and whether Government scientific advisers are once again using fear as a method of control.One of those who is doing the asking is Angelique Coetzee, chairman of the South African Medical Association and the first doctor to raise the alarm over a possible new variant, which turned out to be omicron.Dr Coetzee was among those who reported that omicron caused “very, very mild” symptoms compared with delta, and she hypothesised that it “could potentially be of great help to us” by replacing the more dangerous delta variant and helping the population to reach herd immunity at minimal cost to life. She says she was “astonished” at the panicked response to it in the UK.“I don’t understand why it’s happening,” she told the  from her home in Pretoria. “It doesn’t make any sense to me. The fear that has been spread in Britain – why is that being done?“South Africa has a younger population, but we should have seen far more disease than you because of the vaccination picture. We only have 44 per cent of people double-jabbed, and we only started the boosters last week.”In the UK, 83 per cent of people are double-jabbed, and 61 per cent have had a booster.“If you don’t know by now that the majority of people are going to have mild symptoms, then what other evidence are you waiting for?”It is not the first time Government scientific advisers have allegedly been dismissive of what colleagues in foreign countries have been saying.On February 21, 2020, the Italian village of Vo’ Euganeo, near Venice, went into strict quarantine after the country’s first recorded death from Covid, and almost all of its residents were tested. Around 40 per cent of those who tested positive had no symptoms, strongly suggesting asymptomatic transmission was occurring.Some members of the Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies (Sage) say they raised concerns about asymptomatic transmission with Sir Patrick Vallance, Chief Scientific Adviser, and with modeller Prof Neil Ferguson, only for their concerns to be dismissed.The two men say the warnings were not ignored, yet Boris Johnson has always insisted he would have done things differently if he had understood sooner that Covid was transmitted asymptomatically (Britain resisted lockdowns for a further month after the Italian data was published).South Africa has a highly sophisticated genomic surveillance capability for Covid – which is why both the omicron and beta variants were first identified there – so the thoughts of its scientific experts surely merit attention.Yet Boris Johnson said last month that “the idea that this is somehow a milder version of the virus, I think that’s something we need to set on one side”, while Sir Chris said evidence from South Africa of a milder illness had been “overinterpreted”.Does Dr Coetzee think xenophobia has played a role in Britain’s dismissal of her advice? “No – but I think there was arrogance from the politicians in the UK. Also, Boris Johnson was going through a bad time because of the criticism of his Christmas parties, so maybe there was a political reason for all this.“People in the UK, including the ones advising the Government, don’t seem to understand what the clinical picture is. The scientists are not sitting with patients in front of them. I am a GP and I’m looking at a list of 116 patients I saw, of whom only three were admitted to hospital, one of whom was not fully vaccinated and two of whom were high risk because of obesity, diabetes and so on.“You have to empower people by telling them what is going on, but I get the feeling that some of the UK scientists didn’t want to use the word ‘mild’, they only want to use the word ‘severe’.”Her suspicion appears to be borne out by the language used by the SPI-M-O modelling committee, which on December 7 said: “Currently, there is no strong evidence that omicron infections are either more or less severe than delta infections.”Laura Dodsworth, author of the book A State of Fear: How the UK Government Weaponised Fear During the Covid-19 Pandemic, says the “linguistic manipulation” was entirely deliberate.“The omission of the word ‘mild’ is not an accident,” she says. “The problem for the Government is that once you have started using fear as a tactic, there is nowhere left to go, so you have to keep on using it, and you have to keep on quoting worst case scenarios.“But each time you do it, the tactics become less successful because people become wise to it. Once you have seen the smoke and mirrors, you can’t unsee it.”Modelling published by SPI-M-O on December 15 suggested a “high-level scenario” of infections, peaking at between 600,000 and 2 million per day with the current Plan B restrictions between late December and January, with up to 6,000 deaths per day, peaking between mid-January and mid-March.In fact, infections are currently averaging around 180,000 per day and may have already peaked in some parts of the country, with deaths averaging just over 150 per day.Mark Harper MP, chairman of the anti-lockdown Covid Recovery Group, said ministers had once again been guilty of blithely following expert advice rather than interrogating advisers and looking at the picture in the round.“The whole history of the pandemic shows that ministers need to ask better questions,” he says, “challenge the advice and really get their heads around what they are being told so they can weigh it up against all the other factors they need to consider in the best interests of the country.”The most gloomy predictions for the omicron wave now seem certain to have been wide of the mark. The problem for the Government is that if a more dangerous, vaccine-resistant variant arises, it could prove difficult to persuade an increasingly cynical public to do as they’re told.More from NewsNovak Djokovic says he will stay and compete in Australia as father calls on Queen to interveneCovid latest news: Britain is close to \u0026#39living with Covid\u0026#39 as pressure on NHS and public services diminishesPolitics latest news: Boris Johnson considers cutting isolation period to five days after Chancellor\u0026#39s interventionKazakhstan leader thanks Russia for help putting down \u0026#39coup\u0026#39 and fighting off \u0026#39terrorists\u0026#39\u0026#39Stingy\u0026#39 prince only showered me with €1m of gifts, ex-girlfriend complainsWolf Moon 2022: what time it peaks in the UK and other full moon datesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"giant deep surfaces midlands one britains greatest ever prehistoric","story":"Scientists are celebrating one of the “greatest finds” in British palaeontological history after the skeleton of a 180 million-year-old sea dragon was discovered in Rutland.Measuring 10 metres in length with a skull weighing approximately one tonne, the ichthyosaur is the largest and most complete fossil of any marine reptile found in Britain.The discovery was made by Joe Davis, an employee of the Leicestershire and Rutland Wildlife Trust, during a routine draining of a lagoon island at Rutland Water in February 2021.Ichthyosaurs were marine reptiles that lived in Britain 250 million years ago. They went extinct 90 million years ago.The animal was characterised by its large teeth and eyes, and ranged in size from one to more than 25 metres. It was first identified in the 19th century by the palaeontologist Mary Anning.Dr Dean Lomax, a palaeontologist who has studied the species, said: “Despite the many ichthyosaur fossils found in Britain, it is remarkable to think that the Rutland ichthyosaur is the largest skeleton ever found in the UK. It is a truly unprecedented discovery and one of the greatest finds in British palaeontological history.“Not only is it the largest ichthyosaur skeleton ever found in Britain, but it is also the most complete skeleton of a large prehistoric reptile ever discovered in the UK. And yes, that includes dinosaurs.”When they first spotted the remains poking out of some clay, team members at Leicestershire and Rutland Wildlife Trust were unsure about their origins and suggested that they could simply be pipes. After speaking to Rutland council, experts from the University of Leicester were called and the ichthyosaur skeleton was identified.The remains were dug out by a team of expert palaeontologists from around the UK in August and September. They worked in partnership with Anglian Water, Rutland County Council and the Leicestershire and Rutland Wildlife Trust. The skeleton was also surrounded by the remains of ammonites and belemnites, which may have been feasting on the animal\u0027s remains. Scientists said that the discovery could give them a better understanding of their ecosystems.Although two incomplete and much smaller ichthyosaurs were found during the initial construction of Rutland Water in the 1970s, experts said that it was unusual to find a specimen of this kind in the Midlands. Remains are usually found across the Jurassic and Yorkshire coast.“To put this find into context for the public in the world of British palaeontology, the discovery is like finding a complete Tyrannosaurus rex out in the Badlands of America, only this Jurassic giant was found in a nature reserve in Rutland, of all places. It is a truly unprecedented discovery and one of the greatest finds in British palaeontological history,” Dr Lomax said.Scientists are now securing funding to clean and repair the skeleton before it is put on display.Dr Mark Evans of the British Antarctic Survey said: “I’ve been studying the Jurassic fossil reptiles of Rutland and Leicestershire for over 20 years. When I first saw the initial exposure of the specimen with Joe Davis I could tell that it was the largest ichthyosaur known from either county. However, it was only after our exploratory dig that we realised that it was practically complete to the tip of the tail.”He added: “It’s a highly significant discovery both nationally and internationally but also of huge importance to the people of Rutland and the surrounding area.”Nigel Larkin, a specialist palaeontological conservator, said: “It’s not often you are responsible for safely lifting a very important but very fragile fossil weighing that much.“It is a responsibility, but I love a challenge. It was a very complex operation to uncover, record, and collect this important specimen safely.”The excavation of the remains will feature on BBC Two’s Digging For Britain on Tuesday at 8pm.More from NewsNovak Djokovic\u0026#39s father calls on the Queen to protect his \u0026#39tortured son\u0026#39 as player returns to courtPolitics latest news: Boris Johnson considers cutting isolation period to five days after Chancellor\u0026#39s interventionCovid latest news: Britain is close to \u0026#39living with Covid\u0026#39 as pressure on NHS and public services diminishesKazakhstan leader thanks Russia for help putting down \u0026#39coup\u0026#39 and fighting off \u0026#39terrorists\u0026#39\u0026#39Stingy\u0026#39 prince only showered me with €1m of gifts, ex-girlfriend complainsWolf Moon 2022: what time it peaks in the UK and other full moon datesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"labour has much gain new party led jeremy corbyn","story":"A new year, a new schism in the Labour Party. Rumours are flying that Jeremy Corbyn, still deprived of the Labour whip at Westminster and therefore unable to submit himself as an official candidate ahead of the next general election, is about to launch a new party.Naturally this is being seen as dreadful news for Corbyn’s successor as Labour leader, Keir Starmer: splits, which are far more common on the British Left than on the Right, tend to presage a significant electoral defeat for the party. See 1983 and 2019.There’s no escaping the fact that a new party emerging from Corbyn’s recently launched Peace and Justice Project would pose some organisational and presentational difficulties for Starmer. But there is far more to be gained from such a split, and those who want to see a Labour government in our lifetime should keep their fingers crossed that the rumour mill, on this occasion, is accurate.The root of Corbyn’s grievance is obvious: any MP deprived of the party whip cannot be considered by his or her local party as an official candidate. Naturally, Starmer wants rid of Corbyn from the Parliamentary Labour Party, but that simply wasn’t going to happen if he trusted the judgment of local members in Islington North. Pressing the nuclear button of expulsion would provoke a massive backlash, so deprivation of the whip until after the next general election is an effective, unchallengeable tactic that will serve Starmer’s ends.It\u0027s rumoured that the former Labour MP Mary Creagh, who famously confronted Corbyn for his performance as leader after she lost her Wakefield seat at the 2019 election, is now rumoured to be the leadership’s preferred candidate to replace Corbyn in Islington North – a move that is 100 per cent guaranteed to infuriate Corbyn’s supporters across the country.The hard Left, of which Corbyn remains the figurehead, have been itching for an opportunity to throw a punch at Starmer and the Labour Party and there are many who would relish the prospect of Corbyn standing as an independent against the official Labour candidate — a contest Corbyn would be likely to win.But even this scenario has more upsides than downsides for Starmer. He needs to show that he is in charge of the party and that his promise of a zero tolerance approach to anti-Semitism is being honoured. Corbyn, whose ill-judged comments about the inquiry into anti-Semitism in Labour by the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) led directly to his suspension, remains an embarrassment to Labour so long as he sits in Parliament. If he is there as an independent with his own mandate, Starmer can legitimately disown all responsibility for his presence.And there are plenty in Labour who would welcome the setting up of an entirely new party committed to the kind of anti-West, hard Left economic policies that Corbyn has stood for throughout his career — some because they might be interested in signing up, but many more because they would finally be rid of shouty activists who seem to have more in common with the Socialist Workers’ Party than with a moderate Labour Party committed to change through the democratic and parliamentary process.Such a split should, by rights, have happened long before now there is precious little common ground between centrist Labour and Corbyn’s hard Left, other than a loathing of the common enemy. They disagree fundamentally on defence, on the economy and on foreign policy, especially with regard to Israel and the Middle East. A orce would allow each side to live more happily apart. The reason such a split has never happened is nothing to do with loyalty to the Labour brand or an affection for its history and legacy it is because the current electoral system is guaranteed to kill any splinter group, either immediately or within a very few years. It’s why so many on the hard Left are advocates of electoral reform, which they hope would guarantee at least some representation for a committed Marxist faction. Introducing the single transferable vote would, moreover, have the added attraction of relieving the main party of the need to reform its policies in order to win new voters. Post-polling day alliances could be formed — even between Labour and its former comrades — that would both veto any future Conservative government while allowing unreconstructed socialists to get into government.That’s the theory anyway. That any new Corbyn-led party might be launched before electoral reform is secured says a lot about how desperate the hard Left is. They have never been short of belief in their own philosophy and a conviction that the electorate would embrace them if only they weren’t so stupid and greedy. Like the SDP in 1981, perhaps they believe they can break the mould of British politics with a display of chutzpah and razzamatazz and a decent showing in the odd by-election.Until a split happens (and sadly, it may not), Starmer will continue to feel he is somehow in thrall to his own Left wing, convinced he must continue to throw the occasional morsel to those who once voted for Corbyn but who, perhaps reluctantly, supported his leadership bid in 2020. But imagine a world where a significant number of those party members threw their lot in with the People’s Movement for Peace, Justice and Kindness (trademark pending), where Starmer no longer had to put up with internal criticism every time he praised the record of the last Labour government or supported Sir Tony Blair’s knighthood. What new, innovative policies could Labour develop once it was free from the tyranny of having to sate the socialist appetite of those who can never be satisfied?Imagine having the freedom to campaign for a Labour government without having to worry about those who believe that any Labour Party that is popular with the British people is, by definition, a Labour Party that has sold out.Starmer and his team should adopt a poker faced approach to the prospect of a Corbyn split. In public they should say all the right things — regret, what a shame, best of luck, etc — and confine their glee to private occasions. The new party that would be born from Corbyn’s defection would not be his own it would be the Labour Party.More from NewsNovak Djokovic\u0026#39s father calls on the Queen to protect his \u0026#39tortured son\u0026#39 as player returns to courtPolitics latest news: Boris Johnson considers cutting isolation period to five days after Chancellor\u0026#39s interventionCovid latest news: Britain is close to \u0026#39living with Covid\u0026#39 as pressure on NHS and public services diminishesKazakhstan leader thanks Russia for help putting down \u0026#39coup\u0026#39 and fighting off \u0026#39terrorists\u0026#39\u0026#39Stingy\u0026#39 prince only showered me with €1m of gifts, ex-girlfriend complainsWolf Moon 2022: what time it peaks in the UK and other full moon datesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"must have many babies possible","story":"After the Pope said it was selfish to raise pets rather than kids, I turned on the radio to hear the public’s verdict. Apart from some anti-Catholic bigotry, which I enjoyed because it’s very chic to feel like a victim, a consensus emerged that it is in fact selfish to have kids rather than pets – because it increases your carbon footprint.This might be the silliest thing I’ve ever heard. The idea that giving up your youth, looks and money to raise children is selfish – whereas doing what I did, running away from responsibility, is virtuous – was belied by a visit over Christmas from my friend Alex, his wife and two beautiful children. It felt like taking tea with a hurricane. While we did our best to prevent the girl, a ball of ferocious energy, from demolishing the front room, Alex’s son attempted to swallow his daddy’s car keys. After they’d left, Bertie, my dog, emerged from behind the sofa and said: “If you ever get one of those, I’m moving out.”“I’m afraid on this subject,” said a radio caller, “I defer to David Attenborough, not the Pope.” And there’s the rub. Catholics are pro having kids St David of the BBC says the world is overpopulated, an End is Nigh narrative that is largely false.Parts of the developing world are crowded, but growth is generally slowing. The West has hit its peak and is in decline. In Germany they are razing empty flats to make way for parks in Italy, maternity wards are shut. Much of the world is hurtling towards under-population, which means a shrinking base of young workers supporting an expanding base of pensioners with high medical bills. You can’t defeat the facts of life, which necessitate having babies even if just to keep humanity in balance. Several countries are now paying people to breed.Britain’s solution, however, truly is selfish: we’re importing workers from poorer countries, sucking up the world’s talent like a bloated vampire. But this must end. China is predicted to fall from 1.4 billion now to around 730 million by the end of the century. Bertie will not look after me when I’m old: without a pool of migrant workers, who will?The richest 1 per cent of the world has been responsible for more than twice as much carbon pollution than the poorest half of the world, despite being crammed with all those bodies that so disgust the eco-prophets. Logic suggests we need a little material sacrifice by the West and a fairer distribution of resources (it doesn’t have to mean socialism – freer trade will help). So why many environmentalists leap to the conclusion that we need fewer people, especially when they are already going the way of the red squirrel, is bizarre. They favour fecundity in other species, so the Earth is brimming with tarantulas and great whites, yet almost sterility in their own.It betrays psychology. The Pope wants to save the planet for people. The overpopulation crowd often wants to save it from people. Reading Laudato Si’, Francis’s encyclical on ecology, which helped convert me to environmentalism, one is struck by its language of fertility and abundance. Catholics are instructed to celebrate life and be open to it, because our bodies were designed to create it. Nature evinces a purpose and a plan.It is the careless disposability of the consumer society, the wasting of ine gifts, that really angers the pontiff, especially when it comes to human beings – to the sad notion that we can “eliminate children because they are not what their parents wanted”. The future that haunts Francis is homes “full of things” but empty of people.By obsessing about the inidual’s carbon footprint, the militant environmentalist becomes what they profess to hate: a materialist. They reduce all of life to a zero-sum economic calculation that shifts the emphasis away from dynamic selflessness (active charity) and towards doing as little as possible: no driving, no encountering, just sitting at home, if you can afford to, warming yourself by a heat pump.There are many reasons why people do not have kids that are none of our darn business. But those who boast they are saving the world by avoiding reproduction are  only extracting themselves from the dirty business of living, eschewing the pain and worry of raising a family. By happy coincidence it also leaves them with a lot more money to go on eco-tours of Guatemala. Some of them arrive by private jet.A tribute to another outspoken CatholicSpeaking of outspoken Catholics, I’d like to pay tribute to Fr James Doherty, AKA “Big Jim”, a Glasgow priest who died last week, of whom the stories are legendary. On one occasion, a man appeared at the presbytery with a notepad that read: “I am homeless, deaf and dumb. Please help.” The cleric had seen this trick before.“Can you lip read?” asked Big Jim. The man nodded. “Well, I’ve nae money, honey, but if you’ll come into the house, I’ll make you a sandwich.” Thank you, the man nodded.As they walked past the huge gong the house keeper would use to summon the clergy to lunch, Jim whacked it so hard it rang like Big Ben. “God God!” cried the homeless man, “What the Hell did you do that for?!”“Oh, it’s a double miracle!” said Big Jim. “Ye can hear and ye can speak!!”“Aye well,” replied the man, rubbing his ears, “you’ve got to work bloody hard to get any money out of people nowadays.”Jim made the man his sandwich.More from NewsNovak Djokovic\u0026#39s father calls on the Queen to protect his \u0026#39tortured son\u0026#39 as player returns to courtPolitics latest news: Boris Johnson considers cutting isolation period to five days after Chancellor\u0026#39s interventionCovid latest news: Britain is close to \u0026#39living with Covid\u0026#39 as pressure on NHS and public services diminishesKazakhstan leader thanks Russia for help putting down \u0026#39coup\u0026#39 and fighting off \u0026#39terrorists\u0026#39\u0026#39Stingy\u0026#39 prince only showered me with €1m of gifts, ex-girlfriend complainsWolf Moon 2022: what time it peaks in the UK and other full moon datesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"four ways make your christmas","story":"Four ways to make your Christmas with loved ones safer according to GPWe can still have a great time together – just follow these tips to help protect loved ones from the new Covid- strainthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video coronavirus-numbers-uk-records--,customFields:,clearance:Network,source:ceaefcdbe,sourceUrl:Copied from RSC,site:Mirror,brandSafety: General news – passed for ad targeting,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:dtzrPE,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,pubmaticVideoPrebidEnabled:true,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,disableOzoneScriptOnDragonfly:true,pubmaticIdDisabled:true,fbia.mantisRecommender:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,blackFridayWidget.linkUrl:https:www.mirror all-about black-friday,blackFridayWidget:,partner.quicklinks.bar:true,enableSlideInSkinnySignUp:true,justpremiumDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,videoPlaylistEnabled:true,domain:mirror,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,publicationId:aeed-a--bac-edf,lotameLightningTagV:true,ampVideoCacheBuster:true,pubmaticDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,deleteAccountFromProfile:true,adHiddenLoading:true,adslotsFixedSize:true,blackFridayWidget.Link:https:get-latest.dev.convrse.media black-fridayblack-friday-widget-v.,sovrnDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,video.header.bidding.enabled:,chatEnabled:true,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,enableAboutTopics:true,converse.widget.enable:true,viafouraComments:true,adMobileBottomSlotLarge:true,video.jwplayer.playerId:DxFYnOv,flagsFromDataLayerForFBIA:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,fbia.converse.enabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,openxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,globalTrayEnabled:true,manualReconsent:,mpulse.enabled:true,nobidDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,og.image.for.section.and.topic:https:s-prod.mirror @trinitymirrordigital chameleon-branding publications mirror img logo-mirror-socialsharing.png,publicationName:Mirror,video.jwplayer.enabled:true,loadIrisManually:true,delayAdsUntilCMP:true,disableAdvertMaxHeight:true,preloadFonts:true,viafouraEnabled:true,PWA.enable:true,readNextEmbeds:true,removeSSO:true,chartbeatHeadlinePageTypes:[ home , channel , topic , section ],felix.endpoint:https:felix.data.tm-awx ampconfig.,breakingNewsPull:true,nobidVideoPrebidEnabled:true,adFixedMobileBottomSticky:true,magniteDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,footerNewsletterConfig:,xandrDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,consentText:We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Close contact with others – especially in unventilated spaces – increases your chances of spreading Covid-. If you’re spending the festive season with loved ones there are lots of ways you can reduce the risk, including taking regular rapid lateral flow tests, letting fresh air in and getting your booster. GP Dr Claire Ashley provides some simple tips for staying safe so you and those close to you can gather round the table and enjoy your Christmas fun. Take those tests  Meeting up with loved ones  You should all do a rapid lateral flow test before you mingle.They’re free, easy to do at home and the results show in half an hour – to order a pack, go to nhs.uk get-tested.“If you haven’t got any symptoms, rapid lateral flow tests are very good at picking up Covid-,” says Dr Ashley, based in the South West. “On Christmas morning, before granny comes over for lunch, taking a test is the best way to check you’re not infectious. “My family will all have a rapid lateral flow test the morning we travel down to see my parents, andanything comes back positive, or any of us has symptoms, we won’t go. “I’m aware our plans might be disrupted. It’s not perfect, especially after last year, but I’d rather everyone stays safe.”  As Dr Ashley points out, rapid lateral flow tests are designed to pick up Covid- cases with no symptoms, soyou do have symptoms such as a fever, cough or loss of sense of taste or smell, you need to isolate immediately and take a PCR test. Andyour rapid lateral flow test does show a positive result, you’ll need to isolate and only leave the house to take a PCR test to confirm it.If you have been in contact with someone with Covid- and are double vaccinated, you should take a daily rapid lateral flow test for seven daysyou have no symptoms. If you test positive or develop symptoms in those seven days, you must self-isolate, take a PCR test and follow the guidance on gov.uk.If you are unvaccinated, you must self-isolate for  daysyou are in contact with someone who has Covid-.Don’t forget the NHS COVID- app is still the fastest way to knowyou’ve been exposed to someone who’s tested positive, so keep it on.Open the window sLetting fresh air into your home is one way to help reduce the spread of Covid-. Opening windows and doors for just  minutes will help. “Covid- is an airborne virus and the research suggests that when you’re in a well-ventilated space the risk of contracting it is reduced,” says Dr Ashley. “That’s why being outdoors is much more safe, but that’s tricky when it’s very cold. Soyou want to reduce the chances of Covid- being passed on, have the windows open so you get as much airflow as possible.” Wear a face covering You must wear a face covering in public areas such as shops, places of worship, entertainment venues, and on public transport. It’s wise to wear a mask in crowded or enclosed spaces, eventhey’re not legally required. “Face coverings are really effective at reducing how much you’re spreading Covid-,” explains Dr Ashley. Get your booster Every adult in the country now needs to get a Covid- booster vaccine, because two doses does not give you enough protection against catching Omicron. Book yours now at nhs.uk covidvaccination.Get Boosted Now is the national mission to build a wall of defence against the Omicron iant. This mission is more urgent than ever before with Covid- because Omicron is spreading fast. Vaccines are the best way we can protect ourselves. You can get a Covid- booster  weeks after your second dose. Boosters give you the best possible protection against the virus and should signicantly reduce your risk of serious illness and hospitalisation.If you haven’t had your first or second vaccine, go to nhs.uk covidvaccination or call  to book it, or find your nearest walk-in centre.“It’s also very important for pregnant women to get vaccinated,” adds Dr Ashley. “The benefits of being vaccinated and boosted really outweigh the risks.”People with lower immune systems might need to be more careful about socialising this Christmas, as they could have less protection against getting severely ill with Covid-. This includes people who are taking medication that suppresses the immune system – eg, for rheumatoid arthritis – and those having chemotherapy.

Pepe Di’Iasio’s school in Yorkshire has more than  leaks in the roof, leaving his pupils “cold and wet”. As we launch Levelling up Watch, Mr Di’Iasio said: “Words are cheap, actions speak louder than words.”Mr Di’Iasio dreads the rain. Dreads it because the school roof leaks and staff will be running around classrooms to place buckets to catch the water. It’s just one more problem in a Covid-hit educational world that has caused such anxiety for his pupils that some have turned up drunk for lessons, while others have been traumatised by domestic violence. The school has used all its cash reserves putting support in place. Di’Iasio says: “We’ve done our best to try to prioritise people, not spend money on bricks and mortar.” But the -year-old building is in desperate need of investment.  The clapped-out drains are collapsing, there are cracks in windows caused by subsidence, water comes through the flat roof in at least  places, and the technology building has been closed because it is in such a state. Site manager Martin Smith gives us a tour of Wales High School near Sheffield, South Yorks, and says: “It’s just a nightmare, we’re forever mopping up.” We stop to chat to two caretakers, one has  keys hanging on a chain around his neck as the locks have not been upgraded since the school opened in . The caretakers are fixing a huge fan heater and, with a sigh, one explains: “It’s broken again. Everything is just tired out.”  There are , pupils, aged  to , at the school, where carpets are stained from the leaks and ceiling tiles are missing where caretakers burst them to release the build-up of water. Science teachers were furious last term when water came through and destroyed crucial coursework. But despite the struggles, Mr Di’Iasio and the caretakers could not be more proud of their secondary school and their “amazing” pupils. The devotion of the staff is clear – during lockdown, the kitchen staff and cleaners repainted the whole school. It may not be pretty, but Wales High School, rated “Good” by Ofsted, is so popular parents fight to get their kids places, with at least  appeals every year when admission is refused.  The school tries to keep up with this demand, even converting staff toilets to classrooms. Head of School, Lisa McCall lost half her office to accommodate students. She says: “I can hear the lesson next door and I have to whisperdiscussing anything confidential because of the thin partition.” Mr Di’Iasio invited the Mirror into the school to show how desperately funding is needed. He has seen no sign of the promised levelling up or extra money for schools. He says: “It’s hard to believe we are in the world’s sixth-largest economy. Levelling up is supposed to be the big idea of Boris Johnson’s government.When he was elected in  he pledged to spread opportunity to every corner of the UK. But two years later we are still waiting for the Prime Minister to deliver on his promises. A White Paper setting out the Government’s plan was supposed to have been published this month but has now been shelved until the new year.Many are starting to question whether Mr Johnson is genuinely committed to spreading wealth and opportunity orlevelling up is just an empty slogan. That is why the Mirror is today launching Levelling Up Watch. We intend to hold the Government to account over its plans to improve schools, communities, education and transport. We also want to see any additional money distributed fairly and not just to seats the Tories need to retain to stay in power. What is clear is tinkering with the structure of local government and sprinkling money on piecemeal transport schemes will not be enough. The regional inequality in Britain is not only deep and engrained, it has become starker since the Conservatives came to power in . During that period more than , Sure Start Centres have closed, local councils have seen their funding cut by more than % and the budgets for public health and education have been badly squeezed. The National Audit Office found that since , funding in the most deprived fth of schools fell in real terms by .%, while funding in the fth least deprived schools rose by .%. The additional money announced by Chancellor Rishi Sunak in his Budget will onlyper pupil funding to  levels. People in poorer areas are likely to have worse health and shorter le expectancy but the budget for Public Health England in - is % – £billion – lower in real terms than in -. Nor can it be right that - transport spending was £ per capita in London, compared to £ in the North East and £ in Yorkshire and Humber. We have heard plenty of words from Mr Johnson about his ambitions to level up but the time for rhetoric is over. We need to see some action.  “We are in a s building and as we speak the rain is pouring down. “I have no doubt that we will have more than five or six dferent leaks, with buckets in classrooms, by the end of the day. We are in a school where children will be cold and wet. “This at a time when we are keeping windows open to allow airflow to prevent the spread of Covid, and the heating is working overtime to keep the temperature at a level you can work and learn in. “Our site staff are brilliant at trying to make do and mend, but the building is creaking and when it rains the flat roof leaks. It has been patched up as much as it possibly can be. “The building is not really fit for purpose and the environment can have a massive impact on learning.”  Mr Di‘Iasio is also dealing with the impact of Covid on his pupils’ mental health. He says: “We are dealing with the fallout from that from a large number of students on a daily basis. “Initially when the students came back they were just so happy to be back, but then things changed and they started exhibiting more extremes of behaviour than we had before. “We had students turning up with alcohol, being under the influence. “We had students who had the police in the house overnight dealing with incidents of domestic violence and we’ve had incidents where students have been suffering from the pressure of the exam process.  “We have spent our money making sure we keep our staff and have enough people to support the students. “There is more money now invested in mental health support and wellbeing.” The school stayed open the first week of the Christmas holidays so pupils could get hot meals. All of the school’s reserves, £,, have now gone. Mr Di‘Iasio says: “The students make the job worthwhile, they make every day a happy day. But it’s when you are looking at the budget and having to make really tough decisions about whether to keep that counsellor or that classroom assistant. They are the darkest days. “But we love our school.” About levelling up, Mr Di‘Iasio says: “I am massively in favour of the concept, but words are cheap and actions speak louder than words. A Department for Education spokesperson said: “We have invested £. billion since  to enable schools to refurbish their buildings, including £. billion in - alone.On top of this, our new ten-year School Rebuilding Programme to transform  schools is underway and will improve the education of tens of thousands of children as we level up across the UK.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON EducationSchoolsMental healthSecondary schoolLevelling Up Watch\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Hes the problem, says Fleet Street Fox Image: Getty ImagesopinionByFleet Street FoxColumnist:,  Jan Updated:,  Jan | commentsWhen the illegal parties stack up, the polls slump, and Conservative MPs rebel, the refrain most often heard from Westminster is that the next general election is in the baghis handlers will just let Boris be Boris. The Prime Minister has a reputation - and an electoral record - of being so charismatic, charming, funny, and great at public speaking that he is voter Viagra, able to stfen the softest Tory resolve into a state of firm, blue, rigidity.What his addicts in the party have failed to realise is that permanent priapism is no fun at all, and that the best possible outcome is for that hardened intent to be spaffed up the wall. The structural support he creates is destined, indeed intended, to collapse.Which is why his detractors, the Covid-bereaved, Keir Starmer, and the Labour Party alike, also want his handlers to just let Boris be Boris. There are two years until the next General Election. The PM could be forgiven for thinking he can yet turn the polls, which have consistently swung to Labour for more than a month now, back round.But no government in British history has won  general elections in a row. The Tory request to remain in power until  would be utterly unprecedented,the electorate granted it. And considering that is a year in which we might expect to see nuclear fusion, hydrogen boilers, and flying cars, never mind hypersonic nuclear missiles capable of travelling at a mile per second, there are a number of things that the Tories would need to demonstrate to get the gig.. They will need to surf the wave of scientic advancement. Instead, theyaposre led by someone who needed technology lessons from a lady who left her adulterous stockings in his marital kitchen bin.  . They will need to demonstrate the aposBrexit bounceapos. Short of handing out passport-blue spacehoppers decorated with the Queenaposs coat of arms, this will not be forthcoming. Food costs more, imports cost more, exports cost more, and everyone who voted to get rid of EU migrants has since had cause to complain about a lack of lorry drivers, care staff, NHS workers, waiters and or au pairs.. The average British family is going to lose around £, a year as of April. Inflation is predicted to hit % annually and, to keep pace, weaposd all need a pay rise of % before tax to cope with it. And we canapost all become HGV drivers, now can we  . Petrol, gas, and electricity have all risen by around %. The post-pandemic spike may settle down by , but not at todayaposs rates. Inflation will mean itaposs always going to cost more, and there is absolutely nothing any Prime Minister can do about those prices, because the Tories sold our energy off in the s. . Levelling up needs to happen. Tory mayor for the Tees Valley, Ben Houchen, said today Red Wall voters need to see spades in the ground, improved transport infrastructure, the prospect of new jobs on the horizon. What can they see  HSaposs northern leg cancelled, less funding per head for public services and, as the Mirror reports today, schoolchildren learning in converted staff toilets and classrooms that are unfit for human habitation.  Throw on top of that binfire an increase in National Insurance contributions, a housing crisis, an immigration crisis caused by a refusal to accept the immigrants we need and an inability to get rid of those we donapost, and youaposve handed Keir Starmer the economy, stupid.The Tories are ceding territory to Labour every day. Even now, two years before an election, Labour has been leading on the cost of living for months and demanding a VAT freeze on energy which is the only weapon a PM has against fuel prices, and which will have to happen in March before the price cap kicks in. When the Chancellor announces that, Starmer will thank him nicely for listening, and the country will see an Opposition that is already in charge. Equally important is that the Tories have nothing to rely on but the character of the Prime Minister, and what was once funny is now despicable. His charisma has become cancerous, his rhetoric risible. Who believes, any more, in  new hospitals, or control of our borders, or a fix for Northern Ireland  And how many believe, instead, that his gold wallpaper mattered more to him than keeping Covid out of care homes  Read more With no Brexit bounce, no levelling up visible, and money pouring from our pockets into the tax-avoiding bank accounts of Tory donors, any government that had promised the opposite would struggle to get re-elected.But this one is led by a man whose character has been defined by WhatsApp, by wine-while-you-work, by denials and blame-shting. If you look at Boris Johnson now, you can no longer see a tousle-haired, blond buffoon flying thrillingly too close to the sun. Itaposs dead cat upon dead cat, as far as the eye can see.The Red Wall is crumbling. Tunbridge Wells is disgusted as never before. And there is no firm ground that any future election can be fought on, eventhe Tories find someone  to lead them - itaposs a shting swamp of -word phrases, which is not going to be enough to win an unprecedented  years in power. All Boris Johnson has got are his promises.

He had very kindly come into the building so we didnapost have to deal with one of those awkward line failures.Mr Gove is stuck in the Broadcasting House lt. I wish I could say this is a joke, it is not a joke and it is not very funny for Mr Gove and the security man, who have been stuck there for some time. He said Mr Gove had been keeping cheerful.  The Housing Secretary eventually arrived for his slot, joking: After half an hour in the lt you have successfully levelled me up.Told that #FreeMichaelGove had been started on Twitter, he said he suspected there are rather more people who feel he should be incarcerated for longer.He later told LBC he had texted BBC chairman Richard Sharp in order to be freed from the lt. A BBC spokesman said: Weaposre sorry Mr Gove was stuck in one of our lts, but weaposre glad he was later able to take part in the interview. The incident came as Mr Gove was due to update MPs on plans to fix the cladding crisis. Leaseholders have been trapped in dangerous homes they cannot sell for more than four years after the Grenfell Tower tragedy in , in which  people were killed. The Tories have ripped up unpopular plans to make leaseholders in buildings between m and m tall take out loans to cover the costs of remediation work.  Property developers have instead been warned they face legal action and new taxesthey fail to pay up for costs of dangerous cladding, which Mr Gove estimates to be £ billion. In an earlier interview with Sky News, Mr Gove said he is prepared to use legal means and ultimately,necessary, the tax system to ensure developers live up to their responsibilities. He said: We want to say to developers and indeed all those who have a role to play in recognising their responsibility that we want to work with them. Butitaposs the case that itaposs necessary to do so, then we will use legal means and ultimately,necessary, the tax system in order to ensure that those who have deep pockets, those who are responsible for the upkeep of these buildings, pay rather than the leaseholders, the iniduals, who in the past were being asked to pay with money they didnapost have for a problem that they did not cause. He said there could be a developers tax but stressed some had been stepping up to the plate already to remove dangerous cladding.

He said the vaccine rollout for  to -year-olds needed to go much faster after the Government missed its target to jab the majority of younger teens by the October half term. Only around half of this age group have had the jab, Mr Zahawi said. We have to go much, much faster which is why we are going back into schools on Monday with the school age vaccination programme, he said. The Cabinet Minister said Covid would eventually become endemic and people would live with the virus. But he added: The next two weeks will be bumpy as staff absenteeism will rise as students go back into education. On the whole, this has been a good start last week. This week will be important. He also backed calls for the Covid self-isolation period to be cut to five daysexperts deem it safe, in order to ease staff shortages.

The snap survey found the majorityof heads had pupils absent due to Covid, while nearly a thirdreported over % of children were out of class because of the virus. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of NAHT, said: “Schools are doing everything they can to maintain education for pupils in the face of very challenging circumstances. Staff absence on the first day of term was considerable and could very likely rise as the term progresses.” Mr Zahawi also insisted that exams would go ahead this summer, with more details to come next month on the measures needed to make assessments fair for pupils. He said: My absolute commitment is that exams are going ahead both this January and for the summer, for GCSEs and A-levels, but weaposre putting in mitigations to make sure that we recognise who have had their education disruption.

Today the Daily Mirror takes a detailed look at le in areas the Conservatives claim they now care about. The picture is bleak, with little or no progress since Boris Johnson won an -seat majority at the  General Election. Over-promising and under-delivering is a hallmark of this Prime Minister.

Labour announced it would create a £million contingency fund to support struggling firms, including “energy intensive” industries.It said: “This fully-funded measure would be paid for through the party’s plan to fix the broken energy market, which includes a one-off windfall tax on record North Sea oil and gas profits.” Labour will tomorrow force a vote in Parliament calling for the Government to scrap business rates, reduce the debt burden facing firms and launch the contingency fund. Get a daily morning politics briefing straight to your inbox.for the free Mirror Politics newsletter Shadow Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said: “Soaring energy bills, a wave of cancellations and crippling inflation have left British firms unnecessarily on the brink.  “The Government has been asleep at the wheel, with British firms, especially those energy-intensive businesses, paying the price. “The Conservatives’ ambivalence towards British business is simply unacceptable. “Viable firms risk going to the wall because of Government failures over the last decade.”  Manufacturers fear rocketing power prices could jeopardise jobs. The Mirror revealed a UK Steel report last month that warned how the UK’s “disproportionately high electricity prices have cost UK steelmakers an extra £million this year” and £million over the last six years - “the equivalent of almost two yearsapos capital investment in the sector”.  On average, British producers are paying % more than German firms and % more than French for electricity, it added. UK Steel director-general Gareth Stace said today: “Uncompetitive and unaffordable electricity prices for the UK’s steelmakers have been a thorn in the side of its ability to invest in British steelmaking for many years, and the increasing disparity between UK and European prices now halts in its tracks our ability to decarbonise.  “Last year, we paid £m more than our German competitors for electricity. “Right now, UK steel producers are having to take dficult decisions daily on whether to pause production based on the cost of electricity. “This is no way to efficiently produce steel, or as the foundation to a healthy British economy.” Community steelworkers’ union national officer Alun Davies said: “The British steel industry is the backbone of the UK economy, providing quality jobs, supporting communities and supporting key industries.  “We’re pleased to see Labour acting to reduce energy prices, and hope the Government follows suit to give energy intensive industries the breathing space they so desperately need. GMB union general secretary Gary Smith said: “Labour’s announcement is welcome news and may help protect thousands of jobs in energy intensive companies.  “We will only get proper control over prices and security of energy supplywe create and support domestic industries that bring home green jobs - a move that would create skilled work for the people of our country. “If you want to tackle fuel poverty, a good start is creating well-paid, skilled jobs.” Labour’s plan follows a warning from the Energy Intensive Users’ Group that rocketing power prices had put firms at risk. Chairman Richard Leese said: “On top of already uncompetitive UK industrial energy costs, the current sustained high energy prices, coupled with UK carbon prices at a premium to those in the EU, is driving greater disparity between the UK and its competitors.  “UK Government inaction threatens the inward investment needed to sustain healthy domestic production and, crucially, that needed to meet our shared climate ambitions. “The threshold for Government action shouldn’t be triggered by imminent business collapse. Energy intensive foundation industries underpin critical UK supply chain resilience.” Labour MP Stephen Kinnock, whose Aberavon constituency includes Britain’s biggest steelworks, Port Talbot, said: “Energy intensive industries such as steel are the backbone of the British manufacturing sector, but they are being held back by astronomical energy costs.  “The fully-costed plan that Labour is bringing forward offers steel and other key strategic industries a pathway to a healthy and sustainable future.” A Government spokeswoman said: “We remain absolutely determined to secure a competitive future for our energy intensive industries and in recent years have provided them with extensive support, including more than £bn to help with the costs of energy and to protect jobs. “Ministers and officials continue to engage constructively and regularly with industry to understand and to help mitigate the impacts of high global gas prices.  “Our priority is to ensure costs are managed and supplies of energy are maintained. “We have ious funds in place to support businesses with high energy use to cut their bills and reduce carbon emissions, including the £m Industrial Energy Transformation fund.” The Mirror has been campaigning to Save Our Steel since .Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Labour PartyGMB unionRichard LeeseGary SmithAlun DaviesJonathan ReynoldsEnergyEnergy billsFuel povertyGas pricesBritish economyPoliticsSave Our Steel campaign\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Ashfield MP Lee Anderson was recently criticised for telling a female district councillor in his constituency to “stay out of big boy’s politics”. The Tories appointed him to the committee in May last year, despite having reprimanded him over sexist behaviour. But after just six months on the committee, he was quietly replaced in mid-December by former equalities minister Caroline Dineage. Mr Anderson has not publicly addressed his stepping back from the committee, and did not respond to a request for comment. Commons records show he left the Committee on December . Mr Anderson made headlines during the Euro  tournament for announcing he would not watch England matches because he did not like “the taking the knee business.” Mr Anderson was “warned” by Conservative party in  over a Facebook post while he was a Councillor.Alongside a picture of a woman wearing a low-cut tank top, Mr Anderson wrote: “Out with some great knockers tonight in Skegby.” In November, he sparked fury in his local constituency by telling Ashfield District Councillor Samantha Deakin to “stay out of big boy’s politics.” Cllr Deakin had criticised Mr Anderson in a row about a local college. “Like many people, Lee Anderson’s appointment to the Women’s and Equality Select Committee was a surprise to me,” she said. “ More than that - it was an insult. Since then, I have been a victim of his misogyny.” She added: “We asked the Conservative Party last year whether his current membership of this important committee was appropriate – they didn’t reply. “It’s clear however that someone has agreed and this Select Committee can now get on with their job without the influence of someone with the views of a s Working Men’s Club comedian.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Lee AndersonConservative PartyThe EuroPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Education Secretary rejected Labouraposs plans for a one-off windfall tax on the fossil fuel firms to help support consumers claiming they donapost add up. Mr Zahawi, a former oil industry advisor, claimed the rise in the national living wage would help people cope with rising energy costs which are set to add hundreds of pounds to average bills. The biggest British energy firms, BP and Shell, raked in £.bn in three months last year and the boss of BP has called the market a cash machine. Mr Zahawi told LBC: I was a businessman before I entered Parliament and I can tell you what Labour are putting out just doesnapost add up.  A windfall tax on oil and gas companies, who are already struggling in the North Sea, is never going to cut it.He said the Government had poured £.million into helping those most in need - and said looming National Insurance hike was a progressive way to raise funds for the NHS and social care.But Shadow Financial Secretary to the Treasury James Murray said: Rather than supporting hard-working people facing huge energy bill rises, Government ministers are pleading poverty on behalf of oil companies who are enjoying record profits.” Labour would impose a windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas producers to fund measures to ease the cost of living squeeze, by reducing the average household energy bill by £.The £.bn plan would include removing VAT on domestic energy bills for a whole year, as well as expanding and increasing the warm homes discount for those most at risk. Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves blamed ministers for creating a “price crisis” by responding to surging wholesale energy costs with “dither and delay”.  Under Labouraposs plan, fossil fuel giants would be forced to contribute £.bn to help fund the proposals, through a year-long increase to their corporation tax of %. Ms Reeves told Sky: The Prime Minister was the biggest advocate for cutting VAT on gas and electricity bills during the European referendum. But now when cutting those bills would make more dference than ever, the Prime Minister says no. The Shadow Chancellor said thatnow was not the time to cut VAT on energy bills then frankly I donapost know when is. She added: Bills canapost be paid on broken promises. Labour announced a £ million contingency fund to support businesses struggling to cope with soaring energy costs. Analysis shows that nearly one in four businesses say they have been affected by higher gas prices, with more than , affected.

Statues, flags and anthems are battlegrounds the PM’s smokescreen to ert public attention away from his tax hikes, soaring fuel bills, cost of living rises, stagnant wages and declining public services.  It is a classic, cynical Right-wing strategy to ide and rule. It played well in the past and it might work again. Magicians use misdirection as a form of deception to draw the audience’s attention from the real action. Johnson would rather voters were angry about a jury clearing four protesters over the toppling of slaver Edward Colston’s statue in Bristol than holding the PM to account for increased National Insurance or discussing Labour’s proposed windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas producers to compensate households who are facing huge increases in energy bills. Suella Braverman is an Attorney-General whose ideological conviction results in much of the legal profession judging her guilty of stupidity. Even considering an appeal against the jury verdict in the Colston case is a sign the governing party will roll in the gutter. Labour leader Keir Starmer is wise to take no lectures on patriotism from a Conservative regime which inflicted the terrible national self-harm that is Brexit. But in a fight, the Labour leader is similarly wise to combat smears which saw predecessor Jeremy Corbyn unfairly tainted as hating his country. Labour wins by keeping the national conversation on big issues that really count, the Tories by changing it to emblems and frippery.

Sinead Cottam, , from Scarborough, is mum to Lewis, , Shae, five and Demi, two - who all arrived in the world on  January. The three children have defied unbelievable odds to celebrate their birthdays together, leaving Sinead utterly gobsmacked. The mum-of-three recalled how Lewis, who will be  tomorrow, arrived two days after his  January due date back in . He enjoyed six years of not having to share his birthday until little Shae came along, four days earlier than his due date, on  January . Recalling going into labour on her eldest sonaposs sixth birthday, Sinead joked Lewis was not happy.The single mum said: We had planned to go out for a birthday tea party after school, but Shae decided to make an early appearance on his birthday so Lewis went to my mum and dadaposs house. She added: His due date was the th and I thought he would be late, so it never crossed my mind they might share a birthday, but when I had pains at home in the early hours I knew he was going to surprise us all and steal his brotheraposs birthday. I thought it was a lovely present for Lewis to become a big brother but he wasnapost very impressed at first. Lewis was six at the time and he wasnapost happy to share his birthday the first time, little did I know then that it would happen again.  Three years later, Sinead found out she was expecting a girl, who was also meant to arrive on Shaeaposs due date of  January. But, just like her older brother, little Demi arrived four days early, making her birthday  January as well. Sinead said: They were excited for a little sister but due to late complications I needed a C-Section and I could not believe my ears when the midwe told me the only date available was January . I was honestly gobsmacked and I said no at first. I explained both my sonaposs already shared that birthday but it had to be that date. I even asked them to check twice. When she broke the news to her sons, little Shae didnapost fully understand - but Lewis, who had been through this once before, was in disbelief. He thought I was joking, Sinead recalled.  He could not believe that both his little brother and now his little sister were going to share his birthday. He reacted better than he did when he was six and both boys came to visit Demi the day she was born so I could see them on their birthday too. Stunning her family by the birth of three children on the same day, Sinead said she struggles to get people to believe her. She said: I donapost know how rare it is, but the nurses had never heard of it before and nobody believes me itaposs all for the same day when I order three cakes, or buy three sets of birthday banners.

But sceptical experts said this is unlikely to be the case - with a World Health Organisation scientist emphatically stating Deltacron is not real. Imperial College virologist Dr Tom Peacock is among the experts saying the anomaly appears to be quite clearly contamination as it does not meet the criteria for a new iant.And World Health OrganisationCovid expert Dr Krutika Kuppalli posted on Twitter : Deltacron is not real and is likely due to sequencing artact .Let’s not merge of names of infectious diseases and leave it to celebrity couples.  The response from the scientic community came after Leondios Kostrikis, professor of biological sciences at the University of Cyprus, said his team had discovered  Covid samples which appeared to combine the Delta and Omicron strains. He told reporters: There are currently omicron and delta co-infections and we found this strain that is a combination of these two. It sparked a huge response on social media, with Deltacron trending for much of the weekend, but experts are not convinced. Dr Peacock wrote in response: The Cypriot aposDeltacronapos sequences reported by several large media outlets look to be quite clearly contamination - they do not cluster on a phylogenetic tree and have a whole Artic primer sequencing amplicon of Omicron in an otherwise Delta backbone.  In a y Twitter thread debunking the iant, he said: Delta sequences with strange mutations in amplicon  have been turning up for ageshowever, they always show this non-monophyletic pattern and are nearly always more easily explained by this primer issue exacerbating very low-level contam.Global health expert Dr Boghuma Kabisen Titanji posted on Twitter: On the #Deltacron story, just because I have been asked about it many times in the last h, please interpret with caution. The information currently available is pointing to contamination of a sample as opposed to true recombination of #Delta and #Omicron iants.She added: The best thing we can do besides worrying about it and coining iant names that sound like a Transformers villain, is ensuring that vaccines are available to everyone and combining vaccination with other strategies that give the virus fewer opportunities to spread. Prof Martin Michaelis, Professor of Molecular Medicine at the University of Kent, told The Mirror that it is not yet clear whether the samples are real, or the rest of a sequencing error or contamination.He said: As far as I can tell, researchers from Cyprus have sequenced samples of SARS-CoV-, the coronavirus that causes COVID-, and received genomic sequences that combine features of the Omicron and Delta iants.It is not yet clear whether this is real or a sequencing error or the consequence of contamination. If dferent viruses from dferent SARS-CoV- iants are analysed on the same machines, you can get sequences that look asthey are from a new virus but are in reality just a mixture of dferent viruses. Hence, we have to wait for what further investigations will show. In any case, Deltacron is not an official name. But he warned thattwo viruses infect the same cell, there is potential for strains to combine - meaning a hybrid iant is formed. Prof Michaelis continued: Coronaviruses including SARS-CoV- have in principle the ability to recombine their genetic materialtwo viruses infect the same cell. Therefore, it is possible thatsomeone is simultaneously infected with an Omicron and a Delta iant virus that new hybrid viruses emerge that carry a new combination of the features of the two original viruses. With high levels of Omicron and Delta transmission at the same time, such hybrid viruses may be formed at some point.

I have watched it over and over still donapost understand what happened. Phil said that he did not believe in ghosts. He said: I am not at all into ghosts or the supernatural. And I donapost want any ghostbuster types coming around here to investigate this.  Phil said he had lived in the house for years and nothing like this had happened before.

The ichthyosaur, about  million years old with a skeleton measuring around  metres inand a skull weighing one tonne, is the largest and most complete fossil of its kind ever found in the UK. It was discovered by Joe Davis of Leicestershire and Rutland Wildle Trust during a routine draining of a lagoon island at Rutland Water in February . The first ichthyosaurs, which are called sea dragons because they tend to have very large teeth and eyes, were discovered by fossil hunter and palaeontologist Mary Anning in the early th century.  Dr Dean Lomax, a palaeontologist who has studied the species, said: Despite the many ichthyosaur fossils found in Britain, it is remarkable to think that the Rutland ichthyosaur is the largest skeleton ever found in the UK. It is a truly unprecedented discovery and one of the greatest finds in British palaeontological history. Ichthyosaurs, which were marine reptiles, first appeared around  million years ago and went extinct  million years ago, ying in size from one to more than  metres inand resembling dolphins in general body shape. The remains were dug out by a team of expert palaeontologists from around the UK in August and September. Two incomplete and much smaller ichthyosaurs were found during the initial construction of Rutland Water in the s. However, the latest discovery is the first complete skeleton. Dr Mark Evans of the British Antarctic Survey said: Iaposve been studying the Jurassic fossil reptiles of Rutland and Leicestershire for over  years.  When I first saw the initial exposure of the specimen with Joe Davis I could tell that it was the largest ichthyosaur known from either county. However, it was only after our exploratory dig that we realised that it was practically complete to the tip of the tail. He added: Itaposs a highly signicant discovery both nationally and internationally but also of huge importance to the people of Rutland and the surrounding area. Nigel Larkin, a specialist palaeontological conservator, said: Itaposs not often you are responsible for safely lting a very important but very fragile fossil weighing that much. It is a responsibility, but I love a challenge. It was a very complex operation to uncover, record, and collect this important specimen safely.The excavation of the remains will feature on BBC Twoaposs Digging For Britain on Tuesday at pm.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Skeleton\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

He survived against the odds, but the severe nerve damage to his left leg meant Ben struggled to walk as his foot was paralysed and he would often stumble and trip over. A customised leg brace, funded by Help for Heroes, has enabled the now -year-old to begin enjoying le back on both feet again.  And on Friday, Ben fulfilled a very special wish – to be able to walk his fiancée Steph Dunn down the aisle. The couple married at St Michael’s Church, Skidby, with their daughters Ellie, , and Ariel, seven, as bridesmaids, and continued their celebration at The Millhouse, in Skidby. The wedding served as an important milestone in Ben’s long journey to recovery, aided by Steph who reached out to Help for Heroes and set in motion the assessments that led to Ben receiving his leg brace, which successfully holds his foot in position.  A Help for Heroes spokesman said: “Everyone at Help for Heroes wishes Ben and Steph a letime of happiness together as they start this exciting new chapter. “His customised leg brace, which was funded by Help for Heroes, has massively improved Ben and his whole family’s quality of le. “We urge the Government to reinstate the Veterans Mobility Fund so that many more veterans like Ben can continue to thrive in their recovery from injury and illness.  Ben proposed to Steph on Mother’s Day last year, with the help of the couple’s Jack Russells, Molly and Rex, who sported “Will You ” and “Marry Me ” messages on their collars. Ben said: “Usually my ankle is hypersensitive but this leg brace feels comfortable as it fits on the outside of my shoes and goes up to my calf so stops my foot from flopping.” He said he had been looking forward to walking up the aisle on his wedding day and having people stare at him “for the right reasons”.

The UKs official Covid death toll has passed ,Coronavirus cases have been high for weeks Image: Adam Gerrard   Daily MirrorByBenjamin LynchSEO Writer:,  Jan | comments A new rule change is set to come into effect tomorrow, as the government works on keeping on top of coronavirus case numbers. There have been dficulties keeping track of case numbers in recent weeks due to shortages of lateral flow testsand polymerase chain reactiontests. Despite this, case numbers have remained high and have reached record levels since the Omicron iant took a hold on the country. The UKaposs official Covid death toll passed , on Saturday January . Prime Minister Boris Johnsonaposs government is currently drawing up plan for a living with Covid strategy, which aims to avoid any long-term restrictions in England from March this year.The proposed rule changes may seem like a contradiction to some, so what are they and who do they affect  What is the PCR test rule change   Currently, people who test positive for Covid with no symptoms on a lateral flow test are required to take a PCR to confirm their status. This will change from January .They will still have to isolate for at least seven days, but only from the date of their positive lateral flow test.Head of Imperial College Londonaposs Department of Primary Care  Public Health, Professor Azeem Majeed told the i that the move is a positive step. He said: If you’re positive on lateral flow teststhat’s almost certainly diagnostic of a Covid- infection in the current situation we’re in, as infection rates are so high.By not then having to take a PCR test, it takes pressure off the PCR testing system. What should I doI have a positive LFT   Anyone who tests positive for the virus through an LFT should report their status immediately. The UK Health Security Agencyhas given guidance of how to do this and what will occur afterwards.They said: Under this new approach, anyone who receives a positive LFD test result should report their result on Gov.UK and must self-isolate immediately but will not need to take a follow-up PCR test. At the moment, isolation rules mean that a fully vaccinated person can stop isolating after seven days, proving they take a lateral flow test every day and are negative on days six and seven and have no symptoms. A move to a five-day isolation period is now under consideration. The PM told reporters today: Yes of course, we are looking at that and we will act accordingly to the science as we always have. Is the change to testing permanent   The change brought in has been described as a temporary measure while cases remain high. The UKHSA said: This is a temporary measure while Covid- rates remain high across the UK. Whilst levels of Covid- are high, the vast majority of people with positive [LFT] results can be confident that they have Covid-. The idea is that while cases are in such high numbers, symptoms and a positive test are more likely than normal to indicate the virus. Meanwhile, while case numbers are infrequent and low, a PCR test might be needed to show a positive infection.  The new approach reflects similar changes made this time last year in January , when there was also a high prevalence of infection meaning it was highly likely that a positive [LFT] Covid- result was a true positive. This meant confirmatory PCRs were temporarily paused and reintroduced in March  following a reduction in prevalence.

Andrew Baylis booked a day trip to Ireland during the company’s October flash sale and bagged a bargain with a £flight. The -year-old was headed out to visit friends he hadn’t seen in five years, BirminghamLive reports.However, his trip was ruined after he was forced to wait five hours on the plane - without it taking off. The huge delays meant his day trip to see friends was cut in half and he was left with barely any time in Dublin. Andrew arrived early at Birmingham Airport for the :am flight on November . However, passengers were not able to start boarding the aircraft until :am and were then told that the plane had no fuel.  Things quickly went from bad to worse when, after a two-hour wait, a Tannoy announcement informed them the plane would now need de-icing as a result of the snow. Andrew said: We didnapost start boarding the plane until .am. So it was already late, and by then it had just started snowing. They shut the doors and then the pilot came on the Tannoy and said we had no fuel. Apparently the crew were due to board another plane at the other end of the airport but there was a last-minute change of aircraft, but it had no fuel in it. We waited about two hours to be refuelled and then it started snowing again. The pilot said we now needed to wait for someone to come and de-ice us. We waited another two hours but in the meantime, another Ryanair plane landed, parked next to ours and we watched it being de-iced before us, then it took off again. By this point people were wanting to get off the plane and the pilot agreed those who wanted to could get off. People were queuing up towards the back but then had to wait an hour to an hour and a half because no one was available to bring the steps. We were sat on this plane for five hours and we werenapost offered anything to drink or eat. It got to about .pm and then we were told the plane didnapost need de-icing anymore because it had warmed up. What little ice and snow there was on the plane had melted. Andrew said the aircraft finally left the runway five and a half hours late - forcing him to cancel his lunch plans with friends and leaving him with only four hours in the city before he had toto the airport for his flight home. It was about five and a half hours in the end and it wasnapost very comfortable. We had to keep our masks on the whole time so it was pretty miserable, said Andrew. All this for an hour-long flight.  It did ruin our plans. We wanted to go shopping and have a meal but we ended up just going back to our friendsapos house for a couple of hours for a catch-up, then I had to head back to the airport. To make matters worse, Andrewaposs claim for compensation from Ryanair has since been refused. He said: Just before we got off the plane in Dublin, the crew apologised for the delay and the pilot said over the Tannoy it was not weather-related, but because of a lack of ground staff at the airport. I was reading on their website that anything from a three hour flight delay means you can be entitled to compensation.I put in a delayed claim, and was informed it was declined, as it was due to adverse weather. However it wasnapost, and this was confirmed with the pilot.If it was a weather related delay, then why was a Ryanair flight parked next to us allowed to depart before us  He added: A truly horric experience. A spokesperson for the airline told BirminghamLive the delay was beyond Ryanairaposs control. A Ryanair spokesperson said: “This flight from Birmingham to Dublinwas delayed due to adverse weather conditions beyond Ryanair’s control.

Following several intense months, the pair released a statement revealing they planned to split their time between the UK and North America and would carve out a progression new role in the institution while becoming financially independent. Days later, crunch talks were held in what became known as the Sandringham Summit between Harry, the Queen, Prince Charles and Prince William.It led to the monarch accepting her grandson and his weaposs decision to step back from the Firm and she said at the time: Harry, Meghan and Archie will always be much loved members of my family. The move brought an end to Meghanaposs short time as a royal that had started around  months earlier. During this time, she was given the rare honour of carrying out a day of engagements with the Queen - and the pair travelled to Chester in June . They made their way to the northwest of England on the Royal Train and among their visits was attending opening the Mersey Gateway Bridge.  Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up. On the day, the pair seemed in good spirits and were pictured smiling and laughing together. And one expert noticed that during the day, Meghan made several subtle hand gestures that revealed her true feelings towards the monarch. Body language expert Judi James said at the time: It was clear from the Queenaposs congruent and very spontaneous-looking smiles that she was delighted to have her new granddaughter-in-law beside her on this visit.  Meghan did appear rather nervous initially though, emerging coyly from the train and using some more tentative gesticulation than usual.Without new husband Prince Harry beside her to touch and hug her, there was a noticeable increase in Meghanaposs self-comforting self-touch and checking rituals, suggesting she is still quite in awe of her doting grandmother-in-law.Since Harry and Meghanaposs move from the UK to America, their relationships with several royals appear to have cooled.  But the couple has had nothing but praise for Her Majesty and in June, they paid tribute to her by naming their daughter Lilibet - a pet name of the Queen. Royal author Omid Scobie told Good Morning America last summer: When it comes to that relationship with the Queen, it is as strong as ever.They have nothing but love for her. Of course, we saw them name their daughter after the Queen’s very nickname. So that really gives us an insight into that close relationship.

The unusual visitor is generally found across tropical and temperate waters, from Iceland to Chile. It is particularly notable as the Sunfish population is listed on the International Union for Conservation of NatureRed List. The species is considered vulnerable due to their tendency to become snagged in drt gill nets and suffocate on sea pollutants, such as plastic bags. It is the second largest bony fish on the planet.  It has been known to grow up to cm long, weighing a colossal ,kg. They are commonly mistaken for sharks as a result of their large size, however they are harmless to people and will often approach ers out of curiosity. The odd-looking fish is flat and circular, with a stf fringe of skin in place of a tail. Its elongated fins give it the appearance of having wings. The fish are regularly spotted basking in the sunshine on their sides, hence earning the name ‘Sunfish’. This unusual behaviour is thought to help them raise their body temperatures after ing to feed on jellyfish in the cooler waters.  Sunfish are becoming an increasingly common visitor to southern and western parts of the UK, but they are generally only seen in summer months, when the water is warm. The Wildle Trust asks anyone who spots a Sunfish at sea to maintain a distance of m and put the engine of their vessel into neutral to avoid propeller injury. They also advise reporting the sighting to their local Wildle Trust branch.  A specimen of the giant fish, which can sometimes weigh more than a car, wasspotted off the coast of Dorsetby a local back in .

Claire Sidebottom was grabbed by her handbag strap and forcibly pulled into a safety barrier at the Manchester city centre club, as she filmed the bouncers and was threatening to report them as they laughed at her. Miss Sidebottom, who was on a pub crawl, dropped the phone before hearing one of the doormen shout: “Grab it and run”. She never saw the £ device again. In a statement to police, Miss Sidebottom said the theft meant she lost sentimental photographs and was unable to be contacted by the hospital who were treating her poorly young son. She also said she had lost faith in door staff and did not want to go out in Manchester City centre again. Police who investigated the robbery found one of the doormen in possession of two kubotans - a weapon used in Martial Arts to place targeted force into pressure points on the body. He has since resigned from his job on the doors of Bar Rogue, in Piccadilly Gardens.  At Minshull Street Crown Court, Manchester, Christopher Cash, , from Edgeley, Stockport, admitted robbery, common assault and possession of an offensive weapon and was ordered to pay Miss Sidebottom £, compensation. The other doorman died unexpectedly before he could be charged. After the case full time mother Miss Sidebottom from Mossley said: aposaposI’m glad this manaposs been punished even though I don’t think what he got enough. He was a doorman and he was there to protect people not to bully, assault and rob. aposaposIt has been my first bar crawl for a while and I felt targeted and bullied and felt hurt because people were laughing with him. That evening I only went out to take my mind off what was going on around me at the time. aposaposI can’t even go out around town anymore now without feeling another bouncer will hurt me. This man took my phone that had sentimental pictures of my baby that I can never get back. He took memories away from me.aposapos The incident occurred on February  last year five weeks before the UK lockdown. Andrew Evans, prosecuting, said: aposaposThe defendant was a doorman at the time and Miss Sidebottom was on a night out and was queuing to get in. She encountered Mr Cash and his colleague but she recalls she was refused entry because staff said that she was too drunk and a dispute arose. aposaposDuring that time, she recalls them saying she was too ugly to be let in so she decided to record their behaviour on her mobile phone, asked for their names and threatened to send the footage to head office. aposaposShe then recalls one of the doormen grabbing her phone from her hand but she was able to grab it back. She asked them why they thought they could take this but then recalls one of the males coming at her through the barrier, causing her to drop the phone. aposaposShe recalled falling to the ground and the doorman saying ‘grab it and run’ to someone nearby. He looked up to see someone dressed in black running away and she never saw the phone again. CCTV shows Cash trying to grab the phone by reaching over the barrier, he then grabs hold of her bag and there is a physical confrontation. aposaposThe bag is around her neck and she was forced forward a few steps into the metal barrier. She fights back and gets back her mobile phone. But the other doorman then parts the barrier, steps towards the complainant and grabs the phone causing her to drop it. aposaposMr Cash picks it up and quickly moves out of the way and goes back inside the bar. During this period Mr Cash walks directly towards a hooded person who had been hanging around up the street. He hands the phone to him and the hooded man runs off across Piccadilly Gardens.aposapos Cash said he assaulted Miss Sidebottom when he lunged through the barrier dragging her forward by pulling the bag around her neck. He then stole her phone which had been dropped on the floor and handed it to an unknown hooded man. Officers recovered one kubotan from Cashaposs jacket pocket following his arrest and seized another when they searched his bag in the police station. In mitigation for Cash, who now works as a delivery driver, defence counsel Anna Chestnutt said: “He is a conscientious gentleman who does feel bad as to what happened to Miss Sidebottom. He says she did not deserve to be assaulted and the phone should not have been taken. He understands she deserves to be compensated. “He resigned from his role as a doorman as he felt that was a good thing to do to prevent this from happening again.aposapos Sentencing the judge Mr Recorder Daniel Prowse told Cash: “You were working with a colleague when Miss Sidebottom was refused entry to the bar as she was told she was too drunk. She recalls being told she was too ugly to be let in. “She recorded the behaviour of you and your colleague on her phone asking for your names and threatening to send the footage to head office. It would seem it was that which prompted the offending that followed. She recalls one of the doormen grabbing the phone from her hand and another coming through the barrier, which caused her to drop her phone. aposaposYou were the one who first came towards her and pulled her. You took the phone from the floor and you handed it to someone who left with it. It seems to me the purpose was to deprive her of evidence of your behaviour. You abused your power as a door supervisor in relation to her.” Cash was also ordered to complete a -month community order,  hours unpaid work and  rehabilitation requirement days.

Izabella Toole was born at just  weeks at Liverpool Womenaposs Hospital weighing just . lbs. The tot initially appeared well but soon began having breathing dficulties and spent the first few days of her le in intensive care. Parents Eleanor and James, of Liverpool, Merseyside, were shell-shocked when doctors then gave them the devastating news that their baby needed open heart surgery. This was due to a condition called ventricular septal defectwhich meant Izabella had a hole in the wall separating her two heart valves.Eleanor, , told the Liverpool Echo : The size of the hole meant it wasnapost going to sort itself out.  We were told she needed the operation before she was two and we decided we wanted her to have it sooner rather than later. The whole thing was terrying. It was a whirlwind. You just have to trust the experts that youaposre in safe hands. We were shell-shocked. At the time I donapost think you can really grasp how dficult it is to go through that as a family. At six months old, Izabella underwent the gruelling surgery at Alder Hey Childrenaposs Hospital. On January , the family celebrated the  year anniversary of the operation that saved their daughteraposs le. James, , said: You talk about it, you cry we came out the other end as a family.  It was terrying and obviously a traumatic thing to let your child go through but we knew it was for the best. The family are still processing the trauma of Izabellaaposs early health issues and want to raise awareness of the importance of research into heart defects that made the operation possible. James described their now ten-year-old daughter as wonderful, laid back and happy with dreams of becoming a make-up artist. The couple praised the incredible care and regular check ups they received from Alder Hey. Eleanor said: All the staff were really supportive. They have us a support team that looked after us too and made sure we were okay. During her treatment, Izabellaaposs parents gave consent for their daughter to take part in research projects to further understand heart conditions. They raised more than £ for the British Hearth Foundation in  and now feel it is important to give back to the research that helped their daughter. Eleanor added: It was research that made Izabellaaposs operation possible. Without the people that went before Izabella, all those years and open heart surgery and research, Izabella wouldnapost be where she is.

Armed police gathered outside a property at around .pm and are still there as neighbours have been forced to stay inside their homes. Eyewitnesses have spoken of up to  armed officers at the scene, Coventry Live reports.  Dramatic images shows an armed police officer standing feet away with his weapon pointing towards the propertyaposs front door. Several armed officers are also surrounding the end of terrace house. A couple trapped inside the cordon say they have been left very scared. Gemma Phillips and Tom McGuinness have been trapped inside their house since the drama unfolded. Gemma said: It has been quite hard, Tom tried to go out yesterday to get essentials, he managed to get out but they wouldnapost let him back in... he managed to get back in but it took a while.As of this morning we have been told to stay in the house altogether.  Ms Phillips is a gymnastics teacher and has not been able to leave the house to get to work, partner Tom McGuinness works at a local casino but is currently on annual leave. The couple, who have lived in Earlsdon for eight years, described the feeling on the road: It was very broken sleep last night, itaposs worrying for the young lad [involved]. We just hope for a peaceful end to it, sooner rather than later. We are worried but itaposs a strange feeling being worried about whataposs going on and feeling the safest youaposve ever been. Weaposre on a police cordoned off area.From what we can see several armed police, God knows up the streets whataposs happening there - you feel safe and worried at the same time Mr McGuinness said. Ms Phillips added: We are very scared, it is a very scary thing for armed police to be outside your house... we hope that it comes to a calm ending.  Another resident living nearby, who did not wish to be named, described the moment armed police swooped the street. I hadnapost noticed anything until around noon when I opened our blinds and saw about four or five police cars and a van, they said. Another neighbour said she has not been allowed to leave her house since pm on Sunday.. She said: It wasnapost until pm that we noticed the cordon and the police on the street. We were looking out the window and popped out of the front door to have a look, and we were told that we had to stay inside. People in the street were also told to not to walk their dogs or go the nearby shops. Weaposve been stuck inside ever since. They eased off a little this morning, because I needed to go the shops for my child. We had to inform the police of our house number. We can see several unmarked police cars and one car with guns pointed at the house, as well as officers congregating around the front door. I was born and grew up here, and it is a quiet area - we have a lot of students living around here. It is a middle-class area. It has a community feel. It is the nicest area in Coventry so this is a shock. I have never seen or met the person or the child in the house, but I know the house is a half-way house.  Itaposs been over  hours now, it has been a complete surprise. The ongoing stand-off has forced a neighbour primary school to close. Earlsdon Primary School issued a statement saying: West Mids Police cordoned off an area around Earlsdon Ave North today while officers deal with an incident.The decision has been taken to close the school on Monday. We apologise for any inconvenience. We hope you understand this is in the interests of pupils, staff and parents. A West Midlands Police spokesperson said: A cordon remains in place around a house in Earlsdon Avenue North, Coventry this morning where a man has been refusing to come out since the early hours of yesterday morning .  The -year-old has his eight-year-old son with him and there are some concerns for their safety. Several officers, including armed police and other specially trained officers, are at the scene to bring the incident to a safe conclusion. Unfortunately, residents, businesses, a school and travel are severely disrupted by the cordon. We’re sorry for the inconvenience, but our priority is the safety of those involved. Please avoid the area where possible and we will issue updates on the situation as soon as we can. The library at Earlsdon Avenue North and Albany Road has been opened for residents and officers to use.  A resident said on Sunday: I hadnapost noticed anything until around noon when I opened our blinds and saw about four or five police cars and a van. At that time there was only one armed officer, but over the course of the next three or four hours they presence of armed police slowly increased to the point that now thereaposs between  and  armed officers here. There are at least six police cars and vans, four of five unmarked cars and four ambulances.  The first real movement was recently when the officers were gathering, one had a ladder, and they went around the corner.One posted on Facebook : Iaposm locked in my house, while another added police wouldnapost let him leave his house.Coventry City Council are arranging temporary accommodation for families stranded outside the cordon while a rest centre has been set up at Earlsdon Library. A council spokesperson said: We are supporting the police as they respond to an on-going incident on Earlsdon Avenue North. We can confirm that we have organised a rest centre for those who need it within Earlsdon Library and we will also arrange temporary accommodation for anyone that is unable to enter their homes because of the police cordon.

And even the Royal Family are no exception to this.We previously learned how Prince William called The Queen aposGaryapos when he was younger as he was unable to pronounce aposGrannyapos. While Prince Phillip is said to have called Her Majesty by several dferent pet names such as aposCabbageapos and aposSausageapos. Similarly, Prince Charles had dubbed Meghan Markle aposTungstenapos, because, just like the metal, he thought she was tough and unbending.And when it comes to Kate Middleton, it seems she also has a selection of weird and wonderful nicknames - although one, in particular, is much closer to her full name.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox. for a Mirror newsletter here. According to OK! Magazine, the Duke of Sussex doesnapost call the Duchess of Cambridge aposKateapos, but instead refers to his sister-in-law as Cath.The duchess, , has been known to the world as Kate for years, but it turns out she actually only started using the nickname aposKateapos while at university, previously preferring to go by her full name, Catherine. Kate has previously admitted that she doesnapost mind which name people choose to call her.  During an interview with BBC Radio  presenter Scott Mills she said: I will answer to most things.As well as Catherine, Kate and Cath, the duchess is also frequently called aposbabeapos and aposdarlingapos by her husband, aposmummyapos by her children and while at school she was known as aposSqueakapos. The latter was derived from the name of a guinea pig.Kate and her younger sister Pippa both had pet guinea pigs, named Pip and Squeak, from which they later took nicknames, with Pippa becoming known as Pip and Kate taking on the other moniker.If that werenapost enough, her friends at Marlborough College are also said to have called her the aposPrincess-in-waitingapos for a while.Do you enjoy reading about the royal family for all the best royal news from the Mirror here.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Kate Middleton, Duchess of CambridgePrince HarryRoyal FamilyPrince William\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The pictures were snapped during a secret photoshoot at Kew Gardens last November by famous fashion photographer Paolo Roversi, whose previous work has graced the pages of Vogue and Vanity Fair. And Mr Roversi has opened up on exactly how he came to work with Kate and how he also snapped some special photos that are likely to remain private... First meeting The first meeting between Kate and Mr Roversi came last November at Kensington Palace, where the photographer says they met for tea and biscuits.And during this meeting, he says he found Kate a little nervous about carrying out the shoot.He told Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera : “At first the Duchess was apprehensive. She is machine-gunned by photographers every day but is not used to posing.“Knowing my photos with models she was a little fearful of facing a real session, which required about four hours of work. But I reassured her that once we started it was going to be very easy. Dresses and jewellery Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up.In the portraits, Kate wears three absolutely stunning dresses created by a designer who sheaposs worked with numerous times in the past - Sarah Burton for Alexander McQueen.Sarahaposs relationship with Kate goes back more than  years as she also created her iconic wedding gown. And it appears her trust in her is steadfast as itaposs been reported Kate allowed Sarah to pick the dresses for the shoot. For the official portrait , Kate wears a stunning light organza dress, which Mr Roversi says makes the duchess look like a classical ballerina.In terms of jewellery, Kate wears her eye-catching engagement ring and in two of the shots, opts for a pair of diamond earrings on loan from the Queen.While in the photo where she wears the red dress, she wears diamond and pearl drop earrings that once belonged to her late mother-in-law Princess Diana.Hair and make-up  When it came to Kateaposs hair and make-up, the photographer was keen for a less is more approach, with a no defined hair style and little make-up. He told the Italian publication: “I didnapost want her to look too Lady Duchess, too establishment, but as pure and contemporary as possible. Or even timeless.” On the shoot  While taking her picture, Mr Roversi said he was moved by Kateaposs warm and friendly welcome and enchanted by her shining eyes that reflected the loveliness of her soul and her smile showing the generosity of her heart. He added: It was a profound and rich experience for me, an unforgettable moment. I have met a wonderful person, a person who, with her positive energy, can bring hope to the whole world. The photographer also revealed that for some of the images he took, he persuaded Kate to dance and twirl across the floor - something sheaposs rarely done in public. He said: In the end I wanted to take some moving pictures, so with that wonderful wide skirt I made her dance in front of my lens, a sort of accelerated waltz mixed with a pinch of rock aposnapos roll. But unfortunately, he says these dancing images are likely to remain private and have not been released. Selecting the images After the shoot, the photographer was left with a set of around  pictures, which he whittled down to .He says he and Kate then worked together to choose the three final portraits. The Italian newspaper suggests that Prince William and their childrenaposs favourite shot is the one where she looks directly into the camera.The photos, part of the National Portrait Gallery’s Coming Home exhibition, will go on display in Berkshire, where Kate grew up, St Andrews, where she met Prince William, and Anglesey, their first marital home.And yesterday, Kate thanked her many well-wishers on Twitter, in a rare personal tweet. She said: Thank you for all of your very kind birthday wishes, and to Paolo and the National Portrait Gallery for these three special portraits. C.

Rebecca Wilkinson, , started putting on weight in her teens and saw her weight rocket after falling pregnant with her child at  - piling on nearly  stone in just under two years. She would often indulge in two takeaways a day followed by snacks like chocolate, crisps, and sweets - washed down with litres of Lucozade.At her biggest, Rebecca was defined as obese - weighing st lbs and was struggling to squeeze into a size -.After years of dieting the mum-of-one saw no changes until a trip to a psychic scared her into action. He revealed she had no futureshe carried on her unhealthy habits and told her to do whatever it takes or die. The bombshell kicked-started her weight loss journey and she booked a flight to Antalya, Turkey, to undergo a private gastric sleeve operation in September . A year after the operation to remove part of her stomach, she lost a staggering st lb - slimming down to st lb and a svelte size -. Rebecca, an apprentice plasterer, from Ilkeston, Derbyshire, said: “I was desperate after years of trying and failing to lose weight. “During a visit to my psychic, he scared me into action. He said he saw aposno leapos for me on the cards. “He also said: aposDo what it takes - go to the extreme or you will die.apos I knew I had to take drastic actions and surgery was the only way. “The weight has fallen off after having my stomach removed - it’s turned my le around.” Rebecca struggled with bullies during her teens and beyond - turning to food for comfort. She saw the weight start piling on, especially after she fell pregnant with her first child, Libby, . The mum would often tuck into a takeaway for lunch and dinner - followed by snacks. She said: “I went to an all-girls school, and I was bullied really badly. In school, they nicknamed me aposRebecca double-deckerapos because I was bigger than the others girls. I definitely ate to feel better. “I’d start the day with four pieces of buttered toast, andI was peckish at midmorning, I’d easily repeat this. “For lunch, I’d get a takeaway and dinner every single night was a takeaway as well.” As her weight spiralled out of control, Rebecca struggled with her mental health and suffered from anxiety and depression. She hoped for another baby with her partner of  years, Matt, , who owns a plastering company, but struggled to conceive for the next  years due to her weight. At her biggest, she weighed a whopping st lbs and struggled to fit into a size . She said: “For years I tried to ignore the mess I was in. I wouldn’t leave the house without my mum or fiancé by my side. “I was selective over where I went in case I didn’t fit in the seat or the toilet cubicle. I even had people shouting profanities at me from passing cars. Rebecca tried and failed to diet over the years and was left feeling ‘defeated’. She was ready to give up when a trip to visit a psychic in  changed everything. According to Rebecca, he couldn’t see a future for her in the cards and told her to ‘sort it now’ or she would die. “I was sceptical of the psychic at first, but he knew things no one  did,” she said. The way he knew about how I’d eat and ‘hibernate’ afterwards. “I left the reading in tears, but it was important I did. He said: aposI don’t see any le left for you.apos It was the wake-up call I needed to change.” After the reading, Rebecca looked into private surgery for a gastric sleeve in the UK, but it would cost upwards of £,. She found the operation abroad in Turkey costing a fraction of the price - £, - and flew over in September  with her mum, Jayne Nunn, , who also underwent the surgery. The operation involved removing three-quarters of the stomach and the remaining amount formed a apossleeveapos or tube that lead to the intestine. After the surgery, Rebecca flew back to the UK and had to survive on a diet of liquids, purees, and soft foods for a month before being able to eat solid food again. Rebecca continues: My mum came with me and was such a big support. It all went well but it was a lot to adjust to with my new diet. Now I can only eat small amounts every two hours - like a Babybel or a small bit of protein like a salmon fillet. For dinner, Iaposll usually have a very small portion of whatever Iaposve cooked for the family. I donapost feel hunger or miss food.

Mum did an incredible job as well. Weaposre hoping toto Turkey for another surgery to remove the excess skin. I gave up my work from home job and now Iaposm an apprentice plasterer. I enjoy super long walks, going out and socialising which I never imagined would be possible. Most importantly, Iaposm able to move around and live pain-free.

Here’s what you need to know about one of the earliest signs of the virus. Is a sore throat an Omicron symptom   Scientists have reported that those who tested positive with the Omicron iant present with a dry cough and a scratchy throat. This symptom has been one of the initial signs of infection reported by % of people who have been infected. Since sore throats can be linked with other conditions like allergies and cold, it can be dficult to tellyouaposre experiencing a Covid symptom. The dference between a sore throat and scratchy throat is that sore throats are painful especially while swallowing, but scratchy throats are more itchy and irritated. So itaposs best to keep tabs on how your throat feels.The scratchy throat also causes you to develop a hoarse voice, which has also been reported as an early sign of Omicron. What are the main symptoms of Omicron   Besides the scratchy throat, the other common symptoms of Omicron are a runny nose, headache, muscle pains, fatigue and sneezing.Some of the more unusual symptoms include skin rashes, lower back pain, night sweats and sleep paralysis, nausea and vomiting, diarrhoea and sore eyes. While most Omicron symptoms have been described as mild, Dr Angelique Coetzee, the South African doctor who first raised the alarm on the new iant, warned that certain signs like headaches and myalgia could be felt more intensely by unvaccinated people.When should I get a PCR test done The NHS recommends that you should get a PCR testyou have any of the following symptoms: high temperature, new continuous cough or loss of taste or sense of smell.If you have any of the common symptoms of Covid, self-isolate immediately and get tested, evenyouaposve been vaccinated. Under new rules, you donapost have get a PCR testyou are asymptomatic, evenyour lateral flow test is positive. This means your self-isolation period ends earlier as long as you test negative on the lateral flow test.

The one-person bedsit boasts it is fully furnished with trendy wooden floors. It also brags how the Victorian pad is in a great location in West Kensington, west London. But because it is so small, there isnapost enough space for a bathroom and the shower and toiler are shared with other residents in the block. The listing, marketed via Zoopla, shows the bed up against one wall while the kitchenette is just centimetres away. A sink, microwave and camping-style cooking hob are all within touching distance in the skinny pad which has a limited amount of floor space.  Despite its tiny size, a wardrobe, chest of drawers, table and one chair are also chucked in for good measure. Tenants have to stay for at least six months and the rent works out at just £ per week. Commenting on the listing, one person said: Randomly browsing apartments on Zoopla for no reason and I came across this. London housing is such a joke. Another person said: Youaposd barely be able to walk in there.  The Space Let listing reads: A single bedsit situated within a large Victorian house in-between West Kensington and Baronaposs Court stations with lots of amenities in the area. Fully furnished, wooden floors fitted throughout, own kitchen. Compact studio room furnished with a single bed, wardrobe, chest of drawers, small table and chairs.

The squalid pad, in trendy Glasgow, is covered with weeds with what appears to be mould on some walls and gaping holes in the ceiling. Heaps of clothes, trash and trinkets blot out the floor in what looks like a living room area. Every surface in the kitchen and bathroom is likewise covered in debris - and the sink and bath are brimming with soiled toiletries. Despite its challenges, it is listed as an exciting fixer upper that just needs some love.  In promotional photos on Rightmove, the front door is wide open and further horror lies within. One shocking snap shows collapsed wooden beams from the ceiling strewn across what appears to be a bed. A second bedroom still has posters on the wall, while the bed is unmade with no sheets on it. Commenting on the listing, Louise Diana quipped: Iaposd at least like a ceiling for £,. Auctioneer National Property states: The house requires a full refurbishment and, due to the condition, is currently uninhabitable, non mortgageable and therefore a cash buy only, sold as seen, and unsafe for viewings. The dilapidated property also comes with overgrown front, side and rear gardens. But the firm insists the property is a wonderful development opportunity in a highly sought after area for a canny buyer. It adds: Recent sales of similarly sized properties nearby in good condition have reached superb prices. The house requires a complete refurbishment and is priced competitively to sell hence cash buy only. The auctioneer also suggests a buyer could seek planning permission for a rear extension and to develop the loft. The online auction ends on January .

And in parts of Scotland as much as five inches of snow is predicted to fall, with Pitlochry in Perthshire predicted to see the largest build-up.Dreary January will continue today as more wet weather batters the country, with some areas predicted to see gale force winds and some snow to the north.Temperatures will plunge with forecasters predicting the mercury to drop below zero in parts of northern Scotland, with sub zero temperatures in other northern regions.  Flood alerts have also been issued for nine areas in Wales and southwest England, with those in affected areas advised to look at the Environment Agency site for the latest information.  BBC forecaster Chris Fawkes said of Mondayaposs forecast: “Here’s this area of slightly milder air pushing in off the Atlantic behind this warm front. It’s the warm front that will continue to bring some patches of drizzle just about anywhere - but especially across the west.“Meanwhile, for west Scotland, there’ll be some heavier rain here and some stronger winds through the course of the afternoon. “Temperatures will be at their highest across western areas, reaching  degrees in Belfast. Across eastern areas not quite so high but still -C is above average for this time of the year.  “Monday night into Tuesday, a cold front pushes southwards - the murky, damp weather will be restricted to southern areas of England and Wales for Tuesday. Sunny spells developing widely behind that with just a few showers in the north west of Scotland.”Longer range predictions from the Met Office say that January will see aposunsettledapos conditions with more colder temperatures and some snow fall particularly in the north.UK Weather Forecast Today: A few foggy or frosty spots in the east at first. Early brightness in the southeast, where staying largely dry. Elsewhere cloudy with patchy rain, drizzle and hill fog. Milder away from the southeast, very mild in far west. Tonight: Rain, drizzle and low cloud continuing across many southern areas where mild. Clearer weather spreads to most northern areas but with strong winds and showers in west and north Scotland. Tuesday: Sunny intervals and showers across northern Scotland, where remaining windy. Some rain at first in the south but sunnier skies in central UK should follow to most places eventually.

But her loved ones are baffled as to how she reached the water due to her bronchitis.CCTV footage showed a figure believed to be the -year-old walking alone towards a ginnel leading to the river shortly after midnight on the day of her death, reports the Manchester Evening News.The inquest into her death at Stockport Coroneraposs Court heard Karen, of Windle Court, Offerton, was found in the river near an access point off New Bridge Lane. She was found under the St Maryaposs Way bridge by a dog walker at .am on May , . Her coat, training shoes, phone, umbrella and a bag containing her personal items were found neatly placed nearby. Police coroneraposs officer PC David Wood told coroner Alison Mutch that investigating officers did not believe there were any suspicious circumstances surrounding her death with no aposthird party involvementapos.  Friend Nicki Connor attended the hearing and was allowed by Ms Mutch to question PC Wood. She said there were aposcertain questionsapos as to how Karen got to the location where she died from her home when aposshe could barely walkapos which aposremain unansweredapos. PC Wood said the concerns were passed on to the senior investigating officer, but were not deemed to be of signicance. The hearing was told that Karen suffered from bipolar affective disorder and had been under the care of Stockportaposs Community Mental Health Team until  before transitioning to a new PPSin Stockport. The service was set up to help people remain in the community and Karen was one of its first users. PPS pathway recovery worker Barry Tyldsley was helping Karen and had regular contact with her until her death. When lockdown came in March  she found it dficult because she was advised to shield as a result of her breathing dficulties and her weight, he said. She was part of that vulnerable group. She was very conscious of her condition and adhered to all the restrictions. But her anxieties were raised and she absolutely isolated herself. I increased my support, helped with her shopping and collecting medication and had regular telephone contact as a way of managing that anxiety. He said in  she was still feeling apospretty isolatedapos and was reluctant to meet up with people. Mr Tyldsley said the day before Karen died he emailed the Community Mental Health Team to ask for a clinical review and assessment. But because she had never mentioned taking her own le and had re-started taking medication for psychotic episodes, her case was not deemed urgent. Ms Mutch concluded there was no third-party involvement or suspicious circumstances surrounding Karenaposs death. She said that the cause of death was drowning and that because there was no evidence that Karen had taken her own le, the death was aposaccidentalapos. Speaking after the inquest, her two friends Nicki and Susan Harrison told how Karen had previously worked as a doctoraposs receptionist and in retail. She had also taught English as a foreign language.

It has been hard, because this flare up has affected my face mainly, and Iaposve had to go into work, but everyone has been really good about it. My family and friends have all encouraged me to post about my experience on social media, which has really helped. Posting about it has made me much happier, and showed me itaposs not just me who struggles with this. Of course social media doesnapost always help people with body confidence and things like that, but itaposs really helped me. Rosie, who lives in Cambridge. said that writing down her journey and experience in Instagram posts was very therapeutic. She also spoke about the journey she has been on to get to this point. She said: The first flare up I had, it was literally like I went to bed one night and when I woke up and my skin had completely changed. It was actually quite scary, because it all comes out at once, so I suddenly had all these like red dots on my skin. I was only , so it was a big shock, and it was all so quick. Doctors attributed Rosieaposs sudden flare up to a throat infection she had at the time.  She said: Everything happens for a reason, but this has made me truly believe it. Because the first flare up was such a shock, I was trying to hide, I never wanted to go out, so I really struggled. I posted a picture when Iaposd had the first flare up, and someone commented askingI had chicken pox. So then of course I deleted it immediately, it was really hard. Then, the following year we were in lockdown, so it was easier to hide it then, because I couldnapost go out anyway. Usually the flare ups occur during the summer, but this year, Rosie has suffered with psoriasis in the winter too. But she refuses to let it bring her down and is no longer ashamed of her skin. She said:Previously, Iaposve always laid out in the sun and itaposs really helped. Obviously at the moment that isnapost really an option, so there was nothing  for it but to embrace my skin.

By the time she arrived home her lips had completely ballooned, prompting the panicked -year-old to dash to the doctors, where she was given steroid tablets that quickly reduced the swelling. Horrying photos and footage captured by Daniella show her massive lips and puffy face - which she endured for around four hours before the medication eventually helped them to reduce in size.  After the aposawfulapos ordeal, the sales administrator is keen to raise awareness of the severe reactions that can happen following the procedure - evenyou get a patch test beforehand like she did. Daniella, of Edinburgh, Scotland, said: My reaction was awful. They looked like sausage lips. I donapost knowIaposm exaggerating but I would genuinely say they were about  times the normal size. It was so scary. I was in a lot of shock because Iaposve never seen my lips that big before. I was just a bit stressed about how they looked because I wasnapost sureit was normal orit was going to go away. I was in a panic thinking aposwhen are they going to go down apos Daniella said she originally booked her appointment to get half a ml of filler but decided to get them dissolved and start afresh to prevent it from migrating. She claims she had her patch test around - minutes before having the procedure that injected hyaluronidase, an enzyme that dissolves filler, into her lips. Daniella said: I got a little patch test in my arm just to seeit would be fine. My skin did go a little bit red but I do have really sensitive skin anyway so I didnapost think anything of it. I got the injections in my lips. They got big quite quickly but apparently when you get your lips dissolved theyaposre meant to go quite big anyway. Although Iaposm not sure theyaposre meant to go as big as what mine went. After I left the girl said to me that within an hour it should go down. After Iaposd left the place they started getting a little bit bigger every minute and I was like aposmy God, what has gone on aposBy the time Iaposd driven back to Edinburgh from Glasgow my lips were still the same. I sent her a message on Instagram and she phoned me straight away askingI was feeling ok andI started to struggle to breathe to go to AE because obviously thataposs when something would be severely wrong.  My lips were really big and I was starting to feel a little bit unwell as well. I was getting quite hot and I explained that to the doctors. The -year-old was given eight steroid tablets which reduced the swelling within  minutes and also made her feel a lot better. Daniella said: That evening I was meant to be having a work night but then I couldnapost go because of how I had reacted so I had to cancel my Friday night plans which was a bit gutting, but at least I was fine thataposs the main thing. Iaposve only ever seen it happen once before and never really heard of it. Itaposs not really something thataposs spoken about and obviously it can be quite dangerous as well. It could have been really severe and I was quite lucky that my throat didnapost close up or anything because I know that can happen after reading up on it. Itaposs just to make people aware that these reactions can happen and just because you get a patch test doesnapost mean that itaposs  percent going to be fine.

I thought ‘ooh, I’m still hungry - I’ll have another one’. I shook the pack, and though ‘ooh, that’s funny’. And I said to my friend ‘have a look at this’. Obviously no noise or anything when I shook the packet. “My friend said ‘oh my god that’s amazing - you need to do something about that’. I thought ‘don’t be silly’. But my friend said ‘honestly now, it’s a once in a letime thing’. So I thought ‘yeah I’ll share it’.”  Yarna said Walkers saw her post and she was very pleased with their response. “They saw it and said they’d reimburse me with vouchers and they apologised,” Yarna explained. “They said there was a problem with the machines. She said they’d had a problem with delivery drivers and something must have gone wrong with the production line. “I can’t lie I was about annoyed when I realised [there were no crisps in the packet], but now I just think it was one of those things.  “It’s really quite fun to leave it unopened and have it there. I think I’ll put it in a drawer and keep it. Like I say, it’s a once in a letime thing and this is never going to happen to me again.” “It’s really quite fun to leave it unopened and have it there.

So when we decide to splash the cash on a designer item, we might want to avoid comparisons to the fast fashion retailer. But thataposs what happened to Connor Cundale, who spent £ on a stylish North Face coat only to be told its black and blue colour scheme made him look like he worked at his local Primark. The -year-old advertising student poked fun at his predicament in a series of videos on TikTok, but was ultimately left so embarrassed by his shopping blunder that he ed the coat three weeks after he bought it. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. In one video, Connor could be seen wearing his coat on Clton Suspension Bridge in Bristol, alongside a caption which read: You think you can hurt me  I spent £ on a coat just to look like a Primark employee. The student, from Buckhurst Hill, Essex, even wore the coat into his local Primark store - and was askedhe worked there. He said: On the day I bought it, I went out with my friends that evening. One of them made a comment like aposoh, heaposs wearing a Primark coat.apos I didnapost think anything of it, but that evening, it clicked in my head that I was a walking Primark advertisement. The colours were spot on.  I was in Primark one day, and this lady tapped me on the shoulder. She asked aposdo you work here apos, I just turned around and laughed. I said, aposNo, Iaposm just repping the colours.apos After that, I noticed loads of people staring at me. I donapost knowI was being paranoid, but I was wondering whether people were going to come up to me to ask for help. Connor insisted that while thereaposs nothing wrong with working in Primark, he didnapost want his everyday coat to look like a brandaposs unorm - so he decided toit. He added: I had someone I didnapost know at university make a comment to me, saying I looked like I worked in Primark.  It became well known in student halls that I was the guy with the North Face Primark employee coat. I was embarrassed. I felt like such a laughing stock for spending that much money on something now being related to a Primark employee. Nothing is wrong with working in Primark of course, but you just wouldnapost want your coat looking like a brandaposs unorm. I actually ended up ing the coat in the end. I had it for three weeks overall.  The student has instead decided to switch up his colour palette and has swapped the black and blue coat for a balsam green one. He explained: I didnapost like the idea of having spent so much money on it and then people making a joke out of it. It was a nice coat, it was a nice colour, it was just the connection. I only recently got into design stuff. North Face is a really good brand with high quality stuff, so I made an investment into it. I got a replacement coat in a balsam green colour. I made sure there were no resemblances to any supermarkets or any other big brands. I have the coat I want now, and Iaposm really happy with it. Connoraposs self-deprecating TikTok video went viral, with Primark employees among the commenters poking fun at his fashion disaster. One person wrote: Iaposm crying, I do work at Primark and you genuinely look like you could be my co-worker. While another said: Bro, you spent £ on a coat … the jokeaposs on you. And a third added: Employee of the month boyo, now get behind them tills. What do you think  Let us know in the comments below.

She has stuck to the way of eating ever since and has dropped down to just over nine stone. Chuffed May says she has gone from huffing and puffing when just walking up stairs to “zooming around all day” in her job as a horticulture expert for Tesco.  May, of Portslade, East Sussex, said: “I was so fat that I didn’t really like going out with friends and the more I stayed in the fatter I got. It was a catch  situation. “I would buy frozen pepperoni pizzas and I’d stuff them down with chocolate and a bottle of Coke. I never ate one biscuit, it was always the entire pack. “And I loved takeaways - pepperoni pizzas with two sides and a fizzy drink.

That is one of the things that I hope that we can do in conversation with owners and with developers at the moment.”In a letter to the residential property development industry being sent on Monday, Mr Gove set a deadline of “early March” to publicly accept his ultimatum and provide a “fully-funded plan of action”.They were also ordered to provide comprehensive information on all buildings taller than m that have fire-safety defects and which they helped to construct in the past  years.Reece Lipman said that as things stand, while he owns % of his flat in Romford, east London, he is currently liable for “% of fixing all the costs”.The -year-old said Mr Gove “has got the rhetoric right and is now talking with a much firmer tone”, but insisted that what has been seen as “just a cladding crisis” is in fact “a full-blown building safety crisis” and likened the Government’s action to date as akin to bailing “water off the Titanic with pots and pans”.Mr Gove admitted the Government “did get stuff wrong” in the cladding scandal, but he said some of those who argued they were abiding by building regulations at the time did not have a “strong case”.He told LBC: “It’s also the case that there were lots of steps that were taken which put people at risk, and without wanting to pre-empt what the independent inquiry into Grenfell will conclude, I think it is… you would be hard-pressed to say that putting, essentially, sheets of liquid petrol encased in metal on the side of a tower block was the right thing to do.”The Fire Brigades Union said the Government’s latest move was “a result of determined campaigning by leaseholders and tenants”.The union’s general secretary, Matt Wrack, said: “It shows that the Government can be pressured into progress, and we commend the efforts of campaigners.“We have always been clear here – residents should not carry any cost for failure they did not cause.

It#s estimated that  million plant pots and seed trays are sold every year and the majority are sent to landfill or are incinerated.But there are non-plastic alternatives such as biodegradable pots made using materials like coir, wood chips, bamboo and rice husks.A growing number of garden centres and nurseries use biodegradable pots, but it#s worth checking out their sustainability policies.You can also make your own pots using newspaper or toilet roll tubes.And now is a good time to make your own supplies of biodegradable pots so you have stock for the planting season in a couple of months.If you#ve got a supply of old newspapers to hand, simply roll a cm-wide strip of newspaper tightly around a glass tumbler, leaving cm beyond the bottom of the glass.Fold the excess paper across the bottom, then press the glass down to flatten the pot#s base.There is no need to fix your paper pot with tape, just slide it off the glass.When ready to plant, just fill with compost.Taking good care of existing plastic is a good way to ensure you don#t have to keep buying it – so reuse any plant pots you have again and again for new seedlings, cuttings and plants.If you look after your propagator trays and lids, repairing themthey crack, they will last for several seasons.You can also reuse compost bags to store compost or turn leaves into leaf mould.The added bonus of recycling or reusing items in the garden is that it also reduces cost – as does growing from seed rather than buying established plants.Even in winter, you can grow something from seed, you just need a seed tray and a window ledge, or small cold frame or greenhouse – whatever space and budgets allow.For anyone growing their own vegetables, January is great for sowing onions.If you sow onions then, it saves the expense of buying onion sets – small bulbs – later, and you can have a much larger crop of onions in the summer.Onions seeds do not have a long shelf-le, so it#s best to buy new seeds each year.Seeds will germinate between C and C, one or two weeks after sowing.When large enough to handle, transplant to inidual small pots and keep in a bright, frost-free place until April when they can be planted outside.Varieties to try include: Setton – high yield, yellow skinned and good storage potential Red Baron – a late maturing red onion with globe shaped bulbs and strong taste and Hybound – an early iety with bronze-brown skins which is excellent for long-term storage.January is often the coldest month in the garden but there are still some things you can be doing to keep busy.As the Royal Horticultural Society says, January might be the middle of winter but, as the days en, the garden starts to grow.It is a great time to plan for the coming gardening year and to order seeds and plants.Enjoy the fresh air on dry sunny days, and check your winter protection, stakes, ties and supports are still working after any severe weather.Also, put out food for birds and leave some garden areas uncut, a little longer, to provide shelter for wildle in your garden.Top three jobs this month: clean pots and greenhouses ready for spring, dig over empty or unused plots, and prune apple and pear trees."},{"url":null,"title":"district news january 7 2022","story":"Tiny Glenbarr Primary School, which has just six pupils, has just missed out on being named Scotland#s most scenic school.More than , votes were cast in a Twitter contest organised by Henry Hepburn, news editor at education resource magazine and website Tes Scotland, to highlight the stunning locations of Scotland#s schools.The competition attracted  schools and celebrities even got involved, re-Tweeting posts to boost votes during the few days of competition in December.Despite having so few students, Glenbarr reached the nail-biting semi-final, just short of the final.With views overlooking Ben Nevis, Lochaber High School won in the end, narrowly beating Morgan Academy in Dundee.MID ARGYLLVolunteers are needed to help provide and expand PCR testing in several locations across the NHS Highland region, including Tarbert and Lochgilphead.Volunteers will be co-ordinated by the British Red Cross.

This equipment has the advantage of raising driver awareness of the technology available, without the need to proceed with enforcement.#Councillors agreed that officials should investigate the ious forms of remote speed detection equipment, in consultation with Strathclyde Police and the Scottish Office, as trunk roads authority, and report back.FIFTY YEARS AGOThe New Year in Campbeltown was celebrated quietly at the weekend.Apart from a few breathalyser tests, police said the town was remarkably quiet. There were no incidents of breach of the peace, assaults and so on.All was peaceful on Islay too.No public houses or hotel bars were open to the public on New Year#s Day, which undoubtedly helped to keep everything quiet.There was one New Year#s Day incident. A van belonging to the Redfusion television company struck a wall on Low Askomill. Nobody was hurt.The breathalyser appears to have retained its purpose.All the burgh#s taxis were kept going non-stop over the Christmas and New Year period and operators reported heavy bookings.The West Coast coaches were also well used by people who sensibly left the car at home.Shops were kept busy during the few festive days and licensed grocers sold big amounts of the #cratur# and other alcoholic drinks.Christmas and New Year Day babies expected at Craigard Maternity Hospital failed to arrive and the staff had a quiet time of it.A large crowd of people of all denominations and from all over the country converged on Carradale House, home of the authoress Mrs Naomi Mitchison, to take part in the New Year celebrations.This was the rd time that Mrs Mitchison had played host to a large number of guests at Carradale.Politicians, government workers, farmers and fishermen all mingled together, danced, sung and sampled an excellent buffet.Many Carradale villagers were also present.Addressing the guests, Mrs Mitchison talked about the effects of the Common Market and fishermen.

This original fragment is now in the National Museum of Scotland but its discovery suggested something very signicant about Aberlady’s early history.The design on the fragment was similar to the artwork of the Lindisfarne Gospels, an illuminated manuscript made on Holy Island and completed around AD. This Gospel book is a priceless national treasure, probably created by Eadfrith, the Bishop of Lindisfarne.Ian has a passion for history, especially early Medieval history in the time before Scotland, and so the cross fragment had always fascinated him. The dimensions of the cross fragment suggested that, before it was broken, it would have stood about five metres tall.“A large cross with this level of ornate carving would only be commissioned and erected at a place of some importance,” he told me.“The Celtic Church was widening and deepening its influence and its leaders now had the ear of kings. Royal endowments of land and wealth to the Church and rewards to loyal and battle-hardened thanes co-existed. This was very much a time of devout holy men and warlords. It was such an exciting piece of evidence of Aberlady’s early history.”Ian explained that a cross of similar date and style at Abercorn in West Lothian was very probably carved by the same person, or team of masons, and gave an idea of what the rest of the cross at Aberlady might have looked like. Intriguingly, there were three fragments of that cross.When he told me this, my thoughts wandered for a moment. Here we were, having a wee drink in a pub, talking about a craftsman, or group of craftsmen, whose skill and creativity has been preserved for well over a thousand years, and yet we know nothing about them, not even their names. I raised a glass to them and the countless thousands of skilled stonemasons, joiners, builders and artists of all kinds who really did build our historic monuments, but whom history almost never credits.But, I thought, at least we know who made the beautul recreation: Barry Grove, who also carved the reconstruction of the Pictish cross-slab at Hilton of Cadboll – and he used the same simple tools and techniques that would have been used by those earlier stone masons. The cross was unveiled in Aberlady’s Memorial Garden on December , .Ian then told me of the lost ecclesiastical settlement of Pefferham. He explained that there was a medieval document called Historia Regum, meaning History of the Kings. It was written in the th century and is usually credited to Symeon of Durham. This document listed all the main churches of existence in the Northumbrian diocese of St Cuthbert during the ninth and th centuries AD. Aberlady would have been part of this diocese.“Each of the important churches of the diocese, including Melrose, Abercorn, Edinburgh, Auldhame and Tyninghame, are identied in a clockwise direction in the Historia Regum,” Ian explained. “But there is one church mentioned in that document that is lost in time and seems to have vanished from both maps and memories. It was known as Pefferham, seemingly east of Edinburgh and west of Auldhame.”The western branch of the Peffer Burn flows into Aberlady, of course, and place-name evidence places the village on a route taken by monks travelling between the two great seats of learning of the Celtic Church at this time: Iona and Lindisfarne on Holy Island.This route became a holy highway connecting the two major religious sites, and one very likely taken by St Aidan, who left Iona to establish the church on Lindisfarne. In this context, a high cross here at Aberlady, or Pefferhamyou prefer, becomes quite plausible.More evidence emerged from metal finds in the Glebe Field immediately north of the present church. The tip of an ornately carved bishop’s crosier and a carved representation of Madonna and child had been found by metal detectorists lots of coins too. Moreover, geophysical research located two seemingly overlapping oblong structures, which could have been Anglo-Saxon but perhaps over large when compared with others. The evidence was cumulating and convinced Ian of the need for archaeological research. Historic Environment Scotland agreed and Historical Monument Consent was given, and a case for funding was submitted to the Heritage Lottery Fund.The project envisaged involving six local schools, as well as many local and not-so-local volunteers, and the funding was approved. The archaeological investigation in the Glebe Field, just north of the church, took place in .The results of the dig were astounding, revealing a signicant settlement of stone structures overlaying earlier timber structures dating to the seventh to th centuries. The largest collection of scattered metal objects dating from the Anglo-Saxon period ever discovered in Scotland came from the Glebe here, pointing firmly to a major settlement during that time.Ian happily told me that “prominent academic research experts have agreed that there is now sufficient artefactual, place-name and textual evidence to say that we can begin to tell the story of the ‘lost’ Anglo-Saxon settlement of Pefferham”. “In fact,” he added, “it seems that base hole for the original carved cross may have been discovered.”It was so fascinating to hear and there is not enough space here to go into all the details of the story, but fascinating leaflets have been produced by the conservation and history society which bring these exciting discoveries to le.

How, then, did it go for Raworth Before we could find out, politics show watchers began the day, as is traditional, with Sky News’ Trevor Phillips on Sunday. Having started his run last May as a maternity cover for Sophy Ridge, Phillips was the future once . Now he is the longest serving presenter in post.His first interview of  was with Nadhim Zahawi, former Vaccines Minister now Education Secretary for England and, for this day only, Minister for the Sunday shows.Mr Zahawi had already set the direction of the day with a Sunday Times interview in which he said it would be “helpful”the quarantine period could be cut from seven days to five.He also, according to the report, said free lateral flow tests were on the way out. In front of the cameras, though, he said that was not the case. Scotland’s First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, had already called the move to scrap free tests “utterly wrongheaded”.: Warning on free testsPhillips’s running order also included João Vale de Almeida, the EU’s ambassador to the UK, on Northern Ireland and trade the First Minister of Wales, Mark Drakeford, on dferences in Covid restrictions around the UK and Marvin Rees, mayor of Bristol, on the Colston statue verdict. It was a newsy mix that made for a lively hour.Sunday Morning had Mr Zahawi and Rachel Reeves, Shadow Chancellor, as well as an interview with a hospital chief executive. In keeping with Marr show tradition there was an arts segment, this one featuring Elizabeth McGovern, aka Cora Crawley of Downton Abbey fame, and her new play about fellow actor, Ava Gardner. The show’s other regular, the newspaper review, had also survived intact, as had the set.Sunday Morning was similar to Marr while at the same time very dferent. Where Marr’s show was fleet of foot and proactive, Sunday Morning had the air of a programme that was put together last Tuesday and not changed since. Where Marr set out to make headlines, Sunday Morning came across asit wanted to have no impact at all.In short, Sunday Morning, like its title, felt safe, bland, BBC.Fair enough, butthe Raworth shows prove popular with audiences, and BBC management, it could influence the selection of the new host.Comparing Marr and Sunday Morning has little to do with the presenters personally. Both are experienced, highly respected journalists. But broadly speaking they represent dferent styles and approaches to the jobRaworth, for example, is BBC through and through, cool, calm, hard to read. In recent years it has seemed as though she was getting ready to take on a Dimbleby role with a place at great state occasions.: Covid, the latest figuresMarr, in contrast, with a hinterland in newspapers before joining the BBC, is more of a scrapper whose interview style could best be described as robust. He left the BBC precisely because he wanted to express a view and shake things up.Which style do viewers prefer  It is a question being asked not just at the BBC but throughout the industry as a whole. GB News thought it had the answer by hiring “big personalities”, only to find viewers cared just as much,not more, about basic standards. The signing of Piers Morgan to talkTV shows which way Rupert Murdoch sees the wind blowing.Alternatively, having had a taste of news and views mixing to a greater extent than before, UK audiences could be ready toto the more traditional fare offered by the main channels.Despite the dull title, Sunday Morning might prove to be a lively arrival after all."},{"url":null,"title":"mark-bennett-heaps-praise-edinburgh-team-mates-cardiff-win","story":"Saturday’s - home win over Cardf which put them four points clear of Leinster at the summit was a sixth victory from eight starts, and was once more achieved in some style.Mark Bennett was singled out for praise by head coach Mike Blair after the game at the DAM Health Stadium, and the Scotland centre certainly played his part with two of his team’s five tries. But Bennett himself preferred to heap plaudits on Emiliano Boffelli and Ramiro Moyano, the two summer signings from Argentina who have played major roles in the far more positive approach that the team has adopted this season since Blair took charge. Moyano opened the scoring and Boffelli claimed the second try almost before Cardf knew what hit them. Many players take some time to adapt to a change of surroundings, especiallya new language is involved, but the Pumas pair have fitted in more or less seamlessly, and more or less immediately.“They’re brilliant,” Bennett said. “I love playing with them. They’re great guys on and off the field. “You see what they bring on the pitch. They are quality, quality players and I think their work in the back three is excellent. “I know it’s a few weeks ago now, but against Saracens Emilliano was shouting to Ramiro in Spanish and he was translating it straight away to me in English. That in itself is incredible, never mind the actual performance they were putting on on the pitch.”Of course, it takes more than two players to make a team, and the rest of Edinburgh’s back ision were also on fire in an opening  minutes which has to go down as their best half of rugby so far this season. “We’d be hard pushed to say otherwise,” Bennett accepted. “We were sharp, we were clinical and we actually missed a few opportunities as well.“We created a lot more than we scored, so I think as a back line that’s bloody exciting. We’re getting our roles right and when we execute them we’re scoring. What more do you want “The second half was tough going. It was stop-start and hard to find any momentum. So there is plenty to work on - but it was a hell of a performance from us.”Indeed, it was a performance in which a try bonus point and the victory were both secured before the break, as Bennett scored his first and then his fellow-centre James Lang got Edinburgh’s fourth in the last play of the first half. A Rhys Priestland penalty had got Cardf off the mark towards the half-hour, and the visitors managed to rouse themselves a little after the break, as a try from Owen Lane converted by Jarrod Evans took them to - down and briefly gave them hope of staging some sort of fightback. But, after a couple of near misses, it was Edinburgh who had the final word as Bennett breezed through a fatigued defence to score his team’s fth try. Substitute Jaco van der Walt added the two points to that touchdown, Boffelli having converted two tries in the first half as well as scoring a penalty.  Despite all the points being scored by backs, Bennett insisted it would be unfair to overlook the role of the forwards in the victory. If Magnus Bradbury was the outstanding contributor up front, the man of the match was very much first among equals as the pack won the physical battle to build the  which the backs then exploited. “Our forward pack was outstanding,” Bennett continued. “They were so blooming physical teams have to respect that, and we have players out wide who can do damage. “And Blair is an essential cog in that,” he added, referring to stand-off Kinghorn, who continues to grow in stature in his new position. “His distribution is brilliant and he chucked a couple of cracking ones to get us into that space. When it goes right we’re going to be hard to defend against.”Besides being top of the league, Edinburgh got their Challenge Cup campaign off to an excellent start last month with that win at Saracens, and now look to build on that on Saturday when they visit London Irish. “That’s an exciting challenge for us,” Bennett added. “Irish are a good side - they’ve had some cracking performances in the Prem this year.“We just want to follow on from what we have done. We had a great win away at Sarries and a great win on Saturday. We’ve got to keep that momentum going.”"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13302329.jpg?type=article-full","title":"krazy-kat-ms-marvel-history-american-comics","story":"SOME things never change. To read Jeremy Dauber’s American Comics: A History is to be reminded that the comic book industry in the United States has been racist, sexist and exploitative pretty much from the get-go.And, of course, it was also hugely successful and re-engineered our collective imaginations too.It even changed the way we talk, it seems. “The comic strip’s influence on American language was profound,” Dauber writes of their impact in the early decades of the century. “Bud Fisher of Mutt and Jeff fame invented piker and the phrases fall guy and got his goat. Tad Dorgan came up with applesauce, ball and chain and cat’s pyjamas, among others. Barney Google contributed heebie-jeebies … And Harold T. Webster’s Timid Soul added a whole new character type to the lexicon – or, at least, named it: one Caspar Milquetoast. Comics even gave the world knock-knock jokes…”The distance between influence and reward is one of the recurring themes of Dauber’s new book. The popularity of the pulps – Walter Brown Gibson, creator of The Shadow could afford to live a triplex off New York’s Central Park while churning out  Shadow novels – prompted kids eager to share in the largesse to sign any contract put in front of them, a pattern that was then repeated in comics too.And so, DC editor Vincent Sullivan bought Jerry Siegel and Joe Schuster’s original Superman comic strip for  , the equivalent of in today’s money. “And infor that he also got the rights,” Dauber points out. “To Superman.”The equation was simple. You signed away your rights in order to get published. And, as a result, you missed out on the rewards.First appearing in Action Comics in , Superman was an instant success. Very quickly, Action Comicsand the spin-off comic Superman were selling a million copies an issue .In  Siegel and Shuster sued to regain the rights to Superman and recover m they believed they were due for the character. They were unsuccessful. Shuster was later picked up as a vagrant in Central Park. It was only later in the decade that DC began to acknowledge its debt to the pair.Many other comic writers and artistshad similar experiences.But there are other stories to tell. Like the debt comics owe to William Randolph Hearst, the news baron who inspired Orson Welles’s Citizen Kane. Hearst was actually a fan of comic strips. He enjoyed them and enjoyed the copies of his newspaper they helped sell.He hired Rudolph Dirks to create The Katzenjammer Kids which debuted in  and George Herriman, the man behind Krazy Kat, perhaps the greatest comic strip of all time .Indeed, Hearst loved Krazy Kat so much that he gave Herriman total creative control and a letime contract, even though the strip was never hugely popular.Dauber’s book really picks up the pace when it reaches the s and the hysteria that surrounded comics in the post-war conservatism of Eisenhower’s America. Step forward Dr Frederic Wertham, by far the greatest cartoon villain in the story of American comics.Wertham’s back story, as Dauber points out, is intriguing. A German Jew who emigrated to America in the s, he corresponded with Freud, worked with Clarence Darrow defending black defendants and was praised by Thomas Mann and Arthur Miller. His sincerity in wanting to protect kids was not in doubt.But, by the same token, his distaste for comic books, ultimately spelled out in his book Seduction of the Innocent – a prime text for those studying moral panics – at times verged on hysterical. Speaking to a senatorial committee on juvenile delinquency, he suggested, “I think Hitler was a beginner compared to the comic book industry.”The main victim of the attack on comic books was EC Comics, whose horror and crime publications were both sophisticated in their storytelling strategies but also knew the power of a gruesome image.Dauber, professor of Jewish literature and American studies at Columbia University, a spry, humorous storyteller, has fun with all of this. At one point he plays the game of matching Jack Kirby, and Stan Lee – the men behind Marvel comics – with their Beatle equivalents: “Kirby the Lennonesque genius, pugnacious, spiky, out-there imaginative, of a vaguely mystic bent, matched and complemented by Lee’s McCartneyesque, extroverted Organisation Man genius, keeping the verities and structures moving.”Read More: All of the Marvels by Douglas WolkThere is much more here. Dauber covers the s underground comix scene and its political failings , the Watchmen era, continuity exhaustion. He also charts the emergence of female cartoonists such as Phoebe Gloeckner and Julie Doucet, as well as issues of ethnic and religious ersity in mainstream comicsand such st-century creators as Raina Telgemeier , whom, Dauber believes, “is unmatched at dealing with the often unspoken core of children’s literature: defining yourself as an inidual, and understanding the community of adults, one of which you will become.”At the end, Dauber suggests that the story of American comics is “right in the middle of its run.” If so, this is a very readable map of where it has been.American Comics A History by Jeremy Dauber is published by Norton, £."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-dont-consider-launching-national-convention","story":"Scotland’s poor health and high levels of poverty are constantly featured in the mainstream media as an example of Scotland’s inability to manage itself.But there is an irony in this –we are so much better together, why is poverty in Scotland so endemic, and why are our levels of poor health so much worse than in England My own view is that the Westminster Government has little interest in developing a strategic long-term plan to fund and support initiatives to alter the Scottish statistics for poor health and poverty.The latest example of this is the Conservative Government’s refusal for the establishment of safe, clean spaces for Scottish drug users to access help and support.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has been universally admired for her cautious and well-informed approach to the handling of the Covid crisis for the last two years.Westminster vetoes and an open border make it dficult for the long-term management of Omicron and whatever virus follows it.The Scottish Government should capitalise on the success of the First Minister’s management of this health and economic crisis by turning its back on the doomed idea of asking for a Section  order. Instead, it should make peace with the Alba Party and call all elected members of all parties to a national convention.We should take a vote on independence andthere is a majority, we should act. We should declare independence by withdrawing from the Treaty of Union or by calling a plebiscite election. If this is legally contested by the UK Government, we can by then have won international support and recognition by the UN and some of our friends and colleagues in Europe. We need to find our courage like some of our famous forebears.Maggie Chetty, Glasgow.  SCOTLAND AND THE EUROPEAN UNIONI REFER to David Leask’s very pessimistic view on the Scottish relationship with the EU .He does not mention the Withdrawal Bill or the Internal Markets Bill, both now passed, which take powers coming from the EU to Scotland and gives them to Westminster.Nor does he mention the high standards on health and safety which came from the EU – for example, in the building, agriculture and water industries.Looking at the water industry, we now see the picture in England, where sewage is repeatedly discharged into rivers because money has not been spent to raise standards to EU levels – as it certainly has been in the publicly owned Scottish water industry.Thames Water was fined over £ million in  and £m in  but now this sanction has gone. I think Scots appreciate that the EU has brought them these high standards, including also on human rights, though they do not understand the details of EU law.They have the SNP President, Mike Russell, and SNP MPs like Alyn Smith and Philippa Whitford as well as SNP MSPs like Christina McKelvie and Jenny Gilruth to keep them informed on the hurdles as well as the benefits of Scotland joining the EU and becoming a normal European country enjoying self-determination at last.Susan Grant, Tain.  SIGNIFICANCE OF WIND POWERLYNDSEY Wardmakes some important points about the current dficulties associated with wind power as a source of renewable energy: the wind doesn’t blow all of the time at times too much wind is blowing so the generators get compensation and there are dficulties with our current grid system.None of this can be denied but your correspondent carefully avoids the other side of the issue.We cannot carry on generating electricity using fossil fuelswe wish to avoid a catastrophe caused by global warming.So your correspondent has, in my view, two options – either deny global warning or offer a solution to the generating issue.In my view, wind generation, imperfect as it is, is a signicant option for the UK and, in particular, Scotland.Undoubtedly, new technologies need to be developed to store unusable power, maybe in the form of hydrogen, but there seems little point in just burying our heads in the sand and doing nothing.So, come on, Lyndsey Ward – unless you are a climate change denier, tell us what are your solutions to the major energy issue of the day – namely, how to phase out fossil fuels.John Palfreyman, Coupar Angus, Perthshire.  THE DAY I LEFT TOM MCKEAN FOR DUSTSUSAN Swarbrick’s very interesting piece about Kelvin Hall in Saturday’s magazine brought warm winds of nostalgia.I have many fond memories of the Hall – getting Henry Cooper’s autograph at the Motor Show, going to see Billy Smart’s circus, and taking my own children to the crisp, shiny new transport museum.Another magical memory which sticks in my mind was being asked to take part in the opening of the Kelvin Hall International Sports Arena.As an amateur wrestler, I was invited to participate in a wrestling exhibition by the illustrious Willie Baxter from Milngavie, who had been the British wrestling team coach at the  Munich Olympics and at the time was a manager in the city’s parks and recreation department.Willie advised me to warm up, so I decided to have a few laps around the brand new  metre running track.At the time, Tom McKean, one of Scotland’s track greats who would go on to win European and World titles, was being interviewed by one of our national broadcasters for a tea-time piece about the new arena.Part of their segment was to film Tom jogging round the track. I couldn’t resist the opportunity – I kicked as hard as I could from about  yards behind Tom and left him for dust, or so it would seem.I tuned in that evening and I must have been even faster than I thought, because I couldn’t even be seen whizzing past the future world champ.If the great man remembers this I hope he can take some consolation. The last I heard, he was a police officer running criminals to ground I, on the other hand, struggle to run a bath.Happy memories.

Fundamentally, this is a restriction of the freedom of movement for islanders.\"Not all travel can be planned so far ahead of time.\"The type of travel that falls into this kind of short-notice category is overwhelmingly that undertaken by island residents. Sowe decide a few days before the weekend that we’d like to go shopping in Oban we can’t.\"If we need to attend a funeral, a medical appointment, or have any need to travel that can’t be foreseen a month in advance, our ticket has lower priority than holiday makers and sightseers who planned their one trip many months ago.\"In July, one resident of Mull asking to book a pickup and livestock trailer to Oban was told the next available space for him on a Saturday was in October.The issues have been exacerbated with a series of breakdowns to the CalMac fleet of  ageing ferries during the busy summer tourism period which have raised concerns about the continuing resilience of vessels.Sam Bourne, chairman of the Arran Ferry Action Group supported calls for changes saying passengers were being hampered by what he called the \"outdated booking system\"\"In peak periods, and increasingly becoming a problem across the year, it is near-impossible to access sailings at short notice with a car,\" he said. \"This effectively discriminates against islanders who are unable to book many weeks in advance to travel for essential work or family reasons, or more importantly, to access critical health care appointments at the mainland hospitals. If you are lucky enough to get a booking, you are still at risk of late cancellation. Stand-by systems also give little priority to all but the most urgent scenarios.\"One bereaved Mull islander could not get a ferry booking tofrom her husband’s funeral in Glasgow in mid-December.CalMac staff intervened, however, and enabled her eventually tohome. \"Could anyone really defend a first-come-first-served booking system as fair,it prioritises sightseers ahead of that lady, simply because the sightseers had booked earlier than her,\" said one Mull ferry committee source. \"Of course not. \"It should not require back-channel communications and the intervention of a users’ group to enable a lady to get afrom her husbands funeral.\": Row over ferry port of refuge unavailable as high winds ravage CalMac servicesFerry users say a proportion of deck space should be bookable for island residents only and essential travellers, such as GPs.They say travellers should be encourage to use particular sailings.Businesses are among those who are supporting moves for a rethink.John MacDonald, a Mull haulage contractor said: “The booking system,not the system as a whole, is now so dysal that it is easier for me to bypass it entirely and travel almost exclusively on the non-bookable smaller vessels. I get much greater certainty of travel from the much more dependable and frequent small-ferry service – even though it makes my journeys longer, inflating both cost and fuel burn.\"Heather Hull, another islanders added: “Booking ferries so far in advance is absurd. There are lots of things to be taken into account. Work commitments, school days and cancellation of certain ferries.\"The issues come as would-be ferry replacements MV Glen Sannox and Hull  are still languishing in the now state-owned Ferguson Marines shipyard with completion running up to five years late and costs of their construction more than doubling from the original £m contract. MV Glen Sannox was originally due to enter the Ardrossan to Arran service in the summer of .Some  of CalMacs  working ferries deployed across Scotland are over  years old while Caledonian Maritime Assets Ltd , the Scottish Government-controlled owners and purchasers of Scotlands ferries have quietly raised the depreciation period of Scotlands ferries from  years to  years in the space of just  years.Joe Reade, co-founder and chief executive of The Island Bakery on Mull, and chairman of the local ferry committee said: \"There are laws in other spheres of le to prevent the kind of systemic discrimination seen on ferries – notably of course in employment law. I can’t as an employer discriminate on grounds of gender for example, either directly or indirectly.: Scots ministers acted unlawfully over leline ferries to be built abroad\"If I advertised a job vacancy but stipulated that applicants should have had continuous employment for  years since leaving full-time education, I would be indirectly excluding female applicants, since most would have had employment breaks to have children.\"I could argue that I’m trying to select candidates with good work experience, and that otherwise the job is open to all fairly – but I would rightly be challenged on grounds of gender discrimination. I would have placed qualication hurdles in the application criteria that were indirectly and systemically prejudiced against women.\"This is exactly what the ticketing system does – It is claimed to be ‘fair’ because it does not discriminate between who is buying a ticket, but it places a key qualication hurdle in front of potential travellers – you must be able to plan your journey three or four weeks in advance.\"In December a plan to raise the fares of motorhomes was seen as early piece of ‘demand management’ by Transport Scotland.While general fares are rising by around two per cent, the road equivalent tarfformula applied to motorhomes is to be adjusted, resulting in increases for motorhomes of around -% next year.RET is a distance-based fares structure brought in after the Scottish Government committed to provide one single overarching fares policy across the country’s entire ferry network.The pricing system was introduced originally on a trial basis in  by the Scottish Government. It saw the cost of sailings brought down to match a formula generated by the government so that ferry tickets would, theoretically, cost no more than an equivalent journey on the road.It is estimated that RET is now costing the Scottish Government around £ million per annum in revenue support, of which around two-thirds is attributable to RET for vehicles less than six metres in .But many islanders are angry at the scheme as commercial vehicles are not included, which can send the cost of goods spiralling due to transport costs.A Transport Scotland spokesman said: “Capacity will continue to be managed across the ferry network. No welfare issues or supply issues as a consequence of service disruption have been reported to CalMac, nor through local resilience partnerships, but the position will continue to be monitored. CalMac Ferries Ltddoes its best to assist passengers with a need to travel, particularly those with medical appointments, and will always do everything possible to accommodate passengers on alternative sailings.”"},{"url":null,"title":"covid-scotland-11-000-new-cases-overnight","story":"It means the death toll under this measurement, of people who tested positive for the virus in the past  days, remains at ,.While no new deaths were reported, officials noted that register offices are now generally closed at weekends.The daily test positivity rate was .%, according to figures published by the Scottish Government on Monday, up from .% the previous day.Authorities said large volumes of tests continue to be processed by laboratories, which has “impacted turnaround times resulting in delays between specimens beings taken and results being received and reported”, and that Public Health Scotland is monitoring the situation.There were , people in hospital on Sunday with recently confirmed Covid-, up  on the previous day, and  people in intensive care, down one.So far ,, people have received their first dose of a Covid- vaccination, ,, have had a second dose, and ,, have received a third dose or booster."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"January ,  at : pmA series of virtual community meetings have been organised following on from the Orkney Matters survey.

It comes, however, only after millions in public funds have been spent on an ill-conceived vanity project opposed across parties and the communities most directly affected.#No-one disputes the need to modernise air traffic services, which support operations on our leline air routes. Sadly, months and millions have been wasted by SNP Ministers and HIAL on a centralisation that was never going to get off the ground.”Meanwhile, Alistair Carmichael MP said that the “costly and unnecessary” plans have ended “not with a bang but a whimper”, and called for reform of the board of HIAL to ensure the communities that the airport operator serves are heard.“Above all we need to reflect on how this sorry state of affairs came to be in the first place,” said Mr Carmichael.“Retreat on the centralisation plan is only a temporary fix of the underlying problem. HIAL is supposed to be accountable and responsive to the needs of the entire Highlands and Islands and it is clearly not living up to that aspiration.“If we are to avoid another similar fiasco in the future then we need to look at further reform to ensure that our communities are heard on the board of HIAL.”Richard Hardy, Prospect National Secretary, welcomed the announcement and said that the union and HIAL remain in “sensitive negotiations” in relation to the future delivery of air traffic services.A HIAL spokesperson said: “We have been clear that ATMS is the best option to maintain the long-term sustainability of air services for the Highlands and Islands. Nevertheless, we are committed to working with Prospect and our air traffic control colleagues to try and develop a new solution involving compromise by both sides.“We would encourage those with an interest in ensuring the delivery of a safe, resilient, and sustainable air traffic operation for island communities to recognise the delicate nature of these negotiations and engage in constructive dialogue to reach that end.” copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

And he also said when the Building Safety Bill goes through the Lords, so sometime in February or March or thereabouts, the Government will amend it to try and protect leaseholders in law from these costs, but he didn’t go into detail as to what that meant.”The person said Mr Gove was “trying to put the squeeze on developers so they come to the table prepared to put down big money to make this go away”, and had been “putting his shoulder to the wheel” on the issue.They added: “He’s talking about jeopardising their access to other public subsidy, particularly from Help to Buy,they don’t play ball.”Askedthey were happy with the tone of what they heard at the meeting, the leaseholder said: “Definitely. I mean, it’s about time.”During a round of broadcast interviews ahead of the meeting, Mr Gove said it was time for those with “the big bucks, the big profits” to act to remedy the fire safety risks, as he announced that developers must agree to a £ billion plan to fix dangerous cladding on low-rise flats by early March or risk new laws forcing them to act.Mr Gove told Sky News: “We want to say to developers and indeed all those who have a role to play in recognising their responsibility that we want to work with them.“Butit’s the case that it’s necessary to do so, then we will use legal means and ultimately,necessary, the tax system in order to ensure that those who have deep pockets, those who are responsible for the upkeep of these buildings, pay – rather than the leaseholders, the iniduals, who in the past were being asked to pay with money they didn’t have for a problem that they did not cause.” vw,vw,px, px\"Leaseholders take part in a demonstration in London to demand an end to the ‘cladding scandal’ Leaseholders in buildings between mand mtall will, in a Government U-turn, no longer have to take out loans to cover the costs of remediation work despite no new money coming from the Treasury.Instead, Mr Gove told developers to agree to start contributing this year to cover the “full outstanding cost”, which he estimates to be £ billion.He said “some of the most egregious cases” had already been tackled.He added that there had been a “particular problem in the system” which “means that people have themselves to come forward and say ‘We believe that this building needs work’,” something he said had resulted in him not knowing the precise number of properties that still needed work.He told LBC: “We can’t be absolutely precise about the exact number in scope. That is one of the things that I hope that we can do in conversation with owners and with developers at the moment.”In a letter to the residential property development industry being sent on Monday, Mr Gove set a deadline of “early March” to publicly accept his ultimatum and provide a “fully-funded plan of action”.They were also ordered to provide comprehensive information on all buildings taller than m that have fire-safety defects and which they helped to construct in the past  years.Reece Lipman said that as things stand, while he owns % of his flat in Romford, east London, he is currently liable for “% of fixing all the costs”.The -year-old said Mr Gove “has got the rhetoric right and is now talking with a much firmer tone”, but insisted that what has been seen as “just a cladding crisis” is in fact “a full-blown building safety crisis” and likened the Government’s action to date as akin to bailing “water off the Titanic with pots and pans”.Mr Gove admitted the Government “did get stuff wrong” in the cladding scandal, but he said some of those who argued they were abiding by building regulations at the time did not have a “strong case”.He told LBC: “It’s also the case that there were lots of steps that were taken which put people at risk, and without wanting to pre-empt what the independent inquiry into Grenfell will conclude, I think it is… you would be hard-pressed to say that putting, essentially, sheets of liquid petrol encased in metal on the side of a tower block was the right thing to do.”The Fire Brigades Union said the Government’s latest move was “a result of determined campaigning by leaseholders and tenants”.The union’s general secretary, Matt Wrack, said: “It shows that the Government can be pressured into progress, and we commend the efforts of campaigners.“We have always been clear here – residents should not carry any cost for failure they did not cause. Developers, suppliers and buildings owners are responsible, and they should pay.”Stewart Baseley, the executive chairman of the Home Builders Federation, accepted that leaseholders should not have to pay for remediation, but said builders should not cover the costs alone.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Dr Jaffa is essentially a spokesman and an apologist for the salmon farming industry.#It#s no coincidence that wild salmon stocks have collapsed in all areas of the northern hemisphere where open net salmon farming has developed.#Peter Cunningham, biologist with the Wester Ross Fisheries Trust, said: #It is the salmon farming industry#s inability to manage parasitic sea lice that is the major threat to wild salmon. It is a natural parasite but they multiply and become much higher in number on open cage salmon farms.#Sampling by the WRFT in the spring of  supports contention that cumulative levels of infective sea lice were again much too high between Skye and the mainland of Scotland to protect migrating post-smolt salmon within these waters in the next spring.#Salmon populations in rivers Applecross, Ling, Sheil, Glenmore, Glen Beag, Arnisdale, Broadford, Sligachan and many others around Skye are particularly vulnerable.#  "},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/258343311_483851062940065_6761478433370174788_n.jpg","title":"skyes mavis sails first tall ship at","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine, as part of the Greenock to Leith voyage last year.

the GCSE and A-Level classes - are the priority, so they will remain in school.”Most ReadCrime pays for loyalist killer Robert ‘Brooksy’ Clarke as he puts Co Antrim mansion on market for almost £mPoll blow for Sinn Fein ambition for all-island powerMale model caught at Belfast International Airport carrying €k in suitcaseCouncil chief executive Anne Donaghy takes case against employer alleging sexual, religious and political discriminationJoan Collins’ hell at hands of ‘rapist Larne husband’Top VideosPlayDownpatrick murder victim Aidan Mann laid to restPlayVideo: World#s most powerful telescope gets shock testing in Northern IrelandPlayVideo: Major security alert onboard easyJet flight at Belfast International Airport Latest Education‘We simply are not safe’: NI pupils express concerns over conditions in classroom as Covid crisis deepensCo Antrim woman using Lego to help children and build a better le one brick at a timeMark BainOpinionAssembly needs to make smart decisions and not turn schools debate into playground rowMLAs ‘need to fix school issues, not play blame game’SDLP angry at lack of progress implementing education reportLatestTube workers vote to strike over jobs, pensions and conditionsItaly imposes new restrictions on the unvaccinated amid Covid surgeThomas Frank feels James Ward-Prowse is world’s best free-kick specialistInsects and lab-grown meat on the menu for some, survey suggestsTranscript of Boris Johnson’s interview at vaccination clinic in Uxbridge,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up The survey found pc of voters were unsure what make-up of political parties they would like to see in the next government. However, despite the lack of support for a Sinn Féin-led government, the party remains the most popular in the south and Mary Lou McDonald is the most popular political leader.The new poll shows Mary Lou McDonald’s party is up two points to pc, while Fine Gael is down two to pc. Fianna Fáil is up pc. The state of the other parties are: Social Democrats pc , Labour pc , Green Party pc , Solidarity People Before Profit pcand Aontú pc .Ms McDonald, with a . out of ten rating, is marginally more popular than Taoiseach Micheál Martin , Tánaiste Leo Varadkarand Green Party leader Eamon Ryan . In a further boost for Sinn Féin, more than two in fivevoters say their preference for the next housing minister is Eoin Ó Broin. One thirdsaid they wanted serving minister Darragh O’Brien to continue in the portfolio. Voters are less supportive of Pearse Dohertybecoming the next finance minister, with Fine Gael’s Paschal Donohoestill more popular than his opposition counterpart. Just pc of those polled said their preference for finance minister was Fianna Fáil’s Michael McGrath.Fine Gael’s Helen McEnteeis the public’s most popular choice for justice minister followed by Sinn Féin’s Martin Kennyand Fianna Fáil’s Jim O’Callaghan .In Northern Ireland, Sinn Féin is also in poll position ahead of the Assembly elections in May, with the latest Lucid Talks showing they hold pc of the vote, which puts Michelle O’Neill in a prime position to be the next first minister. The DUP, on pc, has regained some of the support it lost to the other unionist parties but faces an uphill battle to retain the first minister position.In a bid to shore up the hard-core unionist vote, DUP leader Jeffery Donaldson last week again threatened to collapse Stormontnegotiations on the Northern Ireland Protocol are not completed soon. Mr Donaldson’s intervention was branded as “reckless” by Ms McDonald who said the Protocol was working for Northern Ireland businesses.Last week, newly appointed UK Brexit negotiator Liz Truss held meetings with political leaders in the Northern Ireland and Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney as negotiations over the Protocol continue. While the ongoing debate over trading arrangements between the EU and the UK rages on in Northern Ireland, it is very low on a list of priorities for voters in the south. The Ireland Thinks poll found just pc of voters list Brexit and Northern Ireland as priorities for the government.

Specsavers is encouraging avid readers to have regular eye tests so they can continue to indulge their hobby. Presbyopia is the gradual loss of our eyes’ ability to focus close up as the lens becomes less flexible. A natural part of ageing, it usually becomes noticeable around the age of . The condition is common and typically isn’t a cause for concern. But some struggle to adapt, and find they need to hold their book at arm’sto read the page or direct a light on it to see the words more clearly. For most people, the answer is a simple eye test which will identythey need reading glasses, multi-focal glasses or contact lenses to make words clearer – and le easier. Maeve Walsh, director at Specsavers Crescent Link in the Waterside and Ferryquay Street in the city centre, says: “It can sometimes be dficult for people to assess themselves whether they have presbyopia, which is why we always encourage regular eye tests, usually every two years. “As we age, it’s completely natural for our eyesight to worsen and it shouldn’t be something we worry about, providing our eyes are in good health. “My advice to those with presbyopia would be to carry your specs with you at all times and get into the habit of having them close by. This will help with activities like reading, and will also ensure you’re not straining your eyes, which can sometimes cause other problems.” To find out more about presbyopia, or to book an eye test visit:https:www.specsavers eye-health presbyopiaandwww.specsavers stores derryorwww.specsavers stores crescentlink Top five signs you have Presbyopia .

Reporter: Staff Reporter Dec   addthis, Lynch’s, the local family retailer which operates a number of Spar and Eurospar stores and supermarkets, have opened their third local supermarket bringing their total store number to eight across the North West and Mid Ulster. googletag.cmd.push Lynch’s Eurospar, Greysteel is the third outlet from the retailer to open under the popular Eurospar brand and has allowed management to more than double the number of jobs available, now employing  locally. Acquiring what was previously a Centra store on the site, company director Paul Lynch says the community needed a larger format supermarket brand that would not only bring a host of fresh and local produce and ranges, but would be convenient and complemented with services vital to the local area. Paul said: “We have invested around pound, to bring our supermarket experience to the Greysteel area and are so proud to open the doors. “We have more than doubled the size of the space which allows optimum navigation throughout the aisles, where shoppers will find an increased iety and range of fresh and local foods including our own meat offering and pre-packed ranges. “Importantly, we have continued the on-site partnership with Nicholl Fuels to offer locals a -hour fuel service with pre-pay pumps and we have  parking spaces to allow shoppers to conveniently load their cars safely.” The team has also retained important services including the Post Office, ATM, Lotto and PayPoint and added even more amenities and initiatives to bring value and choice to the area. The deli now serves an extended range of hot and cold food to go alongside Barista Bar coffee and Spar bakery, and shoppers can take advantage of the many deals available including the current  Deals of Christmas campaign which drops the price of big name items and festive essentials every week in the lead up to Christmas. Paul continued: “Eurospar also price matches over a thousand branded products to Tesco each week, so paired with our consistent schedule of value deals, we’re bringing a huge amount of savings for shoppers.” As is the Lynch and Eurospar ethos, the team in-store will implement outreach initiatives with the local community, sponsoring and supporting local clubs and organisations, while also fundraising for charity partner Cancer Fund for Children. Paddy Doody, sales and marketing director at Henderson Group, which owns the Eurospar brand in Northern Ireland added: “We now have  Eurospar supermarkets in Northern Ireland, each one bringing a wealth of convenience in a large format supermarket to their areas. “The Lynch’s are experienced independent retailers and know how to engage with their local communities, with an incredibly high bar set for customer service. “Its fantastic to see the Eurospar brand thriving under our independent retailers and we wish Lynch’s the best of luck with their new business.” The new supermarket in Greysteel joins Lynch’s portfolio of stores including Eurospars in the Skeoge area of Derry and Draperstown in Magherafelt, plus Spars in Dungiven, Claudy, Newbuildings and Trench Road in Co Derry, and Clonoe in Coalisland.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ie  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

Hundreds of people turned out for the first day of vaccinations at the Centre, which played an important role in the initial drive to deliver First and Second vaccinations. The Foyle Arena is now open to walk-ins and bookings from am to pm, Monday to Saturday, and am to pm on Sundays. Mayor Warke joined them to receive his booster jab, and said he was impressed by the swt organisation of the effort and the professionalism of staff on site. He said: “This is a rapidly changing situation and I am extremely impressed at how these measures have been so quickly put in place to meet demand. I want to acknowledge the work of the Western Trust staff who are doing such an amazing job in very challenging circumstances. “I also want to thank all the staff at the Foyle Arena, and previously at Templemore, who are playing a vital role in this effort. “The Trust are aiming to vaccinate  people a day at the Foyle and I would appeal to everyone attending to please follow the advice of the professionals and lets do all we can to get as many people as possible protected in the weeks ahead.” The campaign is expected to continue until January and to safely accommodate the numbers of visitors to the centre Members of Foyle Arena, there will be some minor impacts to services over the coming weeks, though most will continue as normal. This includes changes to studio class timetables, and alternative temporary arrangements are now in place for Members, with a wide range of leisure services also available across other Council owned leisure Centres. Director of Health and Community with Council, Karen McFarland added: “There has been a speedy response to the recent developments in the Covid pandemic, and we were happy to be able to step up once again to provide much needed facilities to help progress the Trusts Vaccination Campaign. “Measures have been put in place to mitigate any impacts and while most of our leisure services will continue as normal, there may be some disruption to some activities which we will communicate directly to our members. “This is a short term campaign, and I really appreciate everyones patience as we assist in getting vaccinations to those who need them. “With high volumes of people expected to attend I would appeal to people to please follow the guidance at the centre and the directions of staff – they are there to help keep things running smoothly. “The safety of our staff and the public is our first priority and I would ask for everyones cooperation over the coming weeks.” With the volume of people accessing the Foyle Arena, additional parking is available for members at Clooney Park West playing fields. To find out more about leisure services available across all Council sites, and any changes to timetables please go to: derrystrabaneleisure The Western Trust this week issued an appeal to staff to help in the escalated operation as vaccinators.

These proposals are being brought forward by a new partnership between Derry-based property developer South Bank Square and housing provider Choice. The new plans include a mix of social and affordable homes ranging from one to four bedrooms, comprising a mix of terrace, detached and semi-detached houses as well as a number of bungalows and apartments aimed at those aged  and over. Proposals also include signicant areas of open space, a woodland walk, allotments, childrens play area, and a tenant hub. The project represents poundmillion of investment to the City Region, and will see the creation of approximately  new jobs over a period of eight to  years. Martin Mallon, Managing Director of South Bank Square said: “We are delighted to unveil these updated proposals for the Ballyoan site. “This new partnership with Choice Housing Association represents a signicant multi-million pound investment in the North West and will see the development of hundreds of new family homes over the next ten years. “The comprehensive planned development of this site will be key to delivering some of the thousands of new family homes that we know are very much needed in the city now and over the forthcoming years. “The new proposals will include expansive areas of open space, children’s play areas, a woodland walk, as well as proposed improvements to the local roads infrastructure. “It is fantastic to be able to announce this level of investment in our home city and we expect that this scale of investment will bring with it many job opportunities for local people and local suppliers in the North West. “Enabling works have already started on site following our planning approvals granted earlier this year and we hope to commence house building on site early in .” Michael McDonnell, CEO at Choice added: “We are thrilled to move forward with these proposals in partnership with South Bank Square. This project will unlock huge potential to create much needed, high quality social and affordable homes for a range of people in the city. “As well as relieving housing stress in the city, this project will allow young families to get on the property ladder by bringing forward a number of affordable homes, as well as offering professionally managed, exceptional private rental opportunities too. “Extensive planning has been carried out to ensure the needs of young families, disabled people, and the elderly are catered for, with plenty of green space, allotments, a play park and a tenant hub included in our ambitious plans. “We hope to be able to secure planning permission for these homes so that we can begin to deliver them as soon as possible.”   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

Invest NI and the Department for the Economy , believe that Northern Ireland’s ranking in the ONS survey is not truly reflective of the level of innovation activity that is actually being delivered across the region. This could be down to the fact that many businesses simply don’t recognise what they do as innovation.  In response to the ONS, DfE launched Innovate NI in October  this is an initiative that supports local businesses to progress through a four-step innovation framework for successful innovation to create value. The initiative also provides official recognition for innovation activity, helping businesses to understand where they are in their innovation journey and recognise their innovation achievement.  As a business further develops their innovative project, they can have their activities assessed by Innovate NI. If deemed to be innovative, they receive recognition so they can clearly see the level of progress that theyre making.  Mary agrees with the need to encourage businesses to identy as innovative.  “One thing is for sure we don’t shout about our innovation achievements enough. I firmly believe the NI economy is much more innovative than the ONS survey portrays during the pandemic, we found that NI actually had a lot of innovative businesses with erse offerings and locally we showed a high level of resilience in dealing with a very signicant economic shock. “But I do think micro-businesses in particular, sometimes struggle to see themselves as being innovative and struggle to understand all the supports that are available to them. That’s why Innovate NI’s recognition scheme is so important and it is one of the reasons we decided to support the work of Innovate NI with the Economic Recovery Innovation Grant.” Economic Recovery Innovation Grant The Economic Recovery Innovation Grantis funded by the Department for the Economy’s Economic Recovery Action Plan. The grant was launched on th November and it provides small-to-medium-sized businesses, including micro- businesseswith the opportunity to apply for a grant of up to pound,.  This grant was created to help businesses progress their innovative idea - this idea must be new to the business, or the market, for example, a new product or service, or a new process within the business. The grant will help a business that is currently working on an innovative project to test and develop it, with the end goal of commercialising the product or service, or implementing the process fully in the business. The pound, can be used to fund development costs and the actual implementation of that innovative idea into the business. Businesses hoping to apply must complete Invest NI’s eligibility checker and satisfy the scheme’s eligibility criteria including being registered with HMRC and being a Northern Ireland-based SME or social enterprise.  They must also have a valid Silver Level Innovator recognition from Innovate NI. Silver Level Innovator recognition means businesses have already started to test and develop an innovative idea for their business.  Businesses can checkthey satisfy the eligibility criteria on Investni andthey do, they can submit an innovation assessment to find out their innovation level. Once issued, Invest NI will invite the eligible, Silver Level Innovator to apply for ERIG. Mary says the reason why businesses must have the Silver Level Innovator recognition to qualy for the grant, is to ensure that the grant is put to good use.  “We want local businesses to further develop innovative projects, services or processes that will enable them to grow. A business that is recognised as Silver Level has already completed the ideation and selection steps of the Innovation Framework, so we know the grant will be used to progress an idea Innovate NI has assessed as potentially innovative. “Using the grant to achieve commercialisation or implementation would then, hopefully, allow a business to progress to Gold Level Innovator status.” Innovate NI also provides help, support and signposting to ensure businesses progress through these innovation levels. This helps to avoid repeating the same step over and over again. This signposting will also help businesses know where to go for the right help. “Innovation can be something big or something minor, but it can make a major change for an SME or micro business. Just go checkyou are eligible and where you are on the Innovation Framework - it could completely change the way you do business.” The closing date to apply for the Economic Recovery Innovation Grant is pm on Monday, st January . Grants will be allocated on a first-come, first-served basis. Visit Invest NI to learn more about the grant and whether you are eligible.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

Neighbouring Fermanagh  Omagh had the second-highest rate of . while the lowest figure was to be found at Ards  North Down with .. The overall rate for the North stands at . cases per . people. While there are suggestions that another full-scale lockdown may be imposed by the Executive, given that the new Omicron iant of Covid has long-since embedded itself within the island of Ireland, no matter what restrictions are put in place, Dr Black – who is the Chair of the British Medical Associations Northern Ireland Council – said that rates will continue to rise over the next few weeks. He said: “It doesnt matter what restrictions we put in now because the effects of the fth wave, which is Omicron, are already baked into the system. What is going to happen over the next few weeks cannot be altered now. “ the horse has bolted. That ship has sailed. We are in a position where we are just going to have to work our way through the next four to six weeks. “This will include another two weeks of a huge infection rate, two or three weeks after that will be hospitalisations – hopefully not in large numbers and not too much pressure on Intensive Care Units. The pattern so far is that hospitalisations are not as bad as they were last January with the Delta iant.” Although the Omicron iant is generally regarded as being weaker than the Delta one that struck  months ago. Dr Black says that while young people who have been fully vaccinated maybe able to cope with it, the elderly may be more vulnerable to this iant. He added: “In September , Derry and District had the highest rate in Western Europe and we are more than four times higher than that rate now. The rates that weve seen in the past are so modest compared to what were seeing at the moment.   Figures from the Department of Health of positive Covid- cases in the North of Ireland.  “The rates at this moment are just phenomenal. You always worry about older, vulnerable people getting infected – certainly in Derry in the last week, weve seen more than five hundred patients in Derry and Strabane over sixty years old becoming infected. Across Northern Ireland that figure is more than three thousand. “Your worry from that is do those elderly and vulnerable patients end up in hospital  So far, our numbers for hospitalisations have only increased to around ten per cent in the last week or so. But we will be watching it very closely because although the Omicron iant is clearly a milder disease for younger people, we dont know yet how it will affect the elderly. “With Omicron, the factor here is how infectious is it. I think thats the major reason weve seen such a big increase. As throughout the pandemic, every time we think were successful, we become complacent and loosen up and complacency always leads to failure. “There was something about us being too complacent before Christmas in terms of bringing in enough restrictions early enough. That to some extent is the problem with a democracy. Politicians want to react to public sentiment rather than anticipate public sentiment. “You see in China, they closed down a million-person cityafter they get three positive results. WhereasBoris Johnson seems to be quite content to tolerate hundreds of thousands of infections per day because he thinks thats what the public seems to be wanting to tolerate. “Its a strange dichotomy in terms of how democracies respond to these pandemics.” The Health Service has been under considerable strain ever since the pandemic began almost two years ago. And Dr Black warns that the strain both the virus and the extra workloads it has brought upon the medical sector may well affect important services being delivered by the Health Serivice. He continued: “We worry about how the virus will affect iniduals in terms of their own health but also the effect that is happening on the Health Service with respect to the ability of staff to attend work. “The BMA mapping before Christmas suggested ten per cent of staff to be off with illness and a further ten to fteen per cent off due to isolation. Unfortunately, we seem to have been proven to have been correct. “Were seeing signicant numbers of staff missing – not just in general practice but in hospitals with nurses, doctors, paramedics and particularly in the ambulance service as well with response times from ambulances longer than we would want. “I see some of the ambulance services in the north of England were saying thatyou had a heart-attack, dont wait for an ambulance – go directly and get a lt to hospital. “Thats an extraordinary situation that were in that the virus is limiting the services for patients in other areas such as heart-attacks and strokes.” Meanwhile, the Western Trust has said it will continue with the temporary suspension of visitors to patients in hospitals, such as Altnagelvin in Derry. A short statement on the Western Trusts website read: “We would like to thank the public for their cooperation in relation to the recent changes to our visiting arrangements. Your support helps us to provide safer care for your relatives and friends who are currently in hospital. “Due to the continued pressures on our hospitals and the high level of COVID- transmission in the community, visiting remains suspended across our hospital sites and facilities. This does not apply to birthing partners, for maternity arrangements.” The Foyle Arena is serving as a mass vaccination centre. It is open between am to pm except on Friday, January  where it is open until pm. The centre is closed on Saturday, January  and Tuesday, January . Its opening hours on Wednesday, January  are pm to pm. The Shantallow Community Centre will be offering vaccinations on Tuesday, January  between pm to pm.

She argues that the new accommodation for the incoming undergraduates would be of immense benefit to the retail and hospitality sectors of Derrystudents were resident close to the citys heart. The student pound could help to kickstart the local economy – more so given the effects the pandemic has had on Derrys businesses. In the letter, Ms McLaughlin writes: “Our city will benefit substantially from the intake of new students. That benefit will increase even furtherthe new accommodation needed for them is located in or close to the city centre. “More specically,students live between campus and city centre this will have signicant positive impact on the commercial heart of the city, through its retail and hospitality sectors. I need hardly remind you of the hard times they have suffered over the last two years. “It is essential that core institutions such as the university work together with the public and private sectors, in order to maximise the combined impact. “I suggest this would in this instance be best achieve by providing student accommodation where it will have the most economic impact, which would be close of Derrys city centre. “Moreover, this would provide the best student experience by giving students easier access to the benefits of urban le, with close proximity to retail facilities and evening activities.” Explaining why she has taken it upon herself to write to Ulster University, Ms McLaughlin added: “I am urging the Ulster University Vice Chancellor, its Council and Senate to consider the potential benefits of their actions to the wider city. Our retail and hospitality sectors have suffered terribly through the pandemic, and locating new student accommodation close to the city centre would provide a real and much needed boost to our commercial sectors. “This, in turn, would help to safeguard existing jobs, as well as creating new jobs. I hope Ulster University will accept the logic of my argument. “While my party and I have campaigned for years for the expansion of Magee on the basis of the skills that will be created that will benefit the city and so will create well paid jobs, it is also very important that the expansion provides wider economic benefits through higher spending in the city and on local businesses. That, too, will create more jobs.”   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

That, too, will create more jobs.”   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

And a great way to make sure you’re on an even footing when it comes to motoring in  is by making some simple and easy checks around your car to confirm everything is as it should be. googletag.cmd.push But what should you be focusing on  Here, we’re going to take a look at some of the areas you might want to focus on. Interior   vw,vw,px, px\"  Don’t forget to vacuum areas in the middle of the cabin, too    Alright, so a clean interior isn’t critical to the roadworthiness of your car, but it’s a great place to start things off when it comes to checks. Plus, a tidy cabin will be far less distracting, while a lack of loose objects will ensure that nothing interferes with the major controls. So remove any items such as bottles or packets and wipe down areas such as the buttons and heating controls to ensure they’re bright and clean. A quick vacuum in the footwells can really help too. Tyres   vw,vw,px, px\"      Tyres are absolutely crucial. After all, they’re the only point of contact between your vehicle and the road so it’s paramount that they’re in good condition. First off, give the walls of the tyres an inspection are there any cracks or cuts  If so, they might need replacing. When it comes to tread, the legal minimum in Ireland is .mm. To check this, you could use an accurate tyre gauge – available to purchase from most motor factors and retailers – or a € coin. This latter method requires you torun a € coin along the centre of the wheel. If the gold part of the coin is not visible, then the tyre tread is ok. However,it is visible your tyre could be approaching the minimum legal depth so you should get them checked. You also need to check the pressure of the tyres. You’ll find the correct pressures for your vehicle either on the door sills or behind the fuel filler cap. Find this and simply inflate your tyres to the right pressure using a compressor, which are found at most petrol stations. Lights   vw,vw,px, px\"  Check that all of your lights are operating correctly   Lights are critical at this time of year. Not only are they needed to light up the road ahead, but they’re also required to make sure you’re visible to other road users. It’s why it’s a good idea to give them a check over. You can test your headlights – both dipped and full-beam – by operating them when parked close to a shiny surface, such as a garage door. When it comes to your rear lights, you could ask a friend to watch as you test them – or you can, again, reverse near to a reflective surface and operate them while looking in the rear-view mirror. Make sure you test your indicators, too – a blink that moves too quickly might mean that a bulb has blown and needs replacing. Washer fluid   vw,vw,px, px\"      You might have noticed that there’s a lot of dirt and grime on the roads at the moment and a great deal of this tends to end up on your windscreen. Because of this, it’s best to make sure that you’ve got plenty of washer fluid in your car so you can quickly and effectively clear your windscreen. On most cars, you’ll find the washer bottle under the bonnet, signied by a blue cap. Top it up to the correct level and make sure you’re using washer fluid – water on its own can freeze and cause damage to your car’s washer system. While you’re here, make sure your wipers are working effectively too –they’re making a rubbing noise or are smearing the windscreen, they’ll need replacing. Oil   vw,vw,px, px\"  Locating your car’s dipstick is a simple task. It’s usually marked out under the bonnet by a yellow cap.   While we’re under the bonnet, it’s a good idea to check your oil levels. This is easy to do, too. Simply remove the dipstickand clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Then, re-insert it back into its holder remove it again just after. Now, you’ll be able to read your car’s oil levels using the guide on the dipstick. If it’s too low, top it up via the oil filler using the correct oil for your car – you can find this in your vehicle’s handbook. Remember, only fill up in small increments and check your dipstick after each time. This helps to avoid overfilling. Windscreen   vw,vw,px, px\"  A windscreen might be requireda crack appears    Your car’s windscreen takes a real beating at this time of year, which is why there’s a greater chance of cracks or chips appearing. Take this opportunity to give your car’s windscreen an inspection to make sure that there’s nothing out of the ordinary. If you notice a small chip, then it’s a good idea to get it professionally repaired rather than leaving it to develop into a crack. This preventative repair is far cheaper than the cost of replacing an entire windscreen, after all. Remember, driving with a cracked windscreen can be deemed a motoring offenceit’s obscuring your view. If you’re stopped by police with a heavily cracked windscreen, it could lead to penalty points and a fine.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

At a media briefing, he stated there were inherent internal contradictions in the bans and said, Weve seen these before where you ban flights except for your own citizens. Is it that some passport holders will have the virus and some wont  Does the virus read your passport  Does the virus know your nationality or where youre legally resident  Our concern here is that we apply public health principles, not political principles to selecting measures that are used to control the spread of disease. He made the comments in the wake of tightening border restrictions across dozens of countries in response to the Omicron iant. WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, also called on countries to take rational and proportional risk-reduction measures. He said, Blanket travel bans will not prevent the international spread of Omicron and they place a heavy burden on lives and livelihoods. Dr Ryan suggested other ways to manage risk: There are ways that you can de-risk travel in terms of having increased testing, more testing before departure, more testing on arrival, quarantine until negative testing. There is a whole series of things that can be done that will manage the risk of importation of disease or even exporting disease to another country which fall short of blanket bans. The idea that you can put a hermetic seal on most countries is just frankly not possible. We all know that, weve seen that happen before. And certainly there has to be consistency. If [the bans] are being applied, they have to be consistent.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

Hoey, who was the Minister of Sport in Tony Blairs government and now sits in the House of Lords as an Independent peer, wrote a forward in a report released by a fringe Loyalist group. In it she wrote: “I... support the ongoing work to encourage those, especially from working class loyalist communities, to engage in education and to seek entry to professional vocations such as journalism, law, and public service. “There are very justied concerns that many professional vocations have become dominated by those of a nationalist persuasion, and this positioning of activists is then used to exert influence on those in power.” Ms Hoeys comments have drawn widespread criticism across the political board with the exception of DUP leader, Jeffrey Donaldson who posted on Twitter that he welcomed Hoeys contribution. Susan McKay has refuted Hoeys claims as baseless and thatthere is evidence of Protestants under-achieving in education, then that is for unionism itself to look at and address. She said: “I found it really depressing to see Kate making comments that I would have heard in my own childhood back in the s. “When I was a child, I would have heard adults in the community that I was growing up in saying things like oh the post office is rotten with them – meaning that jobs that were traditionally held by Protestants in the Post Office were now being obtained by Catholics. “The notion that somehow or the other, Catholics getting jobs was something that was disgusting and to be avoided is very obviously sectarian and I think that Kate Hoeys comments, unfortunately, fit that model. “There isnt any evidence whatsoever of any of the things that shes claiming. We do have fair equality legislation. There used to be ways of excluding Catholics by finding out peoples names before youre offered jobs but there isnt any more. “Nor is there any mechanism to exclude Protestants. People have the same educational opportunities and I think the thing is thatthere is evidence of unionist under-achievement in education, then thats a matter that unionism should be looking at and addressing. “Kate Hoeys comments are very much reverting to a sectarian model of society but I think that most people would recoil from this. I dont think thats the way most people see society anymore. “Unfortunately, the worst aspect of it in a way is the fact that Jeffrey Donaldson, the leader of the DUP, has stepped in and welcomed the both the report and Kate Hoeys comments. “Thats the unfortunate part of it that someone like Jeffrey could have responsibly said, of course we encourage equality in all of the professions and we believe that all of our young people should have the same educational opportunities. “But instead he is supporting this sectarian approach which makes it seem asProtestants arent succeeding because of Catholics. Hoeys citing of the legal and media professions have led to concerns of the former MPs comments could inadvertently paint a target on peoples backs. Journalist, Martin OHagan was killed by Loyalist paramilitaries in Lurgan back in  and in , lawyer Pat Finucane was murdered in his own home by UDA terrorists. Pats son John, now the Sinn Feacutein MP for North Belfast, condemned Hoeys comments and Susan McKay said that Catholics who had scaled the social ladder were often seen as getting ideas above their station. She added: “We know of John Finucanes father, Pat, who was a Catholic lawyer who was murdered by Loyalist paramilitaries. “There has been a lot of evidence over the years of a pattern of sectarian killings during The Troubles of Catholics who had – to use a Northern sectarian phrase – got above themselves. “It used to be a common enough phrase in Northern Ireland when I was growing up. “This notion goes right back to the foundation of the state with Lord Brookeboroughs infamous ninety-nine per cent of them are disloyal comment when he was urging employers to go for Protestants lads and lassies as he called them.” McKay also said that unionists such as Hoey should maybe look instead at how unionism has stunted working-class growth in the Protestant community instead of seeking to place blame on aspirational working-class Catholics who have attained white-collar jobs such as lawyers and journalists. She continued: “My parents would have been working-class Protestants who had been able to avail themselves of the  Education Act. So it lted Protestants as well as Catholics because unionism has never looked after its working-classes. “The whole Orange system was meant to be that you knew your place andyou were working-class, you stayed working-class and you did what you were told by your betters. “It was a very rigid system and it didnt encourage people to aspire to better themselves. In some ways, what were seeing now is a playing-out of that. “There is a passivity still within the Protestant community that doesnt serve young working-class people well.” Hoeys comments and Donaldsons endorsement of them have been regarded as unionism whipping up support from its core voting base ahead of this years Northern Ireland Assembly elections. However, McKay reckons thatthis is part of their strategy, it could backfire on them. She said: “Its a dangerous and irresponsible game to start invoking those old sectarian ghosts. “The Good Friday Agreement was supposed to have moved us on from all of this. This is just an attempt to throw us back to the old days when everything was defined in terms of them and us. “Its just so counter-productive for unionism to talk like this at this time. Its so obvious thatunionism wants to keep the union, they need to make it attractive to Catholics and nationalists as well as to unionists. “But that kind of talk, now being endorsed by Jeffrey Donaldson, is far more likely to turn more young unionist people away from unionism than anything . Youre not going to attract any nationalists because its really insulting to everybodys intelligence to be spoken to in that way. “People may well just feel, roll on the referendum on unity, as we cant go back and this crowd dont seem to want to go forward. I think thats how it will work. It will just make people think,  this is the way unionism is going to talk, then there is no future for this state. “Its like the crocodile moment with Arlene Foster where a lot of nationalist people who were not particularly politicised were politicised by that remark as they recognised it as being really demeaning.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

We’re encouraged to make these ongoing health measures as much a part of the holiday as mulled wine and mince pies. Such steps can help protect our nearest and dearest while we’re together. The gt of protecting one another from COVID- – including the Omicron iant – is the one that truly keeps on giving. The weather outside may be “frightful” but, gathering indoors, we can still open windows to allow fresh air to disperse the virus. Embrace face coverings, there are seasonal styles aplenty to add festive flair to commuting and high street shopping trips. Every adult in the country needs to get a COVID- booster vaccine, because two doses does not give you enough protection against catching Omicron. Get your booster now at nhs.uk covidvaccination. Get Boosted Now is the national mission to build a wall of defence against the new Omicron iant. This mission is more urgent and more important than ever before because Omicron COVID- is spreading fast. Vaccines are the best way we can protect ourselves. You can get a COVID- booster  weeks after your second dose. Boosters give you the best possible protection against the virus and should signicantly reduce your risk of serious illness and hospitalisation. And, swter than shaving or applying makeup, taking rapid lateral flow tests are a quick and easy part of your getting ready routine before venturing out. If you have been in contact with someone with COVID- and are double vaccinated, you should take a daily rapid lateral flow test for seven daysyou have no symptoms. This will help slow the spread of the virus and allow you and your loved ones to continue your plans that dayyou test negative. If you are unvaccinated, you must continue to self-isolate for  daysyou are a contact of someone with COVID-. Don’t forget the NHS COVID- app is still the fastest way to knowyou’ve been exposed to someone who tested positive for COVID-, so keep it on. A very merry Christmas and a happy New Year, celebrate safely and let’s make it a good one. ‘It’s vital to ventilate’  Leeds University Professor of Environmental Engineering Catherine Noakes, pictured, said: “As Christmas is coming people will naturally be spending more time indoors – welcoming friends and family into their home and attending social events together – as the weather gets colder.While we are all looking forward to spending time with friends and family this Christmas, it’s important to remember that coronavirus is still spreading and can easily transmit in the home even when people are vaccinated.“In an enclosed space, the infectious particles hang around in the air like smoke and can build up over time, increasing the risk of other people in the room breathing in the virus, especiallythere is no ventilation or fresh air helping to refresh the air.“That’s why it’s so important to ventilate indoor spaces by opening windows, evenjust regularly for a short time. This way fresh air can disperse and blow COVID- particles away to decrease the risk of others being infected.”  Wish List  Vaccinations  All adults now need to get a booster vaccine, as two doses do not offer enough protection against the fast spreading Omicron iant. Boosters are available  weeks after second jabs. Get Boosted Now at nhs.uk covidvaccination to signicantly reduce your risk of serious illness and hospitalisation.  Taking tests  Make taking rapid lateral flow tests part of your festive preparations. Use any unused stocks of rapid lateral flow tests that you may have at homeCollect from your School Universityyou already obtain test kits from thereCollect from your local PharmacyCollect from your local Community Test sitesOrder online at gov.uk   Fresh air  Opening doors and windows for ten minutes can help you and your loved ones stay safe.

McGuigan did not concede a single goal until Desertmartins Ulster semi final defeat to eventual champions Denn of Cavan, and his kick outs provided ample opportunity for the young side in front of him to get at the opposition. Pic by Mary K Burke.  Thompsons pace and running ability saw him constantly encouraged to drive forward from his corner back position into the Dolans attack. He was particularly strong as his side regrouped in the semi final to overturn Moneymores lead, streaming forward at the encouragement of his team-mates to cause the opposition defence a number of problems. Pic by Cathal McOscar.  Monaghan is another of the new breed of corner back who is equally comfortable joining in his sides attacks, along with numerous other defenders. The corner back is more than adept at the less glamorous nature of the position too, tenacious in the tackle, intense in his press and has the controlled aggression required to unsettle opposition attackers. Pic by Seamus McQuillan Mono Pix.  An old-school, sticky corner back, Walker was superb as Moneymore defeated Drum in the quarter final, and kept tabs on Dolans Kevin Nixon for much of the semi final. Walker was strong too in the quarter final win over Drum, producing some fine blocks and interventions to showcase his technical defending ability. Pic by Cathal McOscar.  Hitting - in their semi final win over Craigbane, McElhennon has sickened defenders all year from deep. He also netted in their Ulster win over Donagh, and has shown a knack for attacking from deep with the poise and devastation of a heat-seeking missile. A key cog in Desertmartins running machine and a large part of their success this season. Pic by Cathal McOscar.  Prone to a solo burst into the opposition half, he was particularly good against Drum, drawing an early save from their goalkeeper. Adept at sitting deep and playing the pivot as the men in front of him probe for a defensive opening, Moran has the game intelligence to know when to join the attack to create the overload and give the best opportunity for a score. Pic by Mary K Burke.  At the other side, Desertmartin had a mirror image of McElhennon in McEldowney, who was able to apply pressure on the opposite flank as St Martins hit teams with their speedy runners. Thrived in the space afforded to Desertmartin in their Ulster win over Donagh, and was a strong presence in their semi final defeat to Denn as well. Pic by Tom Heaney nwpresspics.  With his midfield partner Oran Kelly popping up in attacking positions, McGovern was the organiser, sitting back into the hole and looking for the opportunity to hurt the opposition. A calm head during the  final in June, he helped pave the way for that breakthrough success, using all his experience to see his side through a tough patch.  McGinleys experience and physical presence around the midfield area was a big boost for Dolans as they made their first JFC final since . An experienced head in the middle, he helped orchestrate their come-from-behind semi final win over Moneymore in Ballinascreen, and was a vocal organiser to have at centre field as he drove his team into the final. Pic by Cathal McOscar.  CDP Team of the Year : Hurling  See who has made our Team of the Year for last years hurling season.    Torturer-in-chief of a weary Moneymore defence in the semi final, McCosker hit two points and was named man of the match. His ball-carrying ability was key to that turnaround against Henry Joy McCrackens, not only resulting in his own scores, but yielding a number of frees for corner forward Odhran McKane to convert. Pic by Cathal McOscar.  McGuckin was a key link man in the St Martins side, choosing the correct option consistently and helping to probe opposition defences. Another experienced head to guide the younger players around him, the half forwards relentless movement helped create openings for the men around him, while he chipped in with crucial score of his own. Pic by Mary K Burke.  A threat all season, there was an excitement among the Moneymore side when Crozier received the ball. Comfortable running at defenders, he was a threat throughout their junior championship campaign, and was key in helping his side open up a lead in the semi final before a determined Sean Dolans side reeled them in. Pic by Cathal McOscar.  Bloomer hit - against Sean Dolans in the semi final and - in a man of the match display against Drum in the quarter final. Showing a dogged determination to threaten the goal, he turned down marks on two occasions, opting to put the head down and go for the net. Both decisions resulted in a collective - as Bloomer showed a ruthlessness in front of the posts. Pic by Mary K Burke.  Murrays breakthrough season has seen him torment opposition defences with ceaseless energy and clinical finishing. His free-taking has also been a feature, and the precocious forward has been rewarded for a fine debut season at adult level with a call-up to Rory Gallaghers provisional Derry squad for the upcoming McKenna Cup. Pic by Cathal McOscar.  Had a slow start in the semi final win over Moneymore, but was clinical in the pressure of the closing stages, finishing the game with four points. His free-taking, while errant in the early stages, was slick and composed when it mattered, with the game in the proverbial melting pot as his side chased down and overturned the Moneymore lead.

The St Oliver Plunketts stopper went through the entire championship campaign without conceding a single goal, and his efficiency from kick outs helped his side to reach back-to-back intermediate finals. Pic by Mary K Burke.  Quinn organised the Greenlough defence that was narrowly beaten in a low-scoring county final, and was a tough competitor throughout. A consistent performer, he was comfortable bringing the ball out from the back and supporting his team-mates in attack. Quinn has a seemingly indefatigable engine, and a willingness to give everything to his teams cause. Pic by Mary K Burke.  Lindsay had a fine season at the back for the county champions, and presided over a defence that was not only organised, but ready to break at pace. Tasked with curbing some of the countys more lively attackers, Lindsay produced a consistent level of performance that laid the foundations for his sides Derry success, as well as the run to the Ulster final that followed. Pic by Mary K Burke.  Flitting between corner back and half back, the versatile Steelstown man was tasked with picking up Enda Lynn in the latter stages of the county final as Neil Forester pushed on, and did a fine job until the Greenlough man was forced off through injury late on. Energetic and determined, Baker has all the attributes required to be a successful defender. Pic by Mary K Burke.  Rafferty was a lively member of the Drumsurn half back line that was the fulcrum of so many of their attacks during the championship. His input was vital in the deciding league victory over Banagher, and the has had a fine season as St Matthews reasserted themselves as a force to be reckoned with during manager Sean Bradys maiden year at the helm. Pic by Mary K Burke.  Concannons pedigree and ability was crucial to Steelstowns run through the county championship and on to an Ulster final. His pace, anticipation and fitness at the heart of the Brian Oacutegs defence have been consistent over the last few seasons as they fought to make the breakthrough, and proved crucial in finally getting them over the line. Pic by Mary K Burke.  A strong runner, Kearney drove Greenlough on as they attempted to win successive intermediate championship titles. Particularly adept at winning turnovers as the opposition ran out of room in the Greenlough half back line, he was a key part of a defence that did not yield a single goal in championship football all year. Pic by Mary K Burke.  Devine was an attacking threat for Brian Oacutegs from midfield, and showed great leadership throughout their championship campaign. His experience shone through in a side that blended the seasoned and the youtful with fantastic results. Devine drove Steelstown on throughout their Ulster campaign, particularly good in their win over Donaghmoyne. Pic by Mary K Burke.  Following the injury to Niall Bradley, McCallion was asked to take on a lot of the heavy lting in the Greenlough midfield and performed admirably throughout the season. A huge presence physically, McCallions ability to win ball, both first and second, was key to his sides dominance of opposition teams during their championship campaign. Pic by Mary K Burke.  CDP Team of the Year : Junior football  Who has made the cut for the junior football final XV     McCarron has shown all his power and skill throughout the championship, not least in the last two Ulster championship games when defences have opened up. No longer an unknown quantity, McCarron has dealt with the expectation that comes with being on the county , and produced consistent quality performances in the blue of Steelstown. Pic by Mary K Burke.  Not a man in Derry would have begrudged Neil Forester the chance to lt the Bateson Sheridan Lee Cup this season. Led by example and had the experience to organise games at key moments. First shackling Enda Lynn in the final, his versatility in pressing on in the final quarter helped spark the final push that delivered delirium in the Maiden City. Pic by Mary K Burke.  His withdrawal in the final was a blow to Greenlough and gave Steelstown the boost they needed to go on and win the game. As prolic as ever during the  season, Lynn was the perfect foil for the electric Niall Loughlin, sharing the scoring burden and proving creator-in-chief for the St Oliver Plunketts side in both their league and championship campaigns. Pic by Mary K Burke.  Pace, trickery and clinical finishing are all in McMonagles locker. He nailed the pressurised free to take the Derry title and has cut loose in the open spaces of the Ulster intermediate series. The corner forward exudes a real joy in playing the game, and has shown a relish for taking on opposition defenders in one-on-one situations, often leaving them in a flap. Pic by Mary K Burke.  Again the focal point of the Plunketts attack, Loughlin destroyed Slaughtmanus with -, hit a further - against Drumsurn and - in the sticky surroundings of the county final. Followed up a fine early season showing with the county side by shooting his side to within a whisker of back-to-back Derry intermediate titles. Once again a serious threat. Pic by Mary K Burke.  Another man to take advantage of Steelstowns free-scoring plan, Murray has used his pace well. Hit a point in the county final. Murray has produced performances of such consistency throughout the season that he finished the year among the championships top scorers, and made hay in the open fields of the Ulster intermediate championship.

Pic by Ramsey Cardy Sportsfile. googletag.cmd.push Brendan Rogers  “Ive barely trained all week,” said Rogers after his - haul in the Ulster semi final win over Dunloy. The Emmets man had risen from his sick bed to down the Cuacutechullains, producing a superb performance in his relatively new role in midfield. A week later, he repeated the trick, finding the net against Ballycran as Slaughtneil lted their fourth Ulster title. In this form, Rogers is unplayable. He hit scores from distance. He won dirty ball. He linked the play, and at crucial moments, he took off at a canter, beat the defenders and put the ball in the net. That ability has the effect of both unsettling opposition defences and getting maroon and white-clad supporters in the the stands on their feet. In the feedback, one respondent said Rogers was an absolute pleasure to watch and a reliable, classy player. Others said his selection was an easy choice and hailed him as a match winner, while a further response said no words needed. “He is the man that has driven Slaughtneil forward this year in both Derry and Ulster championships, and has been a class act,” suggested a further respondent. One response simply said the man is lethal. The Emmets will certainly hope so, and all of Rogers attributes will be required as they head into an All-Ireland semi final meeting with either Ballygunneror Kilmallock .

Young Hurler of the Year  McLaughlin celebrates his goal against Cootehill. Pic by Seamus McQuillan Mono Pix. Ruaidhriacute McLaughlin  In what has been a breakthrough season for the Na Magha corner forward, Ruaidhriacute McLaughlin has shown plenty of promise. With his side labouring against Cavan champions Cootehill in the Ulster quarter final, it was the young star who rattled the net to calm their nerves. McLaughlin is a lively attacker, whose clever movement has the result of both creating room for himself and freeing up space for his fellow forwards. His ability to appear in the right place at the right time was recognised in the feedback, with one respondent saying he got scores when they were needed at crucial times. Another said he slotted into the team with a quiet confidence, while a further response said he was the most committed young hurler in the county. “Brilliant young player. Fantastic, consistent playing at every match. Shines at every game and is an outstanding team player, always puts the team first,” added another. A fine season in the Antrim league as well as on the Derry and Ulster scene have laid the foundations for the Na Magha man to push forward in .

Pic by Cathal McOscar. googletag.cmd.push Eunan McElhennon  In a year where Desertmartin perfected the attack from deep-lying positions, McElhennon was a key weapon. Whether it was bursting forward with the ball, or getting on the end of a sweeping move, the electric half back was on the score sheet regularly. He found the net with an outstanding inidual effort in the Derry semi final win over Craigbane, and continued his scoring run throughout the Ulster championship campaign. One respondent on the feedback form pointed to McElhennons speed, strength and shooting, while another said you could play him anywhere on the pitch. A further response said he was the best half back in Derry and Ulster for his speed and skill on the ball, while another hailed him as an influential player. “He played some great, entertaining football and was very focused and smart on the field,” added another. One respondent simply nominated Runabout McElhennon, while another said he was easily the best player on the pitch in nearly every game this season. Ending the year with two junior medals to his name, along with his Desertmartin team mates, the half back can be well satisfied with his performances.

Young Junior Footballer of the Year  Murray capped the season with his first start for Derry seniors last night. Pic by Cathal McOscar. Lachlan Murray  Murray wasnt even eligible for Desertmartins first junior success this season, but their full forward was busy anyway, helping secure Ulster and All-Ireland minor titles for Derry. Eager not to miss out, he added the  junior football title to his growing medal collection, and featured strongly in the run to the Ulster junior semi final. With St Martins clearly the team to beat at this level, they faced packed defences wherever they went, with Murray having to work hard to create the space he needed. And he did. Sean Dolans Rory McGurk used his experience to curb Murrays enthusiasm in the early stages of the county final, but he did what talented young players do. The teenager adapted his game and maintained his composure to slot six points from frees as Desertmartin eventually won by ten points. One respondent to the feedback said Murray was the main man in that Desertmartin team, while another said he had a bit of everything in his game. “An exceptional talent. Eight points in the county minor final, performances for Derry minors and made the step to junior football easily,” added another. A part of Rory Gallaghers provisional squad for , there is an exciting future ahead for Lachlan Murray.

Pic by Mary K Burke. googletag.cmd.push Neil Forester  “Is this real ” yelled a delirious Neil Forester at the end of his sides championship final win over Greenlough. Youd forgive him for asking. The Brian Oacutegs captain has seen years of heartache and near misses, and when the crunch arrived in November, he produced a huge performance to finally clamber over the line. Starting the game on Enda Lynn, he pushed forward in the latter stages and marshalled attack and defence, almost omnipresent as Steelstown ended their hurt. It typied the leadership he showed all season, and he was central also as Brian Oacutegs shook off what was historically their bogey team in Castledawson at the quarter final stage. The public feedback reflected the good will towards a man very few would begrudge a county championship medal. “He puts his head where you wouldnt put a sock,” said one respondent, while another simply said he was a brilliant leader. A further respondent said he was a real GAA man. “He does it all for his club, other clubs and schools all around Derry and still puts in big performances when it matters. Heart of a lion and wise beyond his years,” they said. A hugely important player for Hugh McGraths men, Forester will continue the search for silverware this weekend as Steelstown take on Moortown in the Ulster IFC final in Glen.

Young Intermediate Footballer of the Year  The young midfielders aerial prowess was key to the Brian Oacutegs effort. Pic by Mary K Burke. Donncha Gilmore  Its been quite a year for Donncha Gilmore. He picked up Ulster and All-Ireland titles with the Derry minors and ended the year with an intermediate championship medal. The midfielder belied his years with a series of confident, mature performances in a championship where seasoned giants are in plentul supply at centre field. With the county final in the melting pot, he rose to field the ball among a scattering of players, raising a roar from the crowd and lting his team mates. The Steelstown man was a popular choice throughout the public feedback, with his exploits in the Oakleaf jersey no doubt contributing. “He has been brilliant for Derry and Steelstown, an All-Ireland winner and a Derry championship winner, with more to come,” said one respondent. Another said he covered every blade of grass throughout the championship, while another – who was liberal with the blue and yellow heart emojis – said he was pure class. In a nod to the midfielders modesty and work ethic, another response said the young man has no idea just how good he is. Gilmore can look forward to Sundays Ulster IFC final as well, and will feature in manager Rory Gallaghers provisional squad for the upcoming season.

Pic by Philip Fitzpatrick Sportsfile. googletag.cmd.push Ciaran McFaul  If great players have everything in their locker, Ciaran McFaul probably needed a second one last season. The Glen talisman was imperious in the number  role into which Malachy ORourke moulded him in . In the biggest game of the year, the county final against Slaughtneil, he hammered over three points and dictated the game in the same manner he had done all season. That Donegal champions St Eunans set out to shut him down in their Ulster SFC clash in Letterkenny is a mark of just how influential McFaul has been. His name also dominated the responses to our online poll, with one respondent in particular waxing lyrical, saying McFall was arguably the greatest talent ever produced in Derry football. “What an absolute work horse he is on the field, any position that man turns the bolts in any match. He can read a game super and his dummies are without a doubt the best in Ulster,” said another. A further respondent said he redefined the number  role, while another quite simply said the centre back was pure class. Able to dictate play from deep, he has arrived on the end of attacks with perfect timing, while also performing his defensive duties with commitment.  Derry manager looking for continuity after stop-start tenure to date  Rory Gallagher said he was delighted to see theof the McKenna Cup.   Young Senior Footballer of the Year  Doherty in action against Kilcoo in the Ulster semi final. Pic by David Fitzgerald Sportsfile. Ethan Doherty  Ethan Doherty was still at school when the Covid pandemic started. Less than two years later, he helped Glen lt the John McLaughlin Cup for the first time. Stepping straight into the first team at both club and county level, the rise of the former St Patricks College captain has been meteoric. Every inch the modern wing back, his power, pace and ability to break the line have been a key part of Malachy ORourkes Glen machine. The GAA community in Derry have also been quick to recognise his precocious talent, and he was a hugely popular choice in our public feedback. Amid numerous goat emojis, one respondent suggested he could play anywhere, while another said his selection as Young Player of the Year was merely common sense. “The engine of Glens back line with constant running. He never gave up and always looked to drive the ball forward to create scoring opportunities,” said a further response. One particular respondent kept it simple, nominating him for the award because he roasts everyone. Doherty is a player with a big future, and, already performing at the highest level for both club and county, the possibilities seem almost endless.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

Derry had led from early in the game when Niall Loughlin gave them the lead after just three minutes, and points from debutant Lachlan Murray and Emmett Bradley saw the Oakleafers lead by - to - at half time. Monaghan sprung a number of changes, and had five made by the time Derry introduced Declan Cassidy in the th minute, with Miacutecheaacutel Bannigan contributing - off the bench. A nd minute free from Jack McCarron nudged the away side ahead, but Ethan Dohertys immediate response levelled matters again. With the game deep in injury time, Kieran Duffy found room and sent over what the Farney men must have thought was the winner. Doherty though, broke onto a Matthew Downey through ball and with the whites of Rory Beggans eyes in front of him, tucked it between the posts to ensure Derry started the season with a draw. *Full report, pictures and reaction in Tuesdays County Derry Post.

Pic by Mary K Burke.Reporter: Caoimhín Doherty Jan Email: sport@derrypost  addthis, Morgan Murray and Steelstown have their focus set on the club’s first ever Ulster intermediate final against Moortown at Glen on Sunday. googletag.cmd.push Steelstown are coming off the back of their first ever championship and they hope their support on the sideline will help them push on again and double their success. Murray admits his side will have to ‘dig deep’ against a strong team in what are likely to be tough conditions. “It’s evident after the county final that our fans played a big part in helping us over the line,” he said. “The support from them throughout the game was unbelievable and once that final whistle went, it was emotional celebrating with huge club figures who have been there so long. “It’s a special feeling having your family there on the day too, and when we got over the line, having them there made the victory that much sweeter.” Winning the county final was special, says Murray. Pic by Mary K Burke. The -year-old also added how he expects another big turnout despite the weather conditions. An All-Ireland semi final is the prize for the winners, but Morgan insists the ‘Oacutegs’ are not looking that far ahead. “We don’t like to get too far ahead of ourselves, we always just take it one game at a time,” he said. “Obviously,the situation comes that we’re in an All-Ireland semi final, we will be more than prepared, but at the minute, Moortown on Sunday is where our focus lies.” This is Morgan’s first year on the senior side after impressing last year with Steelstown’s reserve team. Murray admits it was a dficult campaign for himself last season with injuries and missing out on senior football. “I was training with the seniors but wasn’t getting to play with the seniors, so I was playing reserve football,” he said. “That was disappointing, and injuries didn’t help, but it just motivated me to push myself on to demand my place on the senior squad. “Reserve football gave me the opportunity to enjoy my football again. “And as I said, I was still in around the seniors, seeing how far they had gone having reached the final and seeing that togetherness, it gave me the drive to be part of it.”  CDP Team of the Year : Intermediate Football  We take a look at the players who made the final XV.   The left-footed forward’s drive and determination in last year’s campaign has landed him where he is today in the Steelstown senior squad. “Thankfully this year, my coaches have put a lot of faith in me and that’s pushing me to perform week in week out,” he said. “I’m very grateful to have had a big part in the team this year and winning the club’s first ever Championship is something that will stay with me forever.” The Pennyburn man has scored a championship total of - and earned his place in the County Derry Post’s Intermediate Team of the Year for  – alongside seven of his teammates. Going into the final, Moortown have an average of . points conceded per game while Steelstown sit at . points. The Derry men are typically big scorers in their games, but Morgan played down the signicance of the statistics. “I don’t think they’re relevant, to be honest,” he said. “It’s an Ulster championship final so anything can happen, but I’m confident that come the final whistle, we’ll have done enough to win the game.”  PREVIEW: Tyrone champions will be Ulster final favourites, says McGrath  Steelstown take on Moortown in Sundays intermediate decider.    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

Steelstown Brian Ogs are Ulster Intermediate champions!Second half comeback sees Brian Ogs overcome MoortownSteelstown Brian Ogs are Ulster Intermediate champions!Reporter: Gary Ferry Jan Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Moortown - Steelstown - Steelstown Brian Ogs are the Ulster Intermediate champions after a determined second half showing to overcome Moortown at Owenbeg. googletag.cmd.push Hugh McGraths team looked to be in some trouble as they managed just one single score in the entirety of the first half, and trailed -, - at the break, having struggled to get through Moortowns blanket defence. Peter Devlin hit each of Moortowns scores in that period, while Cahir McMonagle responded with Steelstowns first score on  minutes. But it was a frustrating first half for the Derry side who hit four wides as they struggled to replicate their usual free-scoring game. It required a dferent type of skill in the second half and when McMonagle struck again just nine minutes in, Brian Ogs had hope. Time continued to tick away but  minutes into the second period, McMonagle struck his third point, a real beauty to tie up the game at -, and the travelling Steelstown crowd sensed the title was there for the taking. With just minutes remaining, Emmet Deane first Steelstown into the lead for the first time, and when McMonagle hit his fourth point of the game soon after, the job was almost done. Con Heron fisted the ball over the bar for Moortowns first core of the second half to make it a one-point game again, but in the dying seconds McMonagle struck again, with the final whistle following shortly afterwards to confirm Steelstown Brian Ogs as the Ulster champions for the first time in the clubs history.    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

Steelstown Brian Ogs are Ulster Intermediate champions!Second half comeback sees Brian Ogs overcome MoortownSteelstown Brian Ogs are Ulster Intermediate champions!Reporter: Gary Ferry Jan Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Moortown - Steelstown - Steelstown Brian Ogs are the Ulster Intermediate champions after a determined second half showing to overcome Moortown at Owenbeg. googletag.cmd.push Hugh McGraths team looked to be in some trouble as they managed just one single score in the entirety of the first half, and trailed -, - at the break, having struggled to get through Moortowns blanket defence. Peter Devlin hit each of Moortowns scores in that period, while Cahir McMonagle responded with Steelstowns first score on  minutes. But it was a frustrating first half for the Derry side who hit four wides as they struggled to replicate their usual free-scoring game. It required a dferent type of skill in the second half and when McMonagle struck again just nine minutes in, Brian Ogs had hope. Time continued to tick away but  minutes into the second period, McMonagle struck his third point, a real beauty to tie up the game at -, and the travelling Steelstown crowd sensed the title was there for the taking. With just minutes remaining, Emmet Deane first Steelstown into the lead for the first time, and when McMonagle hit his fourth point of the game soon after, the job was almost done. Con Heron fisted the ball over the bar for Moortowns first core of the second half to make it a one-point game again, but in the dying seconds McMonagle struck again, with the final whistle following shortly afterwards to confirm Steelstown Brian Ogs as the Ulster champions for the first time in the clubs history.    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

Pic by Mary K Burke. Reporter: Gary Ferry Jan Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Sunday th January  is a day that Steelstown will never forget. The day that they became champions of Ulster for the first time in their history. googletag.cmd.push Just two and a half months after winning their first Derry championship, the men of Brian Oacuteg’s came through their toughest challenge yet to overcome a dogged Moortown by - to - at a packed Owenbeg. Having dispatched of Cloughaneely, Donaghmoyne and Butlersbridge in some style on their way to the provincial showpiece, this was a totally dferent game in which Steelstown where often frustrated and only led for the first time in the th minute but, by the final whistle, they didn’t care one bit.  As manager Hugh McGrath took in the scenes of blue and gold on the field afterwards, he said it was a special and unforgettable day for the people of Steelstown, and also paid tribute to the late Brian Oacuteg McKeever after whom the club is named. “We thought Derry champions sounded good, but Ulster champions certainly has a ring to it! When you put the hard work in that these lads have and you’ve had so many close calls and disappointments, to get over the line in something so close and so tight and so nervy – it just means even more. Steelstown as Ulster champions is one that will live in the memory for a long time,” he said. “All week leading up to it there was an excitement in the group about being in the final but the big thing we were saying was that we were so proud that Brian Oacuteg’s name was being mentioned on a provincial level and in some places on a national level. For us that’s huge. McGrath continued: “We all know in the city what he was about and why we’re named after him, but when you see the way we dug that out today – that’s Brian Oacuteg McKeever. That spirit is exactly what it was. “We’re really proud. Lots of teams say that they’re proud, but we are immensely proud of getting that name on the map and hopefully we can get it on the national stage and make even more people aware of that. Evenit’s just to get them interested and to find out why we’re called Brian Oacuteg’s – great – because that story needs to be told all over.” DREAM COME TRUE As Steelstown captain Neil Forester made his way up the steps of Owenbeg to collect the cup, the only words he could utter were ‘this is the stuff of dreams.’ “It hasn’t sunk in,” admitted Forester afterwards. “There was maybe huge relief and satisfaction after the county final, but this is a dferent level. “Getting out of Derry was such a big thing for us because we just hadn’t done it. I kept saying just get past Cloughaneely in the first round and then you get the ball rolling then you don’t know what can happen with the momentum. We were brilliant that day, but the crossbar still had to save us and maybe that was that little bit of luck we needed. “This team has just grown and grown. To win an Ulster title against a fantastic and dogged Moortown team in conditions that probably suited them and their defensive style is special.

Pic by Mary K Burke. Reporter: Gary Ferry Jan Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Sunday th January  is a day that Steelstown will never forget. The day that they became champions of Ulster for the first time in their history. googletag.cmd.push Just two and a half months after winning their first Derry championship, the men of Brian Oacuteg’s came through their toughest challenge yet to overcome a dogged Moortown by - to - at a packed Owenbeg. Having dispatched of Cloughaneely, Donaghmoyne and Butlersbridge in some style on their way to the provincial showpiece, this was a totally dferent game in which Steelstown where often frustrated and only led for the first time in the th minute but, by the final whistle, they didn’t care one bit.  As manager Hugh McGrath took in the scenes of blue and gold on the field afterwards, he said it was a special and unforgettable day for the people of Steelstown, and also paid tribute to the late Brian Oacuteg McKeever after whom the club is named. “We thought Derry champions sounded good, but Ulster champions certainly has a ring to it! When you put the hard work in that these lads have and you’ve had so many close calls and disappointments, to get over the line in something so close and so tight and so nervy – it just means even more. Steelstown as Ulster champions is one that will live in the memory for a long time,” he said. “All week leading up to it there was an excitement in the group about being in the final but the big thing we were saying was that we were so proud that Brian Oacuteg’s name was being mentioned on a provincial level and in some places on a national level. For us that’s huge. McGrath continued: “We all know in the city what he was about and why we’re named after him, but when you see the way we dug that out today – that’s Brian Oacuteg McKeever. That spirit is exactly what it was. “We’re really proud. Lots of teams say that they’re proud, but we are immensely proud of getting that name on the map and hopefully we can get it on the national stage and make even more people aware of that. Evenit’s just to get them interested and to find out why we’re called Brian Oacuteg’s – great – because that story needs to be told all over.” DREAM COME TRUE As Steelstown captain Neil Forester made his way up the steps of Owenbeg to collect the cup, the only words he could utter were ‘this is the stuff of dreams.’ “It hasn’t sunk in,” admitted Forester afterwards. “There was maybe huge relief and satisfaction after the county final, but this is a dferent level. “Getting out of Derry was such a big thing for us because we just hadn’t done it. I kept saying just get past Cloughaneely in the first round and then you get the ball rolling then you don’t know what can happen with the momentum. We were brilliant that day, but the crossbar still had to save us and maybe that was that little bit of luck we needed. “This team has just grown and grown. To win an Ulster title against a fantastic and dogged Moortown team in conditions that probably suited them and their defensive style is special. The fact that all those habits and the hard work that we put in has paid off. “It’s literally unbelievable. We were talking about getting our monkey off the back in Derry but once we did that we have just kicked on so much. I honestly don’t know what  to say.”   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

Reporter: Gary Ferry Jan Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Over the course of  years, I don’t think I’ve argued with anyone as much as I did with Sean O’Kane. googletag.cmd.push I mean, how can anyone seriously say to me that Jackie McNamara was a better footballer than Ryan Giggs  It was  and we were in the canteen of St. Columb’s College on the Buncrana Road, and he was adamant. One thing about Sean was that he was always passionate and he always stuck to his guns, eventhe truth was staring him right in the face. ‘I’m telling you Gary, he’s a far better player. Giggs is over-rated. And I’ll tell you another thing – any team that signs John Collins will win the Premier League.’ He actually said these words to me! Even now, when I’m trying to swallow the lump in my throat writing about my friend, I have to laugh and shake my head at that statement. John Collins went on to join Everton and he never, ever came near the Premier League title. We were both in our mid-teens, and the only thing that really mattered at that stage was football. This was the time of Oasis and Blur, where the internet didn’t exist, and your mood depended on how your team did at the weekend. Sean was Celtic through and through, just as I was Manchester United, and we rarely,ever, agreed on things on the pitch. I think it was the fact that we agreed on so many things off the pitch which ensured that we became friends. We were massive WWE fans, andwe weren’t lost in conversations about what Stone Cold Steve Austin did to Vince McMahon one week, we were laughing about what The Rock said the next week. We were proper wrestling geeks, a trait that connected us for  years after we left St. Columb’s, andever I needed to vent about anything wrestling-wise, Sean was the one to talk to. We also spent days, weeks and months playing football after school or during the summer holidays when his family moved to Fernabbey he, his brother Fergal, and sometimes his sisters Ciara and Eireann , would meet us all at the Youth Club in Lenamore and we would wile away the hours. At the weekend, it became more serious and we would go to the gravel pitches at the Sports Complex, before walking home together, barging and complaining and laughing the whole time. Sean was always an older head on younger shoulders. He consoled and talked me through my undying love for a teacher at St. Columb’s in those early years. Needless to say I am mortied looking back, but when I do look through my fingers at that cringeworthy period of my le, I remember Sean there, telling me she was a married woman and for me to wise up, in his own unique way of course. Oh and his coat! For some reason, his parents bought him this big warm winter coat, emblazoned with the Celtic crest. There’s nothing wrong with that, but for some utterly bizarre reason, on this coat designed for Baltic weather, the arms were detachable with a zip. I mean, why  That became the bane of Sean’s existence as we used to take off the arms and hide them and he would have to walk around school looking for them. But he loved that coat! Sean and I were also among the few in the school who, when we turned  – on the exact same day – refused to drink alcohol. I was never that interested and he was the same, but that lasted about as long as a Celtic title challenge these days as our other class mates – Colm McCloskey, Neal Sharkey, Paul McColgan, Gerard Grey and Piaras O’ Donaghalie got their hands on him. Before you knew it, Sean was living the le and living the hangovers, and that innocent -year-old teetotaller was lost to history. Le took us in dferent direction for a few years after that but it was Derry City FC which brought us back into the same circles. I was a junior reporter at the Derry News, and Stephen Kenny was taking the team places after years of struggle. Like any true Derry bandwagoner, Sean decided to come along and see what the fuss was about, bringing his good friend Damien Tracey along with him. The fact that his sister Ciara was playing for Derry City Ladies and dating Gareth McGlynn may have had something to do with it also. For a number of years, we would always meet at the games, and revel in a rich period for the Candystripes. It got to the stage that we went in on a bet together – Derry City to win - every game. I remember one such game, City were - up and won a penalty. Mark Farren stepped up to hit it and he missed! Sean was not amused, but luckily Liam Kearney headed one in late on and we were delighted, taking back everything we called Farrenso! I clicked so well with Sean, but I could never be as outspoken as him. He wasn’t shy in holding back his opinion and I always marvelled at that, simply because I couldn’t do it. I’m sure his colleagues and students at St. Joseph’s know what I’m talking about he was just so interesting, and he never failed to make me laugh with his witty observations and devastating putdowns. The fact that both Damien and Sean are gone now weighs heavily on me. I was driving on Saturday evening and it struck me how I wouldn’t hear Sean’s voice again, or read his texts when he would be calling Scott Brown a fraud or Neil Lennon a joke, or venting about whoever had annoyed him that particular week. Sean was able to accompany me to the Brandywell twice last year, for games against Shamrock Rovers and Drogheda United, and I’m so glad that happened. I know he enjoyed those games, and I enjoyed his company, and we laughed about the stupid things as we always did. I can’t claim to be Sean’s best friend, and I don’t knowhe would describe me as a friend or an acquaintance, but the fact that I could always text him about stupid stuff was something I always appreciated. I was on the periphery of his le in the sense that I didn’t go out with him or wasn’t party to his struggles as he fought, fought and fought his battles, but I have always considered him a friend, and I am so damn sad that he has gone. I’m in this job nearly  years and still I would be asking him to correct my headlines andthis or that sentence was grammatically correct. He was a self-proclaimed ‘Grammar grump’, as am I, which brings up another memory. We were in Wexford for the  League Cup final, and in the bar for the celebrations afterwards, another friend of mines looked on agog, as Sean and I complained about people’s grammar. It was ridiculous, but that’s what we were like together. Football, WWE and grammar. I know Sean was so well thought of at St. Joseph’s, at Tristar, and far beyond both in local circles. We were born on the exact same day – March ,  – and maybe that’s the reason I always felt so strongly linked to him. But we were linked by much more than our date of birth, and for that I am appreciative and for that I’ll remember him forever. Others can tell better stories and others will have been much closer to Sean than I was, and I can only imagine what they’re feeling today. Those students who have paid tribute to him on Facebook had a wonderful teacher – not just someone who knew the dference between a comma and an apostrophe, but who was willing to talk to them, to tell them stories, to give them advice, to connect with them on a human level. That kind of teacher is not so easy to find, believe me. Those students are the lucky ones. His best friends, who spent so many hours with him in good times and bad, are the lucky ones, His family, who were with him every step of the way, who made him laugh, who made him strong, who cared and consoled and supported him in those hard, hard days – they are the lucky ones. To have known him at all, makes me a lucky one. It is so hard to say goodbye to you Sean, so I won’t. Instead I’ll say thank you, so much, for arguing with me all those years and for making me laugh so often. And for the record – it took him  years, but he did eventually admit that he was wrong about Jackie McNamara. Better late than never. The page is blurry now as I write these final lines with tears in my eyes, but I’m pretty sure Sean is reading over this shaking his head at any spelling or grammar mistakes I must surely have made. I would expect nothing less from one of the best people I ever knew. Thank you for everything Sean. Until we meet again.

Reporter: Gary Ferry Jan Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Over the course of  years, I don’t think I’ve argued with anyone as much as I did with Sean O’Kane. googletag.cmd.push I mean, how can anyone seriously say to me that Jackie McNamara was a better footballer than Ryan Giggs  It was  and we were in the canteen of St. Columb’s College on the Buncrana Road, and he was adamant. One thing about Sean was that he was always passionate and he always stuck to his guns, eventhe truth was staring him right in the face. ‘I’m telling you Gary, he’s a far better player. Giggs is over-rated. And I’ll tell you another thing – any team that signs John Collins will win the Premier League.’ He actually said these words to me! Even now, when I’m trying to swallow the lump in my throat writing about my friend, I have to laugh and shake my head at that statement. John Collins went on to join Everton and he never, ever came near the Premier League title. We were both in our mid-teens, and the only thing that really mattered at that stage was football. This was the time of Oasis and Blur, where the internet didn’t exist, and your mood depended on how your team did at the weekend. Sean was Celtic through and through, just as I was Manchester United, and we rarely,ever, agreed on things on the pitch. I think it was the fact that we agreed on so many things off the pitch which ensured that we became friends. We were massive WWE fans, andwe weren’t lost in conversations about what Stone Cold Steve Austin did to Vince McMahon one week, we were laughing about what The Rock said the next week. We were proper wrestling geeks, a trait that connected us for  years after we left St. Columb’s, andever I needed to vent about anything wrestling-wise, Sean was the one to talk to. We also spent days, weeks and months playing football after school or during the summer holidays when his family moved to Fernabbey he, his brother Fergal, and sometimes his sisters Ciara and Eireann , would meet us all at the Youth Club in Lenamore and we would wile away the hours. At the weekend, it became more serious and we would go to the gravel pitches at the Sports Complex, before walking home together, barging and complaining and laughing the whole time. Sean was always an older head on younger shoulders. He consoled and talked me through my undying love for a teacher at St. Columb’s in those early years. Needless to say I am mortied looking back, but when I do look through my fingers at that cringeworthy period of my le, I remember Sean there, telling me she was a married woman and for me to wise up, in his own unique way of course. Oh and his coat! For some reason, his parents bought him this big warm winter coat, emblazoned with the Celtic crest. There’s nothing wrong with that, but for some utterly bizarre reason, on this coat designed for Baltic weather, the arms were detachable with a zip. I mean, why  That became the bane of Sean’s existence as we used to take off the arms and hide them and he would have to walk around school looking for them. But he loved that coat! Sean and I were also among the few in the school who, when we turned  – on the exact same day – refused to drink alcohol. I was never that interested and he was the same, but that lasted about as long as a Celtic title challenge these days as our other class mates – Colm McCloskey, Neal Sharkey, Paul McColgan, Gerard Grey and Piaras O’ Donaghalie got their hands on him. Before you knew it, Sean was living the le and living the hangovers, and that innocent -year-old teetotaller was lost to history. Le took us in dferent direction for a few years after that but it was Derry City FC which brought us back into the same circles. I was a junior reporter at the Derry News, and Stephen Kenny was taking the team places after years of struggle. Like any true Derry bandwagoner, Sean decided to come along and see what the fuss was about, bringing his good friend Damien Tracey along with him. The fact that his sister Ciara was playing for Derry City Ladies and dating Gareth McGlynn may have had something to do with it also. For a number of years, we would always meet at the games, and revel in a rich period for the Candystripes. It got to the stage that we went in on a bet together – Derry City to win - every game. I remember one such game, City were - up and won a penalty. Mark Farren stepped up to hit it and he missed! Sean was not amused, but luckily Liam Kearney headed one in late on and we were delighted, taking back everything we called Farrenso! I clicked so well with Sean, but I could never be as outspoken as him. He wasn’t shy in holding back his opinion and I always marvelled at that, simply because I couldn’t do it. I’m sure his colleagues and students at St. Joseph’s know what I’m talking about he was just so interesting, and he never failed to make me laugh with his witty observations and devastating putdowns. The fact that both Damien and Sean are gone now weighs heavily on me. I was driving on Saturday evening and it struck me how I wouldn’t hear Sean’s voice again, or read his texts when he would be calling Scott Brown a fraud or Neil Lennon a joke, or venting about whoever had annoyed him that particular week. Sean was able to accompany me to the Brandywell twice last year, for games against Shamrock Rovers and Drogheda United, and I’m so glad that happened. I know he enjoyed those games, and I enjoyed his company, and we laughed about the stupid things as we always did. I can’t claim to be Sean’s best friend, and I don’t knowhe would describe me as a friend or an acquaintance, but the fact that I could always text him about stupid stuff was something I always appreciated. I was on the periphery of his le in the sense that I didn’t go out with him or wasn’t party to his struggles as he fought, fought and fought his battles, but I have always considered him a friend, and I am so damn sad that he has gone. I’m in this job nearly  years and still I would be asking him to correct my headlines andthis or that sentence was grammatically correct. He was a self-proclaimed ‘Grammar grump’, as am I, which brings up another memory. We were in Wexford for the  League Cup final, and in the bar for the celebrations afterwards, another friend of mines looked on agog, as Sean and I complained about people’s grammar. It was ridiculous, but that’s what we were like together. Football, WWE and grammar. I know Sean was so well thought of at St. Joseph’s, at Tristar, and far beyond both in local circles. We were born on the exact same day – March ,  – and maybe that’s the reason I always felt so strongly linked to him. But we were linked by much more than our date of birth, and for that I am appreciative and for that I’ll remember him forever. Others can tell better stories and others will have been much closer to Sean than I was, and I can only imagine what they’re feeling today. Those students who have paid tribute to him on Facebook had a wonderful teacher – not just someone who knew the dference between a comma and an apostrophe, but who was willing to talk to them, to tell them stories, to give them advice, to connect with them on a human level. That kind of teacher is not so easy to find, believe me. Those students are the lucky ones. His best friends, who spent so many hours with him in good times and bad, are the lucky ones, His family, who were with him every step of the way, who made him laugh, who made him strong, who cared and consoled and supported him in those hard, hard days – they are the lucky ones. To have known him at all, makes me a lucky one. It is so hard to say goodbye to you Sean, so I won’t. Instead I’ll say thank you, so much, for arguing with me all those years and for making me laugh so often. And for the record – it took him  years, but he did eventually admit that he was wrong about Jackie McNamara. Better late than never. The page is blurry now as I write these final lines with tears in my eyes, but I’m pretty sure Sean is reading over this shaking his head at any spelling or grammar mistakes I must surely have made. I would expect nothing less from one of the best people I ever knew. Thank you for everything Sean. Until we meet again.

Festival organisers plan to give out the honours at an in-person event in the coastal Calornia town on March  . The eight actors singled out for the award also include newcomers, such as Saniyya Sidney, who plays Venus Williams in King Richard, and Coda’s Emilia Jones and Troy Kotsur, as well as more familiar faces, including Simon Rexand Dornan. The event, hosted by TCM’s Dave Karger, will include discussions with the talent – which could for some be a stop on the road to the Oscars on March . Karger said the honorees are “integral parts of the season’s most exciting and emotional films”. Previous recipients have included Zendaya, Riz Ahmed and Awkwafina. The long-running film festival, now in its th year, regularly attracts more than , attendees to the idyllic town for films,  and tributes. The full line-up for the early March gathering will be unveiled in February. Organisers are planning for the -day event to be in-person come March , although Covid concerns have once again disrupted many early-year film and awards season events. Last week saw the cancellation of the Palm Springs International Film Festival, which was set to start this week, and the Sundance Film Festival announced this week that it would pivot to a virtual festival. Both the Academy’s Governors Awards and the Critics Choice Awards were postponed from their mid-January dates as well.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

Festival organisers plan to give out the honours at an in-person event in the coastal Calornia town on March  . The eight actors singled out for the award also include newcomers, such as Saniyya Sidney, who plays Venus Williams in King Richard, and Coda’s Emilia Jones and Troy Kotsur, as well as more familiar faces, including Simon Rexand Dornan. The event, hosted by TCM’s Dave Karger, will include discussions with the talent – which could for some be a stop on the road to the Oscars on March . Karger said the honorees are “integral parts of the season’s most exciting and emotional films”. Previous recipients have included Zendaya, Riz Ahmed and Awkwafina. The long-running film festival, now in its th year, regularly attracts more than , attendees to the idyllic town for films,  and tributes. The full line-up for the early March gathering will be unveiled in February. Organisers are planning for the -day event to be in-person come March , although Covid concerns have once again disrupted many early-year film and awards season events. Last week saw the cancellation of the Palm Springs International Film Festival, which was set to start this week, and the Sundance Film Festival announced this week that it would pivot to a virtual festival. Both the Academy’s Governors Awards and the Critics Choice Awards were postponed from their mid-January dates as well.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

So punctual in fact that East Down ACrsquos Sharon Madine missed the start of that race and so she talked herself into doing the K as penance.There were  starters with plenty of quality runners at the front of the pack, who were obviously there to do more than merely run off the turkey.The top five men broke  minutes with Gerard Heaney of North Belfast Harriers taking the win in ..The fastest female was Dearbhla Cox of Annadale Striders in ..

East Down AC had four runners, all female and as mentioned, Sharon Madine was only there by default.Having got lost en-route and failed to get to the K start, she felt that the only way to save face was to run the K.She actually ran very well and in the end was happy to have doubled her exercise goal for the day. Her time of . placed her as th female out of  and was not that far off her personal best.This is impressive since she prefers K to K and also that she arrived with no intention of racing that distance.In addition the blustery conditions were not ideal for chasing times. Alison and Ella Carroll opted for the K over the K based on the later start and the chance of a lie in.It turned out that the rain had also eased by then so it was a good call. Alison ran a well paced race and was as pleased with her consistent splits as she was with her time of ..Ella has not fitted much training in as of late but with characteristic grit she ploughed on to the finish in a time of ..Mags Flynn slipped across the line between these two in a very respectable ..It was a well organised event with adequate parking and toilets. All entrants received a t-shirt and medal and even the poor weather did not detract from the smug feeling of achievement for those who turned out. Kudos to Glenn Grant for his efforts to make this happen.Meanwhile closer to home, the rain had cleared early on to give a bright mild day. Gordy Graham was out for the Burren Townland ten miler and said it was almost too warm.The contrast in the photos of this compared to the Belfast meet is marked. Gordy had a great race and took the win by a clear margin in a time of . but he was keen to point out that his closest adversary, Brendan Heaney, was denied the chance to race it out when he took an unfortunate tumble.Gordy had the good grace to help his rival up but it seemed that the fall took its toll and Brendan never really got back on track.He did hold on to second place but he was four minutes behind Gordy in the end. Another podium for Gordy to end a successful year. It was no surprise to find that Niall Gibney was in the mountains on Boxing Day.However, this time instead of a solo escapade, he had signed up for the annual Turkey trot organised by BARF .This arduous run started at Meelmore Lodge then headed up the lane to the Mourne Wall. The climbing continued up to Trassey Track Ford and then up to the Bernagh-Meelmore col.Niall said that the paths were like mini streams after the deluge on Christmas Day and he described the river crossing below the col as ldquointeresting.To others that probably means practically impassable but the runners toiled on finally reaching Meelmore-Meelbeg Saddle.Our intrepid mountain man reported that, ldquoFrom here the brakes were off and it was a fun fast slippery downhill to the Happy Valley. A further treacherous stretch took them along the Mourne Way back to the lane to Meelmore Lodge.A run like this requires agility as well as stamina, so not all would be fit for the challenge and indeed it was a select field of  who set out.

The High School Ballynahinch made its car park available for parking,Premier Traffic Systems lent some traffic cones and Stephen Wilson, of Truck and Plant Elex, volunteered to lead the tractors with his van.Permission to hold the run was obtained from the Parades Commission.ldquoTuesday morning came and to be honest we had no idea how many would turn up, Mr McCormick said. ldquoWe were hoping for  or at best , but it soon became clear we were in for a busy day.ldquoRegistration was at am, but the first batch of tractors, all the way from Ballywalter, arrived at ..

It will give the town a new Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant and a health food outlet.Newcastle SDLP councillor, Mr Michael Boyd, said he ldquodeplored and regretted the decision to allow another two carry-outs.However, he appreciate the dficulty of the plannersrsquo position in that the two applications were received before a strategy existed and viewed the formulation of the strategy as the ldquolesser of two evils.ldquoNow the planners have agreed to a strategy to by known as the Newcastle enhancement strategy, in response to our concerns and questions, said Mr Boyd.DOWNPATRICK ndash The Gallows Hill area in Downpatrick is to be brought into public ownership, it has been revealed this week.Local SDLP MP, Mr Eddie McGrady, has announced that the Department of Environment has approved an application from Down District Council to upgrade one of the most historic sites in the town.ldquoI am pleased to announce that the Department has approved the councilrsquos application for open space grant which will entail grant up to  per cent of the purchase cost of land needed for passive recreation, said the South Down MP.ldquoThe Downpatrick Regeneration Project has also included an environmental improvement scheme at Gallows Hill in its submission for financial aid under the CRISP programme.ldquoI welcome these developments and hope that the area will eventually be upgraded and regenerated.DUNDRUM ndash Police believe two recent fires at Dundrum schools were caused by the same person.Detectives investigated malicious blazes as both Downshire and the Sacred Heart Primary Schools say the evidence points to the same person and they have appealed for information from the public.A Dundrum man, who was detained for questioning about the Sacred Heart blaze, has been released without charge.That latest fire occurred at the Sacred Heart primary on December  and came less than one wek after an arson attack caused damage estimated at over pound, at Downshire primary.Damage to the Sacred Heart school was confined to the assembly hall after residents spotted the blaze at around pm. The Fire Brigade managed to extinguish the fire before it caused serious damage, although one fireman at the scene said the floor and curtains were burning fiercely.The fire was started after someone entered the school through a skylight of the flat-roofed building. A bale of straw, which had been used for the schoolrsquos nativity scene and which was due to be taken away the next day, was used to start the fire.CASTLEWARD ndash Work is underway to restore the historic corn mill at Castleward to its former glory.The wheels of the th century mill, which were last used  years ago, should be back in operation next summer thanks to a pound, restoration project.The mill has not been in operation since the estate was sold by the Bangor family to the National Trust. However, a team of experts is currently bringing the mill back to working order and recreating what was once an essential part of estate le.The project is being co-ordinated by Dr Fred Hamond, a freelance industrial archaeologist, who outlined some of the history of the mill, beginning from when the strong ties of Strangford Lough were harnessed to turn the wheels.ldquoIt dates back to the s and was initially a tide mill. It was rebuilt in the early s on the same site, but instead of using the tide, it was powered by the force of the river, he said.Much work is needed before the mill is readily to grind corn once again.ldquoThe place was in a terrible condition and we have had to carry out a major cleaning job, Dr Hammond explained.Even so, the surroundings more than make up for the dirty conditions.ldquoIt has been lovely working here, even during the winter. We have an impressive wildfowl collection close at hand and the mill is situated beside the old farmyard and the original castle, he added.BALLYNAHINCH ndash The first phase of a pound, construction project at St Patrickrsquos Roman Catholic Church in Ballynahinch will get underway later this year.Work on a new parish centre in the grounds of the church is earmarked to begin in the spring.The two-storey building, which replaces the existing tin structure close to the nearly cemetery, will comprise a main hall to be used for parish s and indoor sports, a secondary hall, committee rooms, cloakrooms, kitchen and toilets.The second stage of the project ndash a major extension of the church which will increase its seating capacity to  ndash is expected to begin a completion of the first phase next year.Ballynahinch parish priest, Canon Bernard Smyth, said services will be held in the parish centre while the extension work is carried out.DOWN HIGH ndash Memories of almost  years at Down High School flooded back to Mrs Eleanor Carlisle when she was deluged with gts to mark her retirement as senior administrative officer.It was quite a day for her when she was the guest of the headmaster, Mr Jack Ferris, and staff at their Christmas lunch at the Millbrook Lodge Hotel, Ballynahinch.It was her first and only job.

Registration had opened months in advance and entries sold out in record time, a clear indication that this race has become a firm favourite for the elite and the not so elite runner.For most, it is the sense of turning up on the day not knowing what to expect. The race has two unique selling points.Firstly, you have to run with a partner and you are only ever as good as your other half.Many alliances come unstuck on the hills and in the mud and friendships are often lost, regained and lost again as the race unfolds.Secondly, and perhaps more uniquely, only a select few know the course in advance and they are sworn to secrecy.This is unusual in that most of us go to a race knowing what to expect in terms of distance, terrain and elevation: not so with this one.The only information is that it begins and ends in Castlewellan and it is between eight-and-a-half and nine miles .The course this year was a very tightly guarded secret with only those entrusted to assist with the marking on the eve of the race getting any real insight.When asked to describe the course, the Prophet simply stated: lsquoit will stun the legs and play with the headrsquo.These words rang in my head as I ran around fields that I never expected to, climbed hills that I never climbed before and at one point,my eyesight is not failing, saw Sherpa Tenzing throwing down ropes and herding a cabinet of yaks.At the business end of proceeding, there was some real class on parade with Irish mountain running sensation Zak Hannapaired with Andrew Annett , a man in great form as evidenced by his superb win in the Armagh Ten.This international pairing with real climbing pedigree firmly lived up to their billing as odds-on favourites and were almost three minutes ahead of their nearest challengers, the youthful pairing of Jared Martinand Tom Crudgington .With many years of running ahead, both these young men are capable of winning the race in the not-too-distant future.The podium was completed by the last minute pairing of Jonny Scottand Aaron McGrady , who hooked up on the morning of the event due to late withdrawals.The chemistry was clearly good and the partnership worked as they came home in just over  minutes ndash  seconds adrt of Martin and Crudgington.The ladiesrsquo race was a tighter affair with Amanda Perry and Denise Logue from Ballydrain winning by  seconds from Dearbhla Coxand Niamh Donnelly .The podium was completed by Clair Quigley and Fiona McQuillan .The mixed team event is always closely fought and this year was no dferent. With a mile to go to the finish, eventual winners Aidan Brownand Nakita Burkewere still under pressure from Stephen Connolly and Caitlyn Harvey from North Down AC.However, in the final twists and turns the former prevailed and ran out winners by around a minute, finishing eighth and tenth overall respectively.The podium was completed by Neil McGeough, Newcastlersquos rising star, and his partner, Irish Olympian Kerry OrsquoFlaherty, an athlete more at home on the track and over barriers than climbing ditches.Throughout the field there was great camaraderie and the craic was mighty. Social media was buzzing after the race with participants commenting that this was the best course they had ever ran over, despite the numerous challenges that it presented.The race organisers are indebted to everyone, too many to mention inidually, who contributed in any way to the success of the event.It brought great joy to those taking part and spectating at a time when anything that improves our well-being is something to celebrate..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5_January2022_Down.jpg","title":"McCartan hopes for dream start back at the helm  ","story":"DOWN manager James McCartan will be looking for a dream start to hisat the helm this Friday when his Mourne side take on Donegal in the first round of the Dr McKenna Cup.The red and black outfit will travel to MacCumhail Park for a .pm throw-in, in what will be the first piece of action for the county this year.The ing fan favourite will not be under any illusions as to the level of stf competition his footballers will face off against, as they travel to the home of last yearrsquos Ulster semi-finalists.Antrim are the other outfit that make up Section A, with Down welcoming the Saffrons to Newry in their second game next Tuesday.McCartan has already faced adversities in his second stint as boss before his team have even lined out, due to a number of regular Mourne players ruled out of contention.Carryduff duo James Guinness and Owen McCabe, Bryansford shot-stopper Marc Reid and experienced Burren duo Gerard McGovern and Donal OrsquoHare are among those unavailable.The former All-Star man in charge, alongside assistant Aidan OrsquoRourke, have already began drafting in suitable replacements and have recently been given a notable boost in the form of ing former captain Niall McParland.The Glenn clubman has ed following three years teaching in Doha, Qatar, and will be someone who McCartan looks to in order to bring his wealth of experience to the rest of the side ndashespecially those who are up and coming talents.ldquoThe squad has changed but itrsquos good to see some new faces in the , said McParland.ldquoJames and Aidan have a handle on everyone in the county and they have a good squad together so far.ldquoI was happy to get the call to go back because I didnrsquot knowI would get it ndash I donrsquot take anything for granted, he continued.ldquoNow Irsquom fighting for my place in the team.Alongside this encouraging news for the county, current star Barry OrsquoHagan believes Down could benefit even further from an influx of Kilcoo players.However, the current champions of Down are currently hoping to retain their Ulster title when they face off against Derrygonnelly on January , which will see them out of action until things unfold.With this meaning they will not be available for selection for the Dr McKenna Cup, this doesnrsquot necessarily rule out some of the  featuring in the Division Two league campaign.ldquoAt the minute, therersquos probably eight or nine of them you would definitely want in, said OrsquoHagan.ldquoWhether they commit or not I donrsquot know, itrsquos up to those men, but you need the talent and the experience those boys have.ldquoObviously their full focus is on Kilcoo at the minute, as yoursquod expect..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5_January2022_TableTennis.jpg","title":"Owenbeg are on title march  ","story":"IT was an early Christmas present for Owenbeg with a double win over St Johnrsquos to keep their Division One title hopes on track.The current league champions still have three outstanding matches with league leaders Banbridge, so it is still all to play for in this ision.In Division Two, Drumaness kept their title hopes alive with their win over St Johnrsquos.

He also taught commercial subjects like arithmetic and bookkeeping, for use in commerce and industry.Dr Neilson and his clergymen sons were notable for their warm cross-denominational outlook.Fr Luke Walsh, PP in North Antrim, near Ballycastle, spoke highly of his old Kilmore tutor: ldquoI was educated by a Presbyterian clergyman, a man of as great moral worth and sterling integrity as Ireland could boast of.In , as Bishop of Down and Dromore, William Crolly described Rev James Neilson of Downpatrick as ldquoone of the most liberal and respected clergymen in Co Down.Around  Moses began compiling an Irish grammar, later assisted by his son William. In their pursuit of Irish studies, the two Neilsons collaborated with Patrick Lynch, principal of a distinguished Irish and Classical academy in Loughinisland, six miles away.In March  William Neilson was installed as minister of Dundalk Presbyterian Church. This was a perfect fit for his developing academic interests. Attached to the Dundalk congregation was a colony of Gaelic-speaking Scots Presbyterians living in Ballymascanlon.Originally from Argylle, they had fought for King William in . Hence it was a standing requirement that the congregationrsquos clergy be fluent in Irish.William thrived in Dundalk. In the late s Irish was still the first language with large parts of the population in Down and Louth . He preached widely in Irish. In July  he went on a preaching tour of Ulster, achieving wide popularity.RebellionBack in Co Down, and during the  Rebellion period, his preaching activities on one occasion brought him into collision with the military authorities. His father was actually Moderator in the year of the Rising.Dr Moses needed permission from General Nugent to hold the General Synodin Lurgan that August. One Sunday in  his son William was invited back to his fatherrsquos church, to preach in Irish. The event generated considerable interest, and the church was packed.The authorities were nervous in the wake of the rebellion and news of this unusually large assembly soon reached official ears.Halfway through the sermon a party of yeomen entered the church. With no space left to seat them, they occupied the twin staircases leading up to the pulpit. When William had finished preaching they promptly arrested him, and seized theof his sermon.The soldiers involved were likely from the Kilmore Yeomanry. Their Lieutenant at the time was Charles Hamilton, William Strain of Kilmore was a sergeant, and Patrick Soy of \"Tollinagrew\" a private.They marched William all the way to Down Gaol in Downpatrick, newly opened on the Mall in  . Their arrival likely caused some consternation with the Gaol Governor, because the Neilson clergy were widely known to be loyal to the Crown.Rev William bailed by Rev JamesScrambling to smooth over this military faux pas, the Governor sent across town for James Neilson, brother of the prisoner, and minister of the nearby Stream Street Presbyterian congregation. The Rev William was then bailed into the custody of the Rev James,with instructions to appear in court next day.Next morning the magistrate encountered a dficulty mdash he couldnrsquot understand the manuscript of Williamrsquos sermon, preached in Irish the day before. William helpfully offered to translate. It transpired the contents were innocuous, and the prisoner was promptly released. The details of this intriguing episode were recorded a century later by a Neilson descendant .Academic careerIn Dundalk William ran a Classical and mercantile academy similar to his fatherrsquos. In an astonishing burst of creativity, he continued to develop his skills as a linguist.In  he published Greek exercises in syntax, ellipsis, dialects, prosody and metaphrasis. In recognition of this, Glasgow University awarded him an honorary DD in . In  he was elected Presbyterian Moderator. In  he published Introduction to the Irish language, on the basis of which he was elected MRIA in .There were a number of advantages in learning Irish, William explained. For academics, it gave essential insights into other European languages. And for the wider population, it enabled competent communication with those large sections of the population whose first language was still Irish.In contemporary Ireland, he asserted, clergymen, lawyers and farmers could not conduct their business properly without a knowledge of Irish.Paradoxically, the subjects taught in schools run by the Neilson clergy, and others, eventually undermined the use of Irish nationally. The Industrial Revolution was in full swing, and employment opportunities in industry and commerce were exploding.For those without a knowledge of English, Irish-only fluency was becoming an overwhelming disadvantage. When the new national school system was instituted in Ireland in , teachers knew that English was now the essential passport to wider employment.The great Daniel OrsquoConnell ruefully acknowledged the new reality. ldquoAlthough the language is associated with many recollections that twine round the hearts of Irishmen, yet the superior utility of the English tongue, as the medium of all modern communication is so great, that I can witness, without a sigh, the gradual disuse of Irish.At that time there were a number of ieties of Irish, but under the new dispensation the vernacular spoken in East Ulster eventually became extinct. Fortunately William Neilson preserved many Co Down examples in his  Grammar. In the words of his descendant Joseph Nelson, Williamrsquos ldquodialogues and familiar phrases, which form the second part, are a complete guide to the ideas as well as the phrases of the peasantry.Untimely deathIn  William was appointed professor of classical languages and Hebrew at the Belfast Academical Institution. In April  he was elected professor of Classics at Glasgow University. However, he had contracted rheumatic fever, and died on the th of that month, aged only . He was buried in the family vault close to the west gable of his fatherrsquos church in Rademon.A full colour pamphlet based on this article has been produced by Rowallane and Slieve Croob Community Group, to accompany Joyce Gibsonrsquos ongoing Irish language classes in Ballynahinch Market House..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5January2022_LinenHall.jpg","title":"Tributes to former chief librarian at Linen Hall Library who was also decorated Gaelic player  ","story":"A LOUGHINISLAND man who was the custodian of some of Northern Irelandrsquos most precious books and written history will be buried tomorrow.The former chief librarian of Belfastrsquos Linen Hall Library, John Killen was hailed as a ldquogentleman and friend to all after he died peacefully at his home on Sunday.A respected author, historian and former Gaelic footballer, Mr Killen was aged .He had worked at Irelandrsquos oldest and last subion library for  years and became friends with some of its most regular visitors, such as the poet Seamus Heaney, writers Sam Hanna Bell, John Hewitt, Joseph Tomelty and the artist Padraic Woods.Mr Killen retired in January , after taking up his first role as an Irish reference librarian at the Linen Hall in .He was known for continuing the work of a former colleague, Jimmy Vitty, by establishing an extensive political papers section of posters, prisonersrsquo books and records from the Maze Long Kesh.The collection houses more than , separate items and is now used by academics and students from across the world.Among the many books written by Mr Killen was the story of the  year-old library, along with the Irish Christmas Book and The Unkindest Cut: A Cartoon History of Ulster -, as well as books on the Irish famine and the United Irishmen.One of his most recent books was The St Patrickrsquos Treasury, a celebration of the myths, legends and traditions of Irelandrsquos patron saint who is buried in the grounds of Down Cathedral.Mr Killen was also highly regarded as a county hurler and Gaelic footballer who won championship medals, having played for his home club Loughinisland, Downpatrickrsquos RGU and Queenrsquos.Loughinisland GAC said on social media the club was ldquodevastated to learn of Mr Killenrsquos death who had also been a member and secretary in .He won two championship medals with the club in  and .Mr Killen, who was reared in Saul, started as a Gaelic footballer with RGU.He won several Minor championships medals for the Downpatrick side, including leading them to victory over Loughinisland in the SFC final in .Queenrsquos GAA remembered on social media how Mr Killen was a former Sigerson Cup player from - and was also part of the first All-Ireland Freshers winning team in .The Linen Hall Library shared its reaction to the sad news on social media.It said of its former head: ldquoJohn joined the Library in  and dedicated the next  years to this institution.

It is at the core of my lsquoI Am Womanrsquo Arts and Cultural Programme.She added: ldquoI am focused on promoting all forms of equality and ersity in Northern Ireland.The I Am Woman programme was first launched at Parliament Buildings, Stormont, in September and was attended by MLAs and VIPs.But Lisersquos work is not just focused at reaching the ear of politicians.She said: ldquoMy personal agenda is more about reaching out and spreading the necessity for equality, in all formats. In all walks of our society, from both a ground level up and top down.ldquoI feel that we all have a moral responsibility, when it comes to supporting and promoting female, and other, equality here in Northern Ireland. Forwe donrsquot work together, then nothing changes.ldquoMy programmes are embracing, not preaching. They aim to break down the dferences we have as a society by promoting better knowledge, tolerance and understanding.ldquoThe laws that govern us all, especially those written in relation to females, do definitely need to change for equality to happen.She continued: ldquoWe, as a society, also have to encourage change from the ground level up. Educating our young people and changing adult preconceived perceptions are also so important.ldquoBoys and girls, men and women. We are all iniduals who should be treated fairly and equally. By law, and by society in general.ldquoIt is therefore important to engage and stand up for change now. Otherwise, females will continue to be treated as second class citizens in Northern Ireland, for generations to come.ldquoBoth males and females have so much to give our society. In order for a fairer, more democratic society to exist. Females should always be treated equally at all levels.Lise added: ldquoAfter all, it is women who make up the majority of the adult population in this country.This is Lisersquos third project to be showcased at Parliament Buildings.Any school or business interested in hosted Lisersquos exhibitions and or workshops should email LiseMcGreevyPhotographic@gmail..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/13364734.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Henry McDonald writes: \"Millions of others in Oz have stoically put up with the emergency health measures in their country for nearly two years. Why should the world’s greatest tennis player be treated any dferent from anyone  \" As someone with a compromised immune system, on eight tablets per day and only ten per cent of my stomach left after le-saving surgeryI was advised by my heart and oncology consultants to avoid any exposure to the pandemic.For nearly two years I swerved Coronavirus by adhering strictly to lockdown rules, wearing a mask when out, isolating, social distancing etc. When the welcome vaccines arrived, I readily embraced them and am now tripled jabbed. Anda fourth vaccine is offered and deemed essential to combat further spread of the disease, I will happily stick out my arm and get jagged.Despite all these precautions and the vaccinations, I finally succumbed to the virus over the New Year albeit of the Omicron iety. After emerging from seven days of pandemic purdah I can report that this strain was not as debilitating as the previous ones that have killed more than a million people around the world while seriously affecting the health of millions of others.The infection began with a burst of chills spreading all over the body leaving my frame shaking slightly for  hours. Then my throat started to scratch and ache while my nose ran repeatedly for under a week. Yet that was it. The worst symptoms of the infection petered out within a couple of days and the whole experience felt like a bad case of a winter cold not even flu. I have no doubt that having the booster jab back in November helped me quickly get over the Omicron virus.It was a mixed picture inside our bubble at home in Belfast: my sister tested negative throughout while her partner also caught the virus. His symptoms were even milder than mine and he too was triple vaccinated ahead of Omicron’s arrival.As for the source of our infections there were a host of potential viral triggers ranging from one friend who is unvaccinated to the disturbingly high number of peopleunmasked on a Glider journey from my partner’s house in Ballyhackamore into the city centre just after Christmas.Meanwhile my eldest daughter was felled by the virus shortly after Boxing Day in Australia her younger sister had been one of the early casualties of the first coronavirus wave which engulfed her Glasgow University student halls of residence back in the autumn of .Regarding the older daughter it is worth pointing out that she and her friends were caught in one of the most stringent lockdowns in the world in Melbourne for months on end. Despite the tight strictures on their lives in that shut down ‘Down Under’ they regarded it as necessary. They endured. They got through.This is why I have no sympathy for Novak Djokovic who is at the time of writing in lockdown in a government run hostel in Australia. He refuses to get vaccinated and is all over social media preaching against the vaccination programmes saving lives across the planet. Millions of others in Oz have stoically put up with the emergency health measures in their country for nearly two years. Why should the world’s greatest tennis player be treated any dferent from anyone  ! The longer the Australian government stand firm on the issue the more I shall admire them.One of the by-products of the pandemic and lockdown has been my own small act of solidarity with Australia, a nation that thousands of us in this part of the world have strong family connections with.During these years of the plague, I fell in love again with Aussie wine. I started searching wine merchants and supermarket shelves for Australian vino not just because I appreciate a decent Shiraz or robust Cabernet from down there. Australian wine makers have been one of the targets of a Chinese boycott after Canberra simply dared to ask for an independent international inquiry into how the virus originated in Wuhan.The dictatorship in Beijing was mfed that Australia even questioned their official narrative about how Covid- was unleashed on the world. China under Mr Xi’s tyrannical rule then imposed sanctions on Aussie exports including wine as a punishment for speaking out of turn. Anyone enraged at the cover up in Wuhan and the bullying behaviour of Beijing should support Australia while out shopping so long as that boycott continues.As I say small acts of solidarity but necessary ones ... a bit like getting vaccinated here in Northern Irelandnot for yourself then for the lives of others.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

He deceived his partners in the multiparty talks, negotiating in secret with Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness terms of appeasement which would never have been made public but for the Downey trial in .The sequence of events through which Blair abused the authority of his office is clearly set out in Austen Morgan’s Tony Blair and the IRA .The salient facts are these:• Sinn Féin IRA did not sign up to the Belfast Agreement in April •  they continued to demand further concessions from the British government• their main bargaining counter was the threat of renewed violence• Blair conceded their two main demands: the early release of IRA prisoners and an undertaking that specied IRA fugitives from justice would not be pursued or prosecuted.These concessions constituted political interference in and undermined the operation of the criminal justice system. If a victim of IRA terrorism had known what had been agreed, they could have initiated a judicial review with a strong prospect of success. Blair usurped the role of the Crown Prosecution Service overrode the professional advice of his Attorney-General and abused the power of his office.But all this was done in secret, so no victim could have challenged it.Dr WB Smith, Belfast Ben Lowry: Tony Blair was a flawed PM but of course he should be called Sir——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

They say that the beach is a sand and shingle beach and has a reputation for being one of the cleanest in the region. There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground.

As you will have heard in the media, this new Omicron iant of COVID is very infectious. But it does not appear to cause serious illnessyou have been double or triple vaccinated. But frankly I am shocked how badly the biochemistry of this virus has been explained by politicians and so-called experts. As a biochemist with an international reputation please forgive meI try to explain. When you are vaccinated in the arm the main antibody generated is called IgG. This should stop serious illness. But when you get infected in the respiratory tract you also produce another type called IgA. This is secreted into the tract. Also, there is a dferent T-lymphocyte response when you are infected directly there. So, vaccination in the arm will not necessarily stop you getting COVID because your vaccination doesnt activate the IgA production sufficiently. Furthermore, for your immune system to activate against COVID, you have to produce some of the virus and its antigen. This would make you test positive by PCR, which is very sensitive, and probably by lateral flow. Thus, the problem is thatyou get COVID, even mildly, then you would have to isolate for ten days, and this would spoil Christmas again. We can’t risk this. That is why Penarth Bridge Club will close until th January . But here is an interesting hand from last week where the challenge for North South was to bid a slam. But which one – six hearts or seven clubs The AuctionSouth opened the auction with his five-card heart suit. North with fteen points knows game must be on, and maybe a slam. So, he bid two clubs. South felt his hand was strong enough now to reverse, keeping his support for clubs till a later bid. North was tempted to jump to four hearts but this might prevent them reaching a slam. So, he bid three hearts, knowing his partner would bid on after his reverse bid of two spades. Indeed, South now needed to show his support for clubs and so bid four clubs. North now bid four no trumps, Roman key card Blackwood. They were playing   so South’s response of five diamonds must show three key cards with clubs as trumps. North now could see seven clubs must be on, as South’s key cards must be the ace of spades, the ace of hearts and the king of clubs..removeThe playTrick  – East led the queen of diamonds, declarer winning the trick with his ace of diamonds, discarding a spade from dummy. Trick  – North considered the hand. Was he going to take the spade finesse  In fact,the hearts were   or   then he could discard his losing spade on the final heart. But trumps first. He played the ace of clubs from his hand. Trick  – He followed this by winning the next trick with dummy’s king of clubs. Good news. The defenders trumps were  , so he would not have to risk taking the spade finesse. Tricks ,  and  - Declarer then won the next three tricks with his king and queen and dummy’s ace of hearts. Trick  – He then ruffed a heart in his hand, establishing dummy’s last heart as a winner. Trick  – Declarer then ed to dummy by ruffing a diamond. Trick  – He then played dummy’s winning last heart, discarding the two of spades from his hand. Tricks  and  – He then played the ace of spades, followed by a small spade which he ruffed in hand. Trick – Declarer then ruffed his last losing diamond with dummy’s last trump. Tricks  – Declarer then claimed the last trick with his remaining club, the grand slam making with thirteen tricks for score of  - one spade, four hearts, one diamond, two diamond ruffs in dummy, and five clubs in hand. Well bid and well played. Six hearts makes but not seven, because East held four trumps.What have we learnt . It is often a good idea to show your partner a strong hand by reversing, as here, before showing support for his suit.. Once again Roman key card Blackwood.is an essential part of your armoury to reach a slam.. Always checkyou can establish small cards in a suit by ruffing before considering a finesse.Penarth club resultsFriday  December . Trish Tracey and Tony Campbell. Jim Elder and Meryl Skipper.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe latest modelling suggests Omicron cases will peak \"towards the second half\" of this month and then decline – probably more quickly than previous Covid waves.Since arriving in the UK at the end of the autumn, Omicron is now the \"dominant\" form of the virus and is \"seeded in all parts of Wales\", the first minister told BBC Radio Wales this morning.More than , new cases of Covid were reported in a single daylast week, and the nations positivity rate – the number of tests thata positive result – is at  per cent, a figure Mr Drakeford called \"really high\".\"The dficult January that we could see coming is I’m afraid with us, and the protections in place are really necessary to help us all get through the challenging weeks ahead,\" he added.There is some optimism the Omicron wave could fizzle out as quickly as it managed to spread here, as it appears to be doing in South Africa, the nation where the iant was discovered in November. And research suggests people are far less likely to fall seriously ill or require hospital treatment with Omicron, compared to the Delta strain.Mr Drakeford urged caution against \"learning too many direct lessons from South Africa\", but accepted thatthe same pattern – of Omicron infections falling as quickly as they rose – were repeated in Wales, then \"we’re in for a very challenging few weeks but that we may come out of the other side of it more quickly than we’ve done in previous waves\".Wales is currently at Alert Level Two, with restrictions mainly aimed at improving safety measures for businesses and public places, rather than closing them down.The first minister said he believed his government had taken \"proportionate measures\" at the right time last month, based on the threat of the Omicron wave. This included closing down nightclubs, but Mr Drakeford said this was a move copied across much of Europe, and clubs were generally accepted to be at a \"particularly acute\" risk of being \"super-spreader events\"..removeBut asked whether his government would have preferred a full lockdown during the current wave, the first minister said this would have been impossible without financial support from the UK Government.Englands approach to Omicron has been less restrictive, as seen on New Years Eve when Newport city centre was a comparative ghost town compared to the crowds in Bristol. Boris Johnsons reluctance to impose further measures in England would make it dficult for any devolved government to win Treasury backing for a lockdown where.Mr Drakeford suggested the playing field was not level, in terms of funding any future restrictions.\"We have had this long-standing argument with the Treasury in London, that when English ministers decide that they need to move up the levels, they know they can draw on Treasury money to do so, and we and Scotland and Northern Ireland are not in that same position,\" he said. \"So we would not be able to move to [Alert] Level Four measures on our own, because level of support you’d need to offer to the Welsh economy in those circumstances is simply beyond what the Welsh Government ourselves are able to mobilise.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

And he also said when the Building Safety Bill goes through the Lords, so sometime in February or March or thereabouts, the Government will amend it to try and protect leaseholders in law from these costs, but he didn’t go into detail as to what that meant.”The person said Mr Gove was “trying to put the squeeze on developers so they come to the table prepared to put down big money to make this go away”, and had been “putting his shoulder to the wheel” on the issue.They added: “He’s talking about jeopardising their access to other public subsidy, particularly from Help to Buy,they don’t play ball.” vw,vw,px, px\"Grenfell Tower in west London, where  people died in  in a fire that spread rapidly .removeAskedthey were happy with the tone of what they heard at the meeting, the leaseholder said: “Definitely. I mean, it’s about time.”During a round of broadcast interviews ahead of the meeting, Mr Gove said it was time for those with “the big bucks, the big profits” to act to remedy the fire safety risks, as he announced that developers must agree to a £ billion plan to fix dangerous cladding on low-rise flats by early March or risk new laws forcing them to act.Mr Gove told Sky News: “We want to say to developers and indeed all those who have a role to play in recognising their responsibility that we want to work with them.“Butit’s the case that it’s necessary to do so, then we will use legal means and ultimately,necessary, the tax system in order to ensure that those who have deep pockets, those who are responsible for the upkeep of these buildings, pay – rather than the leaseholders, the iniduals, who in the past were being asked to pay with money they didn’t have for a problem that they did not cause.” vw,vw,px, px\"Leaseholders take part in a demonstration in London to demand an end to the ‘cladding scandal’ Leaseholders in buildings between mand mtall will, in a Government U-turn, no longer have to take out loans to cover the costs of remediation work despite no new money coming from the Treasury.Instead, Mr Gove told developers to agree to start contributing this year to cover the “full outstanding cost”, which he estimates to be £ billion.He said “some of the most egregious cases” had already been tackled.He added that there had been a “particular problem in the system” which “means that people have themselves to come forward and say ‘We believe that this building needs work’,” something he said had resulted in him not knowing the precise number of properties that still needed work.He told LBC: “We can’t be absolutely precise about the exact number in scope. That is one of the things that I hope that we can do in conversation with owners and with developers at the moment.”In a letter to the residential property development industry being sent on Monday, Mr Gove set a deadline of “early March” to publicly accept his ultimatum and provide a “fully-funded plan of action”.They were also ordered to provide comprehensive information on all buildings taller than m that have fire-safety defects and which they helped to construct in the past  years.Reece Lipman said that as things stand, while he owns % of his flat in Romford, east London, he is currently liable for “% of fixing all the costs”.The -year-old said Mr Gove “has got the rhetoric right and is now talking with a much firmer tone”, but insisted that what has been seen as “just a cladding crisis” is in fact “a full-blown building safety crisis” and likened the Government’s action to date as akin to bailing “water off the Titanic with pots and pans”.Mr Gove admitted the Government “did get stuff wrong” in the cladding scandal, but he said some of those who argued they were abiding by building regulations at the time did not have a “strong case”.He told LBC: “It’s also the case that there were lots of steps that were taken which put people at risk, and without wanting to pre-empt what the independent inquiry into Grenfell will conclude, I think it is… you would be hard-pressed to say that putting, essentially, sheets of liquid petrol encased in metal on the side of a tower block was the right thing to do.”The Fire Brigades Union said the Government’s latest move was “a result of determined campaigning by leaseholders and tenants”.The union’s general secretary, Matt Wrack, said: “It shows that the Government can be pressured into progress, and we commend the efforts of campaigners.“We have always been clear here – residents should not carry any cost for failure they did not cause. Developers, suppliers and buildings owners are responsible, and they should pay.”Stewart Baseley, the executive chairman of the Home Builders Federation, accepted that leaseholders should not have to pay for remediation, but said builders should not cover the costs alone..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title:  uMichael Gove to push developers to take responsibility for all safety defects u article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.
