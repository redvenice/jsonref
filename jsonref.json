Sadly, it wasn’t to be.‘For me, the only choice after losing him was to keep our home, horses and everything just as it was. My aim was to fulfil the dream we had begun together and live as I had always lived — one day at a time and in the moment.‘I didn’t give a thought to the fact that eventually it might become too much for me.’Susan would tell friends it was her horses that saw her through the darkest times.‘Whenever I felt down, I would wrap my arms around one of their strong necks and feel their power, sensitivity and strength.’She refers to the horses as her ‘children’ and is fastidious about who they are sold on to.         During their time in LA, Susan and Simon would talk about maybe one day owning a farm in the countryside‘I need to know they are going to be loved and cared for in the way I love and care for them,’ she says. ‘That’s all that matters. Sometimes it’s heartbreaking parting with them, especially my favourites. But I want what’s best for them.’Even while she was making films in Hollywood, she always dreamt of one day working with horses.During their time in LA, Susan and Simon would talk about maybe one day owning a farm in the countryside with pigs, sheep and rare breeds.‘After we married in Fiji, we made the decision to leave California. We bought a beautiful 17th-century farmhouse in Northampton.’It was here that they started breeding Arabians.‘I loved my first mare to pieces and although she was primarily my riding horse, she was mother of my first foal. And there it began.’Almost before they knew it, they had ten horses to manage but not enough land.It was while visiting friends in a remote part of Devon that they came across what they considered ‘the most beautiful spot on Earth’ — Exmoor National Park. There, they were able to buy a sheep and cattle farm of 50 acres, which would allow them to expand their Arabian stud business.‘It’s not for nothing that Lorna Doone was written here,’ Susan says. ‘The wilds of Exmoor are rough and rugged — it’s special. This house had been dearly loved by a farmer and his wife and there was a good feeling about it from the moment we stepped inside.‘I love this house so much. It’s my beautiful home. But beautiful as it is, it’s deep in the heart of the countryside, which makes it difficult for me to do anything spontaneously.‘I used to think of my farm as my sanctuary, as “the place where Simon is”. Well, that’s nonsense because he will be with me wherever I go.         Susan is in the throes of completing her autobiography (pictured: Dustin Hoffman, Susan George Straw Dogs, 1971)‘I feel that eventually I’ll move away from Somerset, but when and where to I have no idea. It will be with several of my horses, though, and I’ll continue to breed them, just in a much smaller way.‘Simon would have wanted me to move sooner, I’m certain of that. But he would also know I would do it in my own time.’Apart from returning to the world of acting, Susan is in the throes of completing her autobiography. She promised Simon she would complete her memoirs.He always encouraged her to write, saying that her stories were far too good not to be shared with other people.During her career she has mixed with royalty — she is a friend of Prince Charles and attended his marriage to Princess Diana — and Hollywood stars.‘I’m so fortunate to have been part of that era when you would go to a party and think nothing of being in the company of Cary Grant and Grace Kelly,’ she says.Her friends at the time included Frank Sinatra, Lord Olivier, Liza Minnelli, Michael Caine and Olivia Newton-John.In 2016, in memory of Simon, she launched Lasting Life, the Simon MacCorkindale Legacy, a charity that aims to provide financial support for cancer sufferers.‘His wish would have been to help others in his name,’ she says.Some years ago, Susan brought Simon’s 93-year-old mother Gill to live with her at the farm, and says she would never contemplate her mother-in-law going into a nursing home.‘I treasure her,’ she says. ‘I’m so happy to have her in my life.’As she prepares herself for the next chapter, I wonder whether she feels ready for romance again.She tosses back her blonde hair. ‘There will only ever be one love of my life and that was Simon,’ she says.‘I’m never lonely, life is incredibly busy and I’m happy in my own company. Do I think Simon would want that for me? The answer probably is yes, and mine would be, you can never say never!‘None of us knows what’s around the corner. I am mindful that everything we have in life is on loan to us and I appreciate it all. I was so lucky to have 30 years of unconditional love shared with Simon and for that I will always be grateful.’Susan’s focus at the moment is on discussions for a documentary about her life with horses and the charity.The farm is buzzing with excitement in preparation for their next big fundraiser, the Georgian Arabians showcase, and friends from the entertainment world will be joining her to celebrate.‘To be surrounded by special friends and horses,’ she says. ‘What more could I ask for?’"},{"url":null,"title":"Grandmother 81 tells bravely fought cash point mugger","story":"Share this article She said: \u0027I thought, No, you\u0027re not having my money, I\u0027ve worked hard for that.\u0027 The pensioner quickly grabbed her card and was able to overpower the much younger woman. \u0027I got her hair as well as her collar and she started screaming,\u0027 Doreen said. \u0027I don\u0027t know why she was screaming.

According to Mr Cameron, Boris Johnson put his own political career before the national interest when he chose to back Brexit during the referendum.Interviewed for the Cameron Years for the BBC, the ex-PM said: \u0027By fighting for Leave he was taking the romantic, nationalist, Conservative course, he\u0027d look like a hero, and I don\u0027t think he expected for one minute they were going to win.\u0027In the end, I think, ultimately, he put what was good for his political career ahead of what he actually thought was good for the country.\u0027Mr Cameron also suggested Britain has not left the EU yet because Theresa May ignored his advice on Brexit.He told The Times Red Box podcast he had advised Mrs May to pursue a \u0027soft Brexit\u0027 modelled on Norway, but she ignored him.Palace \u0027displeasure\u0027 at Cameron\u0027s Queen comments - BBC News"},{"url":null,"title":"Dive dive dive Humpback whale breaches stunned submarine crew South Africa","story":"Share this article \u0027I had been stalking the whales all day and was close to giving up but suddenly it all came together beautifully and I was just very lucky to be in the right place at the right time.\u0027 Three of the German-built submarines in the South African Navy are based at Simon\u0027s Town and the humpback whales are a regular sight off the base at this time of year – but rarely photographed together.Ms Wise said planned to give the crew a framed momento of the rare moment she captured \u0027I had a very nice message on my Facebook from the wife of a crew member on the sub who had sent the photographs to her husband who showed the delighted captain.\u0027I am planning to send a copy to them when they return to base to frame and hang in the submarine.\u0027         Three of the German built submarines are based at Simon\u0027s Town and the humpback whales are a regular sight off the base at this time of year – but they are rarely photographed together"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46699ab730b9c8de79940a091b0abc776fb21555/0_112_2878_1727/master/2878.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=24f4fcc78129e3edba4651e66cf40ec6","title":"bleeping it real the tricks kicks and tech behind the years best records","story":"As the 2019 Hyundai Mercury Prize once again celebrates the most exciting and groundbreaking British and Irish talent,  Leonie Cooper explores how each artist nails their soundFor the past 28 years, the Mercury Prize has been the place to find out who’s pushing things forward when it comes to the best of homegrown mainstream music. This year’s shortlist offers up a complex array of ideas, from rap as a form of therapy (Dave’s Psychodrama) and baroque deep es into sexuality (Anna Calvi’s Hunter), to woke punk (Idles’ Joy as an Act of Resistance), spaced out astro-soul (Nao’s Saturn) and, of course, a bit of lovely hip-hop informed jazz (SEED Ensemble’s Driftglass).In order to nail these disparate sounds, producers find themselves in a position almost as important as the artist. One such producer has sprinkled his studio magic over two of the 12 Albums of the Year. Working on debuts from both Fontaines DC and Black Midi, Dan Carey – who also runs independent record label Speedy Wunderground – used scare tactics on Dublin-based post-punks Fontaines DC’s Dogrel in order to capture the raw energy of their live shows. With the running order already decided, he broke the prospective album down into three sections of four songs. “Then I made this pact with the band that I’d record each of those parts in one take,” he says, freaking out the young group with such a stark proposition. “Usually you record multiple takes, but with this I said no matter where it went wrong we’d just wipe it and start again. So there was only ever one version in existence. It puts this amazing pressure on the band.” It paid off. The result is a frenetic, visceral thing that practically bounces off the walls.“When you’re trying to capture how something sounds live it’s not just the sonic aspect,” says Carey. “When you’re playing a gig you can’t stop and go back to the beginning. You’re committed to it as soon as you begin. I was trying to bring in a little bit of that.”Carey also wanted to shine a light on frontman Grian Chatten’s storytelling lyrics, so kept his vocal separate from the main thrust of instrumental noise, layering it on top and hardly mixing it into the band’s output. It’s a process Carey used when working on albums by spoken word artist and MC Kate Tempest, which were shortlisted in 2014 and again for the 2017 Hyundai Mercury Prize, but he’d never done it before on a guitar record. “I wanted it to sound like someone singing over something rather than someone singing inside it,” he says. “His lyrics warranted that.”When it came to the spiralling, complex album from south London experimental noise-makers Black Midi, Schlagenheim, a totally different approach was in order. The most unlikely musical group to emerge from Croydon’s Brit School so far according to Carey they offer up “the ultimate psychedelic music experience”.Again, capturing their live feel was a priority, but this was done by pulling their studio takes through crazed-scientist-style modular synths and firing them back at the band in real time. “They’d play a chord but everyone would hear it coming back into the room at a slightly different pitch or very finely looped.” Sure, you’re thinking: “But what does that actually do to the music?” “It emphasises the otherwordliness of it,” says Carey.“Seeing Black Midi live is so overwhelming. I lost my mind the first few times I saw them,” he adds. “But if you want to make a record sound like that – and you’re not in a loud, dark venue – you have to think of other ways of enhancing that.”This year a significant number of shortlisted artists have either produced or co-produced their own records – the 1975, Cate Le Bon and Foals included. Serving as her own executive producer, Nao was also keen to retain full ownership of her second album, Saturn, making sketches of songs on her laptop before taking them into the studio to be finessed by the album’s main producer, Grades. “It’s nice to be with the record from the very start to the very end of it,” she says. “No matter how many other people help you through, you don’t want to give the executive producer role to anybody else because you’re the one who’s going to put the most passion and love into it.”With occasional takes recorded in a cupboard in her bedroom, Saturn was a surprisingly low-tech production, despite its dreamy sound. Aside from a couple of tweaks, Nao left her airy vocals alone too. “I try and stay away from effects, because enough people think my voice is affected anyway,” she says. “People think I use Auto-Tune but that’s actually just the way I sing!”Composer and arranger Jason Yarde – who produced the Cassie Kinoshi-led SEED Ensemble’s sprawling Afro-jazz triumph Driftglass – also knows the importance of keeping things simple. “Jazz by its very nature is about experimentation and finding new things,” he says. “But as much as you can use studio tricks and add effects you might not have live, it’s also important to make sure the band sounds like the band. It’s also about knowing when to have a break and when to have some tea.”Watch the 2019 Hyundai Mercury Prize live on Thursday 19th September, BBC Four - 9pm.

Tom Thorogood explores how the prize continues to elevate the freshest of British and Irish talentThree years ago Skepta stood on the Eventim Apollo stage in Hammersmith to collect the Hyundai Mercury Prize for his landmark album Konnichiwa.At any other music awards ceremony an unsigned rapper beating 11 other artists, including Radiohead and the late David Bowie, to the top prize would be unprecedented. But the Hyundai Mercury Prize isn’t like any other showbiz award show, where the winner is picked months in advance and the decision often has more to do with insider politics than artistry.It’s also an award that’s highly prized by the artists who make the shortlist, regardless of genre. Last year, MC Novelist said he felt like he, “got an A*” for his album Novelist Guy, and indie star Nadine Shah, who bagged recognition for her record Holiday Destination, revealed she was a fan of the award: “If I was to go on Mastermind, it would be my specialist subject.”After making the shortlist with her fourth album, No Shame, pop star Lily Allen – used to making headlines for reasons other than her music – says: “The artist part of me gets lost a lot of the time – being nominated has helped with that immensely.”Tottenham MC and producer Skepta was hardly unknown in 2016 of course, he’d been a pioneering grime artist for more than a decade alongside Kano, Wiley and 2003’s own shock winner Dizzee Rascal (whose Boy In Da Corner also beat a Radiohead album).But Joseph Junior “Skepta” Adenuga was doing things his own way, without bowing to industry pressure or pop trends – he’d made the video for the first Konnichiwa single That’s Not Me for £80 before releasing the shout-along shock of Shutdown.On stage Jarvis Cocker announced his name, comparing Bowie’s Blackstar album to the “black star”, before Skepta spoke about his team and scene.“We’ve travelled the world – no record label, nothing,” he declared. “We just did this for us, but the love is very appreciated. We all won today!”His comments to friends, the industry and the TV audience, in the frenzied moments just after his win, with his parents standing next to him, have echoed through the three years since.UK rap and grime have had many highs and lows in the past 20 years. Since 2016, when Kano’s Made In The Manor also made the shortlist, the scene Skepta helped birth has flourished in the charts, on radio and at award shows, and spawned more innovative sub genres.Headie One, one of the leading UK drill MCs, recently made the top 10 with his single 18Hunna and has collaborated with Skepta on his current single Back to Basics. He’s also a Tottenham native who watched closely when the older MC released Konnichiwa and won the Hyundai Mercury Prize.“I first started noticing grime when I was at secondary school,” he says. “Everyone knew Skepta and Chip were from Tottenham like us. When he won the award I realised it was important for artists to get that recognition.“And now I’ve spent time with him I’ve learned a lot from his attitude and intelligence and the way he can adapt to different genres, the way he did on Konnichiwa.”Twelve months on from Skepta’s win there were four equally adventurous, genre-melding British MCs on the Hyundai Mercury Prize shortlist, all from the same city, yet sounding vastly different to each other.Loyle Carner showcased his introspective storytelling and disarmingly gentle flow on his first album Yesterday’s Gone, Kate Tempest took her poetry to new places on her concept record Let Them Eat Chaos and on his ambitious debut Common Sense, J Hus told his story in brutally honest detail.The fourth Londoner to make the 2017 shortlist was Stormzy with his own debut Gang Signs \u0026amp Prayer, a record that fused gospel, grime and pop influences and propelled him to a double Brits win and this year’s Glastonbury headline slot, where he impressed Worthy Farm with his political Banksy, BMX and Chris Martin-assisted Pyramid stage set.In a break between songs, topless and surrounded by the sunburnt crowd, he passed the baton on – reeling off a list of artists from his scene, and highlighting essential young British rappers to the field and the many millions watching from the sofa.Three of those names read out by Stormzy make the shortlist in 2019 – Little Simz, Slowthai and Dave, whose albums compete against Anna Calvi, Foals, Cate Le Bon, Nao, The 1975, Idles, Seed Ensemble, Black Midi and Fontaines DC. It’s a typically eclectic lineup and one that could produce a shock winner, to invoke the year drum’n’bass collective Roni Size \u0026amp Reprezent’s New Forms won at the height of Britpop.“I talked with Skepta about how he puts together his albums, and it’s hard,” says Headie One. “It’s a lot harder to put out a full album than a single or an EP, and it’s an achievement, a real body of work.”And three decades after the prize began, and just three years since Skepta’s Hyundai Mercury Prize win, this year’s shortlist shows that hard work and the resulting albums are as valued as ever.Watch the 2019 Hyundai Mercury Prize live on Thursday 19th September, BBC Four - 9pm.

She worked as a guitar teacher and a toy shop sales assistant before being signed by Domino Records in 2009. Brian Eno was an early champion, calling Calvi “the biggest thing since Patti Smith” and singing and playing on her debut album. She’s also collaborated with David Byrne, Marianne Faithfull and PJ Harvey producer Rob Ellis. Calvi’s guitar-driven art-rock sound is often described as dark and cinematic, so it’s not too surprising that she’s recently scored series five of Peaky Blinders.Influences: Black Midi’s name comes from an internet music genre the band learned of via YouTube, a video frontman Geordie Greep has said they “haven’t spent more than five minutes watching”. The four-piece experimental rock band initially bonded over a shared love of Talking Heads, Deerhoof and Danny Brown, but that doesn’t mean these acts are “influences” in the traditional sense. According to Greep, “there’s stuff we all like, but it’s not like we all like stuff that we based the band on sort of thing. We’ve tried to keep the band quite distinct from what we like.”Scene: Black Midi formed at the Brit School, the Croydon performing arts institution known for cultivating Adele, Amy Winehouse and Jessie J. They then honed their live skills at Brixton venue the Windmill, a bastion of the south London indie scene. Though they’re hardly typical Brit School alumni, the group acknowledge they owe a debt to their time there. “You do shows every term and stuff,” Greep has said. “So once you get out you’ve got a really good idea of how sound works. It meant we left school, could play at the Windmill and knew how to soundcheck straight away.”Influences: Growing up in Wales in the 90s, Cate Le Bon’s father would make her mixtapes introducing her to seminal artists such as Neil Young and the Velvet Underground. She was also drawn to California rockers Pavement and two leading Welsh bands of the era, Super Furry Animals and Gorky’s Zygotic Mynci. Her shortlisted album Reward grew from a year of “self-imposed isolation” in Cumbria where she spent her time woodworking by day and later, “playing the piano and singing into the night”.Scene: Born in Carmarthenshire, Le Bon’s roots lie in the Welsh indie scene. She first came to prominence opening for Super Furry Animals frontman Gruff Rhys on his 2007 solo tour, then singing on I Lust U, a standout track from Rhys’s electro-pop side project Neon Neon. She’s since released five albums, collaborated with John Cale and the Manic Street Preachers, and co-produced an album by American indie rockers Deerhunter. She’s revered by peers including St. Vincent and Wilco’s Jeff Tweedy, who earlier this year described Le Bon as “pretty much my favourite artist”, going on to say: “I’m mesmerised by her output over the last 10 years.”Scene: Dave is a leading light of the blossoming British hip-hop scene. Fellow London rappers Stormzy and Wiley supported him early on then Dave’s profile grew again when US superstar Drake jumped on a remix of his 2017 track Wanna Know. More recently, the 21-year-old has collaborated with several other London rappers including Headie One, J Hus and Fredo, who featured on Dave’s chart-topping single Funky Friday. This year, Dave has underlined his rising star status with a guest spot on Ed Sheeran’s No.6 Collaborations Project.Influences: Oxford band Foals have cited minimalist composer Steve Reich, indie icons Pixies and innovative dance producer Arthur Baker as influences. Frontman Yannis Philippakis has also said that a “general anxiety” caused by Trump, Brexit and climate change fed into their shortlisted album, Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost – Part 1. “I was listening to the tracks in the pub and I’d I look up and see a pub garden full of people and realise: ‘We’re all in this shitstorm together.’ I felt the songs should deal with that,” he said recently.Scene: Foals formed in Oxford’s indie scene in 2005. Two band members, frontman Yannis Philippakis and drummer Jack Bevan, were previously part of another band, math-rockers The Edmund Fitzgerald, who disbanded when things apparently became “too serious”. Since releasing their debut album Antidotes in 2008, Foals have been shortlisted for the Mercury Prize on three occasions and become seasoned festival headliners. A follow-up to their shortlisted album, the logically-titled Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost – Part 2, is due in October.Influences: Dublin post-punks Fontaines DC are influenced by the Strokes, the Libertines and the Velvet Underground they’ve called the latter “the base point of modern music”. Frontman Grian Chatten has also cited the Pogues’ 1984 debut album Red Roses for Me as a major touchstone for their own shortlisted debut, Dogrel, saying: “It sounds so raucous but at the same time so intelligent.” But the band’s most formative influence could be their hometown. “I think of Dublin and our music as one and the same, because it was written by people who were intensely absorbed by the city,” Chatten has said.Scene: Inspired by fellow Dubliners Girl Band, whom they credit with “modernising” Irish music, Fontaines DC are part of a new wave of Irish guitar bands making music with a strong social conscience. Discussing the scene earlier this year, Fontaines bassist Conor Deegan III said: “There’s so many things going on in Ireland, socially and politically, that for so long were not being talked about. It feels like there’s a coherent voice for our generation again.” Having toured with Shame and Idles, Fontaines DC also have close connections with the UK guitar music scene.Influences: While often described as a post-punk band, Idles frontman Joe Talbot has said they’re really “a product of different things we love”. The Bristol outfit’s shortlisted second album, Joy as an Act of Resistance, is influenced by the Sex Pistols, Interpol and Welsh post-hardcore group Mclusky, plus garage music, grime and jungle. It’s all funnelled into a righteous and rousing call-to-arms which takes on toxic masculinity, class conflict, immigration and Brexit. The end result isn’t anger, said Talbot, but music that’s “all about opening up and being vulnerable”.Influences: Little Simz said her shortlisted album Grey Area was inspired by “just coming into myself a lot more and being a young woman in my mid-20s and still learning about myself”. The north London artist, whose real name is Simbi Ajikawo, has said that listening to grime as a teenager influenced her writing style, but Grey Area also draws from other sources. Produced by her childhood friend Inflo, it incorporates jazz, funk, soul, rock and trip-hop, and includes collaborations with reggae artist Chronixx, folk-rock singer Michael Kiwanuka and electro-R\u0026ampB band Little Dragon.Scene: Little Simz said earlier this year that “people have struggled with finding where to place me”, adding: “And I think that’s also because I don’t even know where I fit.” This doesn’t mean the north London rapper lacks influential and high-profile fans. Two years ago, Kendrick Lamar said she “might be the illest doing it”, and she’s been tapped for collaborations by Gorillaz, Khalid and alt-j. Simz has even toured with Lauryn Hill, whose seminal album The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill was part of her “day-to-day life” when she was growing up.Influences: Neo Jessica Joshua, better known as Nao, grew up in Hackney listening to R\u0026ampB, hip-hop and UK garage, as well as Donny Hathaway, Aretha Franklin and Prince. Conceptually, her shortlisted second album is inspired by astrology’s Saturn return. “It’s this idea that Saturn takes 29 years to orbit from when you’re born and it is the planet of blessings and growth. So by the time you’re around 29, between 27 and 32, something big happens in your life,” 31-year-old Nao says. “You start to rethink everything – old stuff that your parents taught you or ideas that you believed in. It’s like a complete shedding of skin and it can be painful.”Scene: Nao’s unique musical journey means she doesn’t slot neatly into any particular scene. After studying vocal jazz at Guildhall School of Music \u0026amp Drama, she joined all-female beatboxing troupe The Boxettes, who were popular on YouTube. She also put in stints as a backing singer for Kwabs and Jarvis Cocker. When she released her debut album For All We Know in 2016, she often described her sound as “wonky funk”, and she’s since collaborated with Nile Rodgers \u0026amp Chic and Disclosure.Influences: Led by alto saxophonist Cassie Kinoshi, SEED Ensemble is a 10-piece band “combining jazz with inner-city London, West African and Caribbean-influenced groove”. Kinoshi says she’s personally influenced by composers such as Maria Schneider, Duke Ellington and Charles Mingus, and named Driftglass after a collection of short stories by African-American author Samuel R Delany. “This record specifically focuses on interpreting … what driftglass is as an analogy for how improvised music changes and evolves over time depending on its environment,” she says. “Sci-fi, specifically space travel and Afrofuturist references to water and its connection to black history, were also important in its creation.”Influences: Northampton rapper Tyron Frampton, or Slowthai, has varied musical influences ranging from the Beatles to Basement Jaxx, and So Solid Crew to Elliot Smith. He namechecks the Prodigy on Nothing Great About Britain, the title track from his shortlisted debut album, saying: “I am a prodigy – they made me.” He’s also said he related to Radiohead’s Creep during his formative years. His album is an impassioned mix of hip-hop, grime, electronica and punk, so it’s fitting that it features collaborations with both grime icon Skepta and noisenik guitar duo Slaves.Scene: Tyron Frampton, the rapper better known as Slowthai, was born and raised in Northampton. “It’s always been a band town,” he said earlier this year. “There’s always been good music but never a strong scene to keep it going.” His own music mixes hip-hop grit with a scabrous punk energy, but he’s keen not to be pigeonholed, saying: “I want to play guitar, piano, drums, write songs for other people. I can do punk, I can do indie, but as long as it has my voice, it’ll always be my sound.”Scene: The four members of the 1975 met at Wilmslow High School and started making music at 15. At one point, they operated as a punk covers band, but they soon developed their own genre-splicing songwriting style inspired by everyone from Michael Jackson to My Bloody Valentine. Since signing to indie label Dirty Hit and breaking through with 2013’s self-titled debut, band members Matt Healy and George Daniel have co-written tracks for fellow Dirty Hit artists Pale Waves, The Japanese House and No Rome.Watch the 2019 Hyundai Mercury Prize live on Thursday 19th September, BBC Four - 9pm.

Opening this Saturday, Holly Hendry’s exhibition, The Dump is Full of Images, is a partnership between art and science exploring themes of decay, the body and reusing materials.Named after an epilogue in American writer Miles Orvell’s The Real Thing, which explores the relationship between technology and culture, the exhibition’s main work uses material made from thermoplastics developed by Prof Parikshit Goswami for use as replacement skin.The collaboration with Goswami, based at Huddersfield University, whom Hendry describes as a “scientific magician”, began as a discussion about the potential of materials and how to reuse them in different ways. Slacker, the main sculpture, depicts a body lying down. It consists of the skin-like material printed with anatomical imagery being fed through a series of supermarket-style conveyor belts in a “regurgitatory motion” to create a “rotational autopsy of innards”.Hendry poured silicon onto conveyor fabric and mixed it with rubbish lying around her studio, such as bottle tops or plastic pens, and then remixed it with leftovers or residue from mixing material in the bottom of buckets.The smaller works in the exhibition also use recycled materials, such as plasterboard and locally-sourced sheep’s wool, otherwise destined for incineration. Hendry says that one of the joys of working with Goswami was that they would “approach similar ideas in totally opposite ways”. Goswami intends to turn the wool into textiles, Hendry is turning it in art.The crossover of the different worlds of art and science were a joy but also a challenge, says Hendry. “His way of working is totally practical, it’s funny how what I make is almost the opposite of that it’s totally impractical but deals with the same issues. We were able to have these amazing conversations about the ideas of touch and material sustainability and skins and reusing materials. He’s used to practical outcomes that have meaning, whereas I can go off on a tangent and interpret ideas in strange ways.”Although the work investigates the ideas of excess, the build-up of material in the world, how we choose what we keep and what we see as rubbish, Hendry says she doesn’t want the exhibition in the park’s Weston visitor centre to be “preaching environment sustainability”. She says: “I don’t think there’s the intention of a specific political message in the sculptures. I feel that would be contradictory anyway, as I’m using material to make the work.”In contrast, The Garden of Good and Evil, by Chilean artist Alfredo Jaar, which also opens on Saturday, overtly aims to provoke discussion of humanitarian trauma and politics of image-making. The work, a new permanent collection at the YSP, features ten steel cells, which reference CIA “black sites” or secret detention facilities around the world. The cells, originally exhibited in 2017 in a different formation, are now dispersed around the 500-acre park, installed within the woodland and partially submerged in one of the lakes, as if reclaimed by the land.Each cell, deliberated aged and rusted by the weather, has a one-metre-square base inspired by the poem, One Square Metre of Prison (1986) by Palestinian poet and activist Mahmoud Darwish, who spent much of his adult life in solitary confinement and in exile.

In return, France will lend Italy paintings by Raphael for events marking 500 years since his death next year. A spokesman for Franceschini said “many” works would be exchanged, but which ones would be determined in the next week.Franceschini began the negotiations between French and Italian museums when he served as culture minister under the centre-left Democratic party’s government in 2017. The plan envisaged 26 paintings and drawings by Leonardo being lent to the Louvre for its October show.The Paris museum holds five of only 14 paintings attributed to Leonardo, born near the Tuscan hill town of Vinci in 1452, and hoped to source further works from Italy that were robust enough to travel. They are thought to have included the Vitruvian Man drawing, in Venice, as well as the unfinished painting Saint Jerome in the Wilderness, currently on display at the Vatican Museums.The plan hit a stumbling block when the Democratic party was ousted from government in Italy’s general elections in March 2018, paving the way for a coalition between the far-right League and the anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S). The then culture minister, M5S’s Alberto Bonisoli, hindered progress, claiming the deal was unbalanced. His deputy, Lucia Borgonzoni, from the League, threatened to cancel the loan of Leonardo works last November, accusing France of trying to take centre stage in the commemorations and sidelining Italy, saying “Leonardo is Italian he only died in France”.The renaissance master was party a wider diplomatic dispute, mostly over immigration, between the two countries which led to France recalling its Rome ambassador in February. Tensions began to ease after the French president, Emmanuel Macron, invited his Italian counterpart, Sergio Mattarella, to France in May to mark the beginning of the year-long Leonardo commemorations.The deal was revived when Franceschini returned to the culture ministry this month after M5S formed a coalition with the Democratic party, foiling the former deputy prime minister Matteo Salvini’s gambit to collapse the government and force snap elections.Macron arrived in Rome on Wednesday for a meeting with Mattarella and the reappointed prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, confirming the two countries were friends again.Barbara Agosti, an art history professor at Tor Vergata University of Rome and a member of the committee set up by Franceschini to oversee Leonardo events in Italy, was unable to shed any light on the works that will be exchanged.“But it was only a matter of signing a deal,” she said. “The year of Leonardo is drawing to an end and so most of the work had already been done. Next up is Raphael.”Another committee is expected to plan events to commemorate Raphael, who died in April 1520.“We hope now that the situation has calmed down that everyone can work well … all the rowing and uncertainty made it very difficult to work well,” added Agosti."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/352049c9c59d135d68e92d687221248a95bfdd5c/177_94_4777_2867/master/4777.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8b0a3662075d9d653d107a859014147b","title":"istanbul biennial 2019 in pictures the seventh continent nicolas bourriaud turkey","story":"The art festival focuses on the environment for its 16th edition, The Seventh Continent.

Designed by Erno Goldfinger and opened in 1968, when local authorities still built council housing in earnest, Balfron arrived on the crest of a wave of high-rise developments. Towers were seen as the ideal solution to the problem of how to house people well in dense urban centres.Thirty years later Sadler, now a children’s diabetes specialist nurse, bought a flat three doors down at number 81. Although Balfron’s apartments were now selling on the open market, Sadler says the thing she’d originally loved about it remained: the sense of community. “There were old East Enders who had lived there since the building opened, Bangladeshi families, Africans and eastern Europeans,” she said.In 2011, however, she received a compulsory purchase order: she was being forced her to sell her flat. Balfron was going to be redeveloped for the luxury market. The residents had to go.In bringing up Ballard, Sadler is referring to High-Rise, the author’s 1975 novel set in a multi-storey building partly inspired by Balfron. It featured Antony Royal, a monstrous architect who, like Goldfinger, lived at the top of the tower he built. (Unlike Goldfinger, the fictional Royal beat up his tenants if they got too curious.) The book asked the question: what if, instead of the council tenants who lived in Balfron, such a tower was instead filled with a striving professional class and leisure activities that detached them from the world outside?Ballard’s answer was that the proto-yuppie residents would be driven to vicious distraction by the bourgeois competitiveness fostered by their environment. Braying bourgeois mobs skulk in foyers. Dogs are eaten.“I’ve looked at some of the stuff from the new developers,” says Sadler, “and I’m thinking, ‘Oh my God, it’s that book.’”Indeed, life is mirroring art: this Saturday, the media will get an early glimpse of the new Balfron. All former residents of the 146-property building – renters and owners alike – have been moved on (bar six leaseholders who dug in their heels). The developer, Londonewcastle, commissioned the architects Egret West and Ab Rogers (son of Sir Richard) to modernise to a “21st-century standard”, and the new residents are expected to be a panoply of professionals who will enjoy a high-spec cinema club, a music room complete with drum kit, a workshop, a library, a gym and a cooking and dining space for bigger soirees. All of the flats will be for sale, not rent.The interiors, too, have been reshaped to 21st century standards. There is increased acoustic insulation, sprinklers, and ducts for a filtered ventilation system. The properties Goldfinger demarcated into separate rooms for living, cooking and dining are now open-plan, except for a handful of “heritage” apartments that have been given a “reverse-makeover” using carefully sourced period elements – most of the original taps, for example, were bought on eBay.The real selling point is how faithful the redevelopment will be to the original: Goldfinger’s colour-coded floors and doors return, as do steel Crittall windows and the marble entrance hall (its replacement marble flown in from Portugal with the approval of English Heritage).Indeed, the true value of Balfron on the real estate market is its symbolism, because this tower encapsulates the story of London’s last 50 years better than almost any other building. Each decade of its existence captures the spirit of the age: from optimistic council estate in the 1960s to reviled brutalist bugbear in the 1970s from right-to-buy inidualist homeowning dream in the 1980s to crime hotspot in the 1990s from being the target of commercial development in the 2000s to an artist-occupied embodiment of gentrification in the 2010s.Balfron’s 27 storeys may have been eclipsed by higher towers, but it still stands as a huge physical and metaphorical gateway for London – between north and south, lording over the Blackwall tunnel under the Thames between east and west London, where its sister building, the Trellick tower, looms like Isengard to its Barad-dûr between London and the world, via the A13 road to the ports on the coast and, more than anything, between the city’s much mythologised East End of cockney traders and pie and mash, and the modern financial domination of Canary Wharf, less than half a mile away.Now, reflecting the way in which London’s regeneration story has shifted from inidual gentrification to huge district-area facelifts, Balfron’s own facelift is the centrepiece of much wider plan. What is envisaged is nothing less than a large-scale and long-term regeneration of this entire district, an area that back when Balfron was built was accessible only by bus. Canary Wharf is coming for Poplar at last.The architects and developers are acutely aware of the tension inherent in such a plan, and have taken pains to emphasise their commitment to community. “It was really important… that this was a building again, community-forming,” says Londonewcastle’s head of development, Baerbel Schuett. “It’s owner-occupier. It’s not going to be taken to any kind of far-east show. It is sold here in London.” It is nevertheless being sold to a particular clientele. One bedroom flats start at £365,000. In the marketing materials, the proximity of Canary Wharf is a major selling point.“It’s a shame,” says Sadler. “I just feel like we all benefit from mixing up together, and I think what they are producing is something that will end up being exclusive.”I was given an early look at the still-to-be-finished building, and was shown inside a large dining space that used to be the boiler room, located inside Balfron’s distinctive thin concrete tower, which is connected to the main residential block by “streets in the sky” walkways (Goldfinger’s solution for distancing the apartments from mechanical noise). Among the gathered crowd were representatives from the architects, Ab Rogers and Egret West, who enthusiastically projected their vision of future residents filling the room with dinner guests.I am assured that the concierge will manage the bookings for the dining area, avoiding the kind of edgy bourgeois encounters that Ballard envisaged.You could say Balfron died as soon as it was born.Goldfinger, a modernist architect from Hungary, was a Marxist who began designing the tower in 1963 as part of the wider Brownfield estate of council houses. Balfron was built to a ‘scissor plan’ – a way of interlocking flats to maximise space – and the design was generous: every apartment had dual aspect windows, welcoming sunrise to their bedrooms and sunset to their living rooms. The elegant yet imposing, burly yet intricate tower itself took the breath away, whether you liked it or not.When it opened in 1968, it was one of the tallest towers in Europe Goldfinger and his wife moved into a flat on the 24th floor for two months, gleaning feedback from tenants by putting on lavish champagne parties.The almost immediate response from its vocal critics, however, was that in his feverish devotion to brutalism, Goldfinger had created a monster. “The first tower, although perversely beautiful, conjures up thoughts of prisons and pill-boxes,” wrote Terence Bendixson in the  in 1969. “Here, too, vandalism is setting in.” The timing was equally terrible: two days after Goldfinger’s opening press conference in May 1968, the Ronan Point tower block in nearby Canning Town collapsed, undermining the supposed futurism of high-rise living.In 1978, the East London Advertiser reported that Balfron residents felt isolated in the tower. Fifty-nine-year-old Harold Byford, who lived alone, said he felt like a “battery chicken in a box”. Parents bemoaned a lack of playing space and the impossibility of children mixing between floors. In the 1990s it developed a bad drug problem, and by 2002 it was providing a gritty, shopping trolley-strewn stage for the zombie horror 28 Days Later. Ian Fleming hated Goldfinger so much that he named a Bond villain after him.Stride is the CEO of the powerful but little understood organisation that was behind the decision to turn Balfron into a luxury development: the Poplar Housing and Regeneration Community Association, better know as Poplar Harca.Moreover, it is also trying to reshape the entire economy of this piece of cockney London. It wants to bring the rag trade back to the district by building a “fashion hub”, Poplar Works – a collaborative venture with the Trampery, a social enterprise for creatives, and London College of Fashion – that will turn old garages into more than 40 low-cost studios and workshops for early-stage fashion businesses.Poplar, Stride says, has long been “stuck in the middle” between booming examples of London regeneration and he is glad it is finally receiving a piece of the action. The regeneration is fuelled by Harca’s quasi-Robin Hood business model, which seeks to generate as much value as possible from its assets. This means, for example, selling Balfron and building new private high-end flats at Chrisp Street Market, then using the money generated for social housing, upgrades to the area and helping new businesses set up, such as London’s first Haitian cafe.From our vantage point on the roof, Stride gestures past Balfron to the totems of London’s eastern facelift: Canary Wharf, the O2, the vast new housing developments at Canning Town. “There is lots of regeneration going on,” he says. “Stratford is completely transformed of course, while we are the second most deprived area.” In particular, he says, he wants a more genuine connection between Canary Wharf, with its bankers and high-end restaurants, and more working-class Poplar. “What we are saying is: bring the jobs and the changes that you’re benefiting from – we want it here as well!”“Is this all gentrified?,” Stride asks, gesturing to the new low-rises flats. “This is all social rent and the quality is fantastic. Low-cost home ownership there. There’s no way you can say that is gentrified. Then you’ve got that tower in the corner. Then the rest is social rent. It’s beautiful.”Woollard, like Stride, doesn’t much like Balfron. “I’d rather demolish it, to be truthful … It was good for that time, but as the decades passed it was a paradise for drug deals and an assembly point for gangs and stuff like that.”For those who have to leave their homes in Balfron, supposedly to make the maths work for the improvement of the rest of the neighbourhood, the thinking is that high-rise living has never been for everyone. Indeed, many rightly criticise earlier practices of housing people in towers who may not have wanted to live so high. And yet, not only did many people live happily in Balfron for decades, but now many others will pay top whack to live in it. That Balfron is being readied for the luxury market, says John Boughton, the author of Municipal Dreams, a book on the story of UK council housing, “is a backhanded compliment for the fact that actually it was just very good housing.”Indeed, Balfron wasn’t always vilified. For several decades it was considered by many to be a decent place to live. Sadler says it was only in the 1980s, after Margaret Thatcher abandoned the Greater London Council – the governing body of London that had overseen Balfron – that it began to go downhill, as the local council, Tower Hamlets, shouldered the burden. But Balfron had long been lauded as a design success by the cultural establishment. It was listed in 1998, and acted as a post-industrial reference point to music videos by grime acts and indie bands.That process was crystallised in 2011: Harca invited artists to temporarily occupy the empty flats in a “ship” scheme in collaboration with Bow Arts Trust as the building was being emptied of its tenants. The artist Wane Hemingway made over Goldfinger’s old flat, No 130, with retro stylings Turner nominee Catherine Yass’s “Piano Falling” would have seen her drop a piano from the 26th floor as a “swan song” for Balfron, before it was called off after a petition from local residents. An artist moved next door to Sadler’s sons, who were living in the family flat. “He’d come and knock on the door and want a chat. He was doing some project on extra terrestrials.”For many, however, the scheme turned Balfron into a shorthand for “artwashing”: the practice of developers inviting artists to live in an area, giving it a vibrancy that raises property prices. One , Rab Harling, entered Balfron in 2011 as an artist, and began a photography project to document the interior worlds of the flats. “I wanted to turn the building inside out,” he said. Instead, he began to learn more about the tenants compelled to leave the tower. He recorded some of their complaints in a short documentary that included claims from former residents of Balfron that they signed an agreement which stated that they could come back after refurbishment, only to be sent a letter by Harca a few months later reversing the decision. “I know a few people, a lot of the old people, wanted to go back,” one resident, Cindy, who lived there for 25 years, says in the film. “I think they lie to you.” Gavin, another former resident who was told he could stay, says his fortunes changed when housed in the tower in the 90s. “I was homeless and I was really thankful for a place … now it’s going to the richest of society.”Harca’s own regeneration consultation documents promised that “no resident will lose their home involuntarily”. In response to the claims made in the film, a Harca spokeperson said: “We know that some residents wanted to return to Balfron – it had been their home for a long time. However, speaking with those same residents now, most of whom are settled in next-door in Goldfinger‘s Carradale House, given the option they would now stay where they are.”Harling, for his part, says he now feels that his presence as an artist was manipulated to encourage the social cleansing of the area, a strategy he describes as: “Get the artists in there, push the property prices up, this is our flagship. This is jewel in the crown of the entire area, which is about to be developed all the way up to the River Lea” (where another 30,000 new housing units are being built).In 2013 Harling was evicted. He has since been homeless but continues to campaign against “class cleansing” on his Twitter account, Balfron Social Club, which was denounced by the director of the V\u0026ampA, Tristram Hunt, as “keyboard warriors and artwash agitators”. “Regenerated, or degenerated?” retorts Lorraine Paul when I ask her about Harca’s plans for Chrisp Street market, where she runs Ivy’s cafe. Ivy’s has served pease pudding, faggots and saveloys here since it was built by Sir Frederick Gibberd over the site of the old market and opened as part of the Festival of Britain in 1951.Chrisp Street market still clings on to its old character – its pie and mash shops, independent hardware stores and pubs – while integrating some of the newer elements: the Haitian coffee shop, an Idea Store (as libraries are now called), and a co-working space run by the London Small Business Centre, called Chrisp Street Exchange. The Lansbury Estate and other buildings built during the Festival of Britain will be spared. But the artist impressions Stride shows me of what the new parts of Chrisp Street will look like seem cookie-cutter, resembling any recently regenerated square or quarter of London once deemed unfashionable or dangerous – although a pie and mash shop has been allowed to remain.Paul doesn’t think Ivy’s will survive. The original building will be demolished next year as part of the regeneration and will not be replaced for another three years. During that time, the cafe will be moved to a new spot behind some barriers while the building work proceeds. The noise and dust will put off the customers, she predicts. Beyond that, she fears for the heart of the market.“I don’t like what’s happening in this area any more. You ruin the East End. Just standardising every area to have a coffee shop, a wine bar, getting rid of all these markets that existed for years and years.”She believes the neglected condition of the market under Harca is intentional.“You’re not gonna sell for £1.5m when you look down on this shithole, are you? There’s millions of mice and rats underneath this ground. The floor is collapsing because they live underneath and all the tiles keep collapsing down because they are digging tunnels.”Harca deny that they have neglected the market. “We’ve been working hard to sustain the market with events, publicity and investment,” insists a spokesperson. “The reason for the regeneration is because local people recognise that a significant intervention is necessary to protect the long-term future of the area – bringing new homes, jobs and energy to a much-loved community hub.”Stride says his hero is George Lansbury, the architect of “Poplarism”, the 1920s movement demanding poor relief be shared equally across all London boroughs. Poplar back then was a poster child for urban poverty after the shipping industry declined, and Lansbury, whose rise contains echoes of Jeremy Corbyn’s, argued for direct action.Stride says he is “sympathetic to a more radical approach”, but suggests his hands are tied: even if Harca had wanted to renovate Balfron to include social housing, they would not have been given government funding to do so.He argues that the right-to-buy policy, which allowed council tenants to buy their property, “had a huge amount to answer for as well, because any social housing that is good gets bought out.”The only solution, he says, is for the UK government to “build a significant social housing programme – building in significant ways through real long-term solutions, not wrapping up old buildings in really bad cladding that then catches on fire.”In the meantime, Balfron will be lived in only by those who can afford it, likely to be employees in Canary Wharf or the City of London, people who pay their service charges without a fuss and presumably won’t throw things out of the window. The implication is that Goldfinger’s aspirant architecture is somehow a bit much for lower earners: the luxification of the tower suggests the windows let too much light in, its design is too desirably functional, its spaces are too full of promise and endeavour to be considered for universal consumption.I take a queasy ride on the workman’s lift to the Balfron roof, where there is a breathtaking 360-degree view of London. Goldfinger’s original working chimneys and ventilation shafts are gone in their place will be a wild (but landscaped) meadow-style garden, with shrubs and hardy perennials – low-maintenance foliage that can withstand a battering from the weather. Goldfinger once said of his tower that “it will help bring the countryside to London”, a statement that spoke to the way the architect felt his buildings could open the city up to their residents. Balfron’s new walled garden, on the other hand, speaks of a privatised city folding in on itself.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/888fe802dbc6511e6d1a0a3e070cc476a875d194/0_45_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2e5ddb778790370340d4ff0d143580f4","title":"eton david cameron memoirs leaders power","story":"David Cameron publishes his memoirs today, in which he looks back on his time at Eton college and back on the drug use that, had he been from a different background, might have landed him in jail. Eton is proud of its political leaders. This can be seen from the fact that, in one of its most famous rooms, you can find the bust of every student who has gone on to become prime minister. Eton must ask itself, though, whether it is proud of the kind of leader that it is producing. It must also ponder why, if it truly sees itself as a school of leadership, there are more and more people who regard it and similar institutions as utterly unfit for purpose.A few weeks ago, like thousands of other people, I shared a photo of Jacob Rees-Mogg on social media. The photo, an image of him reclining in the House of Commons as he listened to his furious opponent in a debate about Brexit, seemed to be the very image of entitlement. At a time when the country’s economy and social fabric were under unusual strain, there was Rees-Mogg, apparently revelling in the bedlam.It is too easy for me and others who attended Eton to throw our hands up and say “this is not who we are” to point towards all those kind, decent fellow alumni whom we know personally, maybe even at ourselves, and say that we are better than that. It is far too easy for us to say, in the style of men anguished by the revelations of the #MeToo movement, “not all Etonians”. Moreover, that response stops us from asking the hardest questions. Why, in recent years, has our school consistently turned out prominent politicians with a devastating lack of empathy for the most vulnerable people in our country? How – why – did we enable an atmosphere in which their obsessive sense of destiny was able to thrive?Let us look briefly at some of those politicians. Not only do we have Cameron and Boris Johnson, who seems to be motivated by nothing but a desire to live in the country’s most prestigious house. We have Rees-Mogg, gleefully retweeting speeches by the far right. We have Kwasi Kwarteng, who has dismissed the report of the UN expert on extreme poverty a report that found that the Conservative party’s austerity policies had inflicted “great misery” on the British people. We have Rupert Harrison, the mind behind a bulk of those policies. Late last year, Harrison referred to the most likely outcome of Brexit as “an orderly process” – even though, to all observers, it has been the very definition of chaos. Even Rory Stewart, praised by many as a moderate hope within his party, has voted consistently for measures that enabled and accelerated social inequality in the UK.The presence of so many old Etonians with regressive ideologies in our politics is not proof of our school’s intellectual brilliance. It is instead a grim indication of an economic ide in the UK so severe that the kind of people with the wealth and networks that make them likely to attend schools such as ours will increasingly end up in these positions. Before Cameron, there had not been an old Etonian prime minister since Alec Douglas-Home in 1964. Now they have been two of the last three to occupy No 10.If I look back at my time at Eton, I fondly remember many of my teachers and peers, and I recall a place that gave me a world-class education. But it was also a place where many of the most arrogant students were routinely awarded with positions of authority. I regularly heard working-class people referred to as “lebbage” – a play on the Latin word (I know, I know) for “the common people”. Though the school has many more black students now – when I was there, there were no more than three or four out of about 1,250 at any one time – Johnson’s brand of humour was far from being an outlier. Come on, we were only teenagers, you might say, eventually people grow up. Well, looking at our politics, it is clear that several of those people have not grown up they have merely aged.I am sadly not confident that Eton – the school and its alumni – is capable of looking at these issues in sufficient depth. A few months ago, I saw the headmaster launch a campaign in partnership with a national newspaper. The campaign was looking for applicants for a scholarship fund to study at the school a current Eton scholar was smiling out from the newspaper’s pages. The newspaper was the Sun, and this brilliant student was the son of refugees – just a few years previously one of the Sun’s columnists infamously referred to such people as “cockroaches” in the same week that hundreds were drowning in the Mediterranean. A more self-aware institution would have sought a media partner with a history of greater empathy for working-class black people than the Sun.It is unacceptable that, on the brink of Brexit, a country that claims to be global is directed by an ever more socially homogenous group. Whether Eton likes it or not, it cannot look at its most visible alumni – in effect, its ambassadors – in the political sphere and conclude that these are people who value compassion anywhere near as much as they value power. The UK deserves better leaders, from more socially conscious backgrounds, and it deserves them now.• Musa Okwonga is a poet, journalist and musician"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fe3c4bfb158ab7ae69845094b1ad3ee2d699502d/0_125_3824_2295/master/3824.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ab560a229d18a7b3701942e156f1648d","title":"poland citizens return uk support those staying","story":"In common with European countries – and increasingly the UK itself – Poland does not know quite what to make of Brexit.This is evident in the Polish ambassador Arkady Rzegocki’s letter to his compatriots on Tuesday, which reveals a conflict between the consular duty of care for Polish citizens amid the uncertainties of the protracted Brexit process and the political ambition of the Polish government to tempt back some of the 900,000 Poles who have migrated to the UK.So far, so diplomatic: the Polish state has a duty of care to provide advice and encouragement to its citizens to ensure they resolve their status and are not exposed to an additional period of uncertainty. However, it is the last paragraph of Rzegocki’s letter that has caught the attention of the British media. In a detour that strikes a rather odd tone in comparison with the rest of the letter, Rzegocki exhorts his compatriots to “seriously consider” returning to Poland.To focus on this seems a little unfair in the context of Rzegocki’s broader intentions, but it is characteristic of the conflict at the heart of Poland’s diplomatic response to Brexit. Immediately after the referendum, the then deputy prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, spoke of his regret at “losing” a million Polish citizens to the UK and expressed his hope that they would soon return. As prime minister, he was even more forthright about it: earlier this year, he called for Britain to “give us our people back”.The uncertainty surrounding the UK’s withdrawal from the EU only helps in this objective: in the face of the uncertain process of the EU settlement scheme, and amid concerns about the potential for a no-deal Brexit to create profound economic disruption, many Poles are reconsidering their stay in this country.There are some for whom Brexit is a catalyst for a long-deferred decision about the future. Many Poles originally came only temporarily and remained for much longer than they originally intended. Others are reflecting on the choices they face as they consider starting a family or the need to care for elderly parents in Poland. Most Polish migrants will probably opt to remain in the UK, but it is easy to understand why Rzegocki has sent his letter now.The upcoming Polish parliamentary elections, only a few weeks away, may also have entered into his thinking. The incumbent rightwing Law and Justice government is understandably keen to emphasise its economic record and anxious to make the case that it is taking active steps not only to stem the brain drain but to reverse it.However, attempts to contrast Brexit Britain as a land of confusion with an idyllic view of Poland as a land of opportunity collide with the stories of those who have returned. After years in another country, returning is a process: one that involves many of the same emotional and administrative challenges that are causing Poles to reconsider their lives in Britain.The current crisis is a result of the UK’s decision to leave, but the consular consequences of Poles not applying in time would very much be Poland’s problem, too.Most of the organisations providing support to Poles in the UK are funded by the UK Home Office, with no substantial input from the Polish authorities, who have so far limited their activities to the provision of general information about Brexit on the embassy’s website. Rzegocki is right to stress the risks associated with people not registering in time but given the variety of reasons why most Poles are yet to register, the Polish government needs to do much more than issue vague encouragement. Without a concerted effort to reach all parts of the UK where Poles live and work, and not just the small proportion who take heed of ambassadorial letters, it will be a case of all words and no action.An estimated 100,000 Poles here will participate in October’s Polish parliamentary elections, visiting about 50 polling stations organised by the embassy across the UK. These are citizens who evidently care enough about the future of their home country to exercise their democratic right to decide who will govern it. It could only be a positive thing if the Polish state were to use this opportunity to remind its citizens about the need to formalise their post-Brexit status in the UK, and leave it entirely up to them to make the decision about where they want to spend their future.• Jakub Krupa is a UK-based Polish journalist and social activist "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa1c4051aaff50e0522304d7a9ff70b1758a6071/0_131_3936_2362/master/3936.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=75ce3a922241ce116ef887fde435f356","title":"campaigners urge un to endorse global fracking ban","story":"Emma Thompson and Mark Ruffalo among signatories of open letter to secretary general A global campaign backed by 450 activist groups and celebrities, including actors Emma Thompson and Mark Ruffalo, is calling on the UN to endorse a global end to fracking before the industry torpedoes efforts to tackle the climate crisis.The open letter to UN secretary general António Guterres includes signatures from iniduals representing global environmental movements, universities and faith groups.The campaign also has backing from writer and activist Naomi Klein and fashion designer Vivienne Westwood.Fracking, or hydraulic fracturing, is a way of extracting natural gas from shale rock formations that are often deep underground. It involves pumping water, chemicals and usually sand underground at high pressure to fracture shale – hence the name – and release the gas trapped within to be collected back at the surface.The technology has transformed the US energy landscape in the last decade, owing to the combination of high-volume fracking – 1.5m gallons of water per well, on average – and the relatively modern ability to drill horizontally into shale after a vertical well has been drilled.In the UK, deployment of fracking has met with protests,\u0026nbsplegal challenges\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspplanning rejections. In November 2018\u0026nbsp energy company Cuadrilla was\u0026nbspforced to stop work\u0026nbspat its Preston New Road site in Lancashire twice in four days due to minor earthquakes occurring while it was fracking. The tremors breached a seismic threshold imposed after\u0026nbspfracking caused minor earthquakes at a nearby Cuadrilla site in 2011. In March 2019 the UK\u0027s High Court ruled that the government\u0027s fracking guidelines were \u0027unlawful\u0027 because they had failed to sufficiently consider scientific evidence against fracking.The open letter said fracking for fossil fuels “torpedoes our global efforts to tackle climate change and violates basic human rights”. Hydraulic fracturing is more commonly known as fracking and involves pumping water, chemicals and sand underground at high pressure to fracture shale rock and release trapped oil and gas.The open letter to the UN comes seven years after the UN Environment Programme issued a global alert on fracking, which concluded it may have adverse environmental impacts even if done properly.The letter also points to the “overwhelming scientific documenting” of the fracking industry’s negative impact on the environment, public health and the climate crisis. The activist signatories include members of Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth.Robert Howarth, a professor at Cornell University in the US and one of the letter’s signatories, said fracking for shale gas is a climate disaster because the process releases huge amounts of methane into the atmosphere.He said: “Over the past decade, methane levels have been rising rapidly in the atmosphere, contributing significantly to the unprecedented global climate disruption seen in recent years.”Methane is a far more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide and threatens to accelerate the pace of global heating.Emma Thompson, who also supported the climate protests led by Extinction Rebellion in central London earlier this year, said: “Fracking is the fossil fuel world’s worst idea to date” and called it “an affront to common sense, common health and the safety of the planet”.She added: “It’s pointless, expensive, doesn’t create jobs that will serve a community, but it does pollute, damage and contribute to wrecking the climate. Its poisonous presence in our green and pleasant land is an as a whole.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88d4577af82eebe330b74d8707c7999f7f9aafa5/212_0_1925_1155/master/1925.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=80ed3a8819fccdb3f1ccfbf83fc48d4a","title":"greta thunberg we are ignoring natural climate solutions","story":"Film by Swedish activist and  journalist George Monbiot says nature must be used to repair broken climateThe protection and restoration of living ecosystems such as forests, mangroves and seagrass meadows can repair the planet’s broken climate but are being overlooked, Greta Thunberg and George Monbiot have warned in a new short film.Their call to protect, restore and fund natural climate solutions comes ahead of a global climate strike led by young people on Friday and a UN climate action summit of world leaders in New York on Monday. The film will be shown to heads of state and the UN’s climate and bioersity chiefs in New York.“Right now, we are ignoring natural climate solutions,” said Thunberg. “We spend 1,000 times more on global fossil fuel subsidies than on nature-based solutions. This is your money, it is your taxes, and your savings.”“Nature is a tool we can use to repair our broken climate,” said Monbiot, an author and  journalist who founded a Natural Climate Solutions campaign earlier this year. “These solutions could make a massive difference, but only if we leave fossil fuels in the ground as well.”Shyla Raghav from Conservation International, which helped fund the film, said: “The fact is, we simply will not succeed in avoiding climate breakdown without nature.”Global carbon emissions must be halved in the next decade to avoid serious impacts from global heating, but they are still rising. It is therefore near certain that carbon dioxide will have to be removed from the atmosphere, and technology such as burying CO2 underground has not been demonstrated at scale.In the film, Monbiot says: “There is a magic machine that sucks carbon out of the air, costs very little, and builds itself. It’s called a tree.” A recent scientific analysis concluded that growing billions of trees across the world is the single biggest and cheapest way to tackle the climate crisis, though coal, oil and gas burning must also end.“We are living in the beginning of a mass extinction and our climate is breaking down,” says Thunberg in the film. “But we can still fix this – you can still fix this.”“It’s simple,” she says. “We need to protect, restore, and fund.” That means protecting tropical forests that are being cut down at the rate of 30 football pitches a minute, she said, restoring the large areas of the planet that have been damaged and stopping the funding of things that destroy nature and instead paying for activities that help it.The film’s producer, Tom Mustill of Gripping Films, said: “We tried to make the film have the tiniest environmental impact possible. We took trains to Sweden to interview Greta, charged our hybrid car at George’s house, used green energy to power the edit and recycled archive footage rather than shooting new.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/faa2caba3f7f9be916ef58fd217e4a98deaea91c/0_301_4517_2710/master/4517.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=66813a405033246dcfa99b0825051580","title":"penguin wild swimming new zealand australia","story":"Fiordland penguin found 170km west of Melbourne recuperates for eight weeks after 2,500km swim A New Zealand penguin that washed up on a beach in Victoria has been released back to the wild to complete a 2,500km swim home.The emaciated Fiordland penguin was found struggling against rocks in the shallows at Kennett River, 170km west of Melbourne, on 10 July.It was taken to Melbourne Zoo by the marine response unit and given a balance of fluids and nutrients until it was well enough to eat. Once it felt better, said Melbourne Zoo’s head of veterinary services, Dr Michael Lynch, it began to eat with gusto.Once the penguin had returned to a healthy weight – they are usually about 3.5kg – it was sent to Phillip Island Nature Parks to build up its swimming muscles in their larger pools, ready for the journey home to New Zealand.It was released this month after eight weeks’ recuperation.“We are hoping that it will get back to New Zealand and breed,” Lynch said. “We put a microchip into the bird so if it does turn up back in New Zealand one day and someone reads that microchip we will be very happy.”Melbourne is at the outer edge of the normal range for the IUCN red-listed species, which has breeding grounds on New Zealand’s south island and surrounding smaller islands.The global wild population of the penguins, which are listed as vulnerable, is estimated to be between 4,000 and 5,600.Lynch said the penguins had previously been very rare in Australia but had been turning up more in recent years, for reasons as yet unknown.“The species is known to forage over thousands of kilometres and we are within the edge of the range of this bird,” he said. “So it is not out of the question that we would see the birds here, but they are certainly a long way from home.”Other penguin species have also embarked on unlikely trans-Tasman trips.In 2014, a Snares penguin dubbed “Miss Simpson” was found on a Tasmanian beach some 2,000km from its home grounds of the Snares Islands, south of New Zealand, and spent nine months in recovery before being released.Scientists in New Zealand recently discovered that a little penguin colony near Otago in the South Island was made up of Australian invaders, little blue penguins that had colonised the area and replaced a similar local species 500 years ago."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0cc6e0559c3491963694284793e1973e9ab1e70e/0_0_911_657/master/911.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=5991d41fd0a4f8de84da259ff85d2fae 1440w","title":"off duty 2019s best casual clothes for men in pictures","story":"Whether weekends mean walks or watching films, our menswear editor sources the items that will ensure you’re relaxing in style"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44d147ae0edb2250a9a82c1dbe2c9b3b76eb480e/3_0_3022_1813/master/3022.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a4ab3111607c891e6558902883c76c5","title":"aardmans 20 best films ranked","story":"From early experiments in claymation TV to its forthcoming Shaun the Sheep big-screen sequel, we rate the animation studio’s outputAfter it was used for a perfume ad, Nina Simone’s jazz classic made it into the top 10 in the autumn of 1987. Inspired, no doubt, by the (non-Aardman) video for a successful re-release of Jackie Wilson’s Reet Petite earlier in the year, this music video became a second bite at claymation-meets-1950s. Peter Lord, who directed, went with a sultry singing cat and some artistic shots of piano keys.Aardman Animation secured a high-profile commission from Channel 4 at the end of the 80s: a five-part short film series called Lip Sync, mostly comprising animation of pre-recorded interview material. Next, directed by Barry Purves, deviates from the concept: its basic gag is that William Shakespeare himself is auditioning for an uninterested Peter Hall. On the stage, Shakespeare whizzes through references to every one of his plays Hall couldn’t be less impressed. Clever.A more orthodox interpretation of the Lip Sync concept: a small-time offender talks bluntly about prison life and how he became a law-breaker. It may not have the comedy disjunction of the more famous Creature Comforts short, from the same series, but the direct, untricksy treatment remains melancholy and even haunting.Steve Box, who would go on to direct the unlovely Spice Girls Viva Forever video and co-direct Curse of the Were-Rabbit, made his directorial debut with this impressive 11-minute short that mixes Nick Park-ish ingredients to considerably creepier effect. A vaudeville-act dog trainer called Tiny loses his confidence after clashing with Arnold, a hulking silent-film actor it all ends up a bit Phantom of the Opera. There’s something a little bit freaky about it.Lord was nominated for his first Oscar for this funny short, which showcases his more fingery, freeform style – compared to Park’s smoothly-polished modelling. A stream of jokes about the first created human, perched atop a tiny planet Earth, keeps this ticking along, with the real-flesh “hand of God” hammering points home. Not to get too meta, but there is some fun comment here on the god-like processes of claymation: Adam, after all, was fashioned out of clay in the first place. By the Lord. A coincidence? I think not.Aardman was founded by Lord and Dave Sproxton in 1972, and early jobs included the opening credits for The Great Egg Race and squeaking homunculus Morph on Take Hart. But it was its involvement in the amazingly successful promo for Peter Gabriel’s Sledgehammer single in 1986 that put it firmly on the map. Sledgehammer wasn’t strictly an Aardman production – it was directed by Stephen R Johnson (famous for Talking Heads’ Road to Nowhere) – but they did craft the still-spectacular animated sequences, which include painted clouds flitting across Gabriel’s face, Arcimboldo-esque singing vegetables and Park’s legendary dancing chickens. Even if it runs out of ideas a bit in the final third, it’s still a great watch.Lord stretched his narrative muscles with this rather lovely 11-minute short, which resulted in his second Oscar nomination. There is something of Monty Python in its medieval setting: twin princes, separated at birth, one growing up in the castle, the other in a hovel just outside. It’s the latter, of course, who has got the eponymous pig, the typically anthropomorphised critter beloved by Aardman, although perhaps not quite so instrumental to the narrative as Gromit. Lord’s deployment of a split screen, to parallel the brothers’ development, is inspired.Reports at the time suggested the production of this rodenty feature wasn’t the happiest experience for Aardman, as backers Dreamworks put the hammer down after disappointing box-office figures for their previous collaboration, The Curse of the Were-Rabbit. It shows on screen and led directly to the companies ending their agreement. Even if Aardman seems incapable of making a bad film, such is its iron grip on quality control, the pressure to abandon claymation and move into computer-generated animation led to a charm deficit. The film has got all the Aardman ingredients – quirky characters, relentless gags, top-notch voice cast – but there’s something a tiny bit inauthentic about its vision of an underground London and, of course, the shiny, flaw-free visuals are a long way from the Aardman stock-in-trade.The jewel in the crown of the Lip Synch series, and endlessly recycled since. Only five minutes long, Park’s film manages to be both brilliantly simple and fantastically audacious at the same time building on the idea of animating a vox pop interview (see Going Equipped, above) but switching in zoo animals to create a hilarious disjunction between voice and visuals. Not only did it nab the company’s first Oscar, but it also turned into Aardman’s financial safety net, via a string of popular TV ads in the 1990s and an ITV series in the 2000s.Aardman’s ability to attract the cream of British acting talent has been one of its strengths, but to get Eddie Redmayne hot off his Oscar win for The Theory of Everything was a major coup. He plays Dug, a bucktoothed cave-kid who spearheads a stone age tribe’s contest with a more sophisticated bronze age civilisation through the medium of football. Conceived, as usual, with Aardman’s amazing attention to detail, there’s something a little CBBC about the basic football-match idea in a World Cup year, a slightly anxious attempt to try to reach a mass audience. It’s still cute and funny, naturally.Adapted from Gideon Defoe’s Pirates! book, this is rather openly aimed at the primary school audience, with that title namechecking two key obsessions of the bookish kid. A great cast (including Hugh Grant, Imelda Staunton and David Tennant) give it their all if anything, they are hampered a little by an over-complex plot that shoehorns in a Pirate of the Year contest, Charles Darwin and a murderous Queen Victoria. It sounds great on paper, but ends up a little frenetic on screen.Deriving from a throwaway gag in A Close Shave, Shaun the Sheep has become a safety blanket franchise for Aardman: after 150 episodes of the kid-friendly TV show, the second feature is just about to hit cinemas. I can report that it’s well up to scratch: a Spielbergian story of Shaun’s encounter with a blue-and-pink alien bunny who crash lands on a local pizza joint and ends up on Mossy Bottom farm. As charming and unpretentious as it gets.In retrospect, it seems quixotic that this opening salvo in the Wallace and Gromit series should have lost to Creature Comforts at the 1991 Oscars. Of course, thoughts of a national-treasure franchise were unlikely to be on anyone’s mind at the time, but this 25-minute tea-cosy space epic rendered in Plasticine was surely robbed, if only by Nick Park himself. All the series’ key elements are here: the script’s north of England mannerisms the Jeeves-and-Wooster relationship of the central pair the sheer fiendish delight in the Heath Robinson contraption Wallace comes up with and the gentle knowingness of the film references. Compared with later efforts, it is perhaps not as drum-tight, story-wise (the wheeled cooker that wants to ski is still a headscratcher), but for a film school effort, it’s pretty sensational.Aardman had more success with its second stab at computer-animation: a fun Christmas movie directed by Sarah Smith and written by Peter Baynham. Like most Aardman films, this is notable for its terrific action sequences – kicking off with a legion of elf-ninjas slamming millions of presents across the planet on Christmas Eve. Although there are family resemblances, this is actually pretty different from your traditional Aardman film: less obviously idiosyncratic and a little more conventional in story terms, reflecting the non-Aardman pedigree of the key talent. But it is impeccably put together and goes down a treat.Park was fully into his stride with this third in the Wallace and Gromit series and it got him yet another Oscar as well as a prime Christmas slot on the BBC. Adopting a similar genre backstop as The Wrong Trousers – a robot dog plots to steal sheep – this non-stop cavalcade of whimsy introduces the concept of Wallace’s love life and a superb chase scene with Gromit’s detachable sidecar. As ever, the attention to detail and sense of atmosphere is fantastic.I have bit of a soft spot for this as I saw this being made the patina of tea-time cheeriness masks a painstaking labour of love for everyone who worked on it. Perhaps not the massive hit Aardman has always been searching for, but it is an undeniably successful foray into cross-platform franchising. If that sounds mercenary, it doesn’t come out in the film: it’s the most basically good-natured of Aardman’s films, with only gentle sparring between the enterprising Shaun and officious dog Bitzer.More romance for Wallace in what would turn out to be Peter Sallis’s last time in the role Wallace’s yearning for former model Piella Bakewell achieves an implausibly tragic dimension after Piella is unmasked as a serial killer, shortly before ending up as crocodile food. Conceived on near-identical lines to A Close Shave, this is faultlessly realised, with a magnificent example of the by-now traditional high-speed chase as Wallace takes off after Piella’s runaway bike. At the other end of the scale, Park shoehorns in a reference to James Cameron’s Aliens.Clearly, it is hard to choose between the Wallace and Gromit shorts, especially as Park hit such a high standard so early and maintained it so well. But The Wrong Trousers gets the nod because it crystallised so much of what Aardman brought to the table: the jokeysinister crime story the homely details and the astonishing application of real-world physics. The train chase scene has been rightly acclaimed – as exciting to watch as anything in Raiders of the Lost Ark – while Feathers McGraw, the penguin with the glove on his head, is an inscrutably memorable villain. Just as good 26 years on.A W\u0026ampG feature was no doubt inevitable, and after years of planning it finally emerged in 2005, in between the third and fourth shorts. If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it was clearly the motto: a genre-movie superstructure (Hammer horror) a lovelorn Wallace ridiculously complicated home inventions and thrillingly inventive chases. The directors, Nick Park and Steve Box, imported major guest-acting talent, in the shape of Helena Bonham Carter and Ralph Fiennes – and it’s possible that Aardman unlocked Fiennes’s comedy gene, more recently seen in The Grand Budapest Hotel and A Bigger Splash. Were-Rabbit does all that the short films do, only on a bigger canvas the payoff for the audience is proportionately larger.I will admit that I was bit of a sceptic when Aardman announced it would move into feature films after it had signed its deal with Dreamworks. Could this comfy-cardigan cottage industry outfit with a few TV shorts behind it really do it on the big stage? But Aardman’s first full-length film, masterminded by Park and Lord, remains a treat that even the ensuing disgrace of Mel Gibson can’t ruin. Like all Aardman films, this has a simple premise – The Great Escape with chickens – but such is the animators’ ability to humanise the birds’ plight that it turns into an improbably emotional epic. It is also arguably Julia Sawalha’s finest hour – she voices Ginger, the feisty hen who practically forces her dozy fellow chickens to save themselves – while Gibson does a fine job of Rocky, the rooster who becomes the great hope of saving everyone from the dreaded pie machine. The film proved that Aardman could hold its own with Hollywood’s great animation traditions, as a beautifully judged balance was struck between the two. Chicken Run was a massive hit, too, giving Aardman some elbow room but it didn’t last long.

Imagine a British period movie and what you picture may not look like The Last Tree, the film he has written and directed. But that is what it is: set in the early 00s, an era whose signifiers are as precise as steam trains or bonnets – a CD Walkman and a tiny Nokia used to make calls, in a story set in rural Lincolnshire, south London and Lagos, Nigeria.“I’m not sure a film like this has been a thing in British cinema before,” Amoo says, genial and self-contained. “But it’s a thing now.”As a film-maker of colour producing a portrait of black boyhood in three vivid acts, comparisons to Barry Jenkins and Moonlight are inevitable. Yet The Last Tree has a brilliance all its own. The hero is Femi (played first by the young actor Tai Golding, then a fellow newcomer, Sam Adewunmi). We meet him aged 11 in the care of a white foster mother deep in the English countryside, before his Nigerian birth mother reclaims him. Fast forward and he is 16, unravelling in London. Lagos awaits.The film is billed as semi-autobiographical. As a child, Amoo was also fostered by a white carer in a “monochromatic” small town. Then came reunion with his Nigerian family and a new start in south London. “There was a lot of dissonance for a kid,” he says. “Leaving somewhere you thought was home to go to this place that is apparently your real home, and then there’s this whole other place everyone else knows and you don’t.”Now in his 30s, Amoo still lives in the stretch of London where he spent his later childhood. Shooting in Elephant and Castle, he rarely had to walk more than 10 minutes from his flat. One location was outside his old secondary school, Geoffrey Chaucer. “It could feel like therapy.” He calls The Last Tree a search for identity. Much of his own life, he says, might be described the same way.Yet, not so fast. Semi-autobiographical, he insists, means exactly that. The film is at once his story and not. Details erge – he was not brought up in a single-parent household, for instance, but within a “family family” – while Femi has his own narrative arc. Some of that is down to Amoo ringfencing his privacy. “It’s important I hold some things back.” He also wants to represent the stories of other people of colour he has met who were similarly fostered. Many, he says, have been left traumatised.Amoo was a bright and inquisitive child. He read the Odyssey and Malcolm X before he was out of his teens. At university, he studied journalism. Required to make a documentary, he made a short film about the stabbing of a friend. Something clicked. “I realised film could hold everything that fascinated me: literature, music, performance.” The issue was logistics. “I graduated broke. So broke! And no contacts. The question was: ‘How do I even do this?’”One answer involved a scheme for young writers at the Royal Court theatre. Practical experience came via making videos for early grime artists in the days of urban music TV station Channel U. Amoo cracks up laughing. “I’m still convinced that whole operation was a police setup to get young men to hand over testimony.” Eventually, in 2016, he made his first feature, A Moving Image, about gentrification in Brixton. The film made a splash with a daredevil blend of scripted drama and vérité street life.It was also a blueprint. While Amoo hungered to tell black stories, he wanted to do it “transformatively”. He pulled together a crew with a black cinematographer, editor and composer – rare in British film. On screen, the aim was to upend expectations. “With The Last Tree, I said from the start: ‘OK, this is a coming-of-age that will subvert. Cinematically, politically. All of it.’”The Last Tree opens in the Wash, the improbably flat zone of coastal Lincolnshire with which Amoo became besotted while visiting a former girlfriend. The black community in rural eastern England is small. The nearest major town to the shoot, Boston, recorded the UK’s highest leave vote in 2016. Many directors would site it as a hotbed of racism. To Amoo, the more radical choice was an idyll for the young Femi. “No one expects to see a happy black kid in that environment, just living life. But somewhere that remote, a carer can filter out a lot.”In London, Amoo created a child’s-eye view, a world of noise and dazzle, tower blocks like brutalist spaceships. “I’m bored of films that demonise estates,” he says. “I’ve seen that one-note gritty cliche. Some of the prettiest shots in the film are in the hood.” While crime and violence lurk, the older Femi also experiences young love and everyday rebellion, gawky mates shoplifting mouthwash. “We know young black men are routinely criminalised, but I wanted to let black kids have moments of pure teenage joy that have always been denied them on screen. All the kids I knew stole a bunch of shit from shops and no one had to go to jail!”Growing up in the 00s was an obstacle course of other people’s norms. “There was so much fear among my peers of stepping into what was culturally seen as white territory. I never paid attention.” In The Last Tree, the CD Walkman introduces Femi to the Cure, a detail Amoo did pluck direct from reality. “I never saw them as ‘not for me’. I loved Robert Smith’s energy. It was such a pleasure to reframe them.”Reframed, too, is Lagos, a city of shantytowns, luxury and 21 million lives in motion. Amoo did not visit Nigeria until he was in his 20s. Now, he does so regularly. But it was filming there, he says, that made him see the connection between his three locations. “My Lagos wasn’t going to be a tourist postcard or poverty porn. The place is complicated. Endless different things at once. Then it hit me – that was just like London, just like Lincolnshire.”Back in Britain amid the current chaos, Amoo says he feels oddly at peace. “I’m going counterclockwise, right?” But then, the national meltdown involves ideas he has wrestled with for years. “I couldn’t articulate Britishness. It never felt like it was meant for me. I understand London because it’s the city I grew up in. I understand Nigeria because it’s the house I grew up in. Beyond that? I’m working class, but people might say I make films so I must be middle class. I’m black, because that’s how everyone here perceives me. But in Nigeria that is only a starting point.”If The Last Tree began as a search for identity, Amoo now rephrases the question. “It’s identities. And the answer is in multiple locations.”• The Last Tree will be out in UK cinemas on 27 September"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/219aa33b100e47d3751bc6f4ad26880839be75da/0_7_4395_2637/master/4395.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=deda6d91b17876c692ed428c7a5a4dde","title":"the return of the champions league football weekly extra","story":"Max Rushden, Barry Glendenning, Faye Carruthers and Philippe Auclair discuss action in the Champions League group stage as three of the four English teams stumbled, plus a rugby XV of current and former playersWe discuss the return of the Champions League group stages, as Liverpool, Tottenham and Chelsea all failed to make winning starts.

To be fair it’s not always Hamish who’s somehow ended up in Turkey Street rather than Winchmore Hill, but it usually is. Every side has a Hamish. No matter how many times you announce on the WhatsApp group to meet an hour before kick-off, no matter how many urgent messages you send – “better leave early it’s a replacement bus service”... “Changing room 3” ... “PITCH 4, WE’VE TAKEN THE KIT OUT” – you know he’ll be there, ambling slowly towards the pitch with all the time in the world, his boots in a plastic bag as the referee is doing the toss.But it doesn’t matter. Because he’s good. And good players can turn up when they like.As the traditional lineup of Europe’s finest – rogue states, oligarchs and energy drinks companies – began their quest for glory in the Champions League this week, it’s sometimes hard to remember that the hundreds of thousands of us who will turn out over the weekend are playing the same game.For years I have suggested professionals of all sports should have to endure amateur conditions just once. A Ronnie O’Sullivan 147 would be even more impressive if one cushion was two feet from the wall and he had to contort his cue at right angles above his head. Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal should have one tin of tennis balls, including a grey one that doesn’t bounce, and keep playing until all of them are in the net or over on Court 2. Who doesn’t want to see Rory McIlroy carry his own clubs and reach into his bag for a tee only to pull out a banana that’s been there since the last time it was sunny?And professional footballers should have to put up the goal nets, play in a shrunken tumble dried kit, and deal with three players dropping out on a Saturday morning.The job of trying to get 14 adults to the same place at the same time once a week sounds straightforward. In reality it’s the single most difficult task many of us will ever undertake.I dread looking at my phone on a Saturday morning. Science decided last year that the anticipation of receiving a text message gives you a hit of dopamine. It’s addictive. We are now conditioned to look forward to the flash and buzz of an incoming WhatsApp.But there’s no dopamine on a Saturday. Instead, there’s Scott. His motorbike is broken and his grandad’s van is in the garage. I have four hours to find a goalkeeper. I check Kyle’s WhatsApp. Last seen at 3.45am. He won’t last 20 minutes.Recruitment is now a 247 job – thousands of amateur Marcel Brands – wandering the streets, trying to find anyone with some Puma Kings. It works sometimes – I found a goalkeeper who’d come through the ranks with Joe Hart at Shrewsbury while I was cooking a pork schnitzel for Linda Bellingham on the set of a Channel 4 food show. One Friday last season I was hosting a  Football Weekly live event in Hackney. I had only nine men for the trip to Alexandra Park the following day. While the show mattered – I needed players.I took to the stage and explained my situation. Would anyone like a game? £12. You’d need red socks and black shorts. Five hands shot up.Flippantly I asked if anyone from Alexandra Park was in the audience. Another hand. “I’m the club secretary.” This was unfortunate. But after a few frantic emails all the registrations were sorted by our own secretary Barry – seemingly on hand any hour of the day to help guide players through the ridiculous number of FA hoops needed before. There are thousands of Barrys up and down the country keeping this sport alive.The game took place on Donkey Lane – a wide expanse of land with one of those Sunday league microclimates that turns even the lightest breeze into a force 10 gale.We had what you’d call a five-goal wind in the first half. Goal kicks sailing into the sky and blowing out for a corner, the spindlier players barely able to stand. It felt more like an expedition to that big queue on Everest. 3-2 up at the break, we kept it to that in the second half – one which I’d played no role in – aside from hiding under coats on the touchline.Every Saturday is now an existential crisis. One ACL hangs on by a thread, hidden behind the failing placebo of a ragged neoprene support. The ankle below it gave way under no pressure in pre-season. When I am “fit” I spend the game running after people half my age, questioning my worth with every desperate tackle – players are so much quicker now I can’t even foul them.Every year, there are reports of numbers dropping, of pitches being unusable, of violence against refs and players, of teams dropping out of the leagues mid season up. It’s getting more expensive. Solutions rarely get past unworkable attempts to filter money from the top of the game to the grassroots. Quite why Kevin De Bruyne should pay my £150 subs I don’t know.You can’t force people to play, but there have to be ways to make it easier, more affordable and more accessible for anyone who’s keen. I genuinely don’t know what I’d do without it.The tireless cliches – “first and second”, “don’t let it bounce”, “they don’t want it”, “still 0-0”.The smell of Deep Heat, the devastation when the showers are cold in Gunnersbury Park, the opposition centre-back reeking of booze, throwing up on the touchline and blaming it on a “tight collar”, that (increasingly rare) feeling of scoring a goal – there is no better.So good luck to anyone who’s trying to find their shin pads on Friday evening – one is normally down the side of the washing machine. Try and be on time. And don’t text your skipper at midnight saying you’re not going to make it."},{"url":null,"title":"sega mega drive mini review a legacy truly honoured","story":"Perfectly modelled and smoothly animated, the 42 built-in games are lovingly reproduced, with modern gaming benefits. It’s a delightful surpriseIt’s been almost three years since Nintendo launched its diminutive NES Mini console and discovered a vast audience for stylish retro hardware. Since then, it has re-released the NES Classic Mini and launched an SNES sequel, while Sony has clambered artlessly on to the bandwagon with an uncharacteristically mediocre offering, the PlayStation Classic. Now Sega has joined the fray, its official Mega Drive Mini set to banish memories of the fairly awful Mega Drive retro consoles produced by third-party manufacturer At Games.The result is a wonderfully cute and detailed reproduction of the original Mega Drive model, sensibly priced at £70. Although it’s small enough to fit in the palm of your hand, it packs in accurate cosmetic features such as a volume switch, side grille and extension port, closely mimicking the ghetto blaster form of the 1988 machine. It is kind of a shame that the volume control is non-functional – a headphone port would have been a lovely extra, but doubtless prohibitively expensive to include.The USB ports on the front support the two control pads supplied, which are perfectly modelled to resemble the authentic controllers. You can’t plug in your old pads, sadly, which means if you want to use a six-button pad to get the most out of titles such as Street Fighter II Special Champion Edition and Eternal Champions, you’ll have buy the separately available updated version.Switch it on and you get a simple but authentically 1990s-styled menu, which shows each of the 40 games with their original box art. There’s even a wonderfully nostalgic score by Yuzo Koshiro, who used the original Yamaha YM2612 sound chip for his jaunty composition. A settings menu lets you swap between widescreen and original 4:3 ratio, and there’s also the choice to add CRT-style scan lines to the image, although the emulation is so good you don’t need to bother. Veteran Tokyo developer M2 has handled the process, building on its work with the brilliant Sega Ages retro game collections for the Xbox, Switch and PlayStation.The result is a crystal clear, smoothly animated reproduction of the Mega Drive experience that is sympathetic to the machine’s processing capabilities and colour palette while making the games feel fresh and lively. Importantly, we’re offered key benefits of modern gaming: the Mega Drive mini lets you save games at any point so you don’t have to complete the whole of Gunstar Heroes in one sitting. Unlike the Nintendo machines, there’s no rewind function, but it’s still a huge step up from the PlayStation Classic and it makes a lot of these incredibly demanding titles more accessible to today’s spoiled players.The real beauty of this machine, however, is the thoughtfully curated games library. There are 42 built-in games to discover (Tetris and Darius were never released and get their debuts here) – that’s twice the number offered on the PlayStation Classic or Nintendo SNES Mini. There are plenty of bona fide classics: the first two Sonic Titles, Ecco the Dolphin, ToeJam and Earl, all as slick and colourful as veterans will remember.From here, we get a great spread of the console’s key genres, with shooters such as Gunstar Heroes and Thunder Force III, action RPGs Light Crusader and Story of Thor, and scrolling platformers Dynamite Headdy and Castle of Illusion. Every one of them still has pleasure and spectacle to offer. It’s also noticeable that Sega has chosen the best titles in long-running franchises, rather than always opting for the originals – so we’re offered the far superior Streets of Rage 2 and Shinobi III. There’s also the option to play the Japanese versions of all the titles, which in some cases – including Probotector (known as Contra Hard Corps in Japan) – have key differences.After years of second-rate retro consoles besmirching the Mega Drive name, the official Sega Mega Drive Mini is a delightful surprise. It is well constructed and reverential to the work of hardware designer Mitsushige Shiraiwa, who modelled the original machine on expensive audio equipment and sports-car interiors. It also has a generous selection of titles that have been skilfully emulated, many of which are hard to buy or ruinously expensive in their cartridge form. Hearing the haunting Probotector soundtrack, seeing the giant colourful Shinobi sprites, watching Mickey Mouse skipping through the corridors of the Castle of Illusion, will bring back warm memories for those of us around at the time, and have lasting aesthetic charm for those who weren’t.The Mega Drive, already well served by the more high-end and specialist Mega Sg, now has a mainstream update for everyone. This is the machine that did what Nintendo didn’t – and that legacy has been truly honoured here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c90fd30cd477514999b33c6b7bb3f872aeba5908/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a1569c295da6d1e297ba36b2f3cc4db8","title":"women looking unapproachable could be your greatest asset","story":"Meeting the world with a ‘resting bitch face’ may not be what society demands, but it protects you against unsolicited male attention in publicWith girls as young as 13 years old now opting for Botox, it is clear that ageing is no longer the only thing women are trying to ward off. An article in the New York Post has noted a rise in women seeking plastic surgery to “fix” their so-called “resting bitch face”. This is a women-only affliction, where, even when wearing a neutral expression, you appear perpetually standoffish. In reality, it refers to any time that a woman’s facial expression is set in anything less than a smile.According to one doctor quoted in the piece, the number of requests for the procedure have more than doubled in the past year. This isn’t exactly shocking – women are made to feel bad about just about everything in terms of their appearance – but to me it seems many of these women are getting rid of something that is actually a great asset.In a world where simply being a woman is considered an invitation for unsolicited comments and unwarranted conversation from complete strangers, looking unfriendly is useful armour. It can, at times, be the only barrier between a woman and unwanted small talk on the tube, or a bar. Or on a run. Or on the high street. Or a public bench. Or even while in the middle of conversation with someone else. Heckling and catcalling are rife – should we not at least be allowed to look less than pleased about it?But that would grossly overestimate the amount of emotional intelligence and shame some men have. Because, like anything else, looking grim-faced can be, in and of itself, an invitation. If I had a quid for each of the times I have heard: “Smile, love, it might never happen” shouted at me across the street, I might have the money to rid myself of my own “resting bitch face”. When men say this, it never seems to occur to them that whatever the “it” in question is, it has probably already happened – one look at the world around you should be enough to realise there is often little to smile about. Yet Victoria Beckham’s signature scowl and Kristen Stewart’s tendency to mean-mug have merely culminated in more column inches requesting they turn that frown upside down or, at least, into something that is slightly less offputting.What all this tells us is that women must be amiable and approachable by default. Even when we’re not interacting, we must be poised and primed to do so. Tellingly, there is no “resting grumpy bastard face” equivalent for men – people are far less concerned about faces they don’t deem public property."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42e10c65cc02dcf1926da4c6c8e2da3be9212c9b/0_208_3200_1920/master/3200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=43b05fb71a34a603990dc0e67ced036b","title":"bbc to move more staff and services out of london","story":"Director general wants to see broadcaster ‘embedded’ around UK but relocations can prove hard to sellThe BBC is planning to reduce its presence in London and move more staff and services to other parts of the UK.Tony Hall, the BBC director general, said while the corporation had made “enormous strides” in reducing its focus on the capital in recent years more needed to be done.“I want the BBC to be the organisation that is fully embedded and distributed around the UK,” Hall is expected to tell the Royal Television Society convention in Cambridge.“But I want us to think bigger. Imagine a world in which the BBC moved still more out of London. It would take time. But what an enormous creative and operational opportunity.”The corporation’s biggest hub outside London is in Salford, Manchester, where its BBC North headquarters at MediaCityUK were opened in 2011. London-based departments including parts of Radio 5 Live, BBC Sport, Children’s, Learning and BBC Breakfast moved to the facility.The broadcaster also has large operational hubs in Glasgow and Belfast and significant production centres in Cardiff, Bristol and Birmingham.The BBC received a similar proportion of refusals to move to MediaCityUK, while just 31 of 144 agreed to relocate to operations in Birmingham, which is home to services including half of the BBC Three operation and a youth team for BBC News.Relocating is also expensive and the BBC estimates the lifetime cost of the move to Salford, including operating costs for the site up to 2030, to be £942m. The National Audit Office criticised the BBC for overly generous relocation packages totalling £24m to entice London staff to move to Salford. Channel 4 has estimated that its move out of London will ultimately cost about £50m."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44be23f818f2edeaf5d43a4044d2338712c48dbd/1124_1020_3628_2177/master/3628.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=33be8d4269f7fd06023a6cba78a49d5f","title":"why cant we agree on whats true anymore","story":"It’s not about foreign trolls, filter bubbles or fake news. Technology encourages us to believe we can all have first-hand access to the ‘real’ facts – and now we can’t stop fighting about it. By  William DaviesWe live in a time of political fury and hardening cultural ides. But if there is one thing on which virtually everyone is agreed, it is that the news and information we receive is biased. Every second of every day, someone is complaining about bias, in everything from the latest movie reviews to sports commentary to the BBC’s coverage of Brexit. These complaints and controversies take up a growing share of public discussion.Much of the outrage that floods social media, occasionally leaking into opinion columns and broadcast interviews, is not simply a reaction to events themselves, but to the way in which they are reported and framed. The “mainstream media” is the principal focal point for this anger. Journalists and broadcasters who purport to be neutral are a constant object of scrutiny and derision, whenever they appear to let their personal views slip. The work of journalists involves an increasing amount of unscripted, real-time discussion, which provides an occasionally troubling window into their thinking.But this is not simply an anti-journalist sentiment. A similar fury can just as easily descend on a civil servant or independent expert whenever their veneer of neutrality seems to crack, apparently revealing prejudices underneath. Sometimes a report or claim is dismissed as biased or inaccurate for the simple reason that it is unwelcome: to a Brexiter, every bad economic forecast is just another case of the so-called project fear. A sense that the game is rigged now fuels public debate.This mentality now s the entire political spectrum and pervades societies around the world. A recent survey found that the majority of people globally believe their society is broken and their economy is rigged. Both the left and the right feel misrepresented and misunderstood by political institutions and the media, but the anger is shared by many in the liberal centre, who believe that populists have gamed the system to harvest more attention than they deserve. Outrage with “mainstream” institutions has become a mass sentiment.This spirit of indignation was once the natural property of the left, which has long resented the establishment bias of the press. But in the present culture war, the right points to universities, the BBC and civil service as institutions that twist our basic understanding of reality to their own ends. Everyone can point to evidence that justifies their outrage. This arms race in cultural analysis is unwinnable.This is not as simple as distrust. The appearance of digital platforms, smartphones and the ubiquitous surveillance they enable has ushered in a new public mood that is instinctively suspicious of anyone claiming to describe reality in a fair and objective fashion. It is a mindset that begins with legitimate curiosity about what motivates a given media story, but which ends in a Trumpian refusal to accept any mainstream or official account of the world. We can all probably locate ourselves somewhere on this spectrum, between the curiosity of the engaged citizen and the corrosive cynicism of the climate denier. The question is whether this mentality is doing us any good, either inidually or collectively.Public life has become like a play whose audience is unwilling to suspend disbelief. Any utterance by a public figure can be unpicked in search of its ulterior motive. As cynicism grows, even judges, the supposedly neutral upholders of the law, are publicly accused of personal bias. Once doubt descends on public life, people become increasingly dependent on their own experiences and their own beliefs about how the world really works. One effect of this is that facts no longer seem to matter (the phenomenon misleadingly dubbed “post-truth”). But the crisis of democracy and of truth are one and the same: iniduals are increasingly suspicious of the “official” stories they are being told, and expect to witness things for themselves.On one level, heightened scepticism towards the establishment is a welcome development. A more media-literate and critical citizenry ought to be less easy for the powerful to manipulate. It may even represent a victory for the type of cultural critique pioneered by intellectuals such as Pierre Bourdieu and Stuart Hall in the 1970s and 80s, revealing the injustices embedded in everyday cultural expressions and interactions.But it is possible to have too much scepticism. How exactly do we distinguish this critical mentality from that of the conspiracy theorist, who is convinced that they alone have seen through the official version of events? Or to turn the question around, how might it be possible to recognise the most flagrant cases of bias in the behaviour of reporters and experts, but nevertheless to accept that what they say is often a reasonable depiction of the world?It is tempting to blame the internet, populists or foreign trolls for flooding our otherwise rational society with lies. But this underestimates the scale of the technological and philosophical transformations that are under way. The single biggest change in our public sphere is that we now have an unimaginable excess of news and content, where once we had scarcity. Suddenly, the analogue channels and professions we depended on for our knowledge of the world have come to seem partial, slow and dispensable.And yet, contrary to initial hype surrounding big data, the explosion of information available to us is making it harder, not easier, to achieve consensus on truth. As the quantity of information increases, the need to pick out bite-size pieces of content rises accordingly. In this radically sceptical age, questions of where to look, what to focus on and who to trust are ones that we increasingly seek to answer for ourselves, without the help of intermediaries. This is a liberation of sorts, but it is also at the heart of our deteriorating confidence in public institutions.The current threat to democracy is often seen to emanate from new forms of propaganda, with the implication that lies are being deliberately fed to a naive and over-emotional public. The simultaneous rise of populist parties and digital platforms has triggered well-known anxieties regarding the fate of truth in democratic societies. Fake news and internet echo chambers are believed to manipulate and ghettoise certain communities, for shadowy ends. Key groups – millennials or the white working-class, say – are accused of being easily persuadable, thanks to their excessive sentimentality.This diagnosis exaggerates old-fashioned threats while overlooking new phenomena. Over-reliant on analogies to 20th century totalitarianism, it paints the present moment as a moral conflict between truth and lies, with an unthinking public passively consuming the results. But our relationship to information and news is now entirely different: it has become an active and critical one, that is deeply suspicious of the official line. Nowadays, everyone is engaged in spotting and rebutting propaganda of one kind or another, curating our news feeds, attacking the framing of the other side and consciously resisting manipulation. In some ways, we have become too concerned with truth, to the point where we can no longer agree on it. The very institutions that might once have brought controversies to an end are under constant fire for their compromises and biases.The threat of misinformation and propaganda should not be denied. As the scholars Yochai Benkler, Robert Faris and Hal Roberts have shown in their book Network Propaganda, there is now a self-sustaining information ecosystem on the American right through which conspiracy theories and untruths get recycled, between Breitbart, Fox News, talk radio and social media. Meanwhile, the anti-vaxx movement is becoming a serious public health problem across the world, aided by the online circulation of conspiracy theories and pseudo-science. This is a situation where simple misinformation poses a serious threat to society.Trust in the media is low, but this entrenched scepticism long predates the internet or contemporary populism. From the Sun’s lies about Hillsborough to the BBC’s failure to expose Jimmy Savile as early as they might, to the fevered enthusiasm for the Iraq war that gripped much of Fleet Street, the British public has had plenty of good reasons to distrust journalists. Even so, the number of people in the UK who trust journalists to tell the truth has actually risen slightly since the 1980s.What, then, has changed? The key thing is that the elites of government and the media have lost their monopoly over the provision of information, but retain their prominence in the public eye. They have become more like celebrities, anti-heroes or figures in a reality TV show. And digital platforms now provide a public space to identify and rake over the flaws, biases and falsehoods of mainstream institutions. The result is an increasingly sceptical citizenry, each seeking to manage their media diet, checking up on inidual journalists in order to resist the pernicious influence of the establishment.There are clear and obvious benefits to this, where it allows hateful and manipulative journalism to be called out. It is reassuring to discover the large swell of public sympathy for the likes of Ben Stokes and Gareth Thomas, and their families, who have been harassed by the tabloids in recent days. But this also generates a mood of outrage, which is far more focused on denouncing bad and biased reporting than with defending the alternative. Across the political spectrum, we are increasingly distracted and enraged by what our adversaries deem important and how they frame it. It is not typically the media’s lies that provoke the greatest fury online, but the discovery that an important event has been ignored or downplayed. While it is true that arguments rage over dodgy facts and figures (concerning climate change or the details of Britain’s trading relations), many of the most bitter controversies of our news cycle concern the framing and weighting of different issues and how they are reported, rather than the facts of what actually happened.The problem we face is not, then, that certain people are oblivious to the “mainstream media”, or are victims of fake news, but that we are all seeking to see through the veneer of facts and information provided to us by public institutions. Facts and official reports are no longer the end of the story. Such scepticism is healthy and, in many ways, the just deserts of an establishment that has been caught twisting the truth too many times. But political problems arise once we turn against all representations and framings of reality, on the basis that these are compromised and biased – as if some purer, unmediated access to the truth might be possible instead. This is a seductive, but misleading ideal.Every human culture throughout history has developed ways to record experiences and events, allowing them to endure. From early modern times, liberal societies have developed a wide range of institutions and professions whose work ensures that events do not simply pass without trace or public awareness. Newspapers and broadcasters share reports, photographs and footage of things that have happened in politics, business, society and culture. Court documents and the Hansard parliamentary reports provide records of what has been said in court and in parliament. Systems of accounting, audit and economics help to establish basic facts of what takes place in businesses and markets.Traditionally, it is through these systems, which are grounded in written testimonies and public statements, that we have learned what is going on in the world. But in the past 20 years, this patchwork of record-keeping has been supplemented and threatened by a radically different system, which is transforming the nature of empirical evidence and memory. One term for this is “big data”, which highlights the exponential growth in the quantity of data that societies create, thanks to digital technologies.The reason there is so much data today is that more and more of our social lives are mediated digitally. Internet browsers, smartphones, social media platforms, smart cards and every other smart interface record every move we make. Whether or not we are conscious of it, we are constantly leaving traces of our activities, no matter how trivial.But it is not the escalating quantity of data that constitutes the radical change. Something altogether new has occurred that distinguishes today’s society from previous epochs. In the past, recording devices were principally trained upon events that were already acknowledged as important. Journalists did not just report news, but determined what counted as newsworthy. TV crews turned up at events that were deemed of national significance. The rest of us kept our cameras for noteworthy occasions, such as holidays and parties.The ubiquity of digital technology has thrown all of this up in the air. Things no longer need to be judged “important” to be captured. Consciously, we photograph events and record experiences regardless of their importance. Unconsciously, we leave a trace of our behaviour every time we swipe a smart card, address Amazon’s Alexa or touch our phone. For the first time in human history, recording now happens by default, and the question of significance is addressed separately.This shift has prompted an unrealistic set of expectations regarding possibilities for human knowledge. As many of the original evangelists of big data liked to claim, when everything is being recorded, our knowledge of the world no longer needs to be mediated by professionals, experts, institutions and theories. Instead, they argued that the data can simply “speak for itself”. Patterns will emerge, traces will come to light. This holds out the prospect of some purer truth than the one presented to us by professional editors or trained experts. As the Australian surveillance scholar Mark Andrejevic has brilliantly articulated, this is a fantasy of a truth unpolluted by any deliberate human intervention – the ultimate in scientific objectivity.Andrejevic argues that the rise of this fantasy coincides with growing impatience with the efforts of reporters and experts to frame reality in meaningful ways. He writes that “we might describe the contemporary media moment – and its characteristic attitude of sceptical savviness regarding the contrivance of representation – as one that implicitly embraces the ideal of framelessness”. From this perspective, every controversy can in principle be settled thanks to the vast trove of data – CCTV, records of digital activity and so on – now available to us. Reality in its totality is being recorded, and reporters and officials look dismally compromised by comparison.One way in which seemingly frameless media has transformed public life over recent years is in the elevation of photography and video as arbiters of truth, as opposed to written testimony or numbers. “Pics or it didn’t happen” is a jokey barb sometimes thrown at social media users when they share some unlikely experience. It is often a single image that seems to capture the truth of an event, only now there are cameras everywhere. No matter how many times it is disproven, the notion that “the camera doesn’t lie” has a peculiar hold over our imaginations. In a society of blanket CCTV and smartphones, there are more cameras than people, and the torrent of data adds to the sense that the truth is somewhere amid the deluge, ignored by mainstream accounts. The central demand of this newly sceptical public is “so show me”.This transformation in our recording equipment is responsible for much of the outrage directed at those formerly tasked with describing the world. The rise of blanket surveillance technologies has paradoxical effects, raising expectations for objective knowledge to unrealistic levels, and then provoking fury when those in the public eye do not meet them.On the one hand, data science appears to make the question of objective truth easier to settle. Slow and imperfect institutions of social science and journalism can be circumvented, and we can get directly to reality itself, unpolluted by human bias. Surely, in this age of mass data capture, the truth will become undeniable.On the other hand, as the quantity of data becomes overwhelming – greater than human intelligence can comprehend – our ability to agree on the nature of reality seems to be declining. Once everything is, in principle, recordable, disputes heat up regarding what counts as significant in the first place. It turns out that the “frames” that journalists and experts use to reduce and organise information are indispensable to its coherence and meaning.What we are discovering is that, once the limitations on data capture are removed, there are escalating opportunities for conflict over the nature of reality. Every time a mainstream media agency reports the news, they can instantly be met with the retort: but what about this other event, in another time and another place, that you failed to report? What about the bits you left out? What about the other voters in the town you didn’t talk to? When editors judge the relative importance of stories, they now confront a panoply of alternative judgements. Where records are abundant, fights break out over relevance and meaning.Professional editors have always faced the challenge of reducing long interviews to short consumable chunks and discarding the majority of photos or text. Editing is largely a question of what to throw away. This necessitates value judgements, that readers and audiences once had little option but to trust. Now, however, the question of which image or sentence is truly significant opens irresolvable arguments. One person’s offcut is another person’s revealing nugget. Political agendas can be pursued this way, including cynical ones aimed at painting one’s opponents in the worst possible light. An absurd or extreme voice can be represented as typical of a political movement (known as “nutpicking”). Taking quotes out of context is one of the most disruptive of online ploys, which provokes far more fury than simple insults. Rather than deploying lies or “fake news”, it messes with the significance of data, taking the fact that someone did say or write something, but violating their intended meaning. No doubt professional journalists have always descended to such tactics from time to time, but now we are all at it, provoking a vicious circle of misrepresentation.Then consider the status of photography and video. It is not just that photographic evidence can be manipulated to mislead, but that questions will always survive regarding camera angle and context. What happened before or after a camera started rolling? What was outside the shot? These questions provoke suspicion, often with good reason.The most historic example of such a controversy predates digital media. The Zapruder film, which captured the assassination of John F Kennedy, became the most scrutinised piece of footage in history. The film helped spawn countless conspiracy theories, with inidual frames becoming the focus of controversies, with competing theories as to what they reveal. The difficulty of completely squaring any narrative with a photographic image is a philosophical one as much as anything, and the Zapruder film gave a glimpse of the sorts of media disputes that have become endemic now cameras are ubiquitous parts of our social lives and built environments.Today, minor gestures that would usually have passed without comment only a decade ago become pored over in search of their hidden message. What did Emily Maitlis mean when she rolled her eyes at Barry Gardiner on Newsnight? What was Jeremy Corbyn mouthing during Prime Minister’s Questions? Who took the photo of Boris Johnson and Carrie Symonds sitting at a garden table in July, and why? This way madness lies.While we are now able to see evidence for ourselves, we all have conflicting ideas of what bit to attend to, and what it means. The camera may not lie, but that is because it does not speak at all. As we become more fixated on some ultimate gold-standard of objective truth, which exceeds the words of mere journalists or experts, so the number of interpretations applied to the evidence multiplies. As our faith in the idea of undeniable proof deepens, so our frustration with competing framings and official accounts rises. All too often, the charge of “bias” means “that’s not my perspective”. Our screen-based interactions with many institutions have become fuelled by anger that our experiences are not being better recognised, along with a new pleasure at being able to complain about it. As the writer and programmer Paul Ford wrote, back in 2011, “the fundamental question of the web” is: “Why wasn’t I consulted?”What we are witnessing is a collision between two conflicting ideals of truth: one that depends on trusted intermediaries (journalists and experts), and another that promises the illusion of direct access to reality itself. This has echoes of the populist challenge to liberal democracy, which pits direct expressions of the popular will against parliaments and judges, undermining the very possibility of compromise. The Brexit crisis exemplifies this as well as anything. Liberals and remainers adhere to the long-standing constitutional convention that the public speaks via the institutions of general elections and parliament. Adamant Brexiters believe that the people spoke for themselves in June 2016, and have been thwarted ever since by MPs and civil servants. It is this latter logic that paints suspending parliament as an act of democracy.This is the tension that many populist leaders exploit. Officials and elected politicians are painted as cynically self-interested, while the “will of the people” is both pure and obvious. Attacks on the mainstream media follow an identical script: the iniduals professionally tasked with informing the public, in this case journalists, are biased and fake. It is widely noted that leaders such as Donald Trump, Jair Bolsonaro and Matteo Salvini are enthusiastic users of Twitter, and Boris Johnson has recently begun to use Facebook Live to speak directly to “the people” from Downing Street. Whether it be parliaments or broadcasters, the analogue intermediaries of the public sphere are discredited and circumvented.What can professional editors and journalists do in response? One response is to shout even louder about their commitment to “truth”, as some American newspapers have profitably done in the face of Trump. But this escalates cultural conflict, and fails to account for how the media and informational landscape has changed in the past 20 years.What if, instead, we accepted the claim that all reports about the world are simply framings of one kind or another, which cannot but involve political and moral ideas about what counts as important? After all, reality becomes incoherent and overwhelming unless it is simplified and narrated in some way or other. And what if we accepted that journalists, editors and public figures will inevitably let cultural and personal biases slip from time to time? A shrug is often the more appropriate response than a howl. If we abandoned the search for some pure and unbiased truth, where might our critical energies be directed instead?If we recognise that reporting and editing is always a political act (at least in the sense that it asserts the importance of one story rather than another), then the key question is not whether it is biased, but whether it is independent of financial or political influence. The problem becomes a quasi-constitutional one, of what processes, networks and money determine how data gets turned into news, and how power gets distributed. On this front, the British media is looking worse and worse, with every year that passes.The relationship between the government and the press has been getting tighter since the 1980s. This is partly thanks to the overweening power of Rupert Murdoch, and the image management that developed in response. Spin doctors such as Alastair Campbell, Andy Coulson, Tom Baldwin, Robbie Gibb and Seumas Milne typically move from the media into party politics, weakening the ision between the two.Then there are those iniduals who shift backwards and forwards between senior political positions and the BBC, such as Gibb, Rona Fairhead and James Purnell. The press has taken a very bad turn over recent years, with ex-Chancellor George Osborne becoming editor of the Evening Standard, then the extraordinary recent behaviour of the Daily , which seeks to present whatever story or gloss is most supportive of their former star columnist in 10 Downing Street, and rubbishes his opponents. (The Opinion page of the  website proudly includes a “Best of Boris” section.)Since the financial crisis of 2008, there have been regular complaints about the revolving door between the financial sector and governmental institutions around the world, most importantly the White House. There has been far less criticism of the similar door that links the media and politics. The exception to this comes from populist leaders, who routinely denounce all “mainstream” democratic and media institutions as a single liberal elite, that acts against the will of the people. One of the reasons they are able to do this is because there is a grain of truth in what they say.The financial obstacles confronting critical, independent, investigative media are significant. If the Johnson administration takes a more sharply populist turn, the political obstacles could increase, too – Channel 4 is frequently held up as an enemy of Brexit, for example. But let us be clear that an independent, professional media is what we need to defend at the present moment, and abandon the misleading and destructive idea that – thanks to a combination of ubiquitous data capture and personal passions – the truth can be grasped directly, without anyone needing to report it.• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7135462e727b4b8862ce07a8925fb598911e7218/0_239_5128_3077/master/5128.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=580cab4e81253d44b0fd2e0f08a42168","title":"tesco accident insurance claim","story":"Back in May, a Tesco lorry dropped a steel cage on my car while delivering to a  store.

On the advice of the store manager, I called my insurance company, which organised a repair that took two weeks. During this time my insurer and I tried repeatedly to get Tesco’s accident management company to take action. Four weeks later it wrote saying I should use its authorised repair company. By this time the car was already repaired.I still have not had my insurance excess of £100 refunded, as the claims management company has not refunded the cost of the claim to my insurance company. After many fruitless calls, I received a £100 Tesco card to compensate for the inconvenience. However, this does not compensate for the two weeks without my car, the cancelled travel plans, the effect on my future insurance premiums, the £100 excess and the hours of phone calls.When I emailed the chief executive I received a reply saying that they considered the matter closed.SW, GlasgowTesco seems remarkably laid back about your appalling ordeal. “As SW decided to go through her own insurer, her insurance company would need to pursue a claim with us,” it says. “We can confirm that we have not received anything to date.”It ignores the fact that comprehensive insurance policy holders have to lodge a claim through their own insurer, and that its own store manager advised you on this.Moreover, your insurer has given you a timeline of its unhelpful contacts with Tesco’s claims handlers since May.Happily, Tesco’s insurers have finally paid up, so you have been refunded the excess. After the Observer got involved you were invited to claim for uninsured losses while your car was out of action, and you have now been offered £200 by Tesco’s insurer.Meanwhile, Tesco insists on restricting its contrition to a voucher.

Not for Our Kid the public admonishment of reviewers who’ve failed to grasp its fathomless depths and manifold subtleties, nor the angry social media announcement that critics have missed that his gift is the warmth he lives his life with and the self-reflection he shares so generously (as Lana Del Rey recently admonished an NPR journalist). He deals, he told the  last year, in “meat and veg rock’n’roll”: “I’m here to give people what they want, and if that’s boring, so be it.” To Gallagher Jr, music is like football: “I’m never going to change my fucking football team.”He knows his audience. They are men in middle age for whom pop music has grown ever-more remote since the mid-90s, and for whom Noel Gallagher’s recent attempts to broaden his musical horizons a little represents an unacceptable capitulation to the terrifying forces of progress and change. They are teenagers who’ve bought into a romanticised version of the 1990s, propagated in documentaries and misty-eyed media eulogies occasioned by 25th anniversaries, and who have furthermore noted that guitar-based alt-rock has little to currently offer in that vein: you can go and see Catfish and the Bottlemen, but you’re not going to hear anything with the potency of Slide Away or Rock N’ Roll Star. Mock them if you want – the kind of people who get a petition up when a rapper headlines Glastonbury confused and horrified by identity politics and intersectional feminism desperate for things to be as they once were – but the sales figures suggest he’s done his research: his 2017 solo album As You Were went platinum he’s selling out arenas and sports stadiums.It all makes reviewing his second solo album seem like a pointless exercise. You really don’t need a critic to tell you what it sounds like you know without reading a review whether you’ll like it or not. Anyone desperate to find some point of difference between Why Me? Why Not. and the music Liam Gallagher has already made might alight on Halo, a song audibly conceived in the vein of the Rolling Stones – 1967’s Let’s Spend the Night Together, to be specific – rather than the Beatles. Both The River and Shockwave, meanwhile, make capital from the stomping, brickies-in-eyeliner glitterbeat style also aped on Oasis’s Lyla: like Lyla, if either song had been released on RAK in 1974 by a flop band called something like Bumper or Thumper, a lot of people who wouldn’t give either Gallagher houseroom would be proclaiming them lost junkshop glam gems.In fact, the real difference between Why Me? Why Not. and As You Were might be a certain confidence: for all its snarling vocals, the latter album ended with a song on which Liam Gallagher ruminated that his career might be over. This time, the rock songs punch a little harder, the poppier moments are more unapologetically poppy: the melody of Now That I’ve Found You evokes not John Lennon sneering his way through I Am the Walrus, but Paul McCartney shaking his moptop in crowd-pleasing style. Certainly, it’s more shameless than its predecessor in appealing to its audience’s penchant for 90s nostalgia, and their prurient interest in the ongoing Gallagher v Gallagher war, often at the same time. “Act like you don’t remember, you said we’d Live Forever,” protests One of Us. “It was easier to have fun back when we had nothing,” opens Once, contrasting this state of affairs with the mundanities of middle age – “just … send the kids to school” – before returning to the rosy glow of reminiscence: “I remember how you used to shine … When the dawn came up you felt so inspired to do it again.”The songs, it’s worth noting, are uniformly well-written, at least within their self-imposed parameters: they’re certainly melodically stronger than his brother’s recent experiments. You get the feeling the hired hands brought in to shore up the writing have thoroughly enjoyed themselves, being paid to indulge their Beatles fantasies – to come up with a song like Once, which manages to evoke John Lennon’s Jealous Guy without actually stealing the tune outright – presumably being far more fun than their usual lot, ie driving yourself round the twist trying to devise something that Sia or Pink’s manager will deem worthy of passing on to their esteemed client.Complaining that there’s nothing different or innovative here feels beside the point, like buying an Objekt album then taking it back because his brand of super-hip off-kilter techno doesn’t have a bloke in a parka making Beatles references over the top of it. It does what it sets out to do: provide Gallagher with material hooky enough that the arena crowds don’t storm the bars and lavatories when he stops playing Oasis songs. As Liam Gallagher knows, for his audience at least, that’s enough.Perfume Genius: Eye in the WallThat moment of blissful dancefloor transcendence captured in nine minutes of pulsing synths and yearning, ethereal vocals."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c71c0ed93baaabd6dd5c721a337425890aca95b/0_323_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aeb7ce9e94dc20ba082b3bc74272fb83","title":"revoke and remain inside lib dem conference podcast","story":"With a new leader in Jo Swinson and the defection of six MPs to the party, Lib Dems are hoping for a resurgence.

We know that support for independence is rising, demand for another independence referendum is rising.”She added: “Scotland does have a right to choose its own future and I think the revelations, if I can call them that from David Cameron today, say more about him than anybody else, and really demonstrate the panic that was at the heart of the UK government in the run-up to the independence referendum five years ago.“Of course that is nothing compared to the panic that is in the heart of unionist parties now about independence.” Anti-independence parties have refused to sanction a second vote, while some unionist politicians have floated a leave or remain option in a referendum.Sturgeon concluded: “They know they do not have the arguments against independence and they know that when Scotland is given the right to choose, Scotland this time will choose to become independent.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/81202ca1f6ee92bb837cec30411111cf8ab4ec08/0_1_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=34592821af48910b1b0cd41ec6baabb2","title":"viral stars brexit britain eyeroll girl ana telma rocha","story":"Every day, ordinary people seem to cut through political debate and speak truth to power. But what is it like to go viral and how does it change their lives?“People have died because of austerity,” a woman told Boris Johnson, buttonholing him in Doncaster last week. “And you’ve got the cheek to come here and tell us that austerity is over and it’s all good now.” It was her words, caught on cameras and phones, that hit a nerve, because she spoke for so many. No one remembers what Johnson said, or what he was doing there. Only yesterday, a man with a sick daughter berated the PM in a London hospital over waiting times, and on years and years and years of the “NHS being destroyed”.A couple of weeks earlier it was the Portuguese woman who hijacked a live Sky News broadcast with an emotional plea. After 20 years living and working in Britain she didn’t know whether she was still welcome. “I need a voice, I gave this country my youth,” she said. “I looked after your children, I’ve looked after the elderly.”And who can forget Brenda from Bristol. “You’re joking!” she spluttered at the man from the BBC, when he asked her about Theresa May’s decision to hold a snap election. “Not another one! Oh for God’s sake, I can’t stand this. There’s too much politics going on at the moment.” Brenda was surprised by the fuss, then annoyed. “Oh God no, go away,” she yelled from a window at some journalists recently when they called for her wisdom. These are the viral stars of Brexit Britain, the ordinary folk who are suddenly and briefly catapulted into the limelight. With a sentence or two, or just a look, they strike a chord with the nation. What is it like for them? What happens after their brief moments of fame? Does it make any difference? I caught up with a few – all of them women, because, interestingly, most of them are – to find out.Harriet Ellis was in the queue to board the flight for her holiday. “The woman in front and her boyfriend kept taking selfies,” she remembers. “I was like: that’s so weird, why do you want to remember this moment, being in the Ryanair queue? And I kept getting in the picture, so I was dodging, I didn’t want to ruin this moment for them. Then I looked over at her phone and I just saw loads of pictures of my face. The woman had Googled me and was checking the picture to see if it was me.”Ellis’s eyes are a legend. They achieved this status in November when their owner was sitting right behind Nigel Farage in a Channel 4 Brexit debate. It was his claim that Theresa May was delivering a “remainer’s Brexit” that caused them to perform what has been described as a “double axis roll”. The clip went viral, Harriet became #EyeRollGirl.She was a student at Birmingham University at the time and got an email asking if she wanted to be in the audience for the debate. “I was like: I might as well, I’ve got nothing else to do,” she says. She is interested in politics and has always talked about it at home: “I know a bit, not like loads.”She was not aware of the roll at the time, didn’t even know she was a roller, although afterwards her mum told her she’d had plenty of practice she had spent years rolling her eyes at her. But after the debate someone asked if she had checked her phone. “Oh God, is someone dead? No, but there were 3,000 views on this gif, and I was like: wow, that’s fun. Then we were in the car on the way home and it just snowballed. If people were concentrating on my eyes it mustn’t have been that interesting a debate.”In the morning, her phone wasn’t working. “It overheated from all the notifications. It took a while to calm down, I had 68,000 likes in 24 hours.” On the way to her interview she spoke to newspapers and magazines. “You feel like you’re on top of the world. I think it helped with the interview.”Anyway, she got in, and will start the course this autumn – teaching in a secondary school (religious education, not politics). Does she think she has got Farage to thank for her career? “He did give me some confidence,” she says.Extraordinarily, in the referendum, Ellis voted to… leave! (Now who’s doing the double-axis eye-roll?) But this had nothing to do with Farage. “I was at sixth form at the time this was my first time voting I was very interested in Lexit, leftwing Brexit, reading about how the EU promotes the immigration of white westerners and is sort of like a racist ideology in that it is at the expense of immigration from more deserving countries and people of colour. Also I didn’t like the fact that you didn’t know who was running it you didn’t directly vote for the people at the top, and no one knows who their MEP is.” She would probably vote differently now though, because of the way it has turned out. “It’s an omnishambles, as Malcolm Tucker would say.”Ana Telma Rocha came to this country from Portugal in 1999. It made her into the liberal, tolerant person she is, she says. “I was super-Catholic, a xenophobe, I thought gay people were dangerous. It educated me, it’s been wonderful and I love it.”But, she says, recently the UK has become unrecognisable. In 2016, she was walking down the street in Sheffield, where she was living with one of her two sons. A man accelerated towards her at a crossing, stopping only metres from them. “He said: ‘Go back to your country, foreign scum.’”.That’s when she decided her boys – one of whom has autism – would go to live in Portugal while she stayed here to work. “The toughest decision,” she says, choking up. She moved to London, to carry on her work as a carer for an agency. She gets moved around the country when we speak she is on her way to a job in Suffolk. She has also worked as an actor.She was not arrested, but she did interrupt a Sky TV broadcast covering the protests. “I need a voice,” she said, passionately. “I’ve worked here for 20 years and I have no voice. The resettlement scheme is not working.” She did not realise it was a live show. “I thought, I don’t know, that they’d cut it, because I was just another nutter off the street. But then everybody started to ring me and I thought: ‘God, this has gone a bit mad.’”Soon she became Portuguese Brexit Woman, getting sympathy and abuse, especially when it emerged that she had helped set up a theatre company. She was a planted remoaner stooge, it was clearly fake news. “I knew that as soon as they found out I’m an actress they would say it was fake news,” she says. “But there were many more nice messages than – sorry – those idiots.”Rocha’s main issue – like many other EU citizens in the UK, has been the laborious process – of applying for the EU settlement scheme having to navigate seemingly endless technical issues, error messages and helpline hell while working up to 65 hours a week. Not as simple as the Home Office made out. But since her impassioned TV outburst, she has heard directly from the Portuguese consulate, which has offered to help. “I’m actually quite proud of Portugal,” she says. There is no such warmth towards Johnson. “God forgive him for what he’s done to England.”Amelia McDowell, 16, remembers getting the call. She was in the middle of an art class, at her school in Belfast. “I checked my voice messages and there was this really posh British woman. I said to my teacher: ‘This is important, do you mind if I get it?’”The teacher agreed, McDowell went into the art cupboard, sat down among all the paint and the clay and called the woman back. “She’s asking me all these questions and I try to answer as best as I can with these pots of paint falling on my head, then she’s like: ‘That’s brilliant, we’d love to have you, we’ll send you the tickets.’ I hung up and just screamed.”Tickets to a concert? The X Factor? Oh no. “I burst out of the art store and went, to my whole class: ‘I’M GOING TO BE ON QUESTION TIME!’”McDowell watches the BBC politics debate every week. When there was an announcement that the show would be coming to Belfast (“It never comes to Belfast!”) she immediately applied to be in the audience.A few days later, Dad dropped her off at the venue. “I knew I wanted to say something but it wasn’t like I had completely thought it out, it was mostly spontaneous.” What she did, when she got the chance, was to calmly deliver a damning indictment of the Conservative party. “David Cameron made the referendum policy because he didn’t want to risk losing 10 or 15 seats to Ukip, and look where it has got us,” she said. “This has always been because Tories are playing party politics with issues that are going to be huge, generational changes for all of us.”She was soon being hailed for her eloquence and clarity. She set up a Twitter account, wrote: “Hi, this is me,” under her clip, and collected 8,000 followers overnight. Celebrities – Rob Delaney, Richard Bacon, Amanda Abbington – were retweeting it here was the human embodiment of the argument to give the vote to 16-year-olds (a campaign that McDowell is now part of).In English class the next morning, “friends kept refreshing their phones under the desk, and going: ‘It’s on 215,000 views now.’ I remember when my mate Erin just stood up and said it had hit a million. That night my friend Amy rang and she’s like: ‘Mimi, your video’s on Jeremy Corbyn’s Twitter!’ Then I checked my Twitter and like John McDonnell’s followed me! What’s going on?” It was really good, to have a platform at last, and to know people don’t actually think you’re talking crap when it comes to politics. But also part of me is like: there are like so many young activists my age or maybe a bit older who maybe have an understanding like mine or close to it but didn’t have the chance to go on Question Time and say something. That was luck and I’m very thankful for it.”McDowell has certainly used her moment in the spotlight: she has been on the radio and written articles, and says she would have done more if her GCSEs had not got in the way. She is at sixth-form college now doing French, English language and biology. Not politics, incidentally. “I don’t want to seem up myself but it’s mainly things that I do already have a good understanding of.” That is very clear. As well as school, and school orchestra (violin), she is a Labour party of Northern Ireland youth activist.At the end of her Question Time speech she called for a general election. Is that still what she wants? “There’s obviously the danger of being so close to Brexit now, and I am quite worried that it will become another Brexit election, and we will end up with the Tories again, but I think Boris Johnson’s recent moves have been an electoral disaster. I do not think he’s going to get back in. So honestly part of me really wants an election because we probably would get an extension to do it and I think another government would get in even if Labour needs to be propped up for a while.” After college, she hopes to go to university – Oxford is the aim, otherwise Edinburgh or UCL – to study French and Russian, and then eventually go into politics. There were people saying she should be prime minister after Question Time what did she make of that? “I’m not saying right now, but maybe in the future like, if the opportunity comes up I’m willing to take it.” #VoteMimiWhen Kirsty Archer complained to her landlord about the state of disrepair of the London flat she rented, she was served with an eviction order. Then, following the announcement that the government was going to scrap these section 21 eviction notices – which enable landlords to evict tenants for no reason at all, so long as they give them two months’ notice – she agreed to be interviewed on Sky News. It did not quite go as expected.“I thought if you are a case study you would have the chance to talk about what happened to you,” she says. “But it didn’t really go like that. She was quite critical of me it emerged during the interview that she had been a landlord herself. I was quite surprised about the line of questioning.”She is the Sky journalist – and landlord – Jayne Secker. “That’s just the housing market isn’t it?” Secker said to Archer, on air, about the extortionate rents in London. And she went on to have a moan about some of her own experiences renting out properties to young people who don’t know how to do anything around the house and can’t even change a lightbulb. It had gone from a piece about scrapping section 21 to the woes of being a property owner, and Archer came away thinking it had gone really badly. “She said at the end that I swore, and apologised for me swearing.” (Archer had used the term “pissed off”.)Archer’s flatmate – and fellow evictee – did not think it had gone so badly for her, and did the sensible thing in the situation: he uploaded the clip to Twitter. Two days later – after retweets from, among others, Owen Jones, Philip Pullman and Ellie Goulding – it had garnered 4m views. The story then not only returned to being one about renters’ rights, but now it also became one about patronising journalists who are wildly out of touch with the living situations of the nation’s young people, and woefully ignorant of the renting crisis. Secker ended up apologising, saying that she “got the tone and content of an interview wrong” and had “taken the many comments on board”.“Obviously it resonated with a lot of people,” Archer says. “I think one of the nicest things was all the comments from random people online saying well done and it’s so good you are speaking out for us.”Archer works for the charity Rethink Mental Illness and knows a thing or two about the link between housing and mental health. She is one of the lucky ones she got a platform. Since – and as a result of – her TV appearance she has been to the annual OECD forum in Paris, sat on panels, spoken in schools. “I think it shows that if people take action and are willing to do something rather than just letting it happen, then they can actually change things and help maybe more than just themselves.”The renting situation is still rubbish. The ban on letting fees is positive, likewise scrapping section 21s, although that hasn’t come into effect yet, and who knows when it will, with everything else going on. Archer is renting a new place in Streatham, south London, £675 a month plus bills. The washing machine broke, but it got fixed. “The landlord is a lot more reasonable this time.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/daa1bed53e006fcf11119867224a1dac0c467643/0_351_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c6d6c5eab5a22bc042ae6f12ec51da7b","title":"parliament apologises for photographing rough sleepers","story":"Contractor took photos of homeless people as they slept near palace of WestminsterParliament has apologised to a group of rough sleepers who bed down close to the palace of Westminster after taking inidual photos of them without their permission while they slept.About 20 people sleep rough in and around the tunnels connecting parliament to Westminster tube station. They woke last Friday to find a cleaning contractor employed by the parliamentary estate taking photographs of them.One man, a 45-year-old from Latvia who works on a building site, said he was astonished to be woken up by someone taking photographs.“A manager deliberately came and took photos of us while we were sleeping. There were about six of us sleeping upstairs and 12 of us downstairs,” he said. “We were so shocked about this. Downstairs in the tunnel leading to parliament is the best place in London for rough sleepers to sleep. It’s warm and it’s safe because there are lots of cameras around here. I don’t understand why pictures of us were being made. This was a proper mistake. We know they want to move us out and maybe that’s why they were taking our photos.”A House of Commons spokesperson said: “We apologise for any distress caused this should not have happened and has been immediately stopped.”The homeless people previously all slept in one tunnel but the parliamentary estate effectively evicted them last month by installing shutters to mark parliament’s new boundary following a transfer of land from Transport for London. The new shutters prevented the group from sleeping there, so they are now spread out in various areas nearby.The House of Commons spokesperson did not explain why its contractors had taken photos of inidual rough sleepers.“It’s a human rights breach to take photos of us while we’re sleeping,” said another member of the group of rough sleepers. “By moving us from the part of the tunnel we were sleeping in before, they’ve actually made the problem worse. Previously we were in one place now people are sleeping in different places close to parliament. They want to get rid of us but I don’t know where they expect us to go. Parliament is empty at the moment because it has been suspended. Maybe we can all move in there for a few weeks!”It is understood that the parliamentary estate has instructed its contractor to stop the practice of taking photos of inidual rough sleepers immediately and that all images of rough sleepers have been deleted after the  raised the issue.There is concern among the rough sleepers about possible police and immigration enforcement activity. Previously the homeless charity St Mungo’s has worked with Home Office immigration enforcement teams to identify non-British rough sleepers, who in some cases were subsequently deported.A spokesperson for the Public Interest Law Centre, which brought a successful legal challenge against the Home Office policy to round up migrant rough sleepers, said: “There is a long history of criminalisation and enforcement against homeless people in and around Westminster. This incident further shows how authorities treat homeless people with contempt, dehumanising their very existence in the process. This government has promoted austere and hostile policies which have caused an exponential rise in homelessness and an increase in enforcement measures.”A spokesperson for the Labour Homelessness Campaign said: “Working closely with the Westminster rough sleepers, I know this is just the latest step in a trend of parliament refusing to treat rough sleepers with the most basic respect as human beings. If even parliament, with the eyes of the country on it, won’t guarantee any fundamental rights of homeless members of our community, that’s a sign of how unequal our society is in every respect.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03a609b93d420246d330f185b6e977164176a530/0_257_2469_1481/master/2469.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1bc77687d5d05200310f087be7f99509","title":"rugby world cup 2019 guardian predictions","story":"New Zealand still formidable, Fiji to prove tricky opponents with Semi Radradra turning on the power: our pundits set out their forecasts for the tournamentRob Kitson South Africa, unless they are flattened in the final by a free-wheeling England team boasting even more dynamic power.

It is his fourth World Cup and he took charge of the 2015 final. Has a penchant for one-liners, though with few players likely to be fluent in English on the opening night, they will have to be for the camera.England’s leading referee is also involved in his fourth World Cup and is contemplating retiring after the event to focus on his career as a corruption and bribery lawyer. He has the other pool match where English-speaking players are likely to be at a premium, Georgia against Uruguay, but nothing is likely to be as testing as 2007 when the then rookie took charge of the quarter-final between France and New Zealand, although he does start with Ireland against Scotland.The only South African among the 12, Peyper was given the opening match of the 2015 tournament between England and Fiji but failed to make the knockout stage. He controlled this year’s Super Rugby final and will reach a half-century of Tests in Japan. He will referee the potential pool decider between England and France and last November was slated by the Australia coach, Michael Cheika, for seeing nothing sinister in a high, try-saving tackle by Owen Farrell at Twickenham.He is the most experienced of the four French referees who will be in Japan (Ireland, Scotland, Argentina and Italy do not supply one between them, merely a couple of what used to be called touch judges). Poite used to be a detective in Toulouse but now tackles a different sort of law-breaker. One reason for the prevalence of officials from the other side of the English Channel is their willingness to take tough decisions and reach for the red card. The policeman has never left Poite.He refereed Wales’ victory over England in Cardiff last month, allowing the decisive try when Wales took a penalty quickly as Anthony Watson was leaving the field on his way to the sin-bin. Eddie Jones was not amused and reflected that it was Gaüzère who should have seen yellow. He was involved in the 2015 World Cup and has sent off four players in Tests since that tournament, more than any other official, mostly for dangerous tackles.He is another French official who gets high and mighty, and New Zealand will have noted he has been given their first match against South Africa, the highly likely pool decider. It was Garcès who sent off Sonny Bill Williams during the second Test between the Lions and New Zealand in Wellington and last month dismissed the All Blacks second-row Scott Barrett for a no-arms challenge. He officiated the 2015 semi-final between New Zealand and South Africa and is a contender for this year’s final, should France not find their way there.Tackles will be a central feature of the World Cup with referees expected to be like the French quartet and not be afraid to reward high and reckless challenges with a red card. The crackdown on dangerous tackles and contact with an opponent’s head, no matter if it is inadvertent, has drawn the ire of coaches but World Rugby’s message to them is simple: tell your players to go lower or get used to playing at least one player short. Referees who are reluctant to apply the ultimate sanction can expect a red card. Otherwise the emphasis will be on letting games flow and not get bogged down in scrum resets and players slowing down the ball at the breakdown. One area that has not been policed particularly is off-side behind with rush defences creeping further and further up. With an emphasis on reducing the potential number of concussions by opening space on the field, it is an area that can expect attention. The overall approach should suit the hosts with set-pieces a means of restarting play and little more, apart from when Argentina tackle France and Georgia tussle with Wales. Paul Rees\u0026nbspHis Test career has been a slow burn, partly because of injuries. His first match was in 2009 but he did not make his Six Nations debut until this year, running the line in the 2015 World Cup. He had the whistle when Ireland defeated New Zealand for the first time in 2017, having the previous year sent off the Ireland back-row CJ Stander for a dangerous challenge on Pat Lambie, who was later forced to retire because of the cumulative effect of head injuries.He is the second youngest official among the 12, born five months after the first final in 1987. He is one of five who will be refereeing in a World Cup for the first time. He took up the whistle at the age of 16 and in 2009 became the youngest official to be appointed to the RFU’s national panel. He took charge of his first Test involving a tier one nation only two years ago and starts with Wales against Georgia.Another first-timer in the World Cup and the youngest of the referees at 30, he has progressed in the last three years despite generating controversy over a relative high tolerance threshold over dangerous challenges. He was in charge of Wales’ match against Australia last November when Leigh Halfpenny was taken out by Samu Kerevi, an incident similar to the one involving Stander and Lambie. The Wallabies are involved in his first match, against Fiji.He owned up to a mistake after England’s victory over South Africa last November, saying he should have penalised Owen Farrell for a shoulder-led tackle on André Esterhuizen and given the Springboks the opportunity to kick for victory. Earlier in the year, he had sent off the France full-back Benjamin Fall for a dangerous tackle on Beauden Barrett only for a judicial committee to rule he made the wrong call. There should be no confusion this tournament over high and reckless challenges.He is one of the least experienced referees at the World Cup, but he has been given some high-profile matches this year, including July’s draw between New Zealand and South Africa in Wellington. He played for the Reds, Racing 92 and Wasps before concussion forced him to retire at the age of 28. He took up refereeing in 2015 and has overtaken another former player turned whistleblower, Glen Jackson. He will be in charge of England’s match against the USA.He played for three years for York after graduating, and rose to prominence as a referee last season. He was in the middle at Twickenham twice, for the victory over Japan and the draw against Scotland, and handled the opening match of the Rugby Championship. Earlier this year he admitted he was surprised to be on the list for Japan because he had refereed fewer Tests than the others. He has been allocated four group matches, including England’s opener against Tonga."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e3e58cdc2f90e5b050726162f08f86f88dc33f68/0_342_3845_2307/master/3845.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=578838bfd6b47b859279bff80e5ec3fb","title":"spectacle singapore f1 best chance attracting new fans","story":"The floodlit cityscape of Singapore will host Formula One again this weekend, a race the sport positively revels in promoting.

It is a shop window but in terms of really selling the sport, the bigger picture of how F1 ensures it can still reach a wide audience remains one of its most imperative and complex concerns.With live broadcasts of F1 in the UK exclusive to Sky, fans without subscriptions must wait until Channel Four host their highlights package from Marina Bay on Sunday night. Free-to-air F1 coverage is increasingly disappearing, so a new deal between Channel Four and Sky announced earlier this week was welcomed. The multi-year arrangement means Channel Four will continue to show highlights of every race next season, as well as the British Grand Prix live.As cricket has discovered, it is a dangerous game to chase the money at the expense of exposure. Yet for F1 it is no longer simply a binary choice. The sport has three main revenue streams. Hosting fees from circuits, sponsorship and TV rights. Of these, the sums of money Sky and other broadcasters are paying are now surely the single strongest pillar supporting F1.Recent new deals with circuits such as Spa, Monza and Silverstone are all understood to have been for fees lower than previously charged under Bernie Ecclestone’s stewardship of the sport. Next season’s new race in Vietnam is believed to be in F1 terms almost a loss leader, with organisers paying as little as $6m to host the meeting. In contrast, Sky’s exclusive UK deal has been reported as being worth £200m a year.These are numbers that cannot be ignored and in the short term will define how F1 is consumed. When Liberty Media took over in 2017, its intent was to transform the sport but it inherited Ecclestone’s deals. A central tenet of the company’s plan was to bring the sport to a new audience that Ecclestone had either ignored or dismissed.To that end Liberty was looking immediately at over-the-top streaming to sell F1 direct to the fans and in a format far more suited to how content is now being consumed. But it has not been an overwhelming success.F1TV began streaming last year but has struggled with a variety of technical problems. So much so that Ellie Norman, the marketing and communications director, recently admitted the platform had been launched too soon. Not a great start but one fans in the UK were spared since the deal with Sky means that live race coverage on F1TV cannot be purchased and that will remain the case until that contract is complete in 2024.Which direction F1 will be going in terms of broadcasting by then may be demonstrated in the next two years. This year, broadcasting contracts with Austria, Canada and the United States conclude and the large markets of France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Brazil all require new deals at the end of next season. How F1 approaches them will define what the UK might expect to be offered come 2024.A general return to free-to-air looks highly unlikely, however. Carey recently admitted that Liberty Media would continue its move towards pay platforms “because that is where the world is going”.Given the need for the sport to maintain revenue from broadcasting this is not just a global media trend but simply inescapable for F1. What will shape the future is likely to be how deals are structured between traditional broadcasters and the ability for fans to access F1TV live. The latter is likely to be more attractive to the new breed of fans, consuming sport away from the television set.The fundamental dichotomy inherent in this is that broadcasters will not pay vast sums if F1 is selling its own product to the same market. There is a tightrope to be walked here and it will not be easy. In the USA this year ESPN allowed F1TV streaming of races live in return for not paying for its rights. Not a model F1 can sustain globally.Singapore this weekend is the glamorous showpiece of complex and convoluted backstage machinations that F1 must solve successfully to survive."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0cd40791f83a811aaefbbdcde8e12a4b2f125a2/0_195_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c0a26d64cb785dc7becdf403e12f6947","title":"john humphrys last today programme review a too long lap of honour","story":"After 32 years as Today’s grand inquisitor, Humphrys bowed out with Dame Edna and lots of back-slapping. At least someone brought up the ‘thrown typewriter’ incident ...During his 32 years on the Today programme, John Humphrys has been called many things – grand inquisitor, overpaid, sexist – but never, until this morning, retiring.The dilemma on a presenter’s farewell show is balancing the usual format with back-slapping. It must have been frustrating for the 76-year-old journalist to go out on a slow news morning, with the two biggest stories – the Supreme Court hearing on Prime Minister Johnson’s suspension of parliament, President Trump’s response to Iran – to pay off later.This left room – perhaps too much – for laps of honour. Humphrys talked to Tony Blair about the history of political interviewing. “You own the rebarbative form of interviewing!” the former PM praised him. “I’m a seeker after truth!” boasted the host.Rabbi Lord Sacks, presenting Thought for the Day, compared the presenter to the Old Testament prophets for “speaking truth unto power.” Critics of the religious interlude will note that, while atheists are banned from presenting it, Humphrys’ godlessness oddly did not preclude him being its subject.Back-announcing that item, Humphrys sounded suddenly throaty and chokey, stumbling. Otherwise, he seemed much himself. It felt characteristically cussed that he continued to the end to pronounce the Mayor of London’s name as Sad-eek Khan, despite his recent revalation that it is said Sard-ik another link suggested that Humphrys thinks Downton Abbey, which left the schedules in 2015, is still on TV.For his last slot, editor Sarah Sands paired Humphrys with Justin Webb. This was a risky choice, as the departing veteran has been increasingly attacked as the Alpha Plus Male in a show dominated, until very recently, by men. Perhaps, though, Webb was the least likely to use a final co-appearance to suggest inheritance of the mantle. Webb also avoided repeating his recent claim in Radio Times that Humphrys’ attitude to producers could lead him to “shout at them … throw things even”, a long-reputed aspect of his temperament that was ignored during the three final hours of national treasuring from the BBC.The clear highlight was Dame Edna Everage (Humphries v Humphrys), which brought the Today programme a humour it usually lacks. “Can’t follow that!” said Webb. “Makes everything to come look very …” Realising he might be ensuring that this was his own last programme as well, Webb added “well … let’s see!”Nothing did match the Australian a. Humphrys’ reputation was built around his ferocious 08:10 interviews, but his final encounter suggested he may have found the right time to go. For the last guest, Today wanted Boris Johnson, and would have settled for Jeremy Corbyn. But the current PM’s barking svengali, Dominic Cummings, has declared the programme irrelevant, and Corbyn has not appeared on the show for three years.In the absence of present leaders, the last big political arse on the chair was David Cameron, on the day of publication of his memoirs, For The Record. Unfortunately, Cameron had already spoken at length to The Times and Tom Bradby on ITV, while Today’s own main headline quoted comments made by Cameron in a two-part BBC One interview.Thus, on his last day, Humphrys was very obviously going last with Cameron, and got nothing new. The grand inquisitor went as he had always carried on, at one point he and Cameron raising their voices incoherently over each other in the disputatious duet that was Humphrys’ signature.In the last 10 minutes, present and past co-presenters crowded into the studio. It had the feel of the reading of a will, with everyone worrying someone else may get a bigger percentage of the legacy than them. The alleged “thrown typewriter” incident was brought up, but lost in congratulatory cackling.The last two minutes were a monologue from Humphrys. Consciously or not, the coda echoed the final morning send-off of another radio great, Terry Wogan, almost exactly a decade ago. As then, the climactic gratitude went to the listeners: “My thanks, finally, to you! I feel I have got to know you over the decades.” Audibly emotional after what has been a magnificent, if ultimately overextended, chapter in radio news broadcasting, he could barely croak out the last “good morning”. Then, sorry, John, we have to stop you there."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a89120978da861dfb6678d8b16132c1b289d9525/0_38_2316_1390/master/2316.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d98491aed6ab05c46f71935dc7ff31cf","title":"justin trudeau wearing blackface details emerge third incident","story":"Undated video clip shows Trudeau in blackface, waving, with his arms and legs also appearing to be paintedA third incident in which Justin Trudeau wore blackface has been reported, in yet another damaging blow to the Canadian prime minister’s image, just weeks ahead of the country’s general election.In a short, undated video clip published by Global News on Thursday, Trudeau is seen in blackface, waving. His arms and legs also appear to be painted.Global News says it received the material earlier this week, but held off on publishing the material until journalists could determine its authenticity. On Thursday, a member of the Liberal campaign confirmed the video.The emergence of yet another incident in which Trudeau wore blackface follows a tumultuous 12 hours for the prime minister, after Time magazine published an image of Trudeau dressed as Aladdin – complete with dark skin makeup and a turban – at a 2001 function at a private school where he was a 29-year-old teacher.“I apologise profoundly,” said Trudeau on Wednesday night after the photograph was published. “I regret it deeply. I’m deeply sorry I did that, I should have known better.“It was something I should not have done. I didn’t think it was racist at the time, but now I see, it was a racist thing to do.”After issuing the apology, Trudeau also acknowledged an incident from high school in which he appeared in blackface as part of a talent show.Political leaders across the spectrum reacted swiftly.Jagmeet Singh, leader of the New Democratic party, called the first image “jarring” and called into question the prime minister’s commitment to ersity.Andrew Scheer, the Conservative leader and Trudeau’s main opponent, said he was “extremely shocked and disappointed” at the actions of the prime minister, calling his rival “unfit” to lead Canada. “It was racist in 2001, it’s racist now.”But the Conservative leader has also faced criticism for failing to eject his own party members for racist or homophobic statements this week. He told reporters he would stand by candidates who showed genuine remorse for previous actions.Green party leader Elizabeth May said she was “deeply shocked by the racism shown in this photograph of Justin Trudeau”.The flurry of images comes at a time in which the prime minister is fighting for his second parliamentary majority, with an election set for 21 October. Incumbent Trudeau is effectively locked in a dead heat with rival Conservatives, but his Liberal party holds an edge when it comes to winning seats in parliament.Major party leaders – and the prime minister – are expected to take questions from the media later today to further address the images."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0883f10a11ac5e81e0c143ee790b95a6be85f412/634_422_6073_3644/master/6073.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f95febd79c51c5b19c4a02b6289549e0","title":"netanyahu urges rival gantz join him unity government","story":"Blue and White leader rejects offer to serve under Likud after close-run Israeli electionBenjamin Netanyahu is furiously manoeuvring to cling to office after his rival Benny Gantz refused to serve under him in a government of national unity following an inconclusive election.Neither bloc has an obvious path to form a majority coalition, and Netanyahu called for them to join together in a unity government, hinting that he might be willing to accept a power-sharing arrangement with Gantz, a precedent found in the rotation of the prime minister’s office between Yitzhak Shamir and Shimon Peres in the mid-1980s.Gantz, a former military chief, said he should lead the next government because his alliance won the most seats.“The country has chosen unity. The country has chosen Israel first,” Gantz said on Thursday. “Blue and White, headed by me, has won the election … I am interested in and intend to form a broad and liberal unity government, under my leadership. A government that will convey the will of the people. A paralysed national government does not benefit the people.”Moshe Ya’alon, a senior Blue and White figure, was blunt, telling reporters: “We will not enter a coalition led by Netanyahu.”Netanyahu said he was “surprised and disappointed” by the rejection.Bolstering his opponents’ case that the election was a referendum on the prime minister, polling suggested that Netanyahu and Likud had lost support in its former strongholds.While the struggle to form coalition governments has long been a feature of Israel’s fractious politics, it has been further complicated by the presence of the deeply polarising figure of Netanyahu.In two weeks’ time he will face pre-trial hearings for three corruption cases against him. A majority in the 120-seat parliament could help grant the 69-year-old – who denies any wrongdoing – immunity from prosecution.The Israeli PM is embroiled in four cases involving allegations of bribery and misconduct. He denies wrongdoing in every instance.Case 1000\u0026nbspis an investigation into gifts received on a regular basis by Netanyahu and his family from two wealthy businessmen, including cigars and pink champagne.Case 2000\u0026nbspis examining whether Netanyahu behaved improperly during a taped conversation with a newspaper publisher in which he appeared to try to negotiate more sympathetic coverage in return for lowering the circulation of a rival paper.Case 3000\u0026nbspis an inquiry into alleged kickbacks in a deal to buy German submarines. Netanyahu is not a suspect, but he was closely involved in the deal and the case has ensnared members of his inner circle.\u0026nbspCase 4000, the most serious,\u0026nbspinvolves allegations that Netanyahu offered incentives to the Israeli telecoms company Bezeq in exchange for positive stories in an online news website it owns, Walla.Netanyahu has worked hard to make sure that blame for the failure of a deal with Gantz – which would raise the prospects of an unprecedented third round of elections – is apportioned to his rival.While weeks of negotiations to form a coalition government lay ahead, conditions set by the parties could hobble the task within the allotted time, prompting a third election.Neither side appeared to be able to form a government of at least 61 seats without the support of the election’s apparent kingmaker, Avigdor Lieberman of the Yisrael Beitenu party.His insistence on a secular government would force out Netanyahu’s traditional allies, the country’s two ultra-Orthodox parties and another nationalist-religious party.Reuven Rivlin, the country’s president, promised on Thursday to do everything in his power to prevent a third election.The deadlock follows the second Israeli elections this year, which were called because Netanyahu failed to cobble together a coalition after the April vote. Israelis endured a caustic campaign with a combative Netanyahu fighting for his political survival.This week’s vote was largely seen as a referendum on Netanyahu, who this summer surpassed Israel’s founding prime minister to become the country’s longest-serving leader. During the campaign, Netanyahu cast himself as a seasoned statesman who was the only candidate able to steer Israel through a sea of challenges.Gantz, a former army chief, tried to paint Netanyahu as isive and scandal-plagued, offering himself as a calming influence and honest alternative."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Housing charity Threshold says it intends to examine problem after issue raised in D\u0026aacuteilAn Taisce launches campaign to encourage girls to cycle to school every dayTen rallies are being held in Irish towns and cities in support of School Strikes for ClimateBritain submits \u0026lsquotechnical non-papers\u0026rsquo which reflect the ideas the UKCollision between man in his 70s and coach occurred on Eden QuayLandlord claim of \u0026euro1.48m rent arrears disputed by Fun2see Learning \u0026amp Activity CentreApplegreen confirms incident at its Cherry Orchard filling station was authenticT\u0026aacutenaiste: Attack on Quinn executive \u0026lsquoa reminder of gangland paramilitary-style punishment beatings of past\u0026rsquoBrokered agreement will only work if factories step up on base price, says IFA presidentDoctors could face investigation if found over prescribing benzodiazepines and other similar drugsParamilitary-style attack on Quinn executive Kevin Lunney \u0026lsquosevere beyond comprehension\u0026rsquoImporters and exporters urged to \u0026lsquoget organised\u0026rsquo to deal with flood of new paperworkOwen Keegan calls on councillors to reverse stance due to pressure on Dublin\u0026rsquos financesPainters to lose railings pitches next summer to facilitate Uefa festivalSpecial arrangements leaving North within UK may be acceptable, says Arlene FosterMood in Dublin is growing more pessimistic despite boisterous claims by the British PMDenise McManus had to leave her apartment in what ultimately became an \u0026lsquoawful process\u0026rsquoInappropriate prescribing of benzodiazepines having corrosive effect on patients"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4023769.1568897750!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"attendance at greyhound tracks drops 20 after rt%C3%A9 expose","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMr Dollard said the “footprint” of the greyhound industry may have to changeAttendances at greyhound tracks dropped by a fifth in the aftermath of RTÉ’s expose of mistreatment of dogs in the sector as the sport faces a “problematic” financial future, an Oireachtas committee has heard.The Irish Greyhound Board (IGB), which today is giving evidence on its 2017 accounts to the Public Accounts Committee, also said that it had marked down the value of its stadium portfolio following a revaluation exercise by more than €20 million. IGB chief executive Gerard Dollard told the committee that in its 2018 accounts, which are not yet published, the value of fixed assets held by the company fell from €51.5 million to €29.4 million. The PAC heard this morning that the commercial future of the sport was under threat due to dwindling attendances and the poor financial performance of many tracks. “The existing model from a financial sustainability perspective is problematic,” Mr Dollard told Fine Gael TD Alan Farrell. “Bottom line, looking at our own stadia, Shelbourne Park and Cork wash their face. All other stadia lose money,” he said. “There has to be a rationalised industry. I expect the footprint will have to change,” he saidIndustry footprintMr Dollard flagged earlier that the “footprint” of the industry may have to change. Economic consultants Indecon are currently examining this issue, with a report expected next month. Connolly’s Red Mills, an animal feed supplier, also pulled its sponsorship, but its budget has been redeployed to directly support welfare. Mr Dollard also said that his organisation has made a complaint to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland over the RTÉ programme. The Committee heard that average attendance at greyhound meetings has fallen to 319. Overall, attendance was down 19 per cent in 2017 compared to 2016. Meanwhile, turnover from racing has also fallen dramatically in recent years, from €32.9 million in 2010 to €22.7 million in 2017. The IGB has not made any request for increased funding from the exchequer for this year, the committee heard. However, its strategic plan is predicated on a multimillion euro increase in exchequer funding between now and 2021. The organisation is also facing staffing issues. Mr Dollard confirmed that the IGB’s Director of Governance and Compliance has been on leave since February of 2017, and there is no director of sales and marketing at the semi-state company. Media rightsMr Dollard told Sinn Féin TD David Cullinane that while many aspects of the sport’s performance are challenged, the sale of media rights and international broadcasting rights, as well as the overall tote performance, is improving. The IGB detailed a variety of measures to improve animal welfare which have been put in place since the broadcast of the RTÉ programme. However, the committee also heard that the Department of Agriculture had not been given a consultancy report which formed a core part of that programme until May of this year, despite it being completed in December of 2017.The report, by consultancy firm Preferred Results, suggested that up to 6,000 dogs could be being culled in the industry every year. The IGB has rejected the report, which cost €130,000. Mr Kelly said it was “absolutely shocking” that the Department were not told about the report until the broadcast of a programme which detailed its contents, even if the IGB did not agree with its conclusions.

Photograph: Ste MurrayFewer than one in 250 girls cycle to school every day, according to An Taisce, and those who do cycle say they are dealing with “harassment on the roads from drivers and young men”. The environmental charity has launched a campaign #andshecycles through its Green Schools initiative to try and encourage more teenage girls to cycle and discuss why they do not. Research carried out on behalf of the organisation found young women are dealing with peer pressure, harassment from drivers and young men and a perception that cycling is “uncool”. Lack of cycle lanes and safety concerns were also raised by participants. An Taisce said the campaign hopes to change and challenge some of the issues raised through video, social media and continued liaison with students. Jane Hackett, manager of the Green Schools travel programme said: “We have been working with schools around the country to increase cycling numbers for over ten years. “Because of this work we realised that although teen girls wanted to cycle the numbers weren’t increasing at the same levels as their male counterparts. So we asked why, and #andshecycles was born.”An exhibition of portraits of young women with their bikes taken by photographer Ste Murray will be on show from 4pm on Thursday at the Science Gallery to officially launch the campaign.

The festival village will involve live match screenings, football activities and competitions, food and drink, music and entertainment as well as “artistic and cultural performances”. However the regular artists, some of whom have been trading on the square for more than 35 years have been excluded.Summer trading“This will involve a complete loss of livelihood for six weeks of the summer months, which is the busiest time of the year. We are outdoors in all weathers winter and summer but hours of trading are restricted by light so June and July days are also our longest.”Many of the 101 artists who trade on the square are dependent on the weekend sales which are particularly popular with tourists and Dubliners during the summer months.“This will be a catastrophic loss for many of the artists. Some have told me they will have to go on the dole for those six weeks.”Artists were informed of their exclusion from the square by letter attached to their annual licence renewal form and were given fewer than 10 days to respond, Ms Prendergast said. They have been offered a licence reduction of €60 by the council but have not been offered an alternative location, she said.‘Commercial branding’“The specific reason for the artists to vacate is to allow Dublin City Council to hang commercial branding on the exterior railings of the square, which is the location for which the artists hold their licence to exhibit.” However, she said it was unlikely the football festival would be compatible with the art sales.“The people who are going to these events won’t want to buy and the people who do want to buy won’t want to come in with these events on.”Labour city councillor Dermot Lacey said he would be calling on the council to make an alternative venue available to the artists.“I would be very supportive of the artists. I am always of the view that you can’t create new rights by displacing the rights of others. This is not acceptable and I will be fighting their case,” he said.“I don’t believe it is beyond the wit of the council to find an alternative exhibition space for the artists. Maybe at the railings of the National Art Gallery or the Natural History Museum.”The council said it is working to identify an alternative location for artists."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4023518.1568883250!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coveney issues dose of reality saying there is big gap on brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTánaiste Simon Coveney has issued a “dose of reality” about the prospects for a Brexit deal. Photograph: CollinsTánaiste Simon Coveney has issued what he called a “dose of reality” about the prospects for a Brexit deal after suggestions by DUP leader Arlene Foster in Dublin last night raised hopes of a Northern Ireland-only solution to the Brexit stalemate. “There has been a lot of talk in the last few days about intensive efforts, progress being made, flexibility being shown. Let me just introduce a dose of reality here: there is a significant gap between what the British government has been talking about in terms of their approach and what the EU is able to accept,” he said. Britain on Thursday submitted some proposals in writing of how it would like the stalled Brexit deal to be amended, a spokeswoman for the European Union’s executive Commission said. “We have received documents from the UK and on this basis we will have technical discussion today and tomorrow on some aspects of customs, manufactured goods and sanitary and phytosanitary rules,” said Commission spokeswoman Mina Andreeva. She added that the EU and British Brexit negotiators, Michel Barnier and Stephen Barclay, will also discuss Brexit in Brussels on Friday. “These are papers for now. Until we have looked at them in detail, I will not characterise them beyond being a paper,” Ms Andreeva said. The UK side said it had shared with Brussels “technical non-papers which reflect the ideas the UK has been putting forward,” without going into further detail. “We will table formal written solutions when we are ready,” a British government spokeswoman said. Ms Andreeva added that there was no formal deadline for Britain to submit formal proposals but stressed that every day counted now as the Brexit date nears on October 31st.Mr Coveney was speaking at Iveagh House this morning at the launch of a campaign to promote Ireland in Japan during the rugby world cup. DUP leader Arlene Foster had indicated on Wednesday night that her party could accept special arrangements for Northern Ireland after Brexit as long as they did not affect the North’s position in the UK.SolutionsMs Foster said there were solutions to the Brexit impasse that involved special treatment for Northern Ireland but did not affect the constitutional position of the North.However, she said such arrangements would have to be supported by politicians in the North.Asked if Northern Ireland-specific solutions were possible if they did not affect the constitutional position of the North, Ms Foster said: “Well, I hope so, because what we want to see working ... I think what we want to see is a recognition that we are on an island. We do recognise the unique history and geography, but we also have to recognise that we are in the United Kingdom. ”The DUP leader was in Dublin to address the Dublin Chamber of Commerce annual dinner. In her speech, she said solutions could be found which did not damage the integrity of the single market, but also did not “erect new barriers to trade within the UK”.Afterward, she met Taoiseach Leo Varadkar for 45 minutes at Government Buildings where discussions centred on Brexit.Asked about the Taoiseach’s meeting with Ms Foster, Mr Coveney said: “The meeting with the Taoiseach was positive, it was friendly. It didn’t solve all problems. And I think we need to be careful that this doesn’t get interpreted as some kind of breakthrough, because I don’t think it is.“There’s still a big gap between what the British government has been suggesting they’re looking for and what the EU and Ireland need in terms of getting a deal. And in order to close that gap, we need to get credible proposals from the British government which he haven’t seen yet.” Asked why the British had not provided written proposals, Mr Coveney replied, “I can only assume they’re working on it ... But it’s getting very late in the day.” Mr Coveney again stressed that it was a “huge responsibility” on the British government to bring forward proposals which achieved the same ends as the backstop. He said the British government had to “deal with the problems that their approach is causing.”Chancellor of the ExchequerMeanwhile, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer Sajid Javid is in Dublin today to meet Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe.Speaking as the two men went in to Farmleigh House, Mr Donohoe noted it was the third time they had met in recent weeks and that the two men had “built up a really strong and really important relationship”.Mr Javid said he was “very pleased” to be in Dublin. “Whatever happens next with regard to Brexit it is essential that we not only maintain the strength of the relationship between our two great countries but that we find ways to enhance it and that’s exactly what I want to talk about today,” he said.Mr Javid did not take questions about the speech given in Madrid on Thursday by Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay in which he warned of possible medicine shortages in Ireland after a no-deal Brexit. Government Buildings has also confirmed that Taoiseach Leo Varadkar will meet British Prime Minister Boris Johnson in New York next week, where both will attend the UN General Assembly."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4022671.1568826278!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"much heat but little light in pursuit of brexit deal","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish prime minister Boris Johnson has been told by EU leaders proposals must achieve the same effect as the backstop contained in the withdrawal treaty. Photograph: GettyOn Friday it will be 30 days since German chancellor Angela Merkel told Boris Johnson during a Berlin news conference that a solution to the Brexit impasse could maybe be found within 30 days.Johnson, seizing on her remarks, welcomed the “blistering timetable” and declared “Wir schaffen das” (“We will manage”) a “Yes we can!” type phrase previously used by Merkel about the refugee crisis.And off he went. On that swing through European capitals, Johnson seemed to impress Merkel and later French president Emmanuel Macron with his desire to agree a new deal with the EU. Last week, he did the same with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar.But what Merkel and Macron, Varadkar and Jean Claude Juncker (don’t mention Xavier Bettel) and every other EU leader to whom he has spoken have said to Johnson is that those proposals must achieve the same effect as the backstop contained in the withdrawal treaty.But 29 days on, there has been no sign of British proposals which do anything of the sort. As EU leaders note with increasing irritation, nothing concrete has been tabled by the British government which could serve as a basis for negotiations with the EU.Neither have the British tabled workable solutions in the technical discussions that continue between Downing Street officials and the European Commission – meetings that Johnson now wants to intensify so that they take place every day. While Brussels sources wonder for what? A series of British ministers – most recently new Northern Secretary Julian Smith – have floated various ideas to Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney, as reported in Wednesday’s .But several senior Irish sources are clear as a whistle on these ideas and concepts: none of them go remotely far enough towards establishing a workable alternative to the backstop. In other words, not alone are there no negotiations on a new deal going on, we are quite a distance away from the starting point for such negotiations. Speculation as to whether Johnson is serious about wanting a deal comes and goes in Dublin and in Brussels. Some politicians and officials expect British proposals to replace the backstop to be tabled late in the day, with a frantic period of negotiating against the deadline of a no-deal Brexit looming. Others say this is all just part of a strategy to avoid the blame for no deal. What, if anything, is taking shape? Johnson has claimed the shape of a deal is becoming clearer. And despite protestations it appears that if there is to be a deal it will be a Northern Ireland-specific solution that involves treating the North differently from the rest of the UK, in some respects. There may be a role for Stormont to give it democratic legitimacy in Northern Ireland. It will include an all-Ireland food and agriculture zone (eliminating the requirement for animals to be checked on the Border) and a series of measures such as a trusted-trader scheme, checks on goods at a business level and other arrangements designed to reduce cross-Border friction.However, senior Irish sources familiar with Government deliberations say that even if the details of these measures were worked out – and they are not – they would be insufficient to replace the backstop.That is because the position of Theresa May’s government – that it would eliminate the need for a border – has been junked by Johnson and replaced with a commitment to try to make the Border as frictionless as possible. That is a very big difference. And it will make a deal very difficult to reach. The mood in Dublin is growing more pessimistic.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches. See more here.

He insisted that that “the alternative to the backstop is not necessary until the end of the implementation period in December 2020”. Photograph: Pierre-Philippe MarcouAFPGetty ImagesThe UK has again demanded that talks on guaranteeing a soft Northern Ireland border be postponed until the end of the withdrawal transition period.\u0026nbspAttacking the EU for its lack of flexibility in the Border discussions, Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay elaborated the case against the backstop while not suggesting any alternative.He insisted that that “the alternative to the backstop is not necessary until the end of the implementation period in December 2020 . . . why risk crystallising an undesirable result this November, when both sides can work together – until December 2020?”Mr Barclay, who returns to Brussels on Friday to continue talks with the EU’s task force, was speaking at a meeting for the press in Madrid this morning.The EU has long insisted that it needs the backstop as part of the withdrawal agreement as an insurance policy ahead of and in case discussions on the future relationship during transition are prolonged or do not produce a result that would guarantee a soft border in Ireland.Mr Barclay repeated prime minister Boris Johnson’s insistence that “the UK wants a deal. Time is short – there are just 42 days until we leave – but it is sufficient for a deal.”But the backstop “has to go”.Four reasonsHe said there were four reasons: “Northern Ireland . . . would be governed by rules in which they have no say” “It is inconsistent with the Belfast Agreement because the backstop has failed to achieve the consent of both communities” “The backstop risks being permanent – even though article 50 legally requires it to be temporary” and “the EU would control whether we can leave the backstop, making it harder to leave the backstop than leaving the EU itself.”Mr Barclay said the UK believes that the backstop can be replaced, though without requiring continued membership of either the customs union or the single market.He warned that the UK would not be alone to suffer in the event of a no deal.“For example if I take Ireland, two-thirds of Irish medicines come through Great Britain, 40 per cent of its exports go through Dover. Its supermarkets are supplied from distribution centres in the Midlands.“Yet this is presented as solely a UK challenge – it is a mutual challenge, because if indeed there were 2½ days of delays at Calais, then the impact of that would not solely be felt within the UK, it would be felt in Ireland and indeed in businesses here in Spain. ”“We are committed to carving out a landing zone,” he said, “and we stand ready to share the relevant text. But it must be in the spirit of negotiation – with flexibility, and with a negotiating partner that is willing to compromise,” he said, insisting that the EU has not shown such flexibility.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Video: C-Span\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tClimate activists Greta Thunberg and Jamie Margolin appearing before a House select committee on the climate crisis on Capitol Hill in Washington on Wednesday. Photograph: Anna MoneymakerThe New York TimesThese are some of the things that Greta Thunberg has learned on her American tour. New York City smells. People talk really loudly here, they blast air conditioning, and they argue over whether they believe in climate change, while in her country, Sweden, they accept it as fact.Also, US lawmakers would do well to read the latest science on the threats posed by climate change.That’s what Thunberg (16) told members of a congressional subcommittee on Wednesday when she was asked to submit her testimony into the record. She submitted a report issued last October by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, spelling out the threats of global temperature rise. “I don’t want you to listen to me,” she said. “I want you to listen to the scientists.”Her remarks lasted barely a minute. “And then I want you to take real action.”With her typically blunt, often biting remarks, she has offered Americans a sort of unvarnished, outsider’s view of themselves. And she has used the supersize attention she has received in the country to draw attention to her American peers, those young activists who have dutifully organised for climate action in their communities without any of the limelight that she has received.“She’s been quite selfless in this,” said Xiuhtezcatl Martínez (19) one of the 21 plaintiffs in a landmark children’s lawsuit against the US government. “I’m impressed with that.”Martínez has joined her in a number of her public appearances in New York and Washington, including at an Amnesty International awards ceremony this week, where Thunberg insisted on being onstage with her peers, rather than by herself. “A huge part of her messaging is, ‘This is not for me,’” Martínez said.On Wednesday afternoon, Thunberg joined her activist peers as they went to meet with the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi. She didn’t want to say much, recalled Vic Barrett (20), of White Plains, New York, who is also a plaintiff in the children’s climate lawsuit.“She felt it was an opportunity for the US youth,” Barrett said. “She’s been very clear that she doesn’t feel like all the attention needs to be on her.”‘Invisible girl’Thunberg once described herself as “the invisible girl”. She has never been fond of small talk. She still speaks very quietly and slowly. But she smiles much more than when she first began gaining media attention a year ago. She is more comfortable at banter, including with Trevor Noah, host of The Daily Show, who asked last week how it was to arrive in New York City after a two-week journey across the Atlantic on a solar-powered yacht.She recalled the smell. “It was indescribable,” she said, which prompted howls of laughter from the audience, also in New York City.On Tuesday, speaking to members of a Senate task force, she spoke directly to earnest lawmakers who had commended youth climate activists like her for their courage. “Please save us your praise. We don’t want it,” she said. “Don’t invite us here to tell us how inspiring we are without doing anything about it.”Jamie Margolin (17), a Seattle-based activist who had been invited to the same meeting, was glad she called them out. “She gives very blunt observations,” Margolin said. “If I had done that, people would’ve thought I was an entitled brat.”“She comes with an outsider’s perspective,” Margolin added.Thunberg explained her indignation this way on a CBS Good Morning interview: “We cannot focus on what we can and cannot say now,” she said. “We must speak clearly about what’s happening.”She has said she wants the global youth protests planned for Friday to be a “social tipping point”.Her earnestness comes out occasionally, like when she speaks to her peers. She often says she could not have imagined that school strikes, which she helped to inspire, would take off in so many countries. And she often speaks publicly about being “grateful”.“You will constantly feel like you are not doing enough,” she said last week. “That is a very dangerous feeling to feel especially when you are actually doing everything you can.”“They are doing the impossible,” she said of her peers. “I am eternally grateful for them.” – New York TimesHow is mankind affecting the global climate and what can be done about it?"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons september 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraph matt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to telegraphmattprints or call 0191 603 0178.Comment: Would I return to the Tory party?

It looks exactly the same as before, yet somehow\u0026nbspentirely different.The design itself hasn’t changed from last year. That’s no surprise because 2018’s Apple Watch Series 4 was a radical departure from all the Watches that had gone before, with its bigger display in a nearly identical case, for instance.The Series 5, then, is a dead ringer for Series 4. Except for the couple of things that make it appear very different different.First, there’s the case. Last year, you could choose between aluminium and stainless-steel finishes cladding the watch. The aluminium came in several colours, including rose gold, while the stainless steel came in the natural silvery colour you’d expect, plus Space Black and Gold.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Gun-toting humanoid robot sent into spaceRussia has launched a humanoid robot into space on a rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS).

These include a new metal finish: titanium. It is lighter than – and a little more expensive – than the stainless-steel options and is very attractive. Especially in the Space Black option.Then there’s a return to the ceramic finish not seen since Apple Watch Series 3. It looks sensational: gleaming white and almost glowing, it’s so shiny.But the case is not the real reason this Apple Watch looks so different. That’s down to the new display which gives rise to a new feature: an always-on screen.Unlike regular watches, smart watches tend to conserve battery by turning off the display when you’re not actually looking at it. It makes sense, right? So to wake the display, you must raise your arm. The Apple Watch has always done this raise-to-wake action perfectly, better than rivals, but it still leaves you with that occasional moment when flicking your wrist leaves the display dormant.Now, with the low-temperature poly-silicon and oxide display (abbreviated, thankfully, to LTPO), Apple has devised a way to keep the screen on all the time.iPhone 11 review reveals eye-catching upgrade for AppleSo, you can sneak a glance at the time in a dull meeting without having to twist your wrist revealingly, for instance. Or look at the Watch when it’s facing downwards, where it previously would have switched off.This sounds like such a small thing, but in practice I’ve found it to be a real game-changer.It takes a little getting used to because Apple has organised it so the display dims when you’re not looking at it, though is still entirely visible. It’s very cleverly crafted so it’s not just a matter of turning down the brightness: each Watch face has been optimised so certain elements fade out altogether in the less bright state, or change to a darker colour. Without moving your wrist, you can see the dimmed state raise your arm and it’s back to full brightness and full-on design.It’s the key feature on the new Watch and it works brilliantly.Edelson  AFP)There are new Watch faces to go with the new hardware, including some exclusive to the new Series 5.The other major new hardware in the Watch is a compass. I can hear you snorting in derision, but it’s actually plenty useful. That’s because it can be integrated into apps. For instance, when you’re looking for a restaurant on Yelp and you don’t know which way you should head on the street, take a look at the arrow on the Yelp Watch app. As you turn, the arrow turns with you, so the right direction to head in is unmistakable.It’s also useful in outdoors situations, or if you just fancy knowing your current elevation, longitude, latitude and incline. A bit geeky but quite cool.Much of the rest of the Watch is the same as Series 4. Why didn’t Apple upgrade the processor? Probably because the speed increase it got last time around was enough to last for a while or perhaps the power use optimisation needed for an always-on display may have made this the best configuration.There are new apps in the latest watchOS 6 software, such as a handy Noise app which warns you when the environment you’re in could be too loud for your ears to endure.The Watch has always been about health and fitness and other additions include menstrual cycle tracking for women and the ability to track trends in your activity over a longer period of time. Of course, the heart rate monitor and ECG capabilities of Series 4 are on board here, too.A word about Series 3. Although Series 4 has been retired, the excellent Series 3 first launched in 2017 has had a huge price cut and now starts at £199. This is phenomenal value for such a capable smartwatch. You don’t get the sumptuously big screen or ECG features of Series 5, for instance, but it’s a great first Apple Watch.The Series 5 Watch starts at £399 for the smaller, 40mm case in aluminium or £429 for the larger, 44mm case.

Even so, the think tank warns the measures will inevitably fall far short of eliminating the economic damage of an abrupt exit.\u0026nbspThe scale of recommended spending is much larger than the amount the already-indebted government can borrow in the 2020-21 fiscal year without breaking its self-imposed borrowing limit.\u0026nbspHere\u0027s the full story from Olesya Dmitracova:\u0026nbspBrexit: Boris Johnson urged to spend £60bn to limit impact of no dealUS jobless claims rise less than expected\u0026nbspSome better economic news for Donald Trump after a string of negative indicators: claims for unemployment benefit rose by just 2,000 to 208,000 last week.\u0026nbspEconomists polled by Reuters had forecast claims increasing to 213,00 in the latest week.\u0026nbspThe UK jobs market had recently been showing signs of slowing down.Ryanair boss Michael O\u0027Leary\u0027s €99m pay has sparked anger\u0026nbspMichael O\u0027Leary and the company he runs are\u0026nbsprarely very far from some form of controversy and today is no different.\u0026nbspJust 50.5 per cent of the Irish airline\u0027s shareholders voted in favour of a pay deal that could hand O\u0027Leary €99m (£88m).\u0026nbspRyanair is already facing strike action from pilots and has cut jobs.Interest rate reaction\u0026nbspThe BoE has a tricky balancing act on its hands when it comes to future interest rate decisions, says\u0026nbspPwC chief economist John Hawksworth.On the one hand, the tight labour market has pushed earnings growth up to around 4 per cent\u0026nbspat a time when productivity growth remains very subdued.\u0026nbspThe consequent increase in unit labour costs might normally cause the MPC to consider edging interest rates up to head off potential future inflationary pressures, even though current inflation is slightly below target.\u0026nbspBut offsetting this will be the dampening effect of Brexit-related uncertainty on UK business investment and the housing market. Jobs growth has also slowed in recent months and today\u0027s retail sales data showed a dip in August.Bank of England interest rates decision\u0026nbspThe BoE\u0027s Monetary Policy Committee has left its benchmark rate on hold at 0.75 per cent, as expected.\u0026nbspThe MPC\u0027s nine members voted unanimously in favour of keeping rates where they were.Bank of England interest rates decision\u0026nbspThe BoE\u0027s Monetary Policy Committee has left its benchmark rate on hold at 0.75 per cent, as expected.\u0026nbspThe MPC\u0027s nine members voted unanimously in favour of keeping rates where they were.Debenhams wins court battle against Mike Ashley\u0027s Sports Direct\u0026nbspDebenhams\u0027 programme of store closures will go ahead under a CVA insolvency process as planned after the department store chain won a case in the High Court brought by Sports Direct.\u0026nbspMike Ashley\u0027s firm and a number Debenhams\u0027 landlords had challenged the terms of the turnaround plan,\u0026nbspwhich saw rents on stores slashed and the value of Sports Direct\u0027s\u0026nbspstake in Debenhams wiped out.\u0027Persistently low growth\u0027\u0026nbspThe OECD\u0027s assessment is pretty bleak, particularly about the impact of trade tensions surrounding Brexit and Donald Trump\u0027s tariff war.\u0026nbspThe economic outlook is deteriorating, for both advanced and emerging economies, and global growth may remain stuck at a persistently low level in the absence of strong policy measures.The exacerbation of trade conflicts is increasingly weighing on confidence and investment, which increases policy uncertainty, exacerbates capital market risks, and jeopardizes the already weak growth that is taking place. draws in perspective on a global scale.\u0026nbspThe OECD also says that Brexit will slash 3 per cent of UK GDP over the next three years.\u0026nbspBy contrast, the EU faces just a 0.6 per cent hit.\u0026nbsp“The best thing is to avoid a no-deal Brexit and to stay as closely aligned to the EU as possible,” says\u0026nbspLaurence Boone, the OECD’s chief economist.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspTesla takes on Porsche\u0026nbspElon Musk\u0027s electric car company wants to take on the engineering might of Porsche by beating it in a time trial around Germany\u0027s fables Nuerburgring race track.\u0026nbspTesla\u0027s Model S recorded an unofficial time that was faster than Porsche\u0027s rival electric car, the Taycan, according to Germany\u0027s Auto Motor und Sport.\u0026nbspAn official record attempt for four-door electric cars is set for this Saturday.

This suggests the market does not think the government will end up blocking the deal, said Mr Wilson at Markets.But he added: “I think the risk of the government preventing this deal going through is higher than the market is indicating.”Additional reporting by agenciesShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The Welsh government would not reveal the details of any support given.Any public funds pledged to support Mr Ratcliffe’s business interests are likely to raise eyebrows. In February, The Sunday Times reported that Sir Jim and his two key lieutenants, Andrew Currie and John Reece, were planning a move to the tax-free principality of Monaco in a bid to save £4bn in UK taxes. Between them, the three men own all of Ineos’s shares.\u0026nbspThe move to build around 25,000 of the new “Projekt Grenadier” vehicles in Wales will come as a rare piece of positive news for Britain’s beleaguered car industry which has been battered by the threat of Brexit and thousands of job cuts.However, the scale of the new production is small compared with the hundreds of thousands of cars manufactured at the UK’s largest car plants.Billionaire Brexiteer to move to Monaco in bid to ‘save £4bn in tax’Secretary of State for Wales Alun Cairns said: “Ineos’s investment will provide a welcome boost to our automotive sector and to this part of Wales, creating important jobs which will contribute to a strengthened economy.

Production has dropped sharply from a peak in 2016 as car makers grapple with Brexit and falling diesel sales, among other problems.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The average monthly shortfall for these clients was £365.Unexpected life events were the biggest causes of problem debt.Those experiencing a reduction in income (18 per cent), injury or illness (16 per cent) or unemployment or redundancy (16 per cent) made up the bulk of new clients.StepChange said its figures “underline the growing number of households in the United Kingdom struggling to keep their heads above water, particularly when faced with a sudden change in personal circumstances”.Phil Andrew, chief executive of StepChange Debt Charity, said: “These statistics provide a sobering assessment of the scale of problem debt in this country.Surge in councils using bailiffs to chase debts“Across the board, we are seeing red flags, including worrying proportions of new clients falling into debt due to reduced income, illness or because they rely on credit to pay for day-to-day living expenses.“Clearly more and more households are struggling to hang on and are ill-equipped to deal with any economic shocks the future may hold.He said the figures “must act as a wake-up call to the Government”, with issues around bailiff behaviour and the five-week wait people have before they receive their first Universal Credit payments.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This proportion has risen by a third since 2014, when 18 per cent of new clients were single parents.Nine in 10 single parent clients were renters. Single parents were also particularly likely to have higher outgoings than incomes.StepChange said the rapid growth in single-parent clients suggests they are being squeezed by benefits payments and the rising cost of living.A Government spokeswoman said: “We are determined to help families improve their lives through work, while continuing to support them with the cost of living.“But we know some families need more support, which is why we spend more than £95 billion a year on working age benefits.“With Universal Credit, people can get paid urgently if they need it, and 700,000 families will get on average £285 more a month because the system is simpler.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

He added that the lower clothing prices may be due to unusually wet weather keeping shoppers away and prompting discounting by retailers.Slower inflation may be good for consumers in the short term but it also rings alarm bells for economists.\u0026nbsp“The falling inflation rate could be an early signal of a cooling economy, in line with what we have seen in the US and the euro area,” said\u0026nbspYael\u0026nbspSelfin, chief economist at\u0026nbspKPMG\u0026nbspUK.“Recent falls in the value of the pound and the spike in oil prices over the weekend should boost the headline rate in the coming months, with higher prices for fuel and for imported goods putting pressure on households’ purchasing power and business margins, and further curtailing demand.”Separate data from the ONS showed that average house prices increased by 0.7 per cent\u0026nbspin July compared with a year earlier, only half the rate in June and the weakest pace of growth since September 2012.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The reason for this discrepancy lies in the different inflation metrics used, the think tank says.When estimating GDP, or the value of national output, government statisticians adjust it for inflation, applying what is known as the GDP deflator. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) says it is the broadest measure of inflation in the UK economy, reflecting changes in the price of all goods and services that make up GDP, whether or not they involve consumers.When fine-tuning GDP in its own analysis, the NEF used a narrower measure of inflation – one that tracks changes\u0026nbsponly in consumer prices, including the costs of owning and maintaining a home.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A surfer in action during sunrise at Tynemouth on the north east coastProtesters dressed as the Incredible Hulk and Robocop outside the Supreme Court in London where judges are due to consider legal challenges to Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u0027s decision to suspend Parliament.

Analysis of incomes of people born between 1920s and 1990s revealed that, up until those born in the 1970s, each generation has tended to be better-off than people born a decade earlier were at the same age.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Even so, the think tank warns the measures will inevitably fall far short of eliminating the economic damage of an abrupt exit.\u0026nbspThe scale of recommended spending is much larger than the amount the already-indebted government can borrow in the 2020-21 fiscal year without breaking its self-imposed borrowing limit.\u0026nbspHere\u0027s the full story from Olesya Dmitracova:\u0026nbspBrexit: Boris Johnson urged to spend £60bn to limit impact of no dealUS jobless claims rise less than expected\u0026nbspSome better economic news for Donald Trump after a string of negative indicators: claims for unemployment benefit rose by just 2,000 to 208,000 last week.\u0026nbspEconomists polled by Reuters had forecast claims increasing to 213,00 in the latest week.\u0026nbspThe UK jobs market had recently been showing signs of slowing down.Ryanair boss Michael O\u0027Leary\u0027s €99m pay has sparked anger\u0026nbspMichael O\u0027Leary and the company he runs are\u0026nbsprarely very far from some form of controversy and today is no different.\u0026nbspJust 50.5 per cent of the Irish airline\u0027s shareholders voted in favour of a pay deal that could hand O\u0027Leary €99m (£88m).\u0026nbspRyanair is already facing strike action from pilots and has cut jobs.Interest rate reaction\u0026nbspThe BoE has a tricky balancing act on its hands when it comes to future interest rate decisions, says\u0026nbspPwC chief economist John Hawksworth.On the one hand, the tight labour market has pushed earnings growth up to around 4 per cent\u0026nbspat a time when productivity growth remains very subdued.\u0026nbspThe consequent increase in unit labour costs might normally cause the MPC to consider edging interest rates up to head off potential future inflationary pressures, even though current inflation is slightly below target.\u0026nbspBut offsetting this will be the dampening effect of Brexit-related uncertainty on UK business investment and the housing market. Jobs growth has also slowed in recent months and today\u0027s retail sales data showed a dip in August.Bank of England interest rates decision\u0026nbspThe BoE\u0027s Monetary Policy Committee has left its benchmark rate on hold at 0.75 per cent, as expected.\u0026nbspThe MPC\u0027s nine members voted unanimously in favour of keeping rates where they were.Bank of England interest rates decision\u0026nbspThe BoE\u0027s Monetary Policy Committee has left its benchmark rate on hold at 0.75 per cent, as expected.\u0026nbspThe MPC\u0027s nine members voted unanimously in favour of keeping rates where they were.Debenhams wins court battle against Mike Ashley\u0027s Sports Direct\u0026nbspDebenhams\u0027 programme of store closures will go ahead under a CVA insolvency process as planned after the department store chain won a case in the High Court brought by Sports Direct.\u0026nbspMike Ashley\u0027s firm and a number Debenhams\u0027 landlords had challenged the terms of the turnaround plan,\u0026nbspwhich saw rents on stores slashed and the value of Sports Direct\u0027s\u0026nbspstake in Debenhams wiped out.\u0027Persistently low growth\u0027\u0026nbspThe OECD\u0027s assessment is pretty bleak, particularly about the impact of trade tensions surrounding Brexit and Donald Trump\u0027s tariff war.\u0026nbspThe economic outlook is deteriorating, for both advanced and emerging economies, and global growth may remain stuck at a persistently low level in the absence of strong policy measures.The exacerbation of trade conflicts is increasingly weighing on confidence and investment, which increases policy uncertainty, exacerbates capital market risks, and jeopardizes the already weak growth that is taking place. draws in perspective on a global scale.\u0026nbspThe OECD also says that Brexit will slash 3 per cent of UK GDP over the next three years.\u0026nbspBy contrast, the EU faces just a 0.6 per cent hit.\u0026nbsp“The best thing is to avoid a no-deal Brexit and to stay as closely aligned to the EU as possible,” says\u0026nbspLaurence Boone, the OECD’s chief economist.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspTesla takes on Porsche\u0026nbspElon Musk\u0027s electric car company wants to take on the engineering might of Porsche by beating it in a time trial around Germany\u0027s fables Nuerburgring race track.\u0026nbspTesla\u0027s Model S recorded an unofficial time that was faster than Porsche\u0027s rival electric car, the Taycan, according to Germany\u0027s Auto Motor und Sport.\u0026nbspAn official record attempt for four-door electric cars is set for this Saturday.

He should announce a significant stimulus package of tax cuts and spending increases to support households in the face of a no-deal economic shock, as well as measures to help firms through the temporary turbulence many are likely to face.Welcome to The Independent\u0027s live coverage of business and economics events.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe Bank of England is expected to keep interest rates at 0.75 per cent when its Monetary Policy Committee reports at midday.\u0026nbspBefore that the latest retail sales figures are about to be revealed.

The Welsh government would not reveal the details of any support given.Any public funds pledged to support Mr Ratcliffe’s business interests are likely to raise eyebrows. In February, The Sunday Times reported that Sir Jim and his two key lieutenants, Andrew Currie and John Reece, were planning a move to the tax-free principality of Monaco in a bid to save £4bn in UK taxes. Between them, the three men own all of Ineos’s shares.\u0026nbspThe move to build around 25,000 of the new “Projekt Grenadier” vehicles in Wales will come as a rare piece of positive news for Britain’s beleaguered car industry which has been battered by the threat of Brexit and thousands of job cuts.However, the scale of the new production is small compared with the hundreds of thousands of cars manufactured at the UK’s largest car plants.Billionaire Brexiteer to move to Monaco in bid to ‘save £4bn in tax’Secretary of State for Wales Alun Cairns said: “Ineos’s investment will provide a welcome boost to our automotive sector and to this part of Wales, creating important jobs which will contribute to a strengthened economy.

Production has dropped sharply from a peak in 2016 as car makers grapple with Brexit and falling diesel sales, among other problems.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

That includes new features like improved multi-tasking, a re-designed home screen and more.When the new iPhone update arrivesThis is the first year that Apple has split the operating systems for iPhone and iPad into separate releases, with the latter being referred to as iPadOS. That has presumably allowed the company to more easily stagger the different releases.And it will not be until 30 September that Apple TV gets its own software update, too. That update, named tvOS 13, will bring support for multiple users as well as the ability to use Xbox and PS4 controllers with Apple\u0027s set-top box.Apple presumably could not delay the release of iOS 13 for iPhones in the same way as the Apple TV and iPad because the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro will be released this week, and they needed a stable version of the new software to ship on them.The company did unveil a new iPad at its September event, when the new iPhones were shown off, but that device will not ship until 30 September.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They include the addition of a long-awaited dark mode, new animoji, and updates to maps.It is also perhaps the strangest iPhone update in recent years, since many of the headline features will not actually arrive for another two weeks, with the release of iOS 13.1 on 30 September. That will bring a range of bug fixes for problems that still exist in iOS 13, as well as the features that have been held back.The iPad and Apple TV also won\u0027t be able to get the new update until that same date.

His salary in 2016-17 was revealed to be between £600,000 and £649,999, but\u0026nbsphe took a pay cut the following year, to £290,000-£294,999.His final programme included interviews with former prime ministers David Cameron and Tony Blair. Over the years Humphrys faced accusations of political bias, including by the then chief secretary to the treasury Jonathan Aitken, who in 1995 claimed he was “poisoning the well of political debate” with his “ego-trip interviewing”.A BBC statement at the time defended\u0026nbspHumphrys\u0026nbspand said: “Viewers and listeners expect BBC interviews with politicians to be fair but also robust and testing. Day in and day out John\u0026nbspHumphrys\u0026nbspand his colleagues on the Today programme demonstrate with great professionalism how it is possible to achieve both those objectives.“We invariably take great care to investigate complaints from any party, and we also have to be alert to the kind of pressures which in the past have tended to increase as a general election gets nearer.”Created with Sketch.29 TV shows that have been made into bad films Show all 29Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Joe Carnahan’s dusty and grimy adaptation retained the catchphrases and character personalities of the original series, while surrounding them with an entirely incoherent plot and noisy sub-Michael Bay action. Liam Neeson made for a fun Hannibal Smith and UFC fighter Quinton “Rampage” Jackson did his best as BA Baracus, but a never-more-slappable Bradley Cooper and the chronically unappealing Sharlto Copley were the pits.A sad-all-round adaptation of the cult MTV animated series from the 1990s, Aeon Flux abandoned the avant-garde, largely dialogue-free sensuality of its source material for generic action and dodgy special effects. If it weren’t for the classy presence of Charlize Theron and director Karyn Kusama, whose early cut was radically altered by producers, this would have basically been a bargain-bin Milla Jovovich joint. And that, honestly, would have been a lot more fun.Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman must have been grateful when Marvel came along and helped scrub 1998 film The Avengers even further out of cultural memory. But for those who had to endure their hammy 1998 adaptation of the classic spy series, it’d take a lot more than Iron Man and Captain America to make us forget the image of Sean Connery inexplicably dressed in a giant bear costume and trying to control the weather. Shudders.Although The Bad Education Movie arrived in a similar summertime slot to the successful Inbetweeners film, this sitcom adaptation was nowhere near as popular. Jack Whitehall’s performance was panned by critics who said he appeared “desperate to shock” as delinquent teacher Alfie Wickers and described the whole movie as a “farce”.This 1977 film based on BBC sitcom Are You Being Served? took its inspiration from a theatre production in Blackpool. While it found success on stage, the big screen version was met with hostility, with one critic calling it guilty of violating almost every law of comedy and film.David Hasselhoff is unforgettable as the hunky chief lifeguard Mitch Buchannon patrolling a sunny beach in Baywatch. After a rocky start when the first season was cancelled on NBC, it became the world\u0027s most-watched TV show, running in its original format for 10 years until 1999. The unnecessary big-screen version of the show starred Dwayne Johnson in Hasselhoff’s role and Zac Efron as a new recruit. Even the nostalgic cameo from the show\u0027s former star didn’t make up for the paper-thin plot.Because nose-centric glory for Nicole Kidman couldn’t happen twice, this adaptation of sparkly magical sitcom Bewitched arrived two years after the actor won her Oscar for The Hours, and promptly became a key component in her Queen of Flops reputation throughout the late-2000s. This had brilliance written all over it, from Nora Ephron behind the camera to Will Ferrell, Steve Carell, Jason Schwartzman and Shirley MacLaine in the supporting cast, but still somehow managed to stink.Leigh Francis character Keith Lemon received the big screen treatment in 2012\u0027s Keith Lemon: The Film, one of the only titles to have ever received zero per cent on Rotten Tomatoes. Putting pins in one\u0027s eyes is rumoured to be a better experience.Despite an all-star cast that included Bill Nighy, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Michael Gambon and Tony Jones, the poorly judged spin-off of the much-loved BBC sitcom Dad\u0027s Army (2016) took a pounding from critics, who derided the attempt at an homage to a TV show that had nothing wrong with it in the first place.The nadir of Tim Burton’s career, Dark Shadows was a film nobody was particularly crying out for, most of the fans of the original 1960s fantasy soap opera long dead and the general public having by then grown tired of Johnny Depp’s “heavily made-up comedy weirdo” schtick. Most egregious, however, was the film’s failure to properly utilise Michelle Pfeiffer 20 years after she played Catwoman in Burton’s Batman Returns.Julian Fellowes took the beloved TV drama about the lives of the aristocratic Crawley family and the people who serve them – and turned it into one long fawning session about the royals. Absolutely nothing happens in this film where an entire sub-plot involves a boiler being fixed, and another, completely implausible storyline about an assassination attempt on the king. The only real intrigue is why Thomas, the butler, has suddenly acquired a very orange tan. This is what happens when British institutions get a Hollywood makeover, folks.1229 The Dukes of HazzardThere was a time when Johnny Knoxville, Seann William Scott and Jessica Simpson were the hottest cast in town. There was never a time this unwanted cinematic revival of the action comedy series wasn\u0027t entirely stupid. Life imitated art when the main stars at the heart of HBO show Entourage hit the red carpet for the film version. Sadly, it lacked the vim that was present in most seasons of the show and ultimately felt like a mediocre feature-length episode.Kevin and Perry Go Large was no doubt adored by teens everywhere upon its released in 2000, which is why it\u0027s gained a cult following in the years since. In all honesty, the film is so terrible it\u0027s actually brilliant.1529 The League of Gentlemen2005 film The League of Gentlemen\u0027s Apocalypse is proof that Steve Pemberton, Reece Shearsmith, Mark Gatiss and Jeremy Dyson can do wrong. On the bright side, it\u0027s reassuring to know the multi-talented quartet are indeed human after all. It\u0027s not exactly clear who The Magic Roundabout film was intended for considering kids at the time would have had no idea who Dougal, Zebedee or company were. Save for providing work for Robbie Williams, Tom Baker and Bill Nighy, this version wasn’t much use for anyone. We are all to blame for the abysmal Mrs Brown\u0027s Boys D\u0027Movie. If the sitcom\u0027s Christmas specials weren\u0027t the most-watched episodes of television in the UK every year, then Brendan O\u0027Carroll probably wouldn’t have ever thought a film could be possible. Ricky Gervais just couldn\u0027t stay away from his Office character David Brent and gave him the big screen treatment in 2016\u0027s Life on the Road. Every second paled in comparison to ever single episode of the classic BBC series.The experience of watching the first ever Pokémon film – titled Pokémon: The First Movie – can be likened to watching a YouTube tutorial of someone playing a Pokémon video game, only somehow more boring.The charming story of Postman Pat and his black and white cat in the fictional and busy village of Greendale first screened on the BBC in 1981. What a shame that Postman Pat: The Movie in 2014 – the 3D animated feature film version – managed to stray so far from its original simplicity. It sees Postman Pat (voiced by Stephen Mangan) enter an X-Factor style-singing contest, and despite featuring an impressive array of voice actors, including Rupert Grint, Jim Broadbent and David Tennant, the film was too scary for the under-fives – especially the scene that sees Pat turn into a sinister robot.2129 Sex and the CitySex and the City had all the ingredients for a great movie: starry cast, cult fanbase, glamorous setting. Alas, both films were an embarrassment to the original series. Not enough happened in the movies to warrant anything longer than a 30-minute episode and unfortunately we can never unsee Sarah Jessica Parker and co doing that bizarre slo-mo walk through the desert.The problem with 2015 film Spooks: The Greater Good is that is arrived about 10 years too late. Spooks was a decent BBC drama that ended in 2011 and that\u0027s how it should have stayed.Based on the 1975 series of the same name, this action crime thriller starred Samuel L Jackson, Michelle Rodriguez, LL Cool J, Jeremy Renner, and Colin Farrell in one of his early box office hits. There was plenty of high-octane drama and Farrell was convincing as a hot-shot cop taking on a French drug lord (Olivier Martinez), but it’s also completely predictable and, ultimately, extremely pointless.An updated version of BBC crime series The Sweeney starring Ray Winstone sounds like something from spoof heaven. The finished film, released in 2012, didn\u0027t really do much to convince anyone that it wasn\u0027t. Sure, Ben Kingsley as The Hood is a great spot of casting, but practically everything else in the film version of Gerry Anderson\u0027s Thunderbirds failed to make the grade. Anderson himself was most damning he called it the biggest load of crap I have ever seen in my entire life.There are some interesting things in Twilight Zone: The Movie, but it loses points for featuring one of the worst pieces of work from Steven Spielberg: a segment set in a retirement home titled Kick the Can.Just because the Veronica Mars cast and its loyal fans really wanted a movie spin-off to be made, it doesn’t mean it should have ever actually happened. The TV show was revived thanks to funds raised by star Kristen Bell on Kickstarter, but the film was criticised for making literally no sense for anyone who hadn’t watched the series.Famously bad, Wild Wild West was adapted from the 1960s TV show and was the 2000 recipient of the golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture.Joe Carnahan’s dusty and grimy adaptation retained the catchphrases and character personalities of the original series, while surrounding them with an entirely incoherent plot and noisy sub-Michael Bay action.

The TV show was revived thanks to funds raised by star Kristen Bell on Kickstarter, but the film was criticised for making literally no sense for anyone who hadn’t watched the series.Famously bad, Wild Wild West was adapted from the 1960s TV show and was the 2000 recipient of the golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture.BBC director general Tony Hall said public figures would breathe “a sigh of relief” at Humphrys’ departure, in a piece for The .Describing him as “a journalistic great”, the director general wrote: “He is driven by a profound sense of justice and a deep distrust of authority. It means that he has always, unerringly, represented the listener and championed their right to know.”“There is perhaps no greater tribute than the collective sigh of relief issued by leaders and public figures all over the country,” he added.\u0026nbspAppearing on the Thought for the Day segment, rabbi Lord Jonathan Sacks paid tribute to Humphrys, commenting: “We don’t have prophets nowadays but if we did, one place you’d probably find them would be the\u0026nbspToday\u0026nbspprogramme.“Today’s tough interviewers are recognisably in that tradition of holding power accountable to truth... John Humphrys has been one of the best of our time. What’s made\u0026nbspJohn distinctive has been his fearless moral passion, and his refusal to be fobbed off with evasions and equivocations. He’s been called ‘radio’s rottweiler’ and the BBC’s ‘scrappy, scruffy mongrel terrier’, chasing every rabbit, catching every ball, leaping on the grandest sofa with mud on his paws and a bark of amused defiance.”“He’s been called the listener’s champion because he asked the questions we’d like to ask but don’t get the chance to.

Analysis of a 74-year-old\u0026nbspA.\u0026nbspsligoi\u0026nbspspecimen that once lived at London Zoo revealed its distinct genetic code and it is this species that is thought to be the largest of the three.Sixteen other specimens collected in the early 20th century were also examined.“It’s amazing in this day and age that it took until now to work out what the world’s largest amphibian is,” the study’s lead author Samuel Turvey, a conservation scientist at ZSL, told National Geographic.Created with Sketch.Science news in pictures Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.120 Turtle embryos influence sex by shakingThe sex of the turtle is determined by the temperatures at which they are incubated.

The tallest of the skeletons uncovered measured at 1.9mGiant salamanders, which typically live in rocky, mountainous river systems, were once widespread across central, southern and eastern China.Scientists concluded that Chinese giant salamanders erged into three distinct species between 3.1 and 2.4 million years ago, which coincides with a period of mountain formation when the Tibetan plateau rose rapidly.But their meat is considered a delicacy in China and they have historically been used for medicinal purposes, which has created a vast farming industry. Habitat loss and poaching also pose severe threats.‘Frozen Dragon of the North’: New species of flying creature foundWhile millions are now kept on farms, these appear to overwhelmingly be members of the most common species, while wild populations are at great risk of extinction.“These findings come at a time where urgent interventions are required to save Chinese giant salamanders in the wild,” said Melissa Marr, a PhD researcher at the Natural History Museum.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Zookeepers hope to one day introduce another animal to Professor Lew as a mate.Scientists believe that in light of the recent study, published on Monday in Ecology and Evolution, future conservation efforts could\u0026nbspinvolve\u0026nbspscreening farmed giant salamanders to determine their species before encouraging them to mate and reintroducing\u0026nbspthem into the wild among their own species.Dr Turvey added:\u0026nbsp“We hope that this new understanding of their species ersity has arrived in time to support their successful conservation, but urgent measures are required to protect any viable giant salamander populations that might remain.”Additional reporting by PAShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Pretty Woman certainly isn’t good, with an undercurrent of sleaze so disquieting that it’s no real surprise to learn it was once planned to be a gritty sex work drama that ended in tragedy. But Julia Roberts is pure star-is-born loveliness here, beloved by the camera and endlessly watchable as a result, her joyous pluck overshadowing the rest of the film’s murkier elements. That Disney, the studio behind the film, imagined its aspirational romcom hero as a rich businessman prowling Hollywood Boulevard for an escort is slightly maddening. That Pretty Woman somehow pulls it off… even more so.There are a few moments in this high-school re-telling of George Bernard Shaw\u0027s Pygmalion – in which, due to an elaborate bet, popular jock Zach (Freddie Prinze Jr) attempts to turn artsy nerd Laney Boggs (Rachael Leigh Cook) into the Prom Queen in six weeks – that pull the rug out from under your feet. One such moment is when Laney finds out about Zach’s ploy. “Am I a bet? Am I a bet? Am I a f**king bet?” It is raw, painful, and elevates the film well above your average high-school romcom.Saving Face is both a romantic comedy about gay women, and a romantic comedy about two Asian-Americans, making it a double rarity in the genre. But its loveliest quality is its Manhattan earthiness, with its smoky streets, subway cars, fire escapes and cheap take-out places, all backdrops to the tentative relationship between surgeon Michelle Krusiec and dancer Lynn Chen.Partly because she was its last high-profile “queen”, Katherine Heigl has often been positioned as the actor that killed the romantic comedy. Which is unfair for a host of reasons, but specifically because both Knocked Up and 27 Dresses are such pristine examples of how great the romcom can still be. 27 Dresses is the more traditional of the pair, Heigl surrounded by stock characters (including Judy Greer once again cast as the sad-sack best friend, as she did in the Jennifer Lopez vehicle The Wedding Planner) and playing a brunette and therefore unlucky-in-love single New Yorker obsessed with weddings. But she is such a delightfully prickly and neurotic presence that it makes up for the film’s lesser qualities. We truly didn’t appreciate her at the time.530 26. Playing by Heart (1998)Not strictly a romantic comedy, buoyed as it is by serious drama involving everything from infidelity to AIDS, Playing by Heart is one of those talky, interconnected, Robert Altman-esque indies that dominated so much of American cinema in the Nineties. But the reason it’s here is because two of its many storylines feature lighter pairings that appear unlikely on paper but somehow become incredibly compelling and tender in execution. In one, Angelina Jolie and Ryan Phillippe meet at an LA bar and begin a romance in another, Gillian Anderson and Jon Stewart meet in a bookstore and begin dating. Both stories develop from there, with Sean Connery, Gena Rowlands, Ellen Burstyn and Madeleine Stowe among the recognisable faces orbiting them. But whatever the tone of each seemingly unrelated story, Playing by Heart is driven by a lovely, nostalgic sense of Los Angeles ennui at the end of the 20th century. No one has heard of this movie, and that’s a shame.Crazy Rich Asians may not have saved the romantic comedy last summer, as everyone predicted it would, but it remains a breathless celebration of the genre – with a far-too-late-in-the-day but still wholly appreciated ersity at its centre. Constance Wu is the New York economics professor who discovers her apparently Average Joe fiancee is in fact Singapore royalty. What follows is a fish-out-of-water comedy that both indulges in its gorgeous opulence while never becoming too in awe of it. Michelle Yeoh is a standout, as a high society matriarch intimidatingly protective of her son.Few romantic comedies are more nakedly aspirational about big-city jobs, capitalism and the social power of being busy than One Fine Day, a mid-Nineties comedy about two single parents thrust together when their hectic schedules mean their children miss the class trip. There are far too many big cellphones here, but Michelle Pfeiffer and an ER-era George Clooney, as the squabbling pair at its centre, must surely rank as one of the most beautiful romantic comedy couples in recent memory.The first black, mainstream romantic comedy to possess the same aspirational sheen as their white counterparts, Boomerang is a lively battle-of-the-sexes comedy with Eddie Murphy as a powerful, womanising advertising executive spurned by his female doppelganger (Robin Givens). Grace Jones, Eartha Kitt and a young Halle Berry make for wonderful supporting players, but Boomerang’s secret weapon is Givens, who gives a performance with so much sparkiness that it’s enraging her volatile marriage to Mike Tyson overshadowed much of her acting career.Released a decade after Knocked Up, Seth Rogen’s adorable if occasionally bro-heavy first stab at the romcom, Long Shot bears the fruits of a man who has fixed some of his more regressive tendencies in the interim, producing something smarter, more sensitive and as interested in the feelings, neuroses and dialogue of his female co-star as he is to himself. He is a left-wing journalist recruited as a speechwriter for his former babysitter (Charlize Theron), who is now the US Secretary of State, and the pair forge an unshakable bond despite their wildly juxtaposed looks and vocations in life. Against the odds, Theron and Rogen are adorable together, while the film strikes a wonderful balance between sweetness and crudity. Long Shot may have flopped at the box office, but it’s the closest thing we’ve had to a romcom classic in years.A perfect encapsulation of the Fifties, specifically the allure of the European jet-set, the idealised rat-a-tat-tat magic of big-city journalists, and the otherworldly regality of Audrey Hepburn, Roman Holiday is more of a time machine than most of the films here. But it’s also a true-blue classic, its “famous woman paired with ordinary man” plot inspiring everything from Notting Hill to The Lizzie McGuire Movie, and appropriately beloved as a result. There’s no Hilary Duff, obviously, but we won’t hold that against it.Forgetting Sarah Marshall is a bit like peering into a time capsule a reminder of a time when Russell Brand was (nearly) a Hollywood A-lister, and people believed Jason Segel could be a movie star. Of the post-Judd Apatow era of romantic comedies, this remains the best, however – nicely balancing genuine sweetness and pathos (Mila Kunis is at the peak of her adorability as Segel’s love interest) with A-grade smut (Segel’s two full-frontal nude scenes remain hilariously shocking no matter how often you’ve seen them). There’s also a puppet musical thrown in for good measure, which is never not welcome.Very loudly not fun but still something quietly extraordinary, The Break-Up is a romcom in reverse, with Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn a couple at the end of their tether, who really shouldn’t be together and break up before the opening credits roll, and then muddle through the following 90 minutes figuring out what to do next. Aniston, always underrated as a movie star, is brilliantly magnetic, while Vaughn nicely downplays the manic energy that tends to suffocate his on-screen partners in his other roles. The film’s closer, a thoughtful, heartfelt celebration of having once loved someone regardless of how it all ended, is one of the bravest things an expensive studio romcom has done in recent decades.This satirical comedy set at a gay conversion camp has, quite clearly, a lot more than romance on its mind. But Jamie Babbit’s pink satin-coloured debut is most memorable for the brewing relationship between Clea DuVall’s Graham and Natasha Lyonne’s Megan. One is more in denial about their sexuality than the other, but they discover a mutual attraction while being held under the thumb of Cathy Moriarty’s conversion camp den mother – who, it should be said, is somehow more of a drag queen than her colleague (played by a de-glammed RuPaul).1430 17. Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994)An underwritten female lead in the form of Andie MacDowell’s Carrie is the only fly in this wry, warm-hearted ointment. Revolving around a group of friends as they attend – you guessed it – four weddings and a funeral, this film marks the first of many collaborations between Hugh Grant and screenwriter Richard Curtis. We can probably all agree that the hopeless, stuttering Charlie should have ended up with his best friend Fiona (Kristin Scott-Thomas), but without his devastating indifference towards her, we would never have been blessed with one of the most magnanimous displays of unrequited love ever committed to film. The film’s worth your time, too, for its quietly progressive, heart-wrenching gay subplot.As much a ludicrously beautiful romcom as it is a nostalgic snapshot of the New York hip-hop scene at the turn of the 21st century, Brown Sugar casts Taye Diggs as an A\u0026ampR executive for a record label and Sanaa Lathan, magnetised to so many black romcoms during this time, as the editor for XXL Magazine. Friends since childhood, they’re perfect for one another, but involved with other people (the similarly too-beautiful-for-words real-life couple Boris Kodjoe and Nicole Ari Parker). Queen Latifah and Mos Def are their perfectly cast best friends, just to add to the film’s early-Noughties charm.Most great romcoms are lucky enough to have one stand-out set piece that becomes embedded in the cultural landscape. Love Actually, the annually inescapable Christmas romcom behemoth from Richard Curtis, has about six or seven. Because it’s as famous as it is, Love Actually oddly has a tendency to be underrated, dismissed as too cutesy or misogynist, too awkwardly Blairite in its politics. And all of that, in fairness, is true. But it’s also a real classic of the form – masterfully structured, endlessly watchable, and filled with familiar faces, sweet romances and heartache. It’s love in all its colours, often cringeworthy, sometimes monstrous, but always compelling to watch unfold.The secret masterpiece of the teen movie boom birthed in 1999, and truthfully one of the last of that era, Get Over It grabs so many elements from its subgenre predecessors (a Shakespearean undercurrent, sexually excitable animals and cameos from one-hit-wonders of the time) that it’s a wonder it’s so brilliant. Ben Foster is the recently-dumped high school basketball player who signs up for the school play (a musical version of A Midsummer Night’s Dream, naturally) to woo back his ex, only to fall for the adorable younger sister (Kirsten Dunst) of his best friend. Surrounding them are an array of recognisable faces, including Mila Kunis, Martin Short, Zoe Saldana and the literal Sisqo, while it features one of the finest Backstreet Boys-era boyband spoofs this side of Josie and the Pussycats.1830 13. 500 Days of Summer (2009)Beloved and loathed in equal measure, 500 Days of Summer is notorious among a certain generation of young people who grew up with Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel as quirky hipster pin-ups. And it’s likewise already something of a nostalgic masterpiece, beloved in first-year university film studies classes if then loudly rejected come graduation. There’s a lot to say about where its allegiances lie (is Deschanel’s Summer the movie’s villain, or its rational, realistic hero?), but that discussion also swallows up appreciation for what is for the most part a clever and funny comedy, and a movie that sincerely celebrates the conventions of the genre.It is funny in hindsight that there was such a stink over the casting of the Texan Renee Zellweger as the very English Bridget Jones. Because could you now imagine anyone else playing her? Her accent flawless (in that very prim, written-by-Richard-Curtis way), Zellweger similarly nails the spirited, neurotic melancholy that makes Bridget such a likable character, despite all the reasons we probably wouldn’t be able to stand her in reality. Like most of Curtis’s work, there is a lovely comfort to Bridget Jones, full as it is of slapstick, silly jumpers and new-Millennium London, featuring Colin Firth and Hugh Grant as “adorable dork” and “magnificent bastard”, respectively, and a perfect Christmas finale. It’s truly one of the best of the genre.2030 11. 13 Going on 30 (2004)If every romantic comedy is a fantasy, then 13 Going on 30 is the ultimate fantasy romcom. As if she has watched too many herself, unhappy tween Jenna Rink wishes she could be 30, flirty and thriving, and wakes up one morning a high-powered magazine editor who looks like Jennifer Garner, and whose dorky neighbour has transformed into Mark Ruffalo. By turns incredibly touching and genuinely funny, 13 Going on 30 is brought to life by Garner, who plays the adult-bodied Jenna as a guileless spark plug of self-doubt, glee and determination. Also features none of the weird child molesting undertones of Big, which we should forever be thankful for.With Nora Ephron having slipped off this mortal coil, Nancy Meyers has more or less claimed her spot as Hollywood’s most dependable creator of sensitive and funny love stories set within designer kitchens. She has a largely great filmography, but Something’s Gotta Give remains her masterpiece. Diane Keaton and Jack Nicholson, both twinkling with lived-in Seventies-movie-star ease, play variations on their off-screen personas: her the exasperated neurotic, him the womanising letch. They’re thrown together in the Hamptons, stumble upon an unexpected attraction, and wrestle with what it all means. Keanu Reeves, as Keaton’s doctor and secondary love interest, is additionally a dream.There’s a great Arrested Development storyline in which Jason Bateman’s character doesn’t realise his love interest is mentally ill because she’s an eccentric British woman who looks like Charlize Theron. It may or may not have been inspired by Serendipity, the greatest romantic comedy ever made about a deranged and beautiful Englishwoman fixated on fate, chance and the cosmos. Kate Beckinsale and John Cusack meet by chance at Christmastime in New York, share a blissful evening together but then go their separate ways, Beckinsale sure that they must only date if the universe doesn’t otherwise intervene. Some time later, the pair are engaged to other people, but can’t shake their memories of that fateful Christmas Eve. Sweet, cosy and completely irresistible, Serendipity is a rare Christmas movieromantic comedy twofer and features two lovely performances at its centre. Absolutely bonkers, to be fair, but few films on this list aren’t.2330 8. 10 Things I Hate About You (1999)Gut-wrenching to watch in the wake of Heath Ledger’s death, but still one of the smartest, most convincingly heartwarming comedies of the last 20 years. Ledger and Julia Stiles are a pair of “unappealing” high schoolers whose romance is engineered by Stiles’s younger sister, who can only date once she does. There is much to love here, from the film’s feminist politics (10 Things remains the holy grail of its era, in that regard) to its delightful supporting cast. But it’s Ledger and Stiles that burn the screen. Their chemistry is so authentic, charming and sexy that it’s almost uncomfortable to watch, with only the fact that they’re both ridiculously beautiful encouraging you never to turn away.Christmas has never been better presented in all its melancholy splendor than in Billy Wilder’s The Apartment, with two lonely souls both left dispirited by the holiday season yet finding each other hopelessly up in one another’s lives. Jack Lemmon is unsurprisingly wonderful as one half of the film’s central twosome, who loans out his apartment to his lecherous bosses so they can conduct their affairs, but it is Shirley Maclaine who provides the film with its heart – she is bruised and brittle but eager for connection, and perfectly embodies the dizzying emotions of the winter season.Considering how many people adore My Best Friend’s Wedding, it’s always surprising to re-discover how monstrous its apparent heroine is. Julia Roberts has had better-received roles before and since, but there’s something fascinatingly daring about her work here, playing a single woman in love with her best friend and determined to destroy his wedding to a lovely if naive rich girl she has decided is evil. Cameron Diaz, as the bride-to-be, is an adorable revelation, Rupert Everett a hoot as Roberts’s then-radical “gay best friend”. And the sheer darkness on display here, mixed with that funny and expensive Nineties-romcom sheen, makes it one of the most intriguing romcoms in history, and secretly one of its very best.You could argue that June and Joseph – the dead, park bench couple – have the most poignant love story in this film, but the one between world-famous movie star Anna (Julia Roberts) and very-much-not-famous bookshop owner Will (Hugh Grant at perhaps his most charming, foppish and floppy-haired) comes a close second.A fizzy treasure of a comedy that set the tone for much of what came after it, The Philadelphia Story casts a never-haughtier Katharine Hepburn as a feisty heiress stuck between three men: her dull fiancé (John Howard), a prickly journalist (James Stewart) and the ex (Cary Grant) still hopelessly in love with her. Everyone speaks incredibly fast, romantic tribulations occur in elegant mansion estates and the film’s central trio embody an impossible movie-star glamour you can’t help but begin to miss as soon as they appear on screen.We know. Where you stand on Woody Allen’s work, particularly the stuff not revolving around the apparent inability of young women to resist the allure of a scrawny, bespectacled middle-aged neurotic, is one of those endless pop culture questions we’ve all asked ourselves in recent years. If anything, though, watch Annie Hall for Diane Keaton at her most Diane Keatonish – daffy, stylish and impossibly cool, she becomes so much more than an idealised fantasy figure through sheer force of will. Annie Hall, admittedly, is a masterpiece, if you can look past the obvious.While Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan’s most famous prior romcom collaboration, 1993’s Sleepless in Seattle, has a dark melancholy that makes it less immediately pleasurable to watch, their 1998 reunion in You’ve Got Mail is the kind of movie built for comforting rewatches beneath a blanket. Or at least once every year at Christmas. The pair play sworn enemies waged in a war over the future of Ryan’s ludicrously serene independent book shop, but find love when interacting anonymously online. Despite the dial-up modems and archaic dialogue (“What’s email?” everyone seems on the verge of asking), You’ve Got Mail hasn’t aged poorly, proving how timeless chemistry-driven love stories between beautiful movie stars can be. And considering how brilliant Ryan is here, oscillating between tough strength and soft vulnerability, it is no surprise that she is still regarded as the star most associated with the genre.Truthfully, it couldn’t be anything else. Not only did When Harry Met Sally kickstart the romcom boom that dominated the Nineties, it also invented much of what we recognise today as clichés: from the sardonic best friend (played to perfection by Carrie Fisher), to the late-night phone calls while watching old movies, the ChristmasNew Year’s climax, the “neurotic Jewish man”“Shiksa goddess woman” pairing at its centre, and the hilarious honesty when it comes to sex, never bettered than in the film’s iconic diner-orgasm scene. Romantic comedies are only clichéd because When Harry Met Sally set such a glorious benchmark for why these films work in the modern era, assisted by Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan at their most golden, and a gorgeously structured script that leaps through time, written by the queen of the genre herself, Nora Ephron. Nothing will ever better this.Pretty Woman certainly isn’t good, with an undercurrent of sleaze so disquieting that it’s no real surprise to learn it was once planned to be a gritty sex work drama that ended in tragedy. But Julia Roberts is pure star-is-born loveliness here, beloved by the camera and endlessly watchable as a result, her joyous pluck overshadowing the rest of the film’s murkier elements. That Disney, the studio behind the film, imagined its aspirational romcom hero as a rich businessman prowling Hollywood Boulevard for an escort is slightly maddening. That Pretty Woman somehow pulls it off… even more so.There are a few moments in this high-school re-telling of George Bernard Shaw\u0027s Pygmalion – in which, due to an elaborate bet, popular jock Zach (Freddie Prinze Jr) attempts to turn artsy nerd Laney Boggs (Rachael Leigh Cook) into the Prom Queen in six weeks – that pull the rug out from under your feet. One such moment is when Laney finds out about Zach’s ploy. “Am I a bet? Am I a bet? Am I a f**king bet?” It is raw, painful, and elevates the film well above your average high-school romcom.Saving Face is both a romantic comedy about gay women, and a romantic comedy about two Asian-Americans, making it a double rarity in the genre. But its loveliest quality is its Manhattan earthiness, with its smoky streets, subway cars, fire escapes and cheap take-out places, all backdrops to the tentative relationship between surgeon Michelle Krusiec and dancer Lynn Chen.Partly because she was its last high-profile “queen”, Katherine Heigl has often been positioned as the actor that killed the romantic comedy. Which is unfair for a host of reasons, but specifically because both Knocked Up and 27 Dresses are such pristine examples of how great the romcom can still be. 27 Dresses is the more traditional of the pair, Heigl surrounded by stock characters (including Judy Greer once again cast as the sad-sack best friend, as she did in the Jennifer Lopez vehicle The Wedding Planner) and playing a brunette and therefore unlucky-in-love single New Yorker obsessed with weddings. But she is such a delightfully prickly and neurotic presence that it makes up for the film’s lesser qualities. We truly didn’t appreciate her at the time.530 26. Playing by Heart (1998)Not strictly a romantic comedy, buoyed as it is by serious drama involving everything from infidelity to AIDS, Playing by Heart is one of those talky, interconnected, Robert Altman-esque indies that dominated so much of American cinema in the Nineties. But the reason it’s here is because two of its many storylines feature lighter pairings that appear unlikely on paper but somehow become incredibly compelling and tender in execution. In one, Angelina Jolie and Ryan Phillippe meet at an LA bar and begin a romance in another, Gillian Anderson and Jon Stewart meet in a bookstore and begin dating. Both stories develop from there, with Sean Connery, Gena Rowlands, Ellen Burstyn and Madeleine Stowe among the recognisable faces orbiting them. But whatever the tone of each seemingly unrelated story, Playing by Heart is driven by a lovely, nostalgic sense of Los Angeles ennui at the end of the 20th century. No one has heard of this movie, and that’s a shame.Crazy Rich Asians may not have saved the romantic comedy last summer, as everyone predicted it would, but it remains a breathless celebration of the genre – with a far-too-late-in-the-day but still wholly appreciated ersity at its centre. Constance Wu is the New York economics professor who discovers her apparently Average Joe fiancee is in fact Singapore royalty. What follows is a fish-out-of-water comedy that both indulges in its gorgeous opulence while never becoming too in awe of it. Michelle Yeoh is a standout, as a high society matriarch intimidatingly protective of her son.Few romantic comedies are more nakedly aspirational about big-city jobs, capitalism and the social power of being busy than One Fine Day, a mid-Nineties comedy about two single parents thrust together when their hectic schedules mean their children miss the class trip. There are far too many big cellphones here, but Michelle Pfeiffer and an ER-era George Clooney, as the squabbling pair at its centre, must surely rank as one of the most beautiful romantic comedy couples in recent memory.The first black, mainstream romantic comedy to possess the same aspirational sheen as their white counterparts, Boomerang is a lively battle-of-the-sexes comedy with Eddie Murphy as a powerful, womanising advertising executive spurned by his female doppelganger (Robin Givens). Grace Jones, Eartha Kitt and a young Halle Berry make for wonderful supporting players, but Boomerang’s secret weapon is Givens, who gives a performance with so much sparkiness that it’s enraging her volatile marriage to Mike Tyson overshadowed much of her acting career.Released a decade after Knocked Up, Seth Rogen’s adorable if occasionally bro-heavy first stab at the romcom, Long Shot bears the fruits of a man who has fixed some of his more regressive tendencies in the interim, producing something smarter, more sensitive and as interested in the feelings, neuroses and dialogue of his female co-star as he is to himself. He is a left-wing journalist recruited as a speechwriter for his former babysitter (Charlize Theron), who is now the US Secretary of State, and the pair forge an unshakable bond despite their wildly juxtaposed looks and vocations in life. Against the odds, Theron and Rogen are adorable together, while the film strikes a wonderful balance between sweetness and crudity. Long Shot may have flopped at the box office, but it’s the closest thing we’ve had to a romcom classic in years.A perfect encapsulation of the Fifties, specifically the allure of the European jet-set, the idealised rat-a-tat-tat magic of big-city journalists, and the otherworldly regality of Audrey Hepburn, Roman Holiday is more of a time machine than most of the films here. But it’s also a true-blue classic, its “famous woman paired with ordinary man” plot inspiring everything from Notting Hill to The Lizzie McGuire Movie, and appropriately beloved as a result. There’s no Hilary Duff, obviously, but we won’t hold that against it.Forgetting Sarah Marshall is a bit like peering into a time capsule a reminder of a time when Russell Brand was (nearly) a Hollywood A-lister, and people believed Jason Segel could be a movie star. Of the post-Judd Apatow era of romantic comedies, this remains the best, however – nicely balancing genuine sweetness and pathos (Mila Kunis is at the peak of her adorability as Segel’s love interest) with A-grade smut (Segel’s two full-frontal nude scenes remain hilariously shocking no matter how often you’ve seen them). There’s also a puppet musical thrown in for good measure, which is never not welcome.Very loudly not fun but still something quietly extraordinary, The Break-Up is a romcom in reverse, with Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn a couple at the end of their tether, who really shouldn’t be together and break up before the opening credits roll, and then muddle through the following 90 minutes figuring out what to do next. Aniston, always underrated as a movie star, is brilliantly magnetic, while Vaughn nicely downplays the manic energy that tends to suffocate his on-screen partners in his other roles. The film’s closer, a thoughtful, heartfelt celebration of having once loved someone regardless of how it all ended, is one of the bravest things an expensive studio romcom has done in recent decades.This satirical comedy set at a gay conversion camp has, quite clearly, a lot more than romance on its mind. But Jamie Babbit’s pink satin-coloured debut is most memorable for the brewing relationship between Clea DuVall’s Graham and Natasha Lyonne’s Megan. One is more in denial about their sexuality than the other, but they discover a mutual attraction while being held under the thumb of Cathy Moriarty’s conversion camp den mother – who, it should be said, is somehow more of a drag queen than her colleague (played by a de-glammed RuPaul).1430 17. Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994)An underwritten female lead in the form of Andie MacDowell’s Carrie is the only fly in this wry, warm-hearted ointment. Revolving around a group of friends as they attend – you guessed it – four weddings and a funeral, this film marks the first of many collaborations between Hugh Grant and screenwriter Richard Curtis. We can probably all agree that the hopeless, stuttering Charlie should have ended up with his best friend Fiona (Kristin Scott-Thomas), but without his devastating indifference towards her, we would never have been blessed with one of the most magnanimous displays of unrequited love ever committed to film. The film’s worth your time, too, for its quietly progressive, heart-wrenching gay subplot.As much a ludicrously beautiful romcom as it is a nostalgic snapshot of the New York hip-hop scene at the turn of the 21st century, Brown Sugar casts Taye Diggs as an A\u0026ampR executive for a record label and Sanaa Lathan, magnetised to so many black romcoms during this time, as the editor for XXL Magazine. Friends since childhood, they’re perfect for one another, but involved with other people (the similarly too-beautiful-for-words real-life couple Boris Kodjoe and Nicole Ari Parker). Queen Latifah and Mos Def are their perfectly cast best friends, just to add to the film’s early-Noughties charm.Most great romcoms are lucky enough to have one stand-out set piece that becomes embedded in the cultural landscape. Love Actually, the annually inescapable Christmas romcom behemoth from Richard Curtis, has about six or seven. Because it’s as famous as it is, Love Actually oddly has a tendency to be underrated, dismissed as too cutesy or misogynist, too awkwardly Blairite in its politics. And all of that, in fairness, is true. But it’s also a real classic of the form – masterfully structured, endlessly watchable, and filled with familiar faces, sweet romances and heartache. It’s love in all its colours, often cringeworthy, sometimes monstrous, but always compelling to watch unfold.The secret masterpiece of the teen movie boom birthed in 1999, and truthfully one of the last of that era, Get Over It grabs so many elements from its subgenre predecessors (a Shakespearean undercurrent, sexually excitable animals and cameos from one-hit-wonders of the time) that it’s a wonder it’s so brilliant. Ben Foster is the recently-dumped high school basketball player who signs up for the school play (a musical version of A Midsummer Night’s Dream, naturally) to woo back his ex, only to fall for the adorable younger sister (Kirsten Dunst) of his best friend. Surrounding them are an array of recognisable faces, including Mila Kunis, Martin Short, Zoe Saldana and the literal Sisqo, while it features one of the finest Backstreet Boys-era boyband spoofs this side of Josie and the Pussycats.1830 13. 500 Days of Summer (2009)Beloved and loathed in equal measure, 500 Days of Summer is notorious among a certain generation of young people who grew up with Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel as quirky hipster pin-ups. And it’s likewise already something of a nostalgic masterpiece, beloved in first-year university film studies classes if then loudly rejected come graduation. There’s a lot to say about where its allegiances lie (is Deschanel’s Summer the movie’s villain, or its rational, realistic hero?), but that discussion also swallows up appreciation for what is for the most part a clever and funny comedy, and a movie that sincerely celebrates the conventions of the genre.It is funny in hindsight that there was such a stink over the casting of the Texan Renee Zellweger as the very English Bridget Jones.

That will continue to move eastwards.”Monday\u0026nbsp– the first day of autumn\u0026nbsp– could be “a bit of an in-between day” of cloud and rain with some dry patches, with Hurricane Humberto expected to start bringing\u0026nbspwet and windy weather later in the day.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

So I had conversations with private secretaries and the like but I never asked for anything improper to be said or done.Pressed on why he had involved the Queen in politics, Mr Cameron said: I never asked for anything improper. I don\u0027t want to say anything more about this, I\u0027m sure some people would think, possibly even me, that I\u0027ve already said a bit too much.The former Tory leader said he had made a terrible mistake when he was overheard saying the Queen had purred down the phone when he informed her Scottish voters had decided to remain in the UK.The row emerged in a new BBC documentary about Mr Cameron\u0027s time in power, where he revealed he had been staying at Balmoral, when a newspaper poll came out putting the Yes campaign ahead for the first time, which he compared to a “blow to the solar plexus”.He said: “I remember conversations I had with my private secretary and he had with the Queen’s private secretary and I had with the Queen’s private secretary, not asking for anything that would be in any way improper or unconstitutional but just a raising of the eyebrow even you know, a quarter of an inch, we thought would make a difference.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

group to consider “modern” revisions to the totemic clause IV in its rulebook, including enshrining\u0026nbspcommitments to equalities.The section in the Labour constitution setting out the party’s aims and values was famously modified by Tony Blair in 1995 before his first general election victory. \u0026nbspIt was widely viewed as a historic moment for the party and a departure from a commitment to nationalisation and a left-wing economic agenda.The original 1917 wording – drafted by socialists Sidney and Beatrice Webb –\u0026nbspcommitted the party to “common ownership” of the means of production, distribution and exchange.\u0026nbspThis was replaced by Mr Blair, to pledge support for: “A dynamic economy, serving the public interest, in which the enterprise of the market and the rigour of competition are joined with the forces of partnership and co-operation to produce the wealth the nation needs”.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Protesters take to streets after Boris

Times, the party’s governing body – the National Executive Committee (NEC) – agreed this week to set up a working group to consider revisions to the document.\u0026nbspThe move came in response to motions to Labour’s annual conference submitted by Constituency Labour Parties (CLP), calling for the original wording ditched by Mr Blair over two decades ago, to be restored.The NEC requested the proposers withdraw the motions – and vowed to oppose them if they failed to do so – but the ruling body also said it would establish a working group to consider potential changes to Clause IV.Labour vows to regulate ‘lawless’ facial recognition technologyLabour Friends of Israel scraps plan to host stand at party conferenceLabour’s John McDonnell backs campaign to abolish private schoolsCorbyn warned he must not ‘stay neutral’ in Brexit referendumA source on Labour’s NEC told The Independent: “There is a proposed rule change proposed by a few CLPs which are recommended for remission to the NEC which will establish a small working party to consider possible revisions not to the old version but one in modern language which commits to equality on the basis of sex, gender, race, religion, sexual orientation etc.”However, it is understood some NEC members believe Mr Blair’s principle of\u0026nbsp “rigour of competition” is no longer appropriate for the Labour Party due to the damage the global economy has inflicted on parts of the UK.\u0026nbspLabour has radical plans for nationalisation, and in its 2017 manifesto pledged to bring back key utilities into public ownership.The latest

The average monthly shortfall for these clients was £365.Unexpected life events were the biggest causes of problem debt.Those experiencing a reduction in income (18 per cent), injury or illness (16 per cent) or unemployment or redundancy (16 per cent) made up the bulk of new clients.StepChange said its figures “underline the growing number of households in the United Kingdom struggling to keep their heads above water, particularly when faced with a sudden change in personal circumstances”.Phil Andrew, chief executive of StepChange Debt Charity, said: “These statistics provide a sobering assessment of the scale of problem debt in this country.Surge in councils using bailiffs to chase debts“Across the board, we are seeing red flags, including worrying proportions of new clients falling into debt due to reduced income, illness or because they rely on credit to pay for day-to-day living expenses.“Clearly more and more households are struggling to hang on and are ill-equipped to deal with any economic shocks the future may hold.He said the figures “must act as a wake-up call to the Government”, with issues around bailiff behaviour and the five-week wait people have before they receive their first Universal Credit payments.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This proportion has risen by a third since 2014, when 18 per cent of new clients were single parents.Nine in 10 single parent clients were renters. Single parents were also particularly likely to have higher outgoings than incomes.StepChange said the rapid growth in single-parent clients suggests they are being squeezed by benefits payments and the rising cost of living.A Government spokeswoman said: “We are determined to help families improve their lives through work, while continuing to support them with the cost of living.“But we know some families need more support, which is why we spend more than £95 billion a year on working age benefits.“With Universal Credit, people can get paid urgently if they need it, and 700,000 families will get on average £285 more a month because the system is simpler.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

He added that the lower clothing prices may be due to unusually wet weather keeping shoppers away and prompting discounting by retailers.Slower inflation may be good for consumers in the short term but it also rings alarm bells for economists.\u0026nbsp“The falling inflation rate could be an early signal of a cooling economy, in line with what we have seen in the US and the euro area,” said\u0026nbspYael\u0026nbspSelfin, chief economist at\u0026nbspKPMG\u0026nbspUK.“Recent falls in the value of the pound and the spike in oil prices over the weekend should boost the headline rate in the coming months, with higher prices for fuel and for imported goods putting pressure on households’ purchasing power and business margins, and further curtailing demand.”Separate data from the ONS showed that average house prices increased by 0.7 per cent\u0026nbspin July compared with a year earlier, only half the rate in June and the weakest pace of growth since September 2012.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The reason for this discrepancy lies in the different inflation metrics used, the think tank says.When estimating GDP, or the value of national output, government statisticians adjust it for inflation, applying what is known as the GDP deflator. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) says it is the broadest measure of inflation in the UK economy, reflecting changes in the price of all goods and services that make up GDP, whether or not they involve consumers.When fine-tuning GDP in its own analysis, the NEF used a narrower measure of inflation – one that tracks changes\u0026nbsponly in consumer prices, including the costs of owning and maintaining a home.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A surfer in action during sunrise at Tynemouth on the north east coastProtesters dressed as the Incredible Hulk and Robocop outside the Supreme Court in London where judges are due to consider legal challenges to Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u0027s decision to suspend Parliament.

Analysis of incomes of people born between 1920s and 1990s revealed that, up until those born in the 1970s, each generation has tended to be better-off than people born a decade earlier were at the same age.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We do not eat them, and that is a very important message to send to the rest of the world.“It’s not culturally insensitive because we’re not telling them what to do – we’re just telling them what we do.“We shouldn’t be worrying about that, so I was surprised that was the MoJ’s objection.”Justice officials also argued that it would be dficult to enforce the law and the current ban on transporting or exporting dog and cat meat suffices.Eating dog is already banned in Germany, Austria, Taiwan, South Australia and Hong Kong.An estimated  million dogs a year are slaughtered to be eaten, across China, the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia.Most are stolen off the street.Their meat it is considered both a delicacy and a health tonic.The World Dog Alliance mounted a campaign in the UK last year for a full ban on any activity relating to the eating of dogs.A series of MPs back a ban, including former Foreign Office minister Sir Alan Duncan who dubbed it “a disgusting habit”.A Ministry of Justice spokeswoman said: “We currently have some of the strongest animal welfare laws in the world.The government is currently considering whether any changes are needed in this area in the UK and will set out any plans in due course.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I am fully aware, however, how the right-on conspiracy theories play out here.That is, I’m only saying this because The Mash Report goes against my own political prejudicesand am part of a right-wing media group trying to destroy the working-class via Brexit.The same right-wing media group that broke the Yellowhammer No Deal crisis story, off which The Mash Report has been leeching material all series.Above and beyond my own obvious desire to enslave the proletariat, through dumb quiz show answers, though, I am also a comedy fan, and the remarkable thing about the Brexit circus is that not once, in more than three years, has The Mash Report, Have I Got News For You, The Last Leg or Frankie Boyle’s New World Order said anything so funny it’s worth repeating.Hardly surprising really when, rather than being part of the comedy process, all of those shows are such an entrenched and slanted part of the left-of-centre political process they’ve all removed deserving Labour targets, like Diane Abbott, John McDonnell and Emily Thornberry, from any sort of firing line.It’s natural BBC Channel  bias and stupidity that’s led them to that sorry pass, I think, not orders from above.But the chances of those two networks ever changing their tone and playing fair Take the exact number of angry rants Nish Kumar’s aimed at Labour’s anti-Semites, on The Mash Report, multiply it by the number of times he’s mentioned the actual result of the Brexit referendum and your answer’s still zero.THE height of optimism  Britain’s Got Talent: The Champions host Ant McPartlin announcing: “We’ll be back with the winners of Holland’s Got Talent .

Money does not cushion grief.I find it hard to imagine how anyone could read the excerpt of Cameron’s biography published at the weekend discussing the short le of his son and not be incredibly moved on the human level that should unite us all — regardless of politics. It brought tears to my eyes, although I had heard it all before from him and his we, as well as living through  years of similar traumatic experiences.His anguish at carrying his adored son in his arms for the last time was palpable.Perhaps I am just someone who shares some of Cameron’s “privileged pain” as the privately educated parent of a child with profound disability.Thankfully my daughter has survived complex epilepsy, among other problems, to reach adulthood.Yet like Cameron, I was plunged into the darkness of despair after the birth of a child with disabilities disrupted my le. Only later did I learn this was a form of grief as parents mourn the child they expected and come to terms with changed realities.We met soon after Ivan’s birth, a routine lunch between a journalist and MP turning into an intense discussion of shared experiences. Later we spoke about the impact on our lives and politics, even swapping notes on trusted doctors and schools.Cameron told me of struggling to take in diagnosis of Ivan’s Ohtahara syndrome, when a doctor said their son faced, “very serious dficulties”. He askedthis meant Ivan might have trouble with maths or much worse “I’m afraid it means he probably won’t walk or talk,” replied the paediatrician.For any family, rich or poor, this moment is a shock as dreams are shattered. Then comes a struggle to hold a family together, to retain jobs and relationships, to fight for education, respite and support in a system that seems often so uncaring.Your background makes little dference when filling in endless forms with the same details, searching for a school that might take your sick child, struggling with a seizure in a park, trying to find a public toilet to change a soiled pad or banging your head against blasé bureaucrats to win a few hours of respite care to retain sanity.Even at the world-famous Great Ormond Street Hospital we endured doctors who never read case notes, ed phone calls or responded to emails. One lost key files at a critical time another was a le-saver I will never forget.Exhausted families cling to such saviours as they navigate an overloaded, maze-like system filled with officials feuding over budgets. It seems almost asit is designed to inflame the distress of parents struggling under intense stress.This is recognised by this newspaper’s Give It Back campaign, demanding the Government plugs a £million-a-year funding gap and calling for a joined-up care system to help ensure families can live some semblance of normal le.Cameron wrote about the “torture” of seeing his son’s “small frame racked with spasms and what looked like searing pain” and feeling so helpless to stop the distress.However many times you see such seizures, the suffering never stops — as I felt again on Sunday afternoon watching my beautul daughter endure a series of fits that eventually needed emergency medication.As any parent knows all too well — hearing the hideously familiar screams while seeing the flailing limbs and rolling eyes — epilepsy can be a fatal condition.There are joys too, of course — but the pain of such parenthood is profound, the agonies seared deep in the soul, the struggles seem remorseless.And that is for everyone — whether rich or poor.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They dont communicate properly.They say its going to take another six weeks to finish dealing with all the defects.A Persimmon spokesman said the developer is in regular communication with Ms Ritson.He added: The majority of the snags identied have been resolved and we are liaising further with the customer to complete the remaining works in a timely manner.Radon is a naturally occurring gas and is commonly found in certain areas of the country.Normal building measures were implemented at this site to mitigate against radon, including a radon-proof barrier across the ground floor and ventilation."},{"url":null,"title":"queen made tea buckingham palace","story":"The workman was dismantling a desk and was out of view when a well-spoken woman asked himhe fancied a brew at Buckingham Palace.He replied: “Yeah.

There is a huge lobbying operation to try to persuade us all to go cashless and use only electronic forms of payments.Already, some fashionable bars and restaurants advertise themselves as cashless.Sainsbury’s recently opened a store where the only way to pay was via a smartphone app — though it was rapidly forced to change its policy when confused shoppers jammed the helpdesk.Little known to most people, David Cameron nearly announced in his  Conservative Party conference speech that Britain would become the world’s first entirely cashless society by .He only pulled back when advisers warned that the public was not ready for such a move.Too right we are not ready to have cash snatched from our wallets and be forced to pay for everything with cards or smartphones. And I hope we never will be.I have nothing against electronic forms of payment, when we choose to use them.I do plenty of shopping online and often choose to pay by card in shops, too.But the right to use cash is a vital freedomwe are to avoid being exploited.I am sick of being told that going cashless is for my convenience. No, it isn’t.It is for the enrichment of some very powerful financial interests who have been furiously lobbying governments to abolish cash.In , investors worldwide put billioninto the financial technology — or fintech — industry.Why  In the expectation of huge rewards.According to the Boston Consulting Group, the industry currently earns trilliona year in revenue — such as fees when we use our credit card or download a payment app on to our phone.By , it expects that to DOUBLE.No prizes for guessing where that extra trillion is going to be coming from — you and me.It might be free for consumers to use a debit card now, but you can be sure it won’t bethe option of paying by cash is abolished.Another reason the industry wants to force us to go cashless is to sell data on our shopping habits.When we buy things with cash, we are anonymous. But when we spend on our cards, our spending can be tracked.Visa, Mastercard and ­American Express have already set up subsidiaries to monetise this data and flog it for marketing purposes.While some stand to make fortunes, the victims of an increasingly cashless economy are the poor and elderly, who find their lives made ever more dficult.Hard though it may be for some of us to believe, when a cashless London transport system was being discussed it emerged that ten per cent of the passengers do not have a bank account.It is not easy to open an accountyou do not have a fixed address and cannot produce things such as utility bills. How are such people supposed to cope in a cashless society There are some things — such as parking in certain towns — which can now only be done by smartphone app.That might make sense to young, educated policymakers in Whitehall and council officials who have grown up with the devices and find that using them is second nature.Yet surprising though it may seem to some, . per cent of the population has never used the internet.Four in five over-s do not own a smartphone, and with good reason.Even without arthritis or serious problems with my vision, I find the devices extremely fiddly to use.I struggle to read what is on the screen and I often find my phone battery has run down by the end of the day.I wouldn’t want to be without a phone, but even less would I want to be reliant on it as my electronic wallet.When the Cameron government was seriously considering turning Britain cashless, one of the reasons mentioned was that it would help tackle crime on the grounds it is supposedly harder for criminals to handle electronic money, as it can be traced.But try telling that to the many victims of online scams who lost a collective £.billion last year in Britain.Just because electronic transfers are theoretically traceable doesn’t mean anyone is actually doing the tracing.Online fraud simply isn’t being taken seriously enough by the police or any other authority.Until or unless it is, going cashless will expose more people to fraud as they are forced to open online accounts.What is wrong with having a iety of ways to pay and letting us choose Cash, cards and cheques have happily co-existed for decades and there is no reason why cash cannot continue to exist alongside payment apps and the like.Far from sneakily trying to abolish cash, the Government should be standing up for our right to use it — ensuring, for one thing, that there are enough free cashpoints for all of us to access our money.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

four-star general who serves as the Air Force Chief of Staff, has been monitoring the event to “storm” the Nevada base.In an attempt to stop UFO hunters from raiding the military facility, General Goldfein said: Our nation has secrets, and those secrets deserve to be protected.People deserve to have our nations secrets protected.He made the comments while appearing alongside Acting Air Force Secretary Matt Donovan during a discussion at the Air, Space and Cyber conference in Maryland.Extra security measures have been put in place ahead of the event, which was due to take place on September , but was recently cancelled by the organiser.Donovan, a US Air Force veteran, said: Theres a lot of media attention, so theyre expecting some folks to show up there.Were prepared, and weve provided them additional security personnel, as well as additional barricades.Millions has originally signed up for the event, which was called ‘Storm Area , They Cant Stop All of Us’.Matty Roberts started the event as a joke on Facebook, but it built up an enormous head of steam.The -year-old Calornian student removed himself from the alien extravaganza last week over fears of a humanitarian disaster.A message appeared on the Alienstock  website saying the event was off as they didnt want to be part of Fyrefest ..The statement read: Due to the lack of infrastructure, poor planning, risk management and blatant disregard for the safety of the expected ,+ Alienstock attendees, we decided to pull the plug on the festival.The permit holderwas given multiple opportunities to provide us with the proof that things expected at this festival were in place.In fact, she refused to provide to us, as agreed upon, contracts, proof of deposits or any paper proof of anything.An alternative event is now being set up to take place in Downtown Las Vegas, which has been described as a safe, clean and secure area.This event is scheduled to take place the day before, on September th, and will feature the EDM artists slated to play at Alienstock.But the owner of the original venue The Little ALeInn in Rachel, Nevada, Connie West, says that she still has  acts and two comedians booked.However the towns website has countered saying: If any event still happens it is going to be a pretty sad affair with no bands, very little infrastructure and a lot of unhappy campers.The original post urged people to Storm Area  arguing that they cant stop us all as goof on Facebook.The exact purpose of the air base is not known publicly, and the area is heavily restricted.Trespassers can face huge fines and y prison sentences for setting foot in the zone.Purchased by the US government in , evidence suggests the site is used as a testing area for experimental aircraft and weapons.But the secrecy surrounding it has led conspiracy theorists to suggest the area is holding extra-terrestrial secrets.Theories suggest engineers examine crashed spacecrafts — and even hold meetings with aliens from across the galaxy.The crash of a weather balloon at Roswell, New Mexico in  sparked wild theories of an alien ship crash.Some have suggested Area  is still storing parts of the crashed ship — or even its alien inhabitants.  px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-MAP-AREA--NEW.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads

Her owner is known to police, but has gone on the run.There was no chip on the Panther, or registration documents associated with her, suggesting she was a black market animal who had been trafficked into France illegally, said the source.Detectives said they found an oversized dog basket and food which was clearly set out for the Panther in a nearby house.The Panther was today at the Protestant League of Lilleshelter in the city, where she spent the night in a blacked out cage aimed at reducing stress.Shes quite young, said an LPA spokesman.

A snake, yes. But not a big cat like that.A Black Panther is not a species, but a reference to the colour of types of leopards or jaguars.The blackness is caused by the agouti gene, which regulates the distribution of black pigment within the hair shaft.The gene is most common in leopards from Africa and Asia and in jaguars from South America.Those who appear in countries such as France and Britain are iniably zoo escapees or released pets that had been held illegally, possibly because they became too dficult to manage."},{"url":null,"title":"freshers week 2019 students cowboy night out","story":"No doubt some will be nursing a sore head today as not only did they hit the city’s night spots but a few also hit the floor.Many of the first year students got into the swing of the wild west-themed party and wore Stetson hats and carried toy pistols.The move by the students is rather controversial after the University of Kent in Canterbury student’s union banned cowboy fancy dress outfits last year, saying the costumes could be seen as “offensive”.In a statement in October  it claimed: dressing up as a particular race, culture or stereotype is offensive.But by the looks of things the new students in Bradford didn’t have any problems dressing up as they had a wild time before settling down to their studies.A few though looked like they had trouble staying on their feet as some party-goers were seen sprawled out in the road or even just having a quick sit down before continuing the festivities.First year students up and down the country have been enjoying the party atmosphere of Freshers’ Week.In Portsmouth earlier this week many students donned some seriously revealing outfits to take part in the Big Night Out pub crawl.Students in Birmingham and Manchester were spotted out and about having a ball as they made new friends ahead of their first term."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/RR-COMP-FIRE-v2.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=300\u0026amp;h=192\u0026amp;crop=1\"/\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"teaser-slug\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"teaser-slug__copy t-p-background-color\"\u003eLatest\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"teaser__item-play theme__background-color-rgba-80\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"rail__item-content\"\u003e\u003ch3 class=\"rail__item-headline t-p-color\"\u003eLIFE ON THE LINE\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cspan class=\"rail__item-sub\"\u003e Pilot trapped on high-voltage power lines by his parachute after jet crash \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"rail__item-cutoff\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ca href=\"/news/9960","title":"mystery lost boy orlando sleeping porch burned out car","story":"Three-year-old Noelvin, from near Orlando, Florida, told a concerned woman his familys car was on fire, police said.Police then found a charred vehicle in a wooded area nearby later that night with evidence of human remains inside.But they will take a while to identy the incinerated bodies it is too early to saythe cases are related.Meanwhile Noelvin’s parents plus a family friend remain missing.  Buffalo Police Department Captain Jeff Rinaldo said: The child is in good spirits.He is currently in the custody of Child Protective Services and we are working with CPS and the grandmothers, to begin the process of reuniting them.After making contact with the childs grandparents, police said he may have been on a drive with his parents Nicole Merced Plaud, , and Miguel Valentin-Colon, .A -year-old family friend Dhamyl Roman-Audfred may have also been in the car. The young boys family said they didnt know his parents were planning to go anywhere.Noelvin’s grandfather Jorge Oquendo told ABC affiliate WFTV:  Were heartbroken, were worried, were scared.Were all devastated. ...

with judges deciding the PMs shutdown was unlawful.But a High Court judge had dismissed a similar challenge by Remainer lawyer Gina Miller and Sir John - leading to the case being brought to the Supreme Court this week.In his submission Sir John cites a legal case where an estate agent was in “breach of fiduciary duty” after wrongly claiming a buyer wanted to live in a home when they wanted to sell it on.He said: “It could hardly be suggested that the duties of the prime minister to the monarch are less than those of an estate agent to a homeowner.“Accordingly,the court is satisfied that the prime minister’s decision was materially influenced by something other than the stated justication, that decision must be unlawful.”During the battle between two Tory grandees – Sir John’s lawyer Lord Garnier QC will argue against the government’s claim that the shutdown was political and the courts have “no jurisdiction”.Lord Garnier will tell the court: “Its effect is to deprive parliament of a voice throughout the period of the prorogation.“The inference was inescapable that the prime minister’s decision was motivated, or in any event substantially motivated, by his political interest in ensuring that there was no activity in parliament during the period leading up to the EU Council summit on - October.”Yesterday a Remainer lawyer told the court Boris Johnson shut the Mother of Parliaments with the father of lies.Aidan O’Neill alleged that No’s documents on the shutdown should not be taken as the “complete truth”.“What we have with this prorogation is the mother of parliaments closed down by the father of lies,” declared O’Neill, who already won his claim in the Scottish courts.“Lies have consequences but the truth will set us free.Rather than allow lies to triumph, this court should listen to the angels of its better nature and rule that this prorogation is an unlawful abuse of the power of prorogation which has been entrusted to the government.Mr O’Neill, who represents the cross party group of  MPs and anti-Brexit activists, said the government had proven itself unworthy of trust and said enough is enough.But Sir James Eadie, for the government, insisted that decades of case law showed it was clear that the suspension was the PM’s prerogative, the business of politics and nothing to with the Supreme Court.Sir James also said that opposition MPs had every opportunity to act on prorogation but chose not to use the “nuclear weapon” of a no confidence vote.The case continues."},{"url":null,"title":"samantha david cameron beer rollies downing street exit","story":"The we of the former Conservative leader, , confessed to This Morning: “I was dancing around our kitchen. Actually, I’d had a beer and a few rollies – it was the weekend.“It was a three day marathon of packing with a couple of friends.”Mrs Cameron revealed that she was interrupted by the then incoming leader Theresa May who had popped over to look around the place.David Cameron resigned as the Prime Minister on June ,  just hours after the result of the EU referendum had been announced.Appearing on the show alongside his we, Mr Cameron praised her for organising their departure.He told presenters Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield: “Sam was brilliant at moving out and finding somewhere to go and keeping the family sorted.”Speaking about his decision to quit after he had campaigned to remain in the EU, he said: “I just felt I’d have no credibilityI’d stayed and we’d need have a new Prime Minister.“But I didn’t think I’d be leaving in a few days, I thought I’d have three months.“I hated leaving the job I loved and the country I loved.”He added: “It was a huge decision, but the referendum didnt come from nowhere we’d had promises of referendums and treaties and changes for years.“I think people were frustrated the last time we voted on it  years ago when there were eight members.“I accept my responsibility for holding a referendum and losing a referendum - because I wanted us to stay - and for the dficult consequences that followed.“I wanted to keep a promise I made to give people the choice, to stay in a reformed Europe, orthey wanted to leave.”The couple appeared on the show on the day Mr Cameron’s memoirs of his le in politics, For the Record, was published, which saw the former leader attack his one-time allies such as Michael Gove and Boris Johnson.In the TV interview Mr Cameron tried to mend some broken fences.While he wished Mr Johnson well as the new PM and with his dealings with the EU, he said: “If people in Parliament had voted for the deal Theresa May put together we’d have Brexited by now and perhaps we’d have more certainty.”He also admitted he wanted to patch up things with his old friend Mr Gove after the pair fell out over their disagreements on Brexit.In his book, Mr Cameron attacked Mr Gove for backing the Leave campaign ahead of the  referendum, accusing him of betrayal.He said he was shocked by the “ferocity and mendacity” of his attacks and accused him of being “an ambassador for the post-truth age”.But Mr Cameron has now hinted he is ready to patch things up with his former friend.Askedhe would like to rekindle the friendship, he said: “I want to try. I think the dficulty has just been that, Michael was a very, very close member of the team.“He was so central to my thinking on education reform and other things, and so watching what happened next was very painful and I did in some ways thought hed become quite a dferent person in all of it.

The ex-PM revealed last night he had asked whether the monarch could support his campaign against Scottish independence. Mr Cameron made contact with Buckingham Palace officials in , suggesting the monarch could raise an eyebrow in the close-fought campaign. He was staying at Balmoral, when a newspaper poll came out putting the Yes campaign ahead for the first time. Cameron described how it hit him “like a blow to the solar plexus” and led to a “mounting sense of panic that this could go the wrong way.”    He said: I remember conversations I had with my private secretary and he had with the Queenaposs private secretary and I had with the Queenaposs private secretary, not asking for anything that would be in any way improper or unconstitutional, but just a raising of the eyebrow, even, you know, a quarter of an inch, we thought would make a dference. The Queen made the surprise plea to Scots to ‘think very carefully’ about how they would vote, just a week before the September  referendum. She told a member of the public: “I hope everybody thinks very carefully about the referendum this week.” Mr Cameron wrote of this intervention: “I was delighted”.    A source reportedly told the BBC said that it serves no-oneaposs interests for conversations between the prime minister and the Queen to be made public . It makes it very hard for the relationship to thrive, they added. Today Mr Cameron insisted I never asked for anything improper to be said or done. He told the BBC: The context for this... is at the time Alex Salmond was going round saying Her Majesty would be the proud monarch of an independent Scotland. This concerned me because my side of the argument couldnapost really say anything about that. So I had conversations with private secretaries and the like but I never asked for anything improper to be said or done.

Lee Chadwick, , confronted the aspiring footballer at a Subway store after hearing him say f*** near his five-year-old youngster. The father vowed to teach him a lesson and said: Iaposve got a brother your age, Iaposll get him to come here. And minutes later, Leeaposs brother Paul, , arrived with some friends like gangster sidekicks to batter the boy in a savage revenge attack. The victim, too young to be named, suffered a fractured eye socket as his attackers boasted: Weaposll get away with this - weaposre off to Portugal tonight. But now both Chadwick brothers were each jailed for  months for the attack, which happened more than two years ago.    Since then, the boy - an aspiring footballer - has suffered signicantly with the effects of losing his eyesight in his right eye. Sentencing the yobs yesterday, Judge Bernard Lever said: Lee Chadwick the background to this offence is ridiculous in the extreme for anyone but in particular for you. You and your five year old son in a Subway shop and you overheard your  year old victim swearing. You started getting aggressive and said that you have a brother his age and you would call him. And so it was that you, Paul, came round with your friend like two gangsters sidekicks, and immediately becoming antagonistic with this young man. He showed no aggression yet youaposre aggressive with him. You fracture his eye socket and cause permanent damage to his eye sight. Whilst doing this you brag you can get away with it because youaposre going to Portugal the next morning. The young man was an aspiring footballer, but now with the damage youaposve caused he struggles to assess distances. He nd his parents and the public at large would be disgustedanything other than a custodial sentence was given for this offence.    The judge heard the fracas happened at the restaurant near Manchester Unitedaposs Old Trafford stadium. Paul had been in a pub nearby and rushed over after his brother rang him. Manchester Crown Court was told Lee became aggressive and confrontational in the Subway establishment. The complainant, a child who was aged  at the timethe offence was subject to an unprovoked attack which was was repeated, pre-meditated and left the victim with a serious and lasting injury, said Jon Close, prosecuting. Lee Chadwick had taken umbrage with the victim and called on his brother Paul to attend. Whilst the attack was ongoing Lee Chadwick was being threatening physically and verbally to the victim and others - behavior which preceded the attack and continued in its aftermath. The victim had been in company with a few friends at Subway. He was chatting to his friends when Lee and his young son entered the store. Lee accused the victim of swearing in the presence of his son and became aggressive and confrontational, telling the victim that he needed to be taught a lesson.  The defendant asked the boy his age, and on being told aposapos Lee said aposIaposve got a brother your age, Iaposll get him to come here from the Bishopaposs Blaize [a pub nearby].apos The Bishopaposs Blaize is a pub almost next door to Subway. Once there they made directly to the victim and when physically intimidated him, attempted to coax him outside and when that failed attacked him inside the shop, punching him to the face on multiple occasions. One threatened to apospokeapos him which the boy inferred to be a threat to stab him and said they could get away with it because they were going to Portugal that night. Members of staff were present but any attempts to dfuse the situation were met with threats and violence by Lee who can be seen physically pushing, squaring up to and threatening staff members. Throughout that assault the boy offered no aggression and no resistance other than putting up an arm to try to give himself some protection. The fourth punch which landed hit him on his right eye and knocked him sideways.

The group said it sent people - including convicted criminal leader Paul Golding - out to a beach near Dover on the lookout for desperate migrants who risk their lives to get to Britain from France. However a pro-migrant group called the move aposunsettlingapos, saying that people must respect British law when it comes to people landing on our shores. Britain First shared pictures of their patriot migrant patrol on its website, saying: Equipped with torches, binoculars and hi-vis jackets, our activists patrolled the beach keeping a close eye out for migrant crossings. It has been called Operation White Clfs by the group, who searched Samphire Hoe Beach near Dover last Saturday as hundreds of migrants have made it into the UK in recent weeks.    The group reportedly says it would alert police and the Coastguard to crossings. A spokesman for pro-migrant group, CareCalais, said: We are shocked and concerned to learn of this unsettling development on our Kent coastline. When deeply traumatised men, women and children arrive on our shores they are often in need of medical attention and should be met by professionals. We urge anyone who thinks otherwise to please think again.  Whatever your opinion regarding the arrival of people from France, we believe it is essential to maintain respect for British law and trust in the work carried out by our emergency response services.

Last Tuesday a record  made it over in one day, and in August a total of  - also a record - crossed the Dover Strait, one of the worldaposs busiest shipping lanes. The perilous crossing has also seen two migrants - a man and a woman - die this summer. They are charged thousands by people smugglers, who send them over from Calais in small boats. Hundreds more are expected to make the crossing before the seasons change.  And many are anticipated to come from camps which have recently been shut down. An encampment holding , - including children - at a disused gym site in Grande-Synthe, near Dunkirk, yesterday, while  asylum seekers were cleared from a site in Calais last week.

It was the picture perfect moment as his proud daughter eagerly ran towards the classroom with her hair neatly plaited and her socks pulled up high. But tragically it was a bittersweet moment, because Laylaaposs mum Cheryl Hardy wasnapost there, after she died suddenly at their home in January . Ahead of the big day, devoted dad Fakir, known as aposZackapos, turned to YouTube so he could learn how to plait Layla’s hair to make sure everything was just right for her. Now Fakir, known as aposZackapos speaks for the first time to Mirror about how he is raising the five children they had together alone - with a little extra bit of help from YouTube. And he describes the heartbreaking moment that Layla asked him: aposWhen can mummy take me to school apos Another time, she worriedly asked: “You won’t leave us too, will you ”  Unable to answer the dficult questions, the grieving dad has instead tried to fill both roles of mother and father as best he can. Zack, , said: “Layla missed her presence every day. “But these are questions I cannot answer at the moment. “This might sound strange to some people, but I’ve not told any of my kids that their mum is not coming back. “I’ve never said it. At the moment, I don’t think the time is right given how young they are. “I don’t want them to get distracted and I’m waiting for the right time. “The time will come. Every time they mention mum, I just say she’s in a better place. “I don’t want them to get upset.”  The family had their hearts ripped out in January  as Cheryl, , passed away just seven weeks after giving birth to a baby boy. And as the last person to see her alive, Zack says he wishes he’d stayed with her after he woke up early and went downstairs. But he praises the support network of family, friends and neighbours who have helped anchor the family in their grief. Now he remains upbeat as he talks about how his family are continuing to thrive as they adapt to their new circumstances. Mum Cheryl, , was discovered unconscious by oldest daughter Rhiannah who immediately alerted Zack. But despite medics best efforts, she was declared dead  minutes after they arrived.  The circumstances were especially tragic as the mum, who hoped to become a midwe, had just given birth seven weeks earlier to a baby boy. And after Cheryl died, Zack pledged to raise the children they had together - Rhiannah, , Amirah, , Kameel, nine, Kesaar Mulla, seven, and Layla Mulla, five, - as a single dad. He said: “The biggest challenges are getting them what they need, rather than what they want. “And they go to three dferent schools so it’s all about handling that.” Before her death, Cheryl, who was training to be a midwe, had not been in good health following a trip to Disneyland Paris in December. And she had previously suffered a pulmonary embolism, which is when a clump of material like a blood clot, gets wedged into an artery in the lungs.  But devastated Zack says the death “came out of the blue” and was completely unexpected. He said: “I couldn’t speak to anyone for about two weeks after it happened. “I refused to eat, speak to anyone properly, I just wanted to turn my phone off and disappear for about two or three weeks. “I was a mess. But at the same time, I knew I couldn’t give in because of the kids. “I knew that they only had me and I had to make sure I had a brave face on. “I was married to her for ten years, it’s dficult, I’m still brokenhearted.  He added: In the first few days after Cheryl died, I cried a lot. That upset my kids. They would beg me, apossmile, Daddy, smileapos. So I decided to try to hide my sadness. But my kids seemed to know that I was really sad and on the verge of tears. I told them that even though they couldnapost make my sadness go away, they could do something important by comforting me with all their hugs. I think their hugs have helped them as much as they have helped me. Now Zack says he is determined to make his we proud and keep her memory alive. He said: “We look through memory books with all the photos of our trip to Disneyland Paris. “They go through that a lot, which is good.”  And he says he sends her messages of gratitude constantly. He said: “I thank her, I thank her all the time. I’ll always pay tribute to her and mention her on social media. “I wouldn’t be here without her, she blessed me with the children. “As far as I’m concerned, they’re her kids and I’m doing everything in my le for her to make sure they’re looked after and loved all the time. “She’ll never be forgotten ever. I’ll mention her everyday around the house.” But the grieving dad admits he feels guilt over her death - even though it was due to medical issues. And he wakes up every day at half five, as that was the last time he spoke to her. He said: “I apologise to her when I wake up in the morning and I apologise to her when I go to bed. “I blame myself, I think it was my fault that I spoke to her at half past five in the morning and I didn’t stay in bed when I should have done. “Two hours later, she was found like that.”  Now Zack says he is not interested in another relationship as he focuses his attention on raising his children. Ahead of Layla joining Year One at primary school, Zack watched tutorials on the social media channel before practicing on his daughter’s doll. He said: “She’s been asking me for a while but I told her I couldn’t do it. “I can just about put two bobbles around her hair. “But I watched a few YouTube tutorials and tried it on a dolly. “It’s not a fantastic job but I’m doing what I can do. She was pleased.” Zack says Cherylaposs unexpected death sent shockwaves across the community as she was a keen volunteer.

Kate visited Family Nurse Partnership Sunshine House in London - a voluntary home visiting programme for first-time parents aged  and under - this morning to learn more about the Early Years sector. Dressed in smart black trousers and a black and white polka dot blouse, she chatted with staff, parents and children who work and use the fantastic programme. During the visit, which was embargoed until her arrival , she reflected on the speed children grow up at. One of the people she met revealed: She said children grow up so quickly and she can’t believe that George is six already.    As Kate arrived at the centre she chatted to staff who gathered to greet her, asking about their roles within the organisation, before heading inside to look around. She then had the chance to meet some of the centreaposs youngest members. The FNP partners new parents with a specially trained family nurse who visits them regularly, from early pregnancy until their child is two. It supports young mums to have a healthy pregnancy, improve their childaposs health and development, and reach their goals and aspirations.   We last saw Kate when she joined baking legend Mary Berry to open a garden she helped design at RHS Garden Wisley in Surrey last week. The Duchess, , was pictured in a fitting floral blue and pink Emilia Wickstead dress as she played with and showed the first children around their new play area.    Kateaposs latest creation is designed to allow children to explore and play in nature. It features trampolines surrounded by trees, two tree houses, linked via a walkway with slides, and a living willow pod. In her speech at the opening, Kate said: As a parent, I have learnt just how important it is to foster our children’s development, in all areas, not just physical, as soon as they are born. We build the blocks, the foundations, for future success and happiness later in their lives.

All users applying for a passport must submit an image of themselves with a plain expression and closed mouth.Mr Bada followed the rules and submitted a picture of himself with a digital code that he had to note down and enter on  gov.uk .But the technology rejected his image and asked him to comment on why he still wished to submit it. My mouth is closed, I just have big lips, he wrote in the comment box. But Mr Bada said it is not the first time he faces issues of the sort.  When I saw it, I was a bit annoyed but it didnapost surprise me because itaposs a problem that I have faced on Snapchat with the filters, where it hasnapost quite recognised my mouth, obviously because of my complexion and just the way my features are, he explained. After I posted it online, friends started getting in contact with me, saying, itaposs funny but it shouldnapost be happening. The Race Equality Foundation said it believes the system was not tested properly to seeit would actually work for black or ethnic minority people, calling it technological or digital racism. Presumably there was a process behind developing this type of technology which did not address issues of race ethnicity and as a result it disadvantages black and minority ethnic people, Samir Jeraj, the charityaposs policy and practice officer, commented. Mr Bada is not the only one to have faced struggled to get their features accepted by the technology.In April, Cat Hallam, a black educational technologist from Staffordshire, shared a post on Twitter of similar struggles.She explained how the system told her it looked like her eyes were closed and that it could not find the outline of her head. The first time I tried uploading it and it didnapost accept it, she said.  So perhaps the background wasnapost right. I opened my eyes wider, I closed my mouth more, I pushed my hair back and did ious things, changed clothes as well - I tried an alternative camera. Ms Hallam said she begrudged paying extra to have an image taken in a photo booth when free smartphone photos work for others. How many other iniduals are probably either spending money unnecessarily or having to go through the process on numerous occasions of a system that really should be able to factor in a broad range of ethnicities  she said. But Ms Hallam, who proceeded with one of the images and received her passport without any further problems, said she doesnapost think it amounts to racism but itaposs the end product of algorithmic bias. When posting about the issue on Twitter at the time, the Passport Office tweeted back to her, saying it was sorry the photo upload service hadnapost worked as it should. The Home Office responded saying: We are determined to make the experience of uploading a digital photograph as simple as possible, and will continue working to improve this process for all of our customers.

Katy Spence visited a GP last week to try and get help for her son Xander Spence who she believes suffers from avoidant-restrictive food intake disorder . Sufferers of ARFID can be very sensitive to the taste, texture, smell, appearance and even temperature of certain foods which can lead to avoidance or intake restriction. Xander, eight, has a list just  apossafe foodsapos he will eat and each of these has to be a specic brand and prepared in a specic way otherwise he cannot eat it. Mum-of-two Katy, who works for the NHS in administration, says that Xander first struggled with his eating after catching food poisoning from a dodgy chip shop sausage at the age of one. But from three onwards, Xander started to refuse more and more foods.    Desperate for a confirmed diagnosis and help for her son, Katy booked an appointment at Brannel Surgery in Saint Austell, Cornwall, but claims she was aposfobbed offapos as Xander is a healthy weight. Katy says the GP advised her to starve Xander in the hopes he would either get so hungry heaposd eat anything or lose enough weight to qualy for a referral to the eating disorder team. Katy is refusing to aposkeep quiet and ignoreapos what she feels is a shocking lack of knowledge about eating disorders amongst GPs. Katy, of Saint Austell, Cornwall, said: I went to the doctor for a referral to the eating disorders team for Xander and he told me, in a roundabout way, that Iaposm not strong enough as a mother to deal with these issues. He was basically telling me I needed to man up and just give Xander whatever the family is eating. I explained thatI give Xander my food, he will not eat and the doctor saidXander lost weight then they would be able to do further investigations. The doctor was basically saying thatI starve Xander and he falls underweight then he would be accepted on the eating disorders team.    Iaposm not prepared to do that. Iaposm not prepared to sit and watch my child starve himself because thataposs the only way the doctors will help him. I wonder how long it would take for me to get reported to child servicesI followed that advice and Xander went into school and told people aposmummy wonapost give me any food I can eatapos. It made me so angry and then I got really upset which made Xander upset. The doctor told me heaposs seen children like Xander time and time again and starving them works.Katy added: Itaposs taken me googling the condition and joining Facebook groups to realise Xander has all the symptoms.Surely there must be some sort of mental health provision to help Xander before he becomes like that boy in the news who went blind because he only ate chips  Itaposs so scary seeing things like that and knowing the physical impact ARFID can have.    Iaposm not usually the person to be shouting out loud about this sort of thing but enough is enough. I canapost even imagine Xander growing up with health problems because I didnapost shout enough. I wouldnapost be able to live with myselfI didnapost push the doctors more. Katy said: When Xander was three, he really restricted the amount he was eating so we mentioned it to the doctor and they told us aposhe will eat when heaposs hungryapos. We tried to just sit it out and give him what the family were eating. He starved himself for almost three days. It was heartbreaking. I couldnapost force feed him. In the end, I had to hold my hands up and say I wasnapost going to push him any further. Nobody should have to watch their child starve themselves.  The foods Xander will eat include Aldi penne pasta with mature cheddar cheese but onlythe cheese isnapost melted, McDonaldaposs chicken nuggets, cream crackers and Aldi sausage rolls. When Katy and Malcolm try to get Xander to eat dferent foods he will sometimes vomit or reduce his list of apossafe foodsapos even more. The mum is planning to speak to Xanderaposs school to seeshe can get her son the help he needs through a dferent route.

They were thrilled when their sacrice paid off earlier this year. Baby Lilly finally arrived - completing their perfect family. Gemma, a full-time mum, said: We desperately wanted a sibling for Kayle - he got on so well with his cousins who were a similar age, so we knew he would be great with a little brother or sister too.

The findings come amid the release of footage showing a huge creature, thought to be an eel, in the Scottish Highlandsapos River Ness. Divers also told academics they have previously spotted ft-long eels in the loch. Professor Neil Gemmell, from the University of Otago in New Zealand, said: Eels are very plentul in Loch Ness, with eel DNA found at pretty much every location sampled - there are a lot of them. So - are they giant eels   Well, our data doesnapost reveal their size, but the sheer quantity of the material says that we canapost discount the possibility that there may be giant eels in Loch Ness. Therefore we canapost discount the possibility that what people see and believe is the Loch Ness Monster might be a giant eel. Previous explanations for the fabled Loch Ness Monster include that it was an ancient marine reptile, called a plesiosaur, or a Greenland shark.

Sheffield Hallam graduate Vicki Beavers, , said she has become notorious for losing everything and is the butt of running joke amid friends and family. In just the past year, the accounting and finance graduate has had to replace a total of five iPhone s, one passport, eight driveraposs licenses, two debit cards, four pairs of sunglasses and has even lost clothes and shoes. Vicki, who is now training to be an accountant for Bupa, even managed to lose her passport while she was in the airport after coming home from a holiday to Barcelona.  The -year-old from Warrington, Cheshire, said: Iaposve lost my passport once, my TOTUM student discount card once and my driveraposs license about eight times just this year. When I lost my passport, Iaposd somehow left it at the airport at some point between the plane landing and grabbing my luggage. I didnapost even realise until I got home. I rang the airport and they said I needed to bring proof of ID in order to claim it back - but my only form of ID was my passport. It was a nightmare to sort out. I also lost my driveraposs license on a night out with friends in Preston so I ordered a new one. I then got a letter through the post a few weeks later to say theyaposd found my original license in the club bin - God knows how it got there. I even got a letter from the police once saying that someone had tried to use my ID - they must have found it somewhere and then tried to impersonate me.  Luckily, nothing more came of it but thereaposs all sorts that people can do with your details these days. I guarantee every group has at least one person thataposs notorious for always losing their stuff - Iaposm that person. The girls are always teasing me for it. Maybe Iaposll eventually grow out of it, butthis year is anything to go by, I canapost see it happening any time soon. Vickiaposs tendency to misplace her belongings started getting worse when she turned  and began going out and drinking alcohol, with her bad habit nearly ruining her birthday celebrations. And itaposs not just her ID that Vicki tends to misplace, as her phone gets the brunt of it as well. In the last  months she has lost five iPhone s worth £ each - but fortunately Vicki has only had to pay her the insurance excess each time.  Vicki said: Iaposve been clumsy and forgetful since I was a kid, my parents are always saying it. Even when I was two I lost my bunny rabbit teddy on the plane when we were going on a family holiday despite my parents telling me hundreds of times to look after it. Nobody trusts me to hold anything for them on a night out because I canapost even keep hold of my own stuff. Recently I decided to get a card holder phone case where I could keep my ID at all times but then I just started losing my phone instead - and the ID along with it. Luckily thereaposs been a few times where Iaposve used Find My iPhone and Iaposve been able to track where Iaposve left it, but other times theyaposve both been lost for good.

Even though she only used the popular app for two weeks, the -year-old had more than her fair share of awful dates -  including a man who she claims bought her a pet chihuahua and then accidentally killed it. Sheaposs been put off the app for good after going on three horrendous dates on her search for Mr Right. The first date saw her meet a guy at a bar in London which ended when he fell off his chair. She said: My date spent the entire time leaning as forward on his chair as humanly possible until he practically had his face buried in my cleavage. I was about to make my excuses and tell him I had to leave, when he leaned too far forward on his chair and fell forward off it onto the floor.    For her second hope at meeting aposThe Oneapos, Jodie arranged to meet a guy at the cinema where they planned on watching the latest movie in horror franchise Purge. But just as they were about to walk into the screen she heard a woman screaming. Jodie, who has appeared on Channel aposs Rich Kids Go Skint and the BBCaposs Eating With My Ex, said: A guy who worked in the City took me to the cinema to watch the latest Purge movie - and as we were about to go in, I heard a woman screaming. I turned around and saw a woman making a beeline for us. All I could see was her pointing and shouting with this sparkly ring on.    I had no clue that he was married. I just got my popcorn and ice-blast, ready to see a film, and was caught in the foyer between a cheating husband and his raging we. I just told them aposgood luckapos and made a very quick exit. The third, however, was easily Jodieaposs worst dating experience yet. She said the man turned up to her flat in Canary Wharf, London - with a chihuahua as a gt.    Jodie claimed his face totally screwed up and he looked like the devil had taken over his soul when she turned down the gt and he stormed out with the puppy. Model Jodie said she thought she would never see him again - so was shocked to find him sitting outside her flat days later. Jodie said: I kept in touch with him after the date, not because I wanted to continue dating him, but because I was concerned for the dogaposs welfare. He continued trying to see me, but I told him I was going back to Derbyshire for a few days to see my family as an excuse. The morning I was due to go away, I went downstairs to get in my mumaposs car - and who did I see waiting outside the entrance to my building     Jodie said her Tinder date then tagged along and spent a few days in the Midlands with her family - awkwardly asking her step-dad to adopt him. Getting back to London from her disastrous trip, she revealed: When I got back to London, I tried to have as minimal contact with him as possible. But a couple of weeks later, I found out that the dog had died, likely because he was feeding it a diet of Twiglets and Rubicon Mango Juice. Things took a bizarre turn when Jodieaposs Tinder guy wouldnapost take no for an answer. She claimed: After the chihuahua died, I tried to fully cut things off with him, but he wouldnapost take no for an answer. One day, I came home and the concierge of building called me to show that Iaposd been sent this massive teddy bear - the biggest youaposd ever see.  Around an hour later, he started frantically texting me, asking meI got the gt and that he was coming over. I told him that I was going to ban him from my building. He came anyway, and told me thatI didnapost take him back, heaposd call the police to get his teddy bear back. In the end, he was escorted off the premises - minus the teddy bear, which I still have! The three awful experiences are far from Jodieaposs only dating horror stories. The part-time DJ, said she also dated a guy who forced her to pay a £ bar bill in Oxford Circus when his card declined. She said that she was even dumped by an ex who left her on holiday, which led her to drinking whiskey in the hotel bar by herself. Jodie has decided to stop using online dating, and will go back to old-school methods of meeting someone in person.

Video shows the impressive cat prowling the roofs of the residential building in Armentières, near Lille, in northern France, on Wednesday. The majestic animal, at about the size of a small Labrador dog, walks along a second-floor ledge and goes in and out of an open window for nearly an hour. Witnesses told local media that the black panther would stop to watch a nearby train go by or to stare fixedly at a cat running down the street.    Eyewitnesses also snapped these pictures of the huge predator walking past the windows of their s brick houses.  Local media La Voix du Nord reported the panther had entered an apartment where a -year-old girl was present. She then fled upon seeing the animal walk into the room. Police responded to the scene and set up a cordon as soon as they received reports from nearby residents.    Fire services and a veterinarian were also called to trap the animal in one of the homes before tranquilising it with a dart. Kader Laghouati from the Animal Protection League organisation in Lille said the panther is about five or six months old and weighs about kg . He added that the animal had been domesticated by its owner and was not aggressive. Its claws were clipped and it was in good health in general. Once captured, the panther was put in a cage and handed over to animal protection organisation called The League for the Protection of Animals.

It is alleged the boy, named only as Anton, was regularly beaten by his parents and he became overwhelmed. The youngster was found dead on the road last month in what police say was a suicide. His parents had shouted at him that day for damaging clothes, reports claim. Zhanna, a witness in Enerhodar, Ukraine, said: The parents yelled at the boy for ripping his clothes. I also heard them beating him. Then everything went quiet and I heard the child’s quick footsteps. Several seconds passed and there was that horric thud when a body hits the ground.    I looked out of my kitchen window and saw the boy lying below. I called an ambulance and the police. Another neighbour said: I saw the family going upstairs to their flat. Ten minutes later the boy was lying on the ground as his parents were racing downstairs in the street. Paramedics dashed to the scene but were unable to save Anton.    Police have now launched a criminal case on failure to fulfil parental duties against the victim’s parents. The suspects allegedly told them he jumped out of his room window right after the abuse. They also said they regularly beat up their son for misbehaving, according to reports.

This historic artery had a pulse and an energy all to itself.“Those memorable stretches of the old town nurtured the players who turned out for Dundee Harp FC.”Rob revealed that Arbroath had a star defender, a local lad called Tom O’Kane.Rob went on: “He took no prisoners and could leather a ball from one end of the pitch to the other.“At the beginning of the - season, Tom was poached and somehow persuaded to leave his home team to sign for Dundee Harp.“The town of Arbroath was outraged at the smash-and-grab by Harp.“Were underhand means used to attract O’Kane “Probably.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/09/SNS-19281556-MS-Dundee-v-Alloa.jpg ","title":"dundee boss mcpake blasts horrific decision that could have cost side three points","story":"Dundee boss James McPake blasted referee Alan Newlands for a “horric decision” that could have cost his side a vital three points.The Dens gaffer was annoyed to be talking about what he said was “as blatant a penalty on Cammy Kerr as you’re likely to see” when he should have been talking up a “controlled” win over a good Alloa Athletic side.The spot-kick would have given the Dark Blues the opportunity to see the game out easier as the Wasps piled on the pressure late on.McPake said: “It was a horric decision that could have in the end cost us – I have to say I don’t like criticising referees but it’s decisions like that that can cost points.“We had one at Tannadice that I was honest enough to say wouldn’t have mattered in the grand scheme of things but that one really could have mattered.“It was as blatant a penalty on Cammy Kerr as you’re likely to see.“I’m being genuine when I say I don’t like doing it because they have a hard enough job as it is but it was as stonewall penalty as I’ve seen.“They said nobody saw it.“I end up talking about something I shouldn’t be when I should be talking about the dominant display from us.”First-half goals from Danny Johnson and Jordan McGhee either side of Liam Dick’s th-minute equaliser for the visitors were enough to give McPake’s side victory.“It was a good three points,” he added.“I thought the performance was decent in spells. Alloa were decent, we knew they would be, and credit to them for playing some good football.“We really controlled large parts of that game and I thought the front three were a real threat. Josh McPake was excellent, it was a good first start for the kid, and Fin Robertson coming back was very controlled in the middle of the park.“I thought he dictated the play for large spells. In the last  minutes, we got a bit deeper but we saw it through.”Josh McPake limped off in the second half with a dead calf but should be fine for next weekend while Jamie Ness wasn’t risked after his ankle knock.

That was good momentum but it’s also a reminder that it can so easily just be dashed.“We just need to keep going the course. We’ve always spoken about one game at a time and I think that works both ways – you don’t get too high when it’s going well and you don’t get too low when it’s going against you.“We’ve looked at it early this week and seen why we weren’t as good as we should have been.“As we have done with everything, we’ve looked at all the details to see what we can do better and to stop that happening again.“We’ll be looking for a reaction on Saturday.”United host the Red Lichties just a fortnight after Dick Campbell’s side dumped them out of the Tunnock’s Caramel Wafer Challenge Cup on penalties.Although United fielded a makesht team that day, defender Reynolds is wary of the quality Arbroath possess and has warned they must be on their game to see them off this time.“Arbroath are a good side, they’re going well and picking up results,” he added.“We saw that first hand in the cup – we still put out a decent enough team and we’ll need to be on our game.“If we turn up and play the way we did on Saturday, we’ll be in trouble. We’ll go away, look at the tapes from the cup game and see what we need to do to beat them.“We’ll re-group and go again. We said at the start, even after winning the first four games on the spin, it’s a long season and it’s a hard league.“People will drop points when you don’t expect it and there’ll be twists and turns. All we can do is focus on ourselves and we’ll focus on the Arbroath game on Saturday. That’s as far as we’ll look.”Former Aberdeen man Reynolds lined up alongside his third central-defensive partner of the league season last weekend as Troy Brown made his debut.And Reynolds admits he is hoping to find a settled relationship with Brown or Calum Butcher while Mark Connolly remains out injured.“You can see there’s a quality player there but, as with anyone that comes in, it’s going to take a bit of time to get used to the way we play and what the manager wants us to do.“I’m sure he’ll get there, he’s settled in well and the more game time he gets the better he will become.“It’s been dficult but, when Butch has come in, we’ve done well. Obviously Troy’s in there now and it’s about trying to get a relationship as quick as we can.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/09/5d820bcc130e61.72848189.jpg ","title":"in form keeper hamilton impresses mcpake after strong display for dundee against alloa","story":"Dundee boss James McPake hailed the influence of his No  Jack Hamilton for taking the pressure off his defence when it was needed against Alloa.After saving a second-half penalty with the score at - to the Dark Blues, Hamilton was strong when the Wasps came chasing a late equaliser.And he’s backed his goalie to keep up the good early-season form, where he’s picked up six clean sheets.James said: “Jack made a great save from the penalty.“He’s been great since I came in and was too when I was with the reserves last season.“I’ve said before how good a character he is around the dressing-room but above all he is a good goalkeeper and he proved that again on Saturday.“He was excellent.“He came for crosses late on that took real pressure off us.“I thought the defence did well there as well, it can be tough when you’re winning - at home and you need to see the game out.”The Dens gaffer admits it will be strange travelling outside of the city after playing each of their last six games in the city, five at home and one at Tannadice.Heading to Greenock, James knows it’ll be a dficult day against David Hopkin’s Morton.He added: “It’s weird because it feels like we have hardly been away from home.“Every game since Dunfermline on the opening day has been around about here.“The derby was away –  yards away!“Morton are a bit like Alloa in that they are another one of those teams who have been consistent in this league over the last few seasons.“They have made a lot of changes but they will be tough opponents.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/09/5d820bcd4e82f7.13305143-476x564.jpg ","title":"match winning performance is the standard for dee goalie jack","story":"Dundee goalkeeper Jack Hamilton says his match-winning performance in the win over Alloa is the standard he has to live up to for the rest of the campaign.The -year-old put on a strong showing in the - home win over Alloa Athletic including a second-half penalty save from the Wasps’ penalty king Alan Trouten.That save and dealing with a number of late crosses as Peter Grant’s side chased an equaliser earned Hamilton the Man-of-the-Match award as he played a big role in the club’s first three points since August  against Ayr.Hamilton admits he has goalkeeping coach, and Dens legend, Bobby Geddes to thank for a bit of background penalty knowledge.The former Hearts keeper told the Tele: “It was nice to save the penalty, just to give me a wee feelgood factor.“This season has been good so far and it’s where I want to be, where I want to continue.“I’ve set myself standards and it’s about keeping them up.“The goalie coach, Bobby Geddes, is good with us and we look at things like penalty takers and things like that.“He gets all the stats and I was looking at it and it said Trouten had never missed a penalty so I’m glad to spoil his record!“We watch what he’s done before andthere’s a pattern forming then you go with that.“However, you can look at all his previous ones but you still don’t know what he’s going to do on the day.“It’s about trying to watch the run up and the way he moves.“There’s loads of dferent factors but, at the end of the day, it’s just about keeping the ball out of the net!”Hamilton is happy with his start to the campaign and he’s keen to continue that – and continue picking up points – at Cappielow this weekend.The Dark Blues leapfrogged Morton in the table after the Greenock side lost out on the road to Queen of the South.That was after a decent start from David Hopkin’s men, a dark horse for the play-offs for some people, and Hamilton says that just shows how up and down the Championship can be.“Saturday will be another dficult game,” Hamilton added.“We’ve been working all week to prepare and we go into the game with a wee bit of confidence after the win last week. Alloa are a right good team with some really good players and it just showed there’s no one you can take for granted in this league. Every team has good players so it’s about going out, getting your preparation done properly and trying to do the business.“Morton had a couple of good results not so long ago but then lost out to Queens last weekend. That just shows you can only concentrate on yourselves.”Saturday’s victory over Alloa ended a testing spell for the Dark Blues with very disappointing results against Dundee United and then League Two Elgin City.Hamilton said: “It was a well-earned three points on Saturday, I’d say.“There were a lot of challenges flung at us and it was horrible at times, not particularly nice to play in, but a wee bit of character from the boys ground it out and we got the three points we needed.“Saturday was a dficult game and it was good after the previous two weeks just to get that three points and get going again.“We know we’re going to have to face times like that through the season and it’s about learning from things and moving forward as a group.“We have good lads in the dressing-room and a good manager and that’s the direction we want to go.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/09/DNic_Taw_Teams_Podcast-7-846x564.jpg ","title":"podcast twa teams one street dundee seek back to back wins as united aim to bounce back","story":"This week Tele sports reporters Calum Woodger, George Cran and Graeme Finnan askDundee can make it two wins in a row as they travel to Morton and will United come back from defeat at Ayr  Elsewhere, former Tangerines boss Craig Levein is feeling the heat.Call the #Twa Teams, One Street# fan line on   to leave a message for the boys about all things Dundee and United.For iTunes: click hereFor Spoty: click hereOr search #Tele Twa Teams, One Street# in the podcast app of your choice."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/09/5d8207060c10e7.95933831-423x564.jpg ","title":"shock as driver flips car in city street before fleeing the scene","story":"Residents of a city street say they are “amazed” no one was seriously injured after a car overturned in the early hours of yesterday.Police and fire crews closed off Fountainbleau Drive in Linlathen shortly after am to clear the scene and cut down a lamppost damaged in the smash.A police investigation has been launched in an effort to trace the driver who ditched the car.It is understood the vehicle may have been stolen from the Kirkton area before the crash.Neighbours said they saw three young men wearing dark clothing who fled the area shortly after the incident.An unnamed resident said the yellow Vauxhall came to a stop near the skate park before she contacted the fire service. vw, px\"  She said: “I’m amazed no one was seriously injured.“The car landed on its driver’s side and I contacted the fire brigade – I was worried the car might have gone up in flames.”Another neighbour confirmed she had witnessed a group flee the scene.She added: “I’m amazed they came out of that unscathed.”Another resident described hearing a “loud bang” and said he couldn’t understand how the car had ended up landing in that position, near the junction with Rowantree Crescent.He added: “There was no screeching to imply the car was out of control.“It was facing in the direction of Morrisons but it was on the wrong side of the road to be heading that way.“I can’t understand how it’s managed to end up like that.“There were at least  fire crew members on the scene before a lamppost was cut down.”The fire service confirmed two appliances from the Kingsway station attended the scene.Police have urged anyone who may be able to help their investigation to get in touch.A spokeswoman added: “Officers were called to Fountainbleau Drive in Dundee at around .am yesterday following a one-car collision.“The driver had left the scene prior to police arrival and inquiries are ongoing to trace them.“Anyone who witnessed the crash or has other information relevant to the investigation should contact police on .”"},{"url":null,"title":"britbox-streaming-service-pricing-announced","story":"UK streaming subscription service BritBoxwill launch later this yearat pound. a month, the BBC and ITV have said."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey -

We do at the moment have a dentist and fully qualied staff and are happy with their work.Rumour has it that the aforementioned dentist and staff will be taking on patients from Mid Argyll Hospital, which I presume they tend to already.But the practice is to lose its local NHS patients, so they will deal solely with patients who require dental treatment from the hospital. I think this situation leaves the NHS patients in limbo.I am sure we would rather that the current dentist and all of her staff be given a chance to voice their opinions on this matter as much and as well as the local populace.Yes, it will be brilliant to have both dentists in the town. There is the possibility that those on the local list who are currently treated well by the dental department at the hospital maybe still seen by the dentist and her staff, but I would like this to be confirmed by the local NHS trust.Brian MacDonald, CrinanSir,Hundreds of people across Scotland have been helped through their exam results by a local group of Skills Development Scotlandcareers advisers.Based across the north of Scotland, the advisers were part of a team taking calls at the SDS Exam Results Helpline from am on results day.The helpline is a vital service, supporting young people and their families at what can be one of the most stressful times of their lives.Expert advice and guidance is available all year round, not just on results day.Our professionally qualied careers advisers are working in every state secondary school in Scotland and from our network of high street centres across the country.In schools, careers services are delivered one-to-one, in classrooms and at school events across all year groups, supporting young people to develop the skills to make informed career decisions throughout their lives.

The two practices are run separately but with many shared resources. We don’t think the time is right to merge the practices completely but we do want a new logo and a name that recognises that we work very closely together.The winning entry will receive a cash prize and will then become the public image of our practices for the foreseeable future.

Your understanding and patience is very much appreciated as we seek to find the safest way to deliver the most effective and high quality health care for us all.We look forward to seeing the talent of our local young people when competition entries close on October  and celebrating that talent when we announce our winner on October .Dr Andrew Strain, Lochgilphead Medical Centre and Furnace and Inveraray SurgerySir,My favourite activity at this time of the year is picking brambles. Now I am not saying this is the simplest or even healthiest of activities. All this crouching, hand staining, pricked fingers and even eye strain.Often when you reach for a large black juicy berry it seems to disappear. It’s like the behaviour of politicians. They offer so much but when you reach for it # it disappears. Do you remember the Scottish government passed a law guaranteeing one would be seen by an appropriate health specialist within a stated limited time  The SNP government daily breaks this law – be it on cancer, accident and emergencies, or mental health.Or what about the promises made to the people of Arran and the Outer Hebrides on improved ferry services. The Scottish government is responsible for Caledonian Maritime Assets, CMal, which own and manage ferries. MV Glen Sannox was intended to commence service to Arran in  but lies incomplete for all to see in the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow. Part of the delay is because of disagreement over the fixed-price design and build contract for the two vessels.The SNP seems obsessed with this type of contract which has adversely affected schools, colleges and community centres. Worse still, while the SNP ridiculed previous government public private partnerships they have introduced a system clearly no better. What about the £. million each month we the taxpayers have to pay for the unopened Edinburgh sick children’s hospital  Jeanne Freeman, the SNP Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, stepped in so late that she does not know whether this much-needed hospital will ever open.The second part of the bramble experience is the delicious mouthwatering bramble crumble. A crumble which gives joy and stimulation. Not like the crumbling state of the SNP government which has a sour taste and clearly disappoints.Finlay Craig, CoveSir,Your readers may be interested to know that there are currently  people in need of a kidney transplant in Scotland whose diet will be restricted due to kidney disease.It is likely that they will be on fluid restrictions of around just ml of liquid a day # including liquid found in foods like sauces and ice cream. That is roughly the equivalent of only being able to have a small cup of tea and one can of soft drink per day. In addition, they may have to limit the potassium and phosphate in their diet which means missing out on enjoying foods like chocolate, bananas and tomatoes.We want to make the kidney diet about all the things patients can eat and bring enjoyment back into food # which is why we have launched the Kidney Kitchen.We hope that the Kidney Kitchen will mean everyone living with kidney disease in Scotland can enjoy healthy and delicious food with their family and friends.If you are, oryou know a kidney patient, check out www.kidneykitchen.orgEwen Maclean, advocacy officer Scotland, Kidney Care UKSir,The death of a pet cat can come as a shock, and many owners can find it dficult to come to terms with their loss.The death of a pet is not always seen as a signicant loss, leading some people to hide their feelings which can cause them to feel very alone.On Grief Awareness Day, August , Cats Protection is highlighting its free and confidential Paws to Listen support service, so people facing the loss of a cat do not have to feel alone.The service is available on   .

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

This has been communicated to the providers of the mobile banking service previously.#An alternative location, at the Newton car park where no fees would be charged, has been suggested in the past and remains an option.#Previous parking spots for the mobile unit, including one beside the former RBS building, have proved unsuitable because of traffic and parking conflicts.The Argyllshire Advertiser approached RBS for comment but the bank failed to respond."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column september 13 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe dficult financial times we live in makes for tough choices on spending, there is no doubt about that.The decision to close Ashfield school in Achnamara was dficult, but it was based on educational reasons, according to the committee.Barring appeal it#s a done deal, but the building remains.

It keeps its money as close to home as possible so that, amid historically drastic cuts, the amount spent locally has gone up as featured inon January ,  which notes #where other authorities privatise, Preston grows its own businesses#.Preston ensures that its resources prioritise local providers and businesses wherever possible. Argyll and Bute Council#s Procurement Strategy   falls some way short of this. Its stated aims commendably include:There is no particular emphasis, however, on using its resources to grow Argyll and Bute businesses, to reduce carbon emissions and food transport miles or to foster healthy eating strategies that would benefit our local farmers through #joining up the dots# of local supply and demand.The climate emergency demands a bolder and more innovative respond, and demands it now.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, ArdrishaigSir,I wish to comment on Mr Henderson#s  open letter to Brendan O#Hara in the September  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.The expression #crash out# of Europe is used by Conservative members of parliament, the BBC and the press. While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee. The aim is to transfer all serious patients to one of these centres following pre-hospital emergency care within  minutes.The value of a helicopter air ambulance is therefore obvious.Working alongside the Scottish Ambulance Service#s air fleet, SCAA relies entirely on public donations to keep this vital resource flying.Please consider supporting SCAA in it#s le-saving work during a week when the country focuses on the crucial work of air ambulances everywhere.For further information please visit www.scaa.org.ukDavid Craig, chief executive, Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance , Perth AirportSir,I get a magazine called #Clean Slate#.In it this month is an article where a -year-old girl, Greta Thunberg, along with  other youth activists, have issued this invitation to adults around the world: #Starting on Friday September  we are going to kick-start a week of climate action, with a world-wide strike for the climate. We are asking adults to step up alongside us and make this a turning point in our history.#Greta Thunberg was welcomed by the Speaker of the House of Commons, the leader of the Labour Party and the Secretary of State for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. She also spoke at the elite gathering of business leaders in Davos and at the UN.In March , school strikes took place in more than , cities around the world. Again in May, in more than  countries, millions of pupils took to the streets to remind the world that the earth faces a climate emergency.The strike starting on September  coincides with the UN Climate Action Summit in New York. Millions of people in more than  countries will walk out of their work, homes and colleges and spend a day demanding action on the climate emergency.I hear that many in Lochgilphead High School are planning to do the same # well done!Let us join them on Friday September  between am and pm to help build a future fit for all living beings.Mary Stirling, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"reaching across 150 years","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThis year marks  years of CrossReach, a social care service provided by the Church of Scotland.To mark the occasion Glassary, Kilmartin and Ford Parish Church#s worship group incorporated a presentation about the charity into the Sunday service on September .The presentation, led by Linda Tighe and Lesley Steele, looked at the charity#s beginnings in  as the Church of Scotland Committee on Christian Le and Work, right through to the services they provide today as CrossReach.Using case studies to help showcase the charity#s work, Linda and Lesley told the story of Amna, a young girl whose parents needed to use most of their savings in an attempt to resolve an unexpected crisis.

It forms an integral part of the councilrsquos strategy to build on the investment already made in the Borders Railway, which currently terminates adjacent to the Lowood site in Tweedbank.ldquoThe council purchased the land following an appropriate investment appraisal process and the development of a detailed financial model, which followed the Treasuryrsquos lsquoGreen Bookrsquo best practice.ldquoCouncillors considered the business case in full and three specic reports in December , January  and May  prior to the purchase.ldquoThese reports included the necessary information on site valuations, now released publicly."},{"url":null,"title":"mp-lamont-join-cross-party-bid-get-eu-deal","story":"BORDERS MP John Lamont is joining a cross-party group set up to get a deal with the EU through Parliament.Around  Conservative, Labour and independent MPs launched lsquoMPs for a dealrsquo on Tuesday.And the memberfor Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk says he is signing up, in a bid to find an alternative to a no-deal Brexit.Explaining his decision, Mr Lamont said: ldquoI am a democrat, who was disappointed with the EU Referendum result.\"But I also think the result needs to be implemented and done so in a sensible way.\"Thatrsquos why Irsquom joining this cross-party group to get a deal approved by Parliament, get us out of the EU and move the country on.

This occurs when cats come in contact with chemicals such as fuels, lubricants and some solvents.Usually, self-grooming causes the cat to ingest the toxin, or in some cases they inhale it which can cause a severe pneumonia.The toxin can cause problems throughout the body and on the skin too.When Jonny had examined Tikka, he immediately sent her to our Tranent surgery for blood tests and intravenous fluids as she was dehydrated.Fortunately, Tikkarsquos blood tests were normal so she did not have kidney damage.She tolerated her fluid therapy well and was soon looking much happier however several areas of her skin had become red and she was losing hair especially on her front legs.Tikka did not want to eat or drink. She was given analgesics, antibiotics and soothing cream was applied to her skin.Our nursing staff ensured she was as comfortable as possible and as she was not eating by herself, they fed her via a feeding tube several times a day.Her skin became red and thickened and some areas sloughed off.She had to have cream applied frequently to the damaged skin, just asshe had suffered burns.Tikka was finally well enough to go home where Mrs Taylor continued to treat her skin. Tikka started eating well again and is improving daily. Her fur is regrowing and soon she will have her beautul coat again.Now Mrs Taylor was very vigilant and realised she had to do something to help Tikka immediately.If you suspect your cat may have had contact with petroleum-based substances, please contact your vet as soon as possible.Often the first sign you may have is your pet smells of petrol or diesel.There may be vomiting or diarrhoea. They may actually be dizzy or confused or showing other neurological problems such as staggering and trembling. There may be respiratory signs such as coughing or wheezingthey have inhaled the chemical.Do not try to make your pet vomit as this can exacerbate the toxicity.The first thing you should do is try to remove the chemical from the fur.In many cases, it is best to bring your pet straight to your vets as soon as possible. The nursing staff at veterinary practices are well trained in dealing with intoxication emergencies.With petroleum products there are three main areas where the body can be affected: l The internal organs especially the kidneys, so your vet will want to blood sample your pet to check for any damage to the kidneys or other organsl The respiratory system can be affected especiallythe toxin is inhaled. This often happensthe patient vomits then inhales some resulting in a very severe pneumonia. Your vet may wish to take x-rays to check for this.l The animalrsquos skin can also be affected. The petroleum products sit on the fur then soaks through to the skin where they are held in contact by the fur. This causes them to act as a caustic substance, damaging the skin and hair follicles. Often the first sign before the skin damage is seen is hair loss due to the follicle damage.The treatment for these causes is supportive at all times. There are no specic antidotes. Intravenous fluids are administered, this helps overcome dehydration and helps eliminate toxins from the body.Analgesics are given to help keep pain from damaged skin and internal organs to a minimum.Antibiotics are given, as damaged skin is very prone to secondary infection and they are always givenpneumonia is present. Skin treatment has to be intense to keep infection to a minimum and encourage damaged skin to recover.Thankfully Tikka has made an excellent recovery, thanks to Mrs Taylorrsquos quick thinking and the intense nursing care given by the nursing team at Dunedin Vets."},{"url":null,"title":"tim-39-s-tales-magic-real-39-s-around-us","story":"Of course, in stories magic is very real a frog or beast can transform into a prince, dragons and witches can fly, animals can talk, wishes can be granted by faeries and spells cast by wizards.

Animals do talk, any dog lover will tell us that.Have you ever seen a hare and made eye contact and felt the connection or watched a squirrel hide nuts, and then come up to you asking for more Walk in a wood, or by a riverbank, or just sit in your garden or a park and the magic is all around you. We watched wood pigeons nest in a small elder tree outside our front window over the summer. Two eggs hatched and we watched as they were fed and finally flew the nest. It was, truly, magic.The magic all around us is still vast, and we could all make our own list the sound of birdsong, watching a butterfly flutter, a spiderrsquos web decorated with dew, the glimpse of a deer in a wood, the mist wrapped mountains, a red sparkling cloud during sunset, a wee beastie under a rock as it scampers for cover, the whisper of an ancient tree and the sweet smell of a wood.But I believe that sadly too many of us donrsquot notice real magic anymore.And when we donrsquot notice something we donrsquot feel connected to it, so we donrsquot care about it. And when we donrsquot care about it we donrsquot protect or value it.And when we donrsquot value it, we canrsquot feel the wonder and sense of awe it creates. And so we trash it, ignore and neglect it, exploit it. And we forget we are part of this magic that we are sons and daughters of nature too. And so we disconnect ourselves from what can truly make us feel happy, and instead drug ourselves with the articial magic of our own technology which makes us feel all powerful.But the truth is we are not.Ultimately we rely on the natural environment for our physical and emotional well-being, as much as the creatures we are making extinct.We need nature, it doesnrsquot need us, and eventually it is in control. Asto make this point huge waves hit the rocks of Prestonpans in a storm not so long ago, drenching the nearby houses in a display of naturersquos power. It was scary but also spectacular.In  such a storm was believed to have been the result of magic conjured by the ldquoNorth Berwick Witches.That storm, like the recent one, was indeed magic, conjured by nature, which can whip up a whirlwind more effectively than any wizard or witch.Magic is real.

Wood denounced the councilrsquos decision to block the parades as ldquostupid. This seems harsh, although the immediate backlash does show this cautionary step backfired. As Wood commented in a newspaper article, outright bans simply allow resentment to fester and violence to erupt where.Explosions of sectarian aggression and abuse are an obvious outrage, but even entirely peaceful religious marches through Glasgow are a blot on the cityrsquos reputation. Whenever a Grand Orange Lodge goes past, banging drums, playing flutes and waving banners, I feel I have stepped back three centuries. In theory, Orange marches are harmless and legitimate expressions of faith and historical commemoration. In practice, in the west of the country at least, they are the unlit end of a fuse that doesnrsquot take much to ignite. Everyone knows these are potentially inflammatory occasions, and a marching season that passes without incident is the very definition of a miracle.As is all too evident, sectarian prejudice is alive and well. Those who say it is nearly extinct are either optimists or judge todayrsquos level of confrontation against a much bloodier and more ignorant past. By that measure, certainly, things are considerably better than they were even as recently as when I joined this newspaper when on my first day a new colleague commented on the arrival of yet another Protestant. Anti-discrimination laws have helped promote more enlightened attitudes, but even without this statutory inducement to scrupulous fairness, the majority of us these days make no distinction between Catholic and Protestant,indeed we even notice it at all.:Faith no more  Have catholic schools had their day, asks Kevin McKennaThe country has come a long way since the Church of Scotlandrsquos disgraceful and virulent anti-Catholicism in the s, and the barefaced discrimination and hurtful jibes Catholics of all ranks endured. No wonder separate schools were considered necessary. Yet while levels of abuse and discrimination are dramatically lower than before, in some quarters hoary old grievances and antediluvian attitudes continue to smoulder.You could argue that the answer is education: an ongoing challenging of closed minds that will eventually lead to a state where nobody cares what religion other people follow. It is Tom Woodrsquos contention, however, that in order to eradicate sectarianism we need to abolish Catholic schools. These, he believes, are the root of the problem.With some reluctance, I have to agree their time is up. This, despite knowing that endorsing this view would appear to be rejecting the liberal values that I consider essential for a fair and well-run country. If parents wish to send their children to a school whose principles are guided by the Catholic faith ndash or any other for that matter ndash surely they should be allowed that choice  By all accounts, the education students receive in Catholic schools is impressive, and in some cases so enviable that lapsed members of the church appear to have a Damascene reawakening in order to get their offspring into the classroom.Yet the existence of this archaic system of schooling is tangible evidence of a problem that refuses to wither. From early childhood, separate schools reinforce the idea of dference, segregation and distinction. Whatever side of that school fence you walk, you are made aware from Primary One onwards of the concept of Them and Us.Therersquos another distasteful aspect of segregated schools too. Richard Dawkinsrsquos new book, Outgrowing God, which is aimed at young readers, tries to help ldquobreak the cycle of indoctrination. That word will be offensive to those who think they are doing their best by their children in instructing them in their own religious beliefs and culture, be they Catholic, Protestant, Muslim or Jew. But, even when done with the best intentions, sending a child to a school affiliated to a church is a form of intellectual and emotional programming. It represents the opposite of liberal values.:Catholic schools are rated higher by inspectorsFor as long as it is possible to put a child through a denominational education, society is tacitly acknowledging the power of religion to define who people are. In an age when the state is increasingly non-religious in its decision-making, in order to maintain strict neutrality and equality, it makes no sense. When single-sex institutions are frowned upon as out-dated, when discrimination based on ethnicity, background or sexual orientation is considered abhorrent, it seems odd that this particular expression of dference is allowed to continue. Onlysectarianism were unheard of, rather than a persistent blight, would it ndash just about ndash be acceptable.Back in the real world, the existence of educational pigeon-holes like these means there is little hope of religious bigotry being eradicated. Those on either side of the school gates live in an environment that allows this shameful stain on our country to persist, and even flourish. Initiatives to raise awareness or to banish deep-rooted prejudices can never be wholly successful so long as the public statement of religious identity is allowed such a state-sanctioned .This is not to attack faith itself. What iniduals choose to believe, and the ways in which they introduce children to their religion or creed at home, is their business. Nor should schools cease to teach pupils about world religions, or to help them understand the huge cultural influence that Christianity, both Catholic and Protestant, has exerted on countless aspects of our lives, for good and ill.Complete integration, however, should be the goal. The building blocks of society must mirror the kind of world we want future generations to inherit. No matter how you look at it, denominational schools have become an anomaly. If sectarianism is to become a thing of the past, then so should they."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10428582.jpg?type=article-full","title":"scotlands-economy-brink-recession","story":"Official figures found Scottish GDP fell by . per cent in the second quarter of the year.Two consecutive quarters of negative growth is the technical definition of a recession.SNP Finance Secretary Derek Mackay blamed Brexit.The UK economy shrank by .% over the same period.Over the year to June, Scottish GDP grew by just .% compared to .% for the UK.A key factor in the latest figures was a see-sawing of business activity on either side of the original Brexit deadline of March .In the quarter ahead of the date, many firms stockpiled goods in case of no-deal, with the increased economic activity lting GDP.After the deadline was extended, that process went into reverse as firms ran down their stocks and economic activity sagged.\"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Countdown to Brexit:  days until Britain leaves the EU\",\"description\": \"Countdown to Brexit:  days until Britain leaves the EU\",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer v media sfpYlAw poster.jpg width\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests sfpYlAw.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": A fallback in food and draink and pharmaceutical industries, which helped drive the .% rise in Scottish GDP in the first quarter, accounted for the whole .% fall in the second.Mr Mackay said: ldquoGiven the repeated warnings from business organisations and the contraction across the UK in the same quarter, it is unsurprising but deeply frustrating that we are now seeing the Brexit impact on the Scottish economy.\"The responsibility for this contraction lies entirely with the UK Government.ldquoWe are already taking steps to protect jobs and our economy from Brexit but not every impact can be mitigated.

North of Dundee, there are no Catholic high schools and very few primary ones, likewise in the Borders, there is effectively ldquocomplete integration in education. Yet anti-Catholic hate crimes are still committed in these areas in flagrant contradiction of her abolitionist panacea.It is of course, complete tolerance that should be the goal together with a willingness to accept that a plural society should have a erse and pluralistic education system. Perhaps those who attack Catholic schools should reveal their true motivation they might admit that they loathe religion in general, Christianity in particular and the Catholic manestation of Christianity most especially.They might also admit that atheist or humanist parents who indoctrinate their children in accordance with the Gospel of Richard Dawkins are imposing upon them a belief system or dogma which brooks no counter or challenge, and which considers itself to be truer, purer and altogether more enlightened than any religious system of belief and infuses its adherents with a zeal to convert non-believers by law or by force.Dawkins or Ms Goring can no more disprove the existence of God than I can prove it. They have no stronger claim to veracity for their belief system than I have for mine. The dference between us is that I respect theirs and do not wish to impose conformity with mine upon them. It is in this crucial distinction that we see why atheism inevitably becomes tyrannical.Ironically, the conflict between a small number of marchers on a few Glasgow streets recently is of course political not religious. Although irrelevant to the existence of Catholic schools, it is as depressing as it is instructive to see the flames of those conflicts being fanned by some who would use them as a stick to beat Catholic schools with.Peter Kearney, Director, Catholic Media Office, Glasgow G.IT is most unfortunate that Rosemary Goring takes the view that Catholic schools must be abolished.The secular agenda in Scotland is that faith not be taught as true but as a matter for relative study. The insistence is that faith be excluded from the schools criteria for employment and admission, something which would have the effect of destroying the much-vaunted \"Catholic ethos\".Schools are an extension of the family and the community, not the state. Education is about the formation of habits and virtues it cannot exclude the religious dimension. Serving the most disadvantaged and underprivileged has always been central to the mission of Catholic education ndash Catholic schools are the most ethnically erse and international of all maintained schools. Catholic schools are oases of ersity and tolerance they instil a strong ethos of service to wider society and the sense of identity and belonging which independent inspectors consistently applaud in them is what leads to broad-minded citizens.Martin Conroy, Cockburnspath.ROSEMARY Goringrsquos journalese is deeply flawed. The diminution of active living Christian faith and practice by using the sociological category \"religion\" renders her arguments invalid. She would not write about politics without distinguishing the philosophies of the political parties who constitute our democracy.Richard Dawkins is himself an exemplar of indoctrination and is well recognised as a shallow and pejorative commentator on religion.Irish Catholic immigrants were ordered by the hierarchy not to integrate with Protestants. Now there are many marriages between Protestants and Catholics in the west of Scotland. Not everyone is at each otherrsquos throats even though the Catholic Church continues to discriminate against Protestant members of these families by refusing to recognise us as equals in Christian Faith.Rev Dr Robert Anderson, Dundonald.IT is naive to view Catholic schools as sectarian and other schools as neutral.Every school,it is to address questions of value, meaning and purpose, must do so from a particular philosophy. Failure to address these issues leaves education dry and barren.Catholic schools present a belief system and le philosophy that pupils can ultimately embrace or reject, but they know that they are being educated in a Catholic context.Meanwhile, most other schools induct pupils into a left-leaning liberal secular humanist progressive therapeutic feminist environmentalist LGBT-activist ldquosocial justice philosophy that happens to be remarkably similar to that of the Government. These pupils are usually unaware that they are being educated according to a particular philosophy.The key feature of Catholic schools is the offering of a distinct ethos that appeals to many parents and pupils, and yields better outcomes than the Governmentrsquos educational ideology. The Government is trying to squeeze Catholic schools into its own failed mould, but many of their distinctives have survived so far.Rosemary Goring overlooks all of this and focuses on the alleged contribution Catholic education makes to the bizarre tribalism known as sectarianism. But the answer to irrational hostilities is not to deprive families of the option to have their children educated according to their own values ndash values that have no place for mindless tribalism.Richard Lucas, Leader of The Scottish Family Party, Glasgow G.THOUGH the heading on Rosemary Gorings article is contentious and somewhat simplistic, she nevertheless offers relevant and tangible evidence for the ending of denominational education in Scotland.The origins of Ms Goringss report emanate from a recent newspaper article by Tom Wood, former Deputy Chief Constable of Lothian and Borders Police wherein he contends that Catholic schools need to be abolished to eradicate sectarianism. Mr Wood carelessly dismisses the origins of the sectarian ide in Scotland as fundamentally an Irish problem that was transported to Scotland in the th century and infers an equal responsibility for the perpetuation of the issue throughout the next century. This is far from the truth. Catholics in Scotland suffered from widespread institutionalised discrimination in employment, housing, education and in most walks of Scottish le until more recent times.At the opening of St Modans High School in Stirling in , a school I was proud to attend both as a pupil and as a teacher, JL Foxworthy, the redoubtable headteacher, addressed his audience of young people and parents with the hope that the school could produce future lawyers, doctors and teachers. It was his sincere wish that the Catholic community could integrate itself into Scottish le and gain acceptance in a society where prejudice remained commonplace, through their roles in middle class professions. As Ms Goring observes, separate schools were considered necessary at this time as they were the only vehicle for Catholic advancement in existence in an intolerant and prejudiced Scotland. This rationale is now, however, largely redundant.In an increasingly secular age, Catholic schools and the Orange Order have one thing in common ndash they appear archaic, isive and cling to an image of Scotland that has all but disappeared into the mists of time. It is dficult to argue, as Ms Goring rightly states, that st century Catholic schools are an obstacle to complete integration and that denominational schools have become an anomaly. The Catholic Churchs ambiguous teachings on LGBT rights, same-sex marriage and the continuation of the inequitable and antiquated approval system which vets applicants for posts in Catholic schools to determine their religious suitability are not sustainable in a liberal and inclusive Scottish society. It is time to try and see the bigger picture through the prism of future generations. It is time for the phasing out of Catholic schools in Scotland.Owen Kelly, Stirling.Evidence suggests prejudice and bias are learned rather than being innate and I agree with Rosemary Goring that therefore denominational schools have no place in todayrsquos society. I would go further as I see no place in our schools for any form of religious education. However in the absence of sectarianism I guarantee some zealots would still vent their collective spleen at a minority over some other perceived dference. ldquoBloody vegans coming over here refusing to eat haggis itrsquos an insult to Burns our heritage. Build a wall, send them back to Vega they are not the same as us, stone them!Ms Goring does of course ignore the ldquoelephant in the room of private education as the problems it causes by reinforcing societal isions and the preferentially enhancing future le-prospects of their alumni is far more destructive than religious bigotry.However, currently there is as much chance of removing religious education from schools as there is of ending private education, as it suits the Establishment that they exist and as long as we are fighting amongst ourselves we pose no threat to them.David J Crawford, Glasgow G.Read more: Rosemary Goring: If we want to end sectarianism, we must abolish Catholic schools"},{"url":null,"title":"brian-beacom-soap-television-diluting-impact-nonsense","story":"We all took readily to Brookside and its Scouse scallies and great writing by Jimmy McGovern.

This is because four fths of Scotland’s carbon footprint is generated through the heat and energy required to grow, make, process, transport and provide materials that are often tossed aside at the end of their le.Only by considering how to make products with less reliance on raw materials, and by remaking items at the end of their original le into goods that can be used time and again, will businesses be able to signicantly reduce global emissions.Iain Gulland, chief executive of Zero Waste Scotland, who launched the organisation’s corporate plan before an auduence of business leaders last week, said: “We must radically change the way we think about and consume our goods and materials, and we must do that now.” “Too many businesses assume that reducing the cost to the planet means increasing costs for them. “But as we have and will continue to make clear, the opportunities are plentul, with massive savings to be made. “The current way of working cannot continue in the years ahead and successfully adopting a circular economy approach is the only long-term option.”Everything has value and in a circular economy nothing should be wasted. In simple terms, it can be explained as ‘make, use, remake’ as opposed to ‘make, use, dispose’. The ultimate goal is to maintain and improve our quality of le, while simultaneously reducing our material consumption and, by extension, our impact on the planet.Mr Gulland added: “Many Scottish firms are already leading the way, with our help, changing how they design and trade goods to keep materials in use for as long as possible to maximise their value. “Successful circular economy enterprises range from refurbishing computers and upcycling furniture to producing sustainable animal feed using waste generated by our world-famous whisky industry.”data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.kincardineshireobserver webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Felicitasis just one of the many children supported by Marys Meals.\"   is just one of the many children supported by Marys Meals.\"  Throw a Porridge Party for Mary’s MealsviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.kincardineshireobserver webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Left to right - Fiona Cooper, treasurer, Katrina Suer, chair, and Catherine Houston, vice-chair\"  Scouts plea for hut renovation support viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"KINC | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"KINC | Article Teaser\"Zero Waste Scotland estimates that the circular economy would save Scottish businesses collectively at least £ billion every year through benefits including the creation of longer-lasting relationships with customers, as firms switch from a model centred on simply selling products to providing products as services.

I look forward to the project progressing.”Led by ZeroAvia, developers of hydrogen fuel cell powertrain solutions, HyFlyer will demonstrate a phased approach from battery power to hydrogen power, integrating the new technology aboard a Piper M-class six-seater aircraft which will perform test flights out of Cranfield and Orkney.Project partners Intelligent Energy will optimise its high power fuel cell technology for application in aviation while EMEC Hydrogen, producers of green hydrogen from renewable energy, will supply the hydrogen required for flight tests and develop a mobile refuelling  compatible with the plane.The HyFlyer project will see conventional piston engines in propeller aircraft replaced by electric motors, hydrogen fuel cells and gas storage.If all goes well, ZeroAvia, based in Calornia, are aiming to supply the technology to commercial manufacturers by .Following this demonstration, the next goal then is to power an aircraft, carrying up to  passengers, to travel  miles.According to the Air Transport Action Group, aviation is responsible for  per cent of CO emissions from all transport sources and is one of the fastest growing sources of global emissions.Val Mtakhov, founder and CEO of ZeroAvia, said: “The substantial backing provided by the UK Government underlines the potential that hydrogen holds as a fuel source for commercial aviation and provides signicant validation of ZeroAvia’s approach to zero emission flight.“Our project goal of  NM is equivalent to the distance from London to Edinburgh and will prove that zero emission aviation, powered by hydrogen, can play a key role within the UK and other countries’ transport strategies — enabling net zero targets to be met and improving productivity and regional prosperity.”Richard Ainsworth, Hydrogen Project Specialist at EMEC Hydrogen, said: “HyFlyer is another key step in Orkney’s aim to decarbonise leline transport services for islanded communities.#Hydrogen has the potential to help meet our emission commitments where electrons and batteries can’t.#This project sees us one step closer to meeting our fuel and energy needs from abundant local renewable energy resources using green hydrogen.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

All energy consumers pay for the cost of investment in new network capacity so the regulator ensures that it obtains the best deal possible for them.Ofgem launched a consultation in December last year on proposed changes to SSEN’s plan in an effort to ensure value for money for consumers.Following consideration of consultation responses and further analysis, the regulator has decided to approve the plan subject to the conditions set out in its decision.Approval is conditional on a total of at least MW of new wind farm projects on Orkney either being awarded a Contract for Dferenceor being judged likely to be developed by December .Ofgem would expect to be satisfied that new wind farm projects are likely to be developed despite not being awarded a CfDan independent audit states that the project is financially viable, has signed a relevant grid connection agreement and has been granted planning permission.However, SSEN has stated disappointment that the regulator is maintaining its position that the MW of new renewable electricity generation needs to secure planning permission and demonstrate financial viability prior to granting approval for the construction of the link.Ofgem has extended the date in which developers need to meet these conditions from December  to December . SSEN has said this means, in turn, that the construction of the transmission link may be delayed for at least a two-year period,the full time is required to secure the MW target, or shorterthe need is met at an earlier stage.SSEN’s Transmission and Distribution businesses now intend to consult with Orkney developers and other stakeholders to help establish the optimal #whole system# solution in an effort to make the most of Orkney’s renewable potential.Talking about Ofgem#s decision, Rob McDonald, managing director for transmission with SSEN, said: “Whilst we are clearly disappointed with today’s decision, our commitment to work with Orkney developers and other stakeholders to unlock Orkney’s vast renewable potential has not changed.“With both the UK and Scottish Government committed to net zero emissions, we firmly believe Orkney and Scotland’s other two major island groups will have a key role to play in the fight to prevent the worst effects of climate change.“We now look forward to working with developers and other stakeholders on Orkney to collectively explore the best way forward to unlock Orkney’s renewable potential.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The focus will be on making sure we get there properly.Once in the river, the pound. billion aircraft carrier will anchor for three to five days before waiting for a low tide to pass under the Firthrsquos famous bridges.To do so, the mast pole on top of one of the islands, which operates on a hydraulic system, will be lowered so the ship can pass under the bridges and head towards the North Sea.Captain Houston said there was a ldquoreal air of excitement among the  shiprsquos company and  contractors, adding he was proud of the work they have done to get the vessel ready for sea trials which will test areas including the engines and radar systems.Having previously served as second in command on board HMS Queen Elizabeth, he said he saw exactly what happened during her sea trials and knows how this aircraft carrier will react.With a mixture of new Royal Navy sailors and old hands making up the crew, Captain Houston said for him there is a ldquosense of pride and a real privilege to be the first captain to take the ship to sea.With HMS Prince of Wales setting sail, it will see both of the UKrsquos biggest and most powerful warships at sea together for the first time.Rear Admiral Martin Connell, assistant chief of naval staff aviation and carrier strike, said: ldquoI was the commanding officer of HMS Illustrious ndash our former aircraft carrier ndash andsomeone had told me at the beginning of this decade we would have two brand new aircraft carriers at sea by the end of the decade, I wouldnrsquot have believed them.ldquoIn a matter of days, perhaps weeks, we are going to have HMS Queen Elizabeth on the western Atlantic operating F-s stealth fighter jets, as well as HMS Prince of Wales around the UK doing contractor sea trials.ldquoThat is a remarkable feat in terms of the project.ldquoBut, also what it gives us is the ability and the confidence to think we will have a continuous carrier capability for decades.During their -year service, the two aircraft carriers can be pressed into action for ious work such as high intensity war fighting or providing humanitarian aid and disaster relief.They have been built by the Aircraft Carrier Alliancendash a partnership of BAE Systems, Babcock, Thales and the Ministry of Defence.Overall, six shipyards around the UK ndash Appledore, Birkenhead, Govan, Portsmouth, Rosyth and Tyne ndash have been involved in building ious parts of the carriers.Minister for defence procurement Anne-Marie Trevelyan, who toured the ship ahead of the departure, said it is ldquofantastic that we have got our carrier strike capability back.ldquoThese are Formula One ships ndash extraordinary beasts delivering both global power projection and indeed the ability to deliver hard powerwe need to against our enemies, she added.HMS Prince of Wales is expected to head into her home base of Portsmouth once sea trials have been completed, and will commission into the Royal Navy at the end of the year.copy -.

Launched by new charity Center for Countering Digital Hate, stars lined up to show their support, some of whom will hopefully start following the suggestion more closely themselves.As a phrase, ‘don’t feel the trolls’ has been in use since the early days of internet forums, where the word ‘troll’ came to mean someone sometimes malevolent, but always time-wasting, users who got their kicks from bothering others. They weren’t always nasty. Sometimes they were the jesters of a group, deploying practical jokes and making mischief. This kind were an early example of what’s now known as ‘s***posting’, the creation and sharing of content that is, by design, pointless and insincere, underpinned by a nihilistic view about the state of current affairs, and the sense that why not fritter away time being surreal and annoying to public figures online,society is in meltdown anyway. Dictionary defines the term as “to post off-topic, , or offensive contributions to an online forum with the intent to derail the discussion or provoke other participants”.But at their worst, trolls were abusive, often racist, homophobic, sexist and threatening, and they prolerated in online spaces dominated by young men banding together and hostile to others, where it was possible to use anonymity with sinister intent, encouraged by the toxic bravado that set the tone of belonging in so many humour and gaming forums.: High profile celebs pledge not to publicise social media abuse they receive from vile trollsFor unlimited access to Scotland’s best news, sport and expert analysis, SUBSCRIBE to The Scotsman website hereWhen online abuse began to be discussed in the mainstream as a result of social media usage becoming widespread, there was a conflation of ‘trolling’ with ‘abuse’ that wasn’t especially helpful to understanding either, because while trolling could encapsulate abuse, the word minimised and was inaccurate about what was happening. Traditional media has often been slow off the mark to understand and analyse online behaviour.It’s easy to brush off abuse as just some online thing when it’s called trolling, and that propagates the idea that online threats have minimal inpact when the reality is not only can they be as law-breaking as threats and intimidation in the offline world, but studies have shown they have a diminishing effect on demographics already under-represented in public discourse.Amnesty International has been looking into the impact of online abuse, specically aimed at women, and in  released a study conducted in eight countries showing that almost a quarter of women online had experienced online abuse or harassment, and that  per cent of those felt their physical safety was threatened as a result of online abuse. The impact has slowly begun to be understood as a freedom of speech issue, with abuse leading to self-censorship and stress, preventing women from expressing themselves freely and joining in public le.Shockingly, Diane Abbot alone received  per cent of abusive tweets sent to MPs in the weeks prior to the  election. Similarly, when thetook the interesting and commendable step of analysing comments, they found that women and black writers received a disproportionate amount of abuse. There is a school of thought that the internet, and particularly social media, is the cause of abuse. Certainly, there are many exacerbating factors. But social media also makes existing thoughts and tendencies visible, and what’s on view here is racism and sexism that already exists in iniduals, expressed in violent and threatening ways.: Humza Yousaf: I would meet Twitter trolls who send me racist messages: Nicola Sturgeon urges online trolls to ‘take a long hard look at themselves’In her recent book of essays, Trick Mirror, a brilliant and excavating look at contemporary culture, there is a section where author Jia Tolentino examines trolling and the “mutual dependency” that can encourage it. Arguing online can be addictive and cathartic. Who doesn’t want to swear on Twitter sometimes  But while blocking can feel like doing nothing, it’s still taking an action, and a more decisive one than engaging with and providing attention to those who seek it.For a very small minority of users who are highly visible, engaging with ‘trolls’ also becomes part of their personal brand. Let’s be clear – this is not about taking a stand in a useful or important way, but performatively squabbling with anonymous or clearly malevolent accounts, sometimes to depict themselves as at the forefront of a social movement. It’s also frustrating to see an easy supply of responses to career controversialists like Katie Hopkins and Piers Morgan, who dangle bait and always get a bite. Common sense seems in short supply in these instances.But where is corporate responsibility in all this  Blocking and muting is good advice, but it’s also treating the symptom of a larger disease. We’re encouraged by social sites to put more and more of ourselves online under the guise of making connections and networking. Social media has been an important tool for people under-represented in mainstream public expression, and has helped communities and movements bolster one another and flourish. But just as capitalism encourages us to create personal brands and turn ourselves into walking advertisements in increasingly insidious ways, the ultimate goal of social media sites is to profit from their users. The negligence over cracking down on content which is abusive and prejudiced cannot be overlooked. When Amnesty International began to examine the impact of online abuse on freedom of expression, they discovered much of it was against the terms and conditions of social sites which let it flourish unchecked. Facebook has infamously banned images of breast-feeding, including any nipple shots on its sister site Instagram, but far-right propaganda and hate speech run rampant.Blocking and muting, in order not to feed the trolls, is for the most part a sensible coping strategy for iniduals. But placing the onus on social media users to solve the problem sites have failed to, which disproportionately impacts women and racial and sexual minorities, lets social behemoths who make staggering profits from our data off the hook. Perhaps it’s time for legal requirement for social media sites to enforce their own community standards and deal with hate speech adequately, at risk of financial penalty.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"last laugh for edinburgh couple as they sell up diagon alley joke shop","story":"Their business is believed to have been the basis for JK Rowlings lsquoZonkorsquos Joke Shoprsquo in Diagon Alley - a favourite place for young wizards including Harry Potter.: The Inbetweeners star James Buckley takes swipe at joke crowned the best at Edinburgh Fringe And over the years it certainly has not lost its magic.

I would buy the shop myselfI had the money but I hope to continue working here under a new owner. The shop could become even better with a modern digital vision in place.The shop has welcomed a host of celebrities over the years from Emma Thompson to Jason Isaacs and just about every Fringe performer desperately seeking props. Looking back on the shop, Bill said: ldquoThis business sells nostalgia and some of the props and pranks we have never get old. You see grandparents wanting their grand kids to share the same laughs that they did. That is what it is all about for me. To see the joy that we bring into peoplersquos lives- it is just such a wonderful thing to witness.The couple will look to have more free time in their retirement, with Bill vowing to explore the world and the unseen parts of Edinburgh that he has not yet had the time to enjoy.Cathi and Bills Top Five Products:.

But this week the #Peatbogs# will be back on home turf to showcase their energetic brand of traditional-inspired electronica as part of this year#s Skye Live Festival.The rare Skye gig will mark the start of another autumn tour for the six-piece group, for whom constant re-invention has proved key to longevity spanning almost three decades.The sound that#ll boom out in the tent high above Portree Harbour this Saturday will be far removed from the group#s roots as a folk band playing in local pubs. But the Peatbogs, like more recent successors such as Niteworks, are a reminder that a grounding in traditional music is no barrier to a letime of instrumental experimentation.Le for the Peatbog Faeries began with a gig in Edinbane Lodge in the spring of . Peter Morrison and bass player Innes Hutton from Braes # the two constants in the line-up # were joined by Davie Tait, Ali Pentland and Alan Edmunds.Pubs and village hall dances became their early staple, but gradually more adventurous elements crept into their set and the audiences lapped it up.Morrison recalled: #We#d bring in a blues or a reggae sound, and we found it was these things that started to go down best with audiences.#We moved to more of a world music sound around about , but we never expected much to come of it. We were just out to play at pubs and parties and have a bit of fun#.Their first tape # the #Great Ceilidh Swindle# # sold well locally and paid for a demo in Edinburgh, which in turn caught the ear of Greentrax Records, the specialist label in Scottish traditional music.With bands like Shooglenty and Martyn Bennett also arriving on the scene it proved a perfect time to be breaking new ground and the Peatbog Faeries# debut album #Mellowsity# would stay in Greentrax#s top ten for the next decade-and-a-half.Morrison remembers: #Because of our size and sound, bands like us and Shooglenty cost a lot more to record than other folk bands at the time. So there was a worry at the start.#But as soon as we signed to Greentrax, we quite quickly got an agent and we got sought-after slots at Glastonbury, Nomad and Celtic Connections.#We didn#t really notice what was happening, in a way # it felt like one day we were playing in the pub, the next day playing in front of thousands.#There weren#t that many precedents for bands like ours. Most folk bands just played in pubs. There were some accordion bands that were full-time or groups like #Silly Wizard#, but for us coming out of Skye we never thought it would turn into a full-time occupation.#We just went with the flow and luckily for us it proved a lot more popular than we thought it would be.#The band#s line-up has changed several times, and in turn, each addition helped explore new sounds # the most dramatic sht coming when Rick Taylor and Nigel Hitchcock arrived on Skye in the s to add a three-piece brass section.Taylor # who passed away earlier this year # was a revered musician who had toured with Elton John, while in recent years the Peatbog#s fiddler Peter Tickell left the group to take to the road with Sting.The current scaled-back line-up has seen Morrison and Hutton joined by Edinburgh-based Tom Salter on guitar keyboard player Graeme Stafford from Ardnamurchan drummer Stu Haikney and Shetlander Ross Couper on fiddle.For Peter Morrison, the global tours, the record deals and the Glastonbury stage all owe their origins to the chance he got to learn the chanter in the long-since closed Vatten Bridge primary school.He explains: #Every year Norman MacLeod # the teacher#s husband # and John Laing used to pipe us all in to the Christmas Party, so that was where I first heard the pipes.#Every pupil got the chance of learning the chanter at school, and I think nine of us started playing. It was either that or an hour of maths.#I think I was the only one who carried on into secondary school, but I got the bug. I didn#t like the competing part, but I enjoyed listening to the pipes and learning to play them.#My pal Donnie MacAskill from Roag also played the accordion, so I learned to play drums along with him and from about the age of  I was always in bands.#Morrison#s early piping tutor was Cameron MacFadyen, and he received additional help from Nicol Campbell # another well-known local piper and character from Dunvegan, whose memory has been honoured across the globe.Morrison added: #When he passed away Nicol left me his kilt, which has since been worn on stages in Japan, Africa and America.#A joiner to trade, who also worked for aperiod as a hotelier in Dunvegan, Peter Morrison has seen attitudes to traditional music change over the years, and with it opportunities flourish.He still lives in Roag with we Johan and grown-up kids Jenny and Calum, and it#s no surprise to hear him promote the virtues of free access to music tuition in local schools.He continues to be #amazed# at some of the local talent learning traditional instruments, some of whom he can be heard playing alongside at regular music sessions laid on in the Edinbane Inn and the Old Inn in Carbost.#It#s changed a lot since when I was a youngster whenyou wanted to learn music the only real opportunity was the pipes,# he recalled.#Things like the fis movement have been really helpful in creating opportunities. There now seems to be a constant stream of really good young musicians coming out of Skye.#When I started you would never have thought of making a career out of it, but now with some of these youngsters, it seems to be the only thing they think about. #A lot of these kids are now at a standard that in previous years only a handful of people in Scotland were achieving.#In Skye you have the likes of Daimh, Niteworks, Bridghe Campbell # the list goes on and on. #At these regular sessions there are some great young local players going along like Anna Scott, Dugald McKiggan, Archie and Isobel Maclean and Malin Lewis.#Morrison continued: #Recently over in LorientI saw a great act. It was a Sikh beatboxer, accompanied by step-dancer Sophie Stevenson along with Catherine Tinney from Portree singing puirt-a-beul.#This was another Skye person on the international stage, singing to an incredible standard, but she was someone I#d never heard sing before. #In the past, going somewhere like Lorient,there was a person from Skye on stage you would know exactly who it was # they would be an established name. Now you can go somewhere like that and get a surprise.#It shows the strength in depth there is now.#Some of that west-coast musical talent will be showcased at Skye Live this weekend among a ied line-up that will also include some of the country#s top nightclub DJs.Morrison urged the local community to rally behind the festival weekend, which this year starts with a Thursday-night concert to the Waterboys.He added: #We played at the very first Skye Live five years ago and are looking forward to getting on stage at the Lump in Portree again.#It#s an iconic setting, but organisers have kept the festival to a level that is comfortable for the place.#A capacity of , people is about a fth of the population of Skye and is manageable. When you start to go into the tens of thousands it brings pressures, and it#s a risk to go too big without the infrastructure to support it.#Whenever anyone organises a festival there will always be people who might want to pick holes in it or knock it in some way.#But people need to remember that these guys are putting on a  for so many types of music.#It#s something people of all ages can go to and hear some of the best music in Scotland in Portree.

Launched officially on July , it was a case of getting straight down to business! The volunteers cover quite a large area, including Broughshane, Kells, Ballymena and the surrounding rural local areas.The group has  volunteers, however by August it had responded to  purple and red incidents in support of the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service.This translates into  inidual responses. The group prefers to send more than one responder to each patient in case their needs are beyond the capacity of a single person. Cardiac arrest is a case in point and while only three of patients have been in this specic condition, many more have been suffering from chest pain.Responders grow in experience and expertise, with the group aiming to have an experienced person at each incident to support them. The four committee members have ided this task between them.The more active members are learning fast, particularly through their exposure to NIAS crews and rapid response paramedics, who have been patient and helpful with them.The group held their second monthly members meeting and training event at the end of August and used this to reflect on their experiences, share what they had learned and build vital patient care competence.More members are needed and they are asking people to get in touchthey want to volunteer. Working with the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service and Dalriada Urgent Care, there is a planning and training programme organised for January soyou are interested check the group out on Facebook.The group posted recently: “One thing has become clear in the course of our first month’s activity -we need to recruit and train more responders. “We are working with NIAS on dates for another training course and this will determine our recruitment timetable.”A spokesperson added: “We owe huge thanks to those who made our new service possible.“The people and organisations who contributed so generously to help us meet our funding needs.“The NIAS Community Resuscitation Development Team, who guided us through the complexities of setting up the scheme, trained our members for us and continue to support us.“The Governance team at Dalriada Urgent Care, who supported us in our recruitment efforts and other vital matters such as insurance.“The front line staff of NIAS who have supported and guided us on scene.“And, last but certainly not least, our volunteers, who continue to give the community their time and newly-acquired expertise and to meet their new challenges with great resilience and good humour.“Its a privilege to work with you.”Follow the Braid Valley Community First Responders on Facebook to keep up to date with all their news and to see how you can become involved.

Lea explained to Phil and Holly how she had been spurred on by Gareth’s kindness to carry on the good gesture: “I know it wasn’t absolutely the same circumstances, but I just thought I wanted to do a good gesture for somebody  so I paid off the same amount that he’d paid off our cake onto someone ’s. It carries on the story as well.”Gareth and his we Kirsty, who live between Loughbrickland and Rathfriland on the outskirts of Banbridge, were then introduced.Lea Ni Bhriain on This MorningTheir daughter Hannah Stella Bronte was born prematurely on September ,  weighing just two pounds, five and half ounces.

Bangladesh finally won its freedom from East Pakistan in  after a bloody, -month war of independence which left up to three million dead.Of late the developing country has been in the headlines for providing shelter to , Rohingya who have fled persecution in neighbouring Myanmar.“Coláiste Feirste was honoured to welcome the Bangladeshi delegation,” said Seán Mistéil. “Minister Chowdhuryexplained the importance of mother languages to nation building and economic well-being. That resonated powerfully with our students.”Minister Chowdhury toured the site of the Gaeltacht Quarter’s next development project: a triangle of disused land which represents one of the last building sites fronting the Falls Road.“We have bold plans to transform this triangle of land into a Gaeltacht housing and tourism project,” added the Coláiste Feirste Chairman. “This vibrant and visionary social development initiative will promote the collective economic capacity of the wider Spórtlann na hÉireann and Coláiste Feirste site. We believe that maximising this hub of interdependent and unique elements is best achieved through a one site vision that connects all of its parts. We have this coordinating vision in place and it has enterprise and exchange at its heart. It is infused with environmental and economic promise and includes a wealth of cultural, sporting and human potential.”The visit of the Bangladeshi delegation was hosted by London-based Study Circle and facilitated by the growing Bangladeshi population of Belfast."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"bone man at key palestine hearing","story":"A BONE man is in the Hague this week as an international observer at a historic hearing on the Palestine-Israeli conflict.Eddie Whyte, who has lived in Norway for over thirty years, is also a member of the Palestine Justice Campaign.Eddie attended the International Criminal Court in the Netherlands as the case got underway yesterday .The case has been brought by Dutch citizen Ismail Ziada against the former Chief of General Staff of the Israeli Defence Force , Benny Gantz, and former Commander of the IDF Air Force, Amir Eshel, over the bombing of the Ziada family home in Gaza.The attack in July  killed six family members from three generations of the Ziada family, including Ismail’s -year-old mother, three brothers, his sister-in-law, a -year-old nephew and a visiting friend. Mr Ziada, who is of Palestinian origin, contends that the attack on the family home was a violation of international humanitarian law and constituted a gross violation of internationally recognised human rights principles.Mr Gantz and Mr Eshel claim immunity from the Dutch court and contend that Mr Ziada should have presented his claim in an Israeli court. Mr Gantz is running for office against Benjamin Netanyahu in the Israeli national elections this week.Speaking to the North Belfast News, Eddie said: “The case is historical in that it is the first time a Palestinian has been able to make use of civil litigation on the basis of universal jurisdiction to gain access to justice for war crimes.“The pursuance of the case has been made possible by an online crowdfunder which received widespread support in Ireland from iniduals, trade unions and human rights organisations and prominent people like Senator Frances Black, award-winning filmmaker Seán Murray and musician Mick Blake.

Two of the sculptures from the popular Julia Donaldson-penned Gruffalo tale were completely destroyed after they were set ablaze while others were defaced. Colin Glen Forest Park is home to the unique Trail and has visitors and families from across the city visit daily to see the attraction. Mother-of-two Nicola Marley said that it is “upsetting” for her children when their “favourite character or activity is signicantly damaged or missing” along the Trail.“I participated in a project with the Princes Trust to create a small memorial garden for victims who have lost their lives as a result of mental health issues,” she said. “A lot of hard work and time went into it, many close friends and family of the victims use the garden as a peaceful space to sit and reflect. It is sad that this has now been destroyed too. The park would be a nicer and safer placethe constant vandalism stopped.”Another parent, Janine Belton, spoke of how the Gruffalo Trail “gives the children a wonderful experience and provides them with some learning within nature.” “However, the animal statues have been destroyed, leaving the children confused and sad as they believe that the animals were being ‘hurt’,” she said. Bernadette Devlin, from Colin Sure Start said that vandalism on the Gruffalo Trail was impacting the learning and development of children in the area.“We use that facility a few times a year to bring parents and our children from nought to four age range,” she said.“It promotes the kids’ speech and language, it promotes their social interaction, it helps them learn about their environment and, most of all, it allows them to have fun. It’s local and it’s free of charge, but they are unable to enjoy it as much because of the vandalism of the statues on the Gruffalo Trail. It’s a health and safety issue too because the children like to get their photos taken with the statues, but obviously they can’t do that now. There is one near the entrance and you wouldn’t even be able to identy what it is now.“We just want to make people aware of the impact it’s having on the families who are living in the community.“It’s resource that we’ve had many an enjoyable outing to, and we would like to continue to do that. It has so many benefits for community, butthis vandalism continues we’ll no be able to use it. The safety of the children is paramount to us. We would be very wary of bringing families there because of the vandalism.”Sinn Féin Councillor Séanna Walsh described those behind the destruction as “a handful of disgruntled vandals who are attacking their own community”.“Colin Glen Forest Park is a major asset for this area, the community, council and departments are investing heavily into it and we are looking at a £ million investment package for it,” he said. “The Glider has really opened up the opportunity for people and families to access the park and we have a handful of youngsters who are turning up to try and vandalise it.“The park is set to launch its latest attraction, the toboggan, soon and planning applications are in for zip lines and mountain bike trails.

Apparently, Belgium are the top-rated team in world football, ahead of Brazil and the actual world champions France writes our rugby tipster Paddy Tierney.In golf, Englishman Justin Rose moved to world number one ahead of the US Masters despite his one and only major victory coming at the  US Open. With the Rugby World Cup taking centre stage over the coming weeks, it is worth pointing out that Ireland are back to being the top-rated team in the world. That’s Ireland, who are rated as   shots to lt the Webb Ellis Trophy.That’s Ireland who were obliterated - in last month’s warm-up game at Twickenham.It seems back-to-back wins over Wales at Cardf and then Dublin were enough to promote Joe Schmidt’s side back to number one. Yet, Ireland have a painful history at the Rugby World Cup and have failed to make it past the quarter-final stage in eight previous attempts. In , they topped Pool D, but were humbled - by a ravenous Argentina side in the quarters. Their pain was only lessened by the fact that hosts England failed to make it out of Pool A behind Australia and Wales. However, the  winners look a dferent proposition four years on and Eddie Jones’ side are a real threat. They are   to top a Pool C group containing France and Argentina and look set to take on either Wales or Australia, who should finish first and second in Pool D, in the quarters. Pool B looks a shoot-out between world champions New Zealand and South Africa, while Ireland’s opening game against Scotland on Sunday could well determine who tops Pool A. Hosts Japan might have something to say about that and neither side will take them for granted after they caused one of the biggest upsets in the history of the competition by beating South Africa in their opening game of the  World Cup when managed by the aforementioned Jones. Either way, Ireland will face an almighty challenge to better their horrendous World Cup record as they will face either New Zealand or South Africa in the last eight.I think both Ireland and the All Blacks will top their group meaning it will be Scotland versus New Zealand and Ireland against South Africa. While Ireland have proven that they can beat any team in the world on their day, I can’t help but feel like the World Cup arrives  months too late for Schmidt’s men, who seem to thrive when they are written off. The decision to leave Devin Toner at home has ided opinion, while captain Rory Best is now  and will retire after the World Cup. Fitness doubts continue to linger about Johnny Sextonand Keith Earls, while Robbie Henshaw has been ruled out of the Scotland game with a hamstring injury and Ireland look destined for another quarter-final exit with most firms going   on that outcome. Elsewhere, I like the look of Wales at   to top Pool D and I think they’ll end up playing France in the quarter-final. If my predictions are correct, that would leave Warren Gatland’s side taking on South Africa in the last four. Wales are one of the few teams who should match the brute force of the Springboks and I wouldn’t be surprised to see them reaching the decider.That being said, almost every betting preview I’ve read has tipped South Africa as the winner and as much as I hate hopping on the bandwagon, they looked to have assembled one hell of a squad. The other semi-final could be the game of the tournament with world champions New Zealand looking like they are on a collision course with England. Australia could throw a spanner in the works in the quarter-finals, but I’ve a gut feeling fear that England will go very close. Final Prediction Thankfully, their outright odds are   are far too skinny for me to consider the unthinkable, but they may well reach the decider with an England versus South Africa final priced at a tasty-looking  . Back in , the same countries contested the decider in France with South Africa winning - in a cagey affair at the Stade De France and I fancy a repeat of that result at the ,-capacity International Stadium in Yokohama.A certain Bryan Habana was the star of the World Cup  years ago, scoring eight tries and Cheslin Kolbe could be worth a wager in the top-tryscorer market at  . The -year-old winger scored two tries at the weekend as Rassie Erasmus’s side defeated hosts Japan in their final warm-up game -. When you consider that Ireland’s Jacob Stockdale is as low as  , Kolbe looks outstanding value while George North could also be worth an each-way punt at  . The Kolbe South Africa double is also available at  , while those looking a patriotic punt could do worse than back Iain Hendersonto score the first try for Ireland in Sunday’s opening game against Scotland with the Ulster ace available at  ."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"meabh set to sing the anthem at croke park","story":"AN Under- Lámh Dhearg footballer will perform Amhrán na bhFiann in front of thousands of GAA fans on Sunday ahead of the Dublin -Galway All-Ireland Senior Ladies Football Final. -year-old Méabh McNeill told Daily Belfast that she is “super excited” to be singing in front of up , fans at Croke Park ahead of the finale to the ladies football season. “When I was seven myself and my brother went to Scéim Samhraidh at our club, Lámh Dhearg,” she said. “One of the events was learning and singing the national anthem. Two of the leaders at the time Orla Nic Shíomóin and Orla Nig Fhearraigh thought I could sing and had a lovely voice. They approached my dad and askedit was okay for me to sing in the Scór na nÓg. I’ve been singing every year since.”Méabh spoke of how the club’s Cultural Officer, Ronan McHugh “asked me to come back last year to teach the kids how to sing the anthem”. “That is the thing about our club, the kids that attend the summer schemes, and there are now three running, end up coaching younger kids coming through which is fantastic,especially the U- girls.”“I then started singing the national anthem at club events such as juvenile and senior dinners. “Antrim Cultural Officer Bronagh Lennon asked my dadI could sing at some championship games and then onto County Antrim league games. Bronagh has been a great influence and mentor, not only to me but to other kids in the county with her encouragement.”Méabh’s extremely proud dad Joe said all the family will be travelling down to Dublin to support her on Sunday.“There is a big festival on at the club on Sunday and the game will be on in the club after that. We are just so proud.”The Blessed Trinity College student has always had a passion for the performing arts and has performed lead roles in New Lodge Arts High School Musical and Belfast Musical Drama Society’s Hairspray. Following her momentous pitch debut at the Jones’ Road stadium on Sunday, Méabh will be straight into rehearsals for her school’s production of Beauty and the Beast of which she will perform the role of Belle. “I sang the national anthem in front of the Artane Band at Clones, that was a huge honour and an amazing day so imagine what it was like when my dad broke the news to me that I had been invited to sing our national anthem in Croke Park in front of an estimated , people. I’m just so excited.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"one womans journey of discovery on lyric stage","story":"HOUSE lights dim, stage lights up and our scene is set. Gingham tablecloth, matching curtains, egg and chips on the hob and Tara Lynne O’Neill’s Shirley Valentine invites us into her kitchen.Willy Russell’s iconic play, later a film, has been relocated from s Liverpool to Belfast in this winning new production by Patrick J O’Reilly – the artistic director of Tinderbox Theatre Company.Shirley keeps telling us that she is “ years old”, which doesn’t seem that old at all but the character, at this stage in her le, is already done. She and her husband Joe have grown apart, both wounded by their marriage. Shirley is there to peel the spuds, put dinner on the table and tend to the grown-up children, Millandra and Brian, asthey are still toddlers. Shirley talks to the wall as there is no-one  to talk to.Her friend Jane has bought her a ticket for two weeks in Greece and the first act is the will she won’t she build-up to getting there.Shirley tells us how she wanted to be a “courier or air hostess” but was discouraged by less-than-patient teachers at school – “Only the clever ones get to do that.”Shirley Valentine has “disappeared,” we are told, worn down by routine and repetition and now “frightened of le beyond the walls.”By the time the interval came the audience was rooting for Shirley as she gets ready for her two weeks in Corfu.In Act Two, gone is the mousy dress, apron and sensible shoes of the first half and in its place is a striking Shirley: colourful bathing suit, tanned skin, feet encased in bright pink shoes. We learn that Shirley’s friend Jane abandoned her for four days ”to shack up with a man she met on the plane. “I was alone but it was lovely” – Shirley took her table down to the beach most nights to watch the sunset and sip her wine.Shirley Valentine is a timeless story – a woman stuck within four walls who needs to break out and break free. Tara Lynne triumphantly portrays a woman who was a prisoner in her own kitchen but learns that there is “le beyond the walls” and drags us along with her, cheering in her wake.As the lights dim, she’s on the beach and waiting for Joe – who she believes probably won’t recognise her – to come and talk at the crossroads they have found themselves at.In a poignant touch, there was a standing ovation for actor and “hugely talented” assistant director of the production Julie Maxwellwho tragically passed away last month.Shirley Valentine runs at the Lyric Theatre until October .

He attended Holy Cross Boys Primary School in the district and is also a past pupil of the old St Gabriel’s school.Leaving school at , Thomas admits that the academic world was not for him and he left home soon after to work in England.“School just wasn’t for me,” he explained.“I wasn’t academic but always fascinated by art and photos in newspapers and magazines such as The Observer and Sunday Times magazines.“I left home at  and went to England. There wasn’t much work here at the time and I just wanted to get away from Belfast with all the conflict going on.“I saw so much trouble and bloodshed on the streets. My community was under siege.“You couldn’t get in or out of Ardoyne without getting checked by British Army or RUC.“I was away for a year and worked in construction on building sites in London. I decided to come back because to be honest, I missed the place.“I didn’t really like London at all. It was far too quiet compared to back home.”Thomas ed to Belfast and turned his attention back to one of his hobbies and interests he had from a young age – photography.“I wanted to pursue a career in photography,” he added.“I went to night school where I learnt the basics but I wanted a job so I could work for the community using photography.“I managed to get an interview with the founder of Andersonstown News in West Belfast, Basil McLaughlin and Máirtín Ó Muilleoir who told me they were starting a new newspaper for North Belfast.“I was familiar with the Andersonstown News and liked the fact that they provided a voice for the community in West Belfast during the Troubles.“My interview was  years ago and I haven’t looked back since.”In  years, Thomas has established himself as a well-known and talented photographer and there wouldn’t be many in North Belfast who haven’t recognised him out and about doing the job he loves.Still, much has changed over the years in North Belfast and in photography.“North Belfast has changed in some ways but many issues remain today like housing and the unfair points system.“Community relations have improved with integrated education but even today, there are still sectarian attacks and peace walls remain up iding communities.“There are still people out there fighting for peace.“As for photography, I started off developing my own black and white images before it moved on to the digital age which takes up a lot less time and I can produce more photos.”Thomas has enjoyed many successes over the years and in , showcased  years of his work in the local media at an exhibition for Féile an Phobail.Back in May of this year, he scooped four awards at the Northern Ireland Press Photographers Awards, including first place in the Inidual Study and Sports Action categories along with a Provincial Merit Award. He has been recognised multiple times over the years in the awards.“It is great to be recognised for the daily work that I do. It is great for the North Belfast News and Belfast Media Group to show we put our best efforts into the product.“It was a proud moment for me and the paper.”Away from his daily working le, Thomas may also be seen on his motorcycle on the road and he also enjoys music. Thomas is also a busy grandad to two grandchildren and has three children – two daughters and a son.Asked for any advice for any budding photographers out there, Thomas would encourage them to join a camera club – the long-running CB Camera Club on the Antrim Road who meet every Thursday night at pm.As for the future, Thomas concluded, “I am content with the job I do now – representing people in the local community.“I am proud of where I am from. I want to see all young people succeed in what they are doing.”"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38499162.ece/85800/BINARY/Proms_in_the_Park043.jpg","title":"bbc ni defends absence of god save the queen from belfast proms playlist","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

His report, published on  January , raises challenging, long-term, strategic and cross-cutting questions with major financial implications.Amongst other issues, it recommends expanding medical training places by at least  per year, potentially costing up to an additional £m per year when fully implemented. This report is a key consideration of UU in putting forward its proposal for a medical school in Derry.While DoH has been assisting UU in the development of its Outline Business Casefor a Graduate Entry Medical School at Magee Campus, this is separate from any decision on medical student expansion in Northern Ireland. Feedback was provided on  July  to the fourth iteration of the OBC.Any commissioning of additional medical places for Northern Ireland must address comprehensively the full range of available options, with a particular focus on the assessment of value for money and affordability for health and social care, the report says.“For example, rather than simply expanding medical student numbers, it will be important to explore lower-cost measures likely to increase the supply of medics over the short-term and which enhance and maximise the signicant investment currently being made in undergraduate medical education.“DoH is developing a business case to consider these matters.

Alongside that are centres of innovation and excellence in data analyticsand robotics and automationand a Personalised Medicine Centre of Excellence .Julian Smiths report says the proposals to expand Magee had signicant funding consequences from a capital infrastructure perspective, approximately £m, and from a resource funding perspective.The proposal would require Higher Education in NI to be placed on a sustainable footing, comparable with England, from which expansion would take place.According to the report, there would also be, as with any requested expansion or increase to student numbers, resource grant consequences of funding the proposed additional places at UU and NWRC, and associated student support costs, circa £m.\"The £m capital cost was highly indicative and based on an assumed cost per square metre per student.\"The Department for the Economyundertook initial work to determine how it would look at the case,there was an agreement on how the sector as a whole could be sustainably funded, as any expansion in student numbers would not make sense without this in place,\" it said.In February , DfE wrote to, and is awaiting a response from, UU requesting that an update be made to the case, according to the report.DfE asked for a more accurate assessment of capital need, which was \"very theoretical\" in the original proposal and created a signicant cost requirement. It wants a review of the number and subject level mix of additional students required to ensure an underpinning alignment with graduate postgraduate economic need in subject areas proposed.Furthermore, the department requested information around phasing of the project to assessthere are \"more suitable break points\" in the proposal and a potential to scale any expansion both in terms of student numbers and capital development.And sought the \"rationale\" for locating additional higher education places in the Magee Campus, as opposed to other geographical locations with further and more detailed explanation in relation to sub-regional economic benefits.This information will be critical to enabling a strategic approach to HE provision and in feeding into any final

Also integral to the City Deal remains our commitment to establishing a Graduate Entry Medical School in a bid to address the challenges of a healthcare system at breaking point.   City Deal recognises the crucial role our University can play as an economic engine in the North West and is a major boost to the collective ambitions of the city and region.  We look forward to the development of our projects in partnership with industry, civic and educational partners.\"How much money will be needed in total to fund the projects put forward as part of the City Deal A spokesperson for Ulster University commented: \"The funding contributions by project across City Deal and the Inclusive Futures Funds are indicative at this stage, based on the allocations provided by Council, and subject to adjustment as we go forward.  Our contribution of % University funding to the Magee projects within City Deal reflects our belief in the impact they will make, and our commitment to playing our part in the collective ambitions of City Deal.“City Deal enables us to build further on our academic strengths that are signicant for the region’s growth, and to make sure that this expertise across world class research and progressive student learning works hard for the benefit of all in the city region. The City Deal bid has education, innovation, job creation and skills development at its core and each of these priorities are also central to our work across both teaching and research.  We are therefore a natural fit and a committed partner in this ambitious bid.  A continued collaborative approach is essential as we prepare to take forward the projects through planning and design and development of the business cases.”"},{"url":null,"title":"food festival leaves newtown smiling","story":"Saxophone Sundae entertains festival goers at this years Newtown Food Festival. ltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtPicture: Rob Davieslt spangtlt spangt\" Food festival leaves town smilingThree cyclist from Hafren Cycle Club who wil be competing in the Chrono des Natiltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtons in Les Herbiers ltspan classtruncate-full-screengtVendeacutee meet members from the twining association at this years Newtown Food Festival.

In the fth minute a free was given away by the lsquoFin defence and Cormac Venney slotted over from the m line.In the sixth minute a superb full-pitch move from the lsquoFin was finished by Breannain McComiskey, restoring the two-point lead.A minute later Garland was clinical when he drove to the net to put the lsquoFin firmly in the driving seat. Shea Croskery raced through moments later and drove for goal, but saw his effort go wide and Dundrumrsquos relief was palpable.Instead of going eight points behind, Dundrum did well to re-group and points from Aidan Fegan and a second Venney free cut the deficit back to three points.Oran Flanagan sent over the next three points in the second quarter of the game with Glavin doing the same for Dundrum. Garland and Croskery also raised the white flag with their strikes to leave the lsquoFin with a half-time lead of - to -.Fegan got the first point of the second half for Dundrum with three minutes gone and a third free kick of the game was landed by Venney by the end of the third quarter.While the lsquoFin had not yet scored, it wasnrsquot for the want of trying as a few opportunities were missed and Dundrum lsquokeeper Eamon King pulled off a superb double save, the first from Croskery and the follow up from Chris Doran.Oran Flanagan was having a good game and he sent over his fourth point of the match and a superb effort from Shane McCann restored the lsquoFinrsquos four point half-time advantage with ten minutes remaining.Dundrum continued to threaten, but other than two more excellent points from their standout player Kyle Glavin, the lsquoFin defence held strong and kept the dangerous duo of Venney and Fegan scoreless the remainder of the game.Dundrum half forward Fegan was sent to the line after getting a second yellow in the final throes of the game.

The upgrading of the pitch is certainly sustainable financially, given the amount of usage it would get.ldquoWe have lost  teams to other leagues in the past few years and they have all cited poor facilities as their main reason for moving to play in the the Lisburn or South Belfast Leagues, he added.Mr Torney said it was essential that proper facilities were put in place to enable the league to avoid weekly postponements of games.ldquoWe are left every year with a fixture congestion because of postponements and in order to arrest the haemorrhaging of clubs from the league we must address this issue immediately.The league are being supported by South Down MP Chris Hazzard, who has called on Newry, Mourne and Down Council to ldquofinally deliver fit for purpose pitches for the local community in Downpatrick.He continued: ldquoThe current provision of sports pitches at Dunleath Park is nothing short of a disgrace.ldquoDunleath Park is used extensively by the Downpatrick Youth Football League with hundreds of young footballers playing each weekend, but yet againthis week, parts of the pitches have been closed to the public as raw sewage has come to the surface.ldquoIt is an absolute shame that in the shadow of our fantastic new leisure centre here in Downpatrick our local young people are expected to make do with substandard pitches that not only flood for most of the winter months, but are regularly polluted with raw sewage.Mr Hazzard believes that Downpatrick deserves much better treatment.ldquoAs the county town, Downpatrick deserves to have the very best in local sports provision, and that simply isnrsquot the case at the moment.ldquoIt is deeply disappointing that so many of our young footballers are left to travel to Lisburn and Belfast each weekend to play football. That must not be allowed to continue.Mr Hazzard added: ldquoWhilst there is no getting away from the fact that Dunleath Park is in a flood plain area, I would have sympathy with local sports clubs that feel that this is too easily put up as a hurdle to any investment, and that the council should actively consider a range of solutions in order to deliver suitable facilities.ldquoI want to thank those local sports clubs and Downpatrick Youth League representatives who continue to work tirelessly in order to provide local sporting opportunities for our young people and I will now be making representation to senior council management in order to make all their voices heard..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th September 2019 Castlewellan.jpg","title":"Castlewellan forest cycle in the park family event in aid of Knockevin Special School  ","story":"ALL roads lead to Castlewellan Forest Park this Sunday for a special event to raise money for Knockevin Special School in Downpatrick and celebrate the benefits of cycling for everyone.The lsquocycle in the parkrsquo event is being organised by the schoolrsquos Parent Staff Association to raise funds to help purchase new bikes for pupils to help them experience nature and the great outdoors.Sundayrsquos all ability event mdash which runs from am until pm ndash is being billed as a celebration of cycling and will have something for families and special needs adventurers, hard core mountain bikers, club riders, children and young people.The event is being hosted by the Kilmegan Velo Cycling Club with its chairman, Sean Warnock, inviting all cyclists to make their way to the forest park for the event.He said: ldquoThe aim is to get families and friends to experience cycling in a safe setting but full of adventure and we have events for all abilities.ldquoThere will be family trail quests, agility skills for kids, a full time-trial on the red trails, special needs bikes and a Sunday club fuel stop.

For others feeling a bit more confident, a lakeside cycle might appeal with volunteers on hand to help.Velo Club member, Michael Donnelly, is encouraging those into their mountain biking to put their name down for the Red Trail time trial. He said Kilmegan VC volunteers will clock the riders with a pound McConvey Cycles voucher up for grabs.Michael said the Kilmegan Clubrsquos junior section is running an agility course sohills and thrills arenrsquot necessarily for peoplersquos cup of tea, they might want to practice a few skills and warm up on the agility course ahead of the agility obstacle course.

Title deeds, usually the easiest of documents to trace, have become impossible to track down.Three people are laying claim to the pier alone and a legal row is pending about whether a contract was broken over the sale of pier some time ago.Against this backcloth, Down council official have been trying to bring the harbour into public ownership since the publication of the Governmentrsquos cash-help promise in July . Before then they had already spent four years attempting to trace owners.This week councillors decided to end their six-year search and apply for vesting mdash a statutory power which enables a Government department to buy land compulsorily, despite the wishes of the owner.But they were warned by council administrative officer, Mr Owen OrsquoConnor, that it would be a dficult vesting order and he could not guarantee that the whole of the inner bay of Killough would be acquired before December.The last-ditch attempt to beat the deadline was sparked off by Downpatrick councillor, Mr John Ritchie, who has been trying to push the council into buying the harbour since . On Monday he was clearly angry that time was running out.POLITICS mdash A suggestion that South Down MP, Enoch Powell, should accompany a Down council deputation to Stormont was kicked out by SDLP councillors this week.The suggestion was surprisingly made by industry minister, Mr Giles Shaw, who has agreed to meet a council deputation to discuss industrial affairs in Down district.In a letter to councillors, Mr Shaw suggested that Mr Powell should be advised of the meeting and,convenient, should accompany the council delegation.SDLP councillor, Mr Eddie McGrady, described the ministerrsquos decision as ldquoodd and said he had never come across anything like it before in his  years in government affairs.He thought the minister was ldquousurping the councilrsquos decision to form its own deputation and he believed the motive behind the suggestion was not altogether altruistic.He told councillors: ldquoWhat is happening is that a new precedent is being proposed to us. A corporate body has almost been directed to include a political representative on its deputation. This will create tensions which this council and district can do without.Mr Sean Quinnthought it was ldquorather arrogant of the minister to make the suggestion and he believed that Mr Powell was like previous South Down MPs, who, he said, had not satisfactorily served the constituency.Official Unionist councillor, Mrs Ethel Smyth, said she would resent it as much as anybodyshe felt the councilrsquos powers were being usurped, but on this occasion she thought it was only natural that Mr Powell should join the deputation.She told councillors: ldquoMr Powell has worked consistently very hard for all sections of the community and nobody could accuse him of working for one party or another. He is one of the best constituency MPs at Westminster.A motion by Mrs Smyth to invite Mr Powell on the deputation was defeated by nine votes to seven mdash a defeat which did not go down well with Official Unionist, Mr William Finlay, who told the SDLP members: ldquoThat was just a political vote. You are not worried whether people in the district get a job or not.BALLYNAHINCH mdash The streets of Ballynahinch will have Christmas lighting this year mdash at leastthe townrsquos Chamber of Commerce have their way.At a well attended meeting of the Chamber on Tuesday evening, it was unanimously agreed to purchase the lights in an effort to brighten the townrsquos main thoroughfare for the festive season.Whether they are erected and illuminated, stress the Chamber, now depends entirely on the business community and townspeople of Ballynahinch.This step forward was made possible by support from a number of traders in the town and the exhaustion of the chamberrsquos present funds.The Ballynahinch committee feel that what other towns in the locality have achieved they can emulated.CASTLEWELLAN mdash Councillor Mr Eamon OrsquoNeill said this week he is still hopeful that some industry can be attracted to the vacant factories at Castlewellan and Annsborough.Mr OrsquoNeill, who has been fighting for Government intervention since the factories closed last month, revealed that efforts have been made to attract new industries.He told a meeting of Down councillors that although nothing had yet happened, he believed that the efforts to attract new industries had been lsquoconscientiousrsquo.ldquoIt is a lamentable situation with two factories lying idle but I still remain hopeful that something will come out of it, said Mr OrsquoNeill.MOURNES mdash A planned motor cycle competition on the slopes of Slieve Donard in Newcastle has been turned down by local councillors.Councillors agreed on Monday that the event would encourage the improper use of the Mourne Mountains because it was planned in an area of outstanding natural beauty.ldquoEvents such as this should be discouraged to preserve the amenities of the area, said a council spokesman.The event, called lsquoEndeavour Motor Cyclersquo, was to have been staged by the Mourne Motor Cycle Club.DOWNPATRICK mdash Army bomb experts carried out a controlled explosion on an explosive device which had been placed on a windowsill of the Northern Bank at the junction of St Patrickrsquos Avenue and Market Street, Downpatrick, on Thursday evening.Police received a call at .pm stating that there was a suspect device at the premises and the bomb experts were called in.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We learn about the Romans, World War Two, the American Civil War at school, but most people have never been taught about the history of their own country.ldquoWe have more castles than any other country in the world per square mile, and thatrsquos something worth celebrating.Fonmon Castle is a rarity among Welsh castles, uniquely well-suited to creating interactive events like jousting, workshops, Renaissance and Steampunk fairs, and many more.ldquoFonmon Castle is one of the few Welsh castles that is still lived in, explained Mr OrsquoHenessey. ldquoIt has remained within two families since it was built by the Marcher Lords during the Norman invasion.ldquoIt recently it was sold to a very friendly couple and they headhunted me in order to help them turn the castle around, to open it up to the public and help teach people more about Welsh history.ldquoTheyrsquove basically provided me a blank cheque. I want people to wake up in the mornings, and wonder lsquowhat shall we do today at Fonmon Castle rsquoThe first of these events, on Wednesday, August , will feature medieval re-enactments, living history displays, medieval combat lessons, have-a-go archery, childrenrsquos play areas and dino walks - and will be free.ldquoWe have so much history to offer as a country, said Mr OrsquoHenessey. ldquoI want to really start to show it off.To find out more, email info@fonmoncastle article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We want to turn them into respectful iniduals with good values and an understanding of issues across the whole spectrum le has to offer.The school encourages pupils to voice their ideas, and shape their own education to a degree. They are asked what additions and activities they would like around the school, push for pupil engagement with a range of le experiences, and emphasis the development of their social skills to help them interact with others in dferent settings.The idea works well in practice. The students are friendly, confident, and respectful to the teachers. They smile, wave and say hello to the teachers in the corridors.ldquoThis is my eleventh year here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoI feel privileged to work in Fairfield. Itrsquos a school with a wonderful ethos and atmosphere, and skilled staff who know the children well, ensuring theyrsquore getting the best possible.ldquoThe children really exude enjoyment and enthusiasm for their learning.One classroom was filled with children learning their times-tables by singing and dancing, grins from ear to ear. In the schoolrsquos on-site nursery, youngsters concentrate on their basic arithmetic, rolling modelling clay into a single sunflower, or a pair of bananas.The nursery is the most recent addition to the school, having been opened in January of last year. Itrsquos the sort of place you can hear long before you see, as smiling toddlers enjoyed their break time.The nurseryrsquos addition to the school site would allow for an improved transition for pupils from nursery to reception.ldquoChildren benefit from being challenged with their learning at an earlier stage, explained Ms Lewis. ldquoWe want to make them feel safe and comfortable at the school, and make it as easy as possible to move up to reception.ldquoWe also give our older pupils a chance to experience both Stanwell and St Cyres secondaries around here to give them a smooth move into secondary education.Therersquos plenty on offer at the school, as well.Opportunities for extracurricular activities is vast, with local community groups using the hall throughout the week, for gym, dance fitness, karate, football and music tech.The introduction of a lsquoMid-week Muddle-Uprsquo allows pupils to work across age groups on half-termly projects, which use staff expertise in particular areas for a project that they collectively work on such as working on the environment in their own conservation area, or lsquoPizza Mathsrsquo combining elements of maths and fractions with cookery.Pupil groups cover School Council, Sports Council, Creative Committee, Sgwad Cymraeg, Eco-Committee, Team Captains, Digital Leaders, while other groups focus on global issues and the impact of their actions internationally.Jake Kidby, Ahmed Maher and Georgia Tomalin-Reeves are on the school council.Though each had a dferent focus for their enjoyment of the school site, they all agreed they were very happy at Fairfield.Jake said: ldquoI absolutely love my football and therersquos loads of chances to play that here. The new gym trail outside is great too.Ahmed said: ldquoI prefer maths and challenges. We thought school council would be a fun responsibility to look after the school, help people and share ideas.Georgia said: ldquo As part of school council we decided to build a lsquorelaxation stationrsquo for anyone who feels down. They can bring paper and pens and books. Itrsquos just a wooden den. But wersquore putting in shelves, posters. And therersquos lot of free space to run around front and back.The school has been lauded for its environmental efforts, securing a Bronze Welsh Charter Award last term, and earning a Platinum Flag for their approach to ecological and sustainability issues.Pupils Isaac Eley and Sophie Wilford were at the schoolrsquos conservation area.They explained to me that the area was first started around  years ago, but they had begun pushing for more lessons to be held outdoors.They hope to add tables, chairs and more outdoor classroom equipment, so they can take lessons in the open air.ldquoThe staff go above and beyond here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoWith increased pressure on funding for schools staff, governors and parents have to really put  per cent effort in.ldquoThe PTA has raised an incredible amount for us over the years and have done wonders for our IT departments.ldquoParents have helped out in raising money for the new gym trail.ldquoOne father built our relaxation station shed by himself, and the stage on the playground for singing and dancing was also built with parentrsquos help.ldquoThey ensure we can continue and we can be excellent for all the childrenrsquos learning.ldquoAttainment is high and all pupils make good progress specic to them, and this achievement is something of which we are extremely proud.Therersquos an underlying feeling of positivity in Fairfield, off the beaten path but quietly proud and it seems thoroughly well-earned. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The focus will be on making sure we get there properly.Once in the river, the pound. billion aircraft carrier will anchor for three to five days before waiting for a low tide to pass under the Firthrsquos famous bridges.To do so, the mast pole on top of one of the islands, which operates on a hydraulic system, will be lowered so the ship can pass under the bridges and head towards the North Sea.Captain Houston said there was a ldquoreal air of excitement among the  shiprsquos company and  contractors, adding he was proud of the work they have done to get the vessel ready for sea trials which will test areas including the engines and radar systems.Having previously served as second in command on board HMS Queen Elizabeth, he said he saw exactly what happened during her sea trials and knows how this aircraft carrier will react.With a mixture of new Royal Navy sailors and old hands making up the crew, Captain Houston said for him there is a ldquosense of pride and a real privilege to be the first captain to take the ship to sea.With HMS Prince of Wales setting sail, it will see both of the UKrsquos biggest and most powerful warships at sea together for the first time.Rear Admiral Martin Connell, assistant chief of naval staff aviation and carrier strike, said: ldquoI was the commanding officer of HMS Illustrious ndash our former aircraft carrier ndash andsomeone had told me at the beginning of this decade we would have two brand new aircraft carriers at sea by the end of the decade, I wouldnrsquot have believed them.ldquoIn a matter of days, perhaps weeks, we are going to have HMS Queen Elizabeth on the western Atlantic operating F-s stealth fighter jets, as well as HMS Prince of Wales around the UK doing contractor sea trials.ldquoThat is a remarkable feat in terms of the project.ldquoBut, also what it gives us is the ability and the confidence to think we will have a continuous carrier capability for decades.During their -year service, the two aircraft carriers can be pressed into action for ious work such as high intensity war fighting or providing humanitarian aid and disaster relief.They have been built by the Aircraft Carrier Alliancendash a partnership of BAE Systems, Babcock, Thales and the Ministry of Defence.Overall, six shipyards around the UK ndash Appledore, Birkenhead, Govan, Portsmouth, Rosyth and Tyne ndash have been involved in building ious parts of the carriers.Minister for defence procurement Anne-Marie Trevelyan, who toured the ship ahead of the departure, said it is ldquofantastic that we have got our carrier strike capability back.ldquoThese are Formula One ships ndash extraordinary beasts delivering both global power projection and indeed the ability to deliver hard powerwe need to against our enemies, she added.HMS Prince of Wales is expected to head into her home base of Portsmouth once sea trials have been completed, and will commission into the Royal Navy at the end of the year..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Britain us newest aircraft carrier squeezes out of dockyard for maiden voyage article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--Promoted Stories       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

is encouraging schools here to take advantage of beneficial dog safety and responsible dog ownership lessons for their students. Their free dog welfare workshops, delivered as part of the Charity’s ‘Be Dog Smart’ campaign, enhance the National Curriculum and seek to provide children between the ages of seven and  years with the knowledge and understanding they need to act responsibly and safely around dogs in their homes and those they may see out and about.Each workshop benefits pupils by involving a pretend dog as its focus, with the aim of developing compassion and consideration for all living beings.Not only do children - whether dog owners or not - learn how to behave safely around dogs, they also learn all about the commitment involved in owning a dog through a creative and interactive learning experience.Last year, Cathy Clyde, Dogs Trust’s NI Education and Community Officer delivered workshops to , children. This year they are on track to improve on this number yet again. With the growing success of the ‘Be Dog Smart’ campaign, Dogs Trust now employs  education and community officers across the UK to provide workshops in their designated regions.Cathy said: “Through debate and discussion, our responsible dog ownership workshops encourage learners to embody important values around dog ownership such choosing the right breed or type of dog for your le style, as well as understanding that dogs are a lelong commitment and not a disposable commodity. I would welcome the opportunity to work with schools in the area and encourage them to get in touch, as pupils really do get a lot out of the workshops as do their dogs.”For more information about ‘Be Dog Smart’ visit www.bedogsmart.org.ukFor more information or to book a ‘Be Dog Smart’ workshop, contact Cathy Clyde on    or email cathy.clyde@dogstrust.org.ukFuneral details for Francis McCarville

Several motorists were warned about their speed but the sad thing was that two motorists received Fixed Penalty Notices for speeding.“On top of this one motorist obviously didn’t see us driving behind him when he decided to lt his mobile and start chatting to a friend instead of concentrating on the road. As a result this motorist also received a Fixed Penalty Notice for his misjudged action.“I would prefer to inform you that we had a successful day and caught nobody as it truly saddens me to issue these fixed penalty notices but some people just will not learn.“What I also noticed today was that not one person waved to us. That also saddened me as we are only out trying to keep everybody safe, so when you see us out and about please wave at us as it makes our day go in that bit quicker.”These are the  most popular

We speak to founder Daniel Crawford and his team about the journey so far A spark in the mind of Daniel Crawford as he studied for his masters degree in Glasgow just a few years ago has grown into a business at the sharp end of technology. axialD is tasked with turning the complicated and laborious process of converting D medical scans into D models – and producing them for use by surgeons and medical professionals. It’s an ever-growing business, spun out of Ulster University, which is expanding its reach across the UK, Ireland and now into the US where it’s targeting a burgeoning fresh marketplace. The company has been involved with Catalyst since , been directly involved with a host of its programmes, and is participating in the EU INTERREG funded North West Centre for Advanced Manufacturing , managed by the Special European Union Programmes Body . Catalyst is Northern Ireland’s leading technology hub, home to  companies and around , staff. Daniel has a strong team around him – growing to  staff based in Belfast city centre, including Niall Haslam, chief technology officer, Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships and Cathy Coomber as operations manager. While studying medical visualisation and human anatomy in Glasgow, Daniel was exposed to the raft of imaging available – including CT, MRI and ultrasound, and began examining how the crucial data could be better used. The biomedical physics undergraduate grew the idea into his thesis – looking at converting D data sets and converting them into fully D printable files. “That allows us to turn images into D models to allow surgeons or registrars, to understand digital pathologies, before going in to theatre,” he said. “But we discovered it wasn’t just good for that and surgeons also wanted to get their hands on the D models.” That gave Daniel greater scope for developing the concept. In one early case, a surgeon was able to use one of the D prints to identy small fractures in a patient who had suffered a motorcycle crash, that weren’t initially apparent using more traditional methods. The company was thrust into Catalyst’s Springboard programme in  – a  week scheme which allowed a would-be entrepreneur, fresh out of university, access to business training and development, which included working with PathXL’s Stuart Harvey. From there, it was into the Halo programme – bringing axialD together with angel investors in order to get the start-up off the ground. It landed £, through Techstart and private investors, which allowed the company to get the ball rolling. Through Catalyst, Daniel also got the opportunity to visit MIT and the entrepreneurial development programme, Way to Scale, bringing axialD to Massachusetts and the Boston area – the global heart of the health technology sector. Niall Haslam is axialD’s chief technical officer. He said a Belfast and Boston partnership has helped strengthen the links between the cities, bringing firms from Northern Ireland to the US for both networking and scoping out the potential for setting up shop across the Atlantic. “The Way to Scale program brings entrepreneurs together. It’s a great networking opportunity,” Niall says. axialD is now a partner in the EU INTERREG-funded NW CAM, which brings together a network of research institutes, universities and enterprises to carry out research in advanced manufacturing. It is working with Ulster University on a number of projects, including looking at developing custom designed jigs for hospitals to produce D models. Cathy Coomber has been with axialD for three years. “What we have done in that time is looking at standardising the processes,” she says. “Biomedical engineers from Ulster University and those across the UK are producing data, manually segmenting thousands of medical images in order to help them develop an algorithm. “That allows us to massively improve our standardised process and reduce the time involved in producing those files.” That could mean reducing the time down from up to five hours, to as little as an hour. “When the company started, Daniel was able to get those early users excited in Glasgow, and then setting up in Belfast there were key surgeons which helped set the pace,” Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships said. The company has since been involved with NHS frameworks as a means to help remove as many bottlenecks as possible. This involves developing and marketing the products to the NHS and HSC in the Republic – helping them to learn about the product, the process and what area of specialism it can be used in. “In the last  months with the development of the algorithms, we are moving in to the US,” Katie said. “We’re seeing a lot of growth in the US.” And the axialD team is also growing fast. “We have  staff at the moment but are looking to expand in  months,” Daniel said. “That includes new staff in the US to help grow and manage that market as we further expand our software team back home.” The success of axialD mirrors the overall success of Catalyst, since its inception  years ago. It’s an independent not-for-profit organisation across its four sites – including its largest base at the Titanic Quarter in Belfast, alongside its Londonderry hub, Ballymena, along with the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub at Danske Bank in Belfast city centre.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/jm_1.jpg","title":"how do you retain staff and keep them enjoying their job","story":"Posted on Wednesday September  by Ulster Business With such intense competition for talent, the challenge for employers isn’t just finding prospective candidates, it’s also keeping them, writes John Moore, managing director of Hays NI Astonishingly, almost half of professionals surveyed in the Hays What Workers Want Report said that they left at least one new job within the first  months because it didn’t match expectations formed during the application process. A signicant number of our employees at Hays have been with us for , ,  and even  years, and we pride ourselves on growing our own talent and promoting from within. Although there are times when employees leave due to circumstances employers can’t control, organisations can create the right conditions to retain their staff for as long as possible. We believe there are three key areas. A sense of purpose Across ages, cultures and sectors, professionals need to get up in the morning knowing that they can make a dference. No matter how big or small, recognising a clear and meaningful purpose in your role is a huge driver for staff. Communication is key for employers. By prioritising employee progression, offering regular feedback and communicating the wider objectives of the business, employers can ensure their staff come to work each day with a strong purpose. Variety each day While not every task can be exciting, and some parts of a job will inevitably be more stimulating than others,the mundane becomes the usual, employees will think about moving on. Injecting iety into each week and staying interested at work partly falls on employees themselves, who can proactively seize opportunities. But a good employer should also push their staff and encourage them to work outside of their comfort zones. This ensures professionals can keep growing and developing within an organisation rather than move where. A strong network The people we work with have a huge bearing on our happiness levels at work. You simply can’t stay in a role long-termyou don’t enjoy working with those around you, so the importance and impact of these relationships are not to be underrated. Employers can help their staff develop a network of inspiring and admirable colleagues from their first day by making sure they receive proper introductions and support contacts. Workers who have these strong bonds feel a greater sense of belonging which keeps them wanting to work in their organisation. With these three points in mind, it’s important to consider how someone’s organisation and role makes them feel, rather than just how impactful their salary or bonus might be. After all, this is what can’t easily be replicated across organisations and can keep an employee with an organisation throughout their career.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"new  bedroom boutique hotel planned for belfast","story":"Posted on Wednesday September  by John Mulgrew A listed Belfast building could become a new hotel and restaurant as part of wider plans for a £m revamp of the city centre. Tribeca Belfast, formerly Royal Exchange, will see UK developer Castlebrooke redevelop much of the north side of the city centre. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. As part of the revised plans it wants to turn the listed former Assembly Rooms building at the corner of North Street and Waring Street into a new -bedroom hotel, with a restaurant and bars. That would involve knocking down part of the newer extension to the building, including the rear part of the former Northern Bank and the adjacent - North Street to “accommodate the new extension to form the proposed boutique hotel”. “The proposals for the existing building are similar in scope to that which was included as part of the extant approval. It is proposed to conservatively repair the existing historic fabric of the former Northern Bank,” a design statement says. “A key feature of the proposed extension is that the interface with the rearelevation of the existing listed bank building will be improved by setting back the footprint of the proposed extension so that the north west corner of the original building is readable.” The scheme includes the re-use and adaptation of the existing building as well as an extension on the footprint of the existing s extension on North Street. The extension will be set over five floors, with a rooftop bar, while upper floors are set back with metal cladding to the facades to “reduce the overall massing of the building and reflect the roofing materials or upper story treatment of surrounding buildings”. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. This summer the developer ran a fresh public consultation amid revised plans for the scheme, which included signicantly reducing a huge -storey building to around , retaining additional facades and dropping plans for an underground car park.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals. What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you  Believe in yourself, be flexible and above all when opportunities present themselves to you, grab them.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/da1.jpg","title":"clarity telecom building telecoms from the ground up","story":"Posted on Monday September  by Ulster Business Clarity Telecom helps businesses of all shapes and sizes develop their communications needs from the ground up, and is now rolling out its fast-growing cloud software across the UK and Ireland. Founder and managing director David Whelan speaks to Ulster Business about a business which boasts the right tools for the job David Whelan’s vision and mantra for what is now one of the leading telecoms businesses is clear – telecommunications services are only as good as the foundations on which they are built, with engineering front and centre. He’s the entrepreneur behind Clarity Telecom – a successful Belfast-based full-service telecommunications solutions company with almost  years under its belt, helping develop top-end connectivity – including lines, calls, mobile, broadband and cloud software – for businesses across Ireland and the UK. And for David, telecoms is all about engineering at the core of finding the best comprehensive solution to its customers, having the right tools for the job, and having world class people. For Clarity Telecom, it’s about developing a bespoke system for companies, focusing on engineering from day one. Since its inception in , Clarity Telecom has grown to have a greater engineering capability than any other independent telecommunications company in Northern Ireland, and is now rolling out its leading byphone VoIPsystem throughout the UK and Ireland. David also says through Clarity Telecom and its burgeoning byphone technology, the company could double revenues in the next three years as well as growing its workforce. “The phone network stops at a plug in the wall and from that point on, you have to provide the infrastructure and management,” David says. “What we do is focus on the engineering. It’s all about how well it works and adapts to your business. “By focusing on that we are looking at the way things are being built, and we can then get insights on how we can change and improve things.” Led by engineering, the Clarity team is driving change within the telecoms industry ensuring client infrastructure is fit for purpose and for the future. That starts with assessing a business’s needs, making sure the network is suitable, reviewing the workforce needs and bandwidth requirements. From there, Clarity Telecom can develop a bespoke solution – from cabling, to switching, cloud services, routing and phone systems. Clarity Telecom now has a team of  staff – a third of whom work directly within the engineering side of the business. But that number could grow further still, as the company expands its business across Northern Ireland, and develops its byphone technology. The company developed its subsidiary, Voxbit, in  – specically to design engineering solutions. And through that has come one of its most successful products, byphone. A simple to use VoIP , byphone is a drag and drop system that allows users to configure their own phone set up suited to the exact needs of the organisation and enables a range of analysis tools that can help business owners drive up efficiencies. “In  as VoIP started coming along, I realised that was a signicant opportunity,” David says. “Where the communications industry is going is into the cloud. It’s going from traditional storage within buildings, into something in the cloud. The traditional telephone systems are evolving. “We started making a series of innovations surrounding cloud technology. We realised you can make it simpler – we were asking ourselves, can you make it work without a manual, for example. “If you can, in the same way as Apple’s iPhone made things easier for users, people will start using the services. It’s about making everyone’s le easier. “The end user wants to be able to use the system easily, from managing their telephone number, to having access to voicemail. It’s about the ‘power of simple’. “We now have around  resellers for the byphone system in the UK, and we are looking at trebling or quadrupling those sales,” he said. One of Clarity Telecom’s customers is Mid  East Antrim Borough Council. The firm was tasked with bringing together the complex communication needs of the new ‘super council’ following the amalgamation in . “With bringing three councils together, one of the main problems was having a single phone number that people could call. If you have numerous sites, spread across three council areas, that would involve a lot of rip and replace,” David says. “But we gave them one telephone number and then managed the routing to all those bits of equipment across the council areas.” Hotel giant Andras House – which operates seven hotels and , rooms in Belfast including the Crowne Plaza at Shaw’s Bridge and the new Hampton Hilton – is also another major customer. “Businesses trust us to be able to provide the engineering solutions in order for them to run their companies,” David says. So, why should a business consider Clarity Telecom for its crucial and comprehensive connectivity needs  David says Clarity is all about improving how companies interact with their customers – making it easier, and thus, improving revenue and sales. “As you manage your telephone connections you become better at dealing with your customers – you become more efficient at dealing with them, and they will have a better experience. It’s about improving customer contact. “As a business you are able to do a lot more, such as listening to call recordings, access to statistics and using data which will help manage that contact, as well as saving on costs and making your business more efficient. “What solution depends on your business. That is where we come along. We never put a system in without doing a full engineering visit.” Some of the connectivity includes the ability to connect landline with mobile phones, call forwarding and being able to access voicemails as digital recordings, by phone or computer. “When companies deal with us, they can come along and say ‘this is what we are trying to do’, and we are able to work the engineering and infrastructure, before then providing the services,” David says. “It’s also about fighting against the view that it’s all about price. Yes, you have to be competitive, but you need the right infrastructure. For example,a shop loses connectivity for two days, then they lose two days of sales, simply because they don’t have the back-up for the credit card payment system. “It’s about getting businesses to think about the infrastructure and all of the issues. It’s not just about how cheap you can make a call. It’s about how customers can engage with your business – and we are at the heart of making that happen.” For further information, contact Clarity Telecom on    or visit www.clarityteleView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/greggssss.jpg","title":"greggs to open new belfast city centre store","story":"Posted on Tuesday  September  by John Mulgrew Greggs looks set to open a new store in the heart of Belfast city centre, it can be revealed.
