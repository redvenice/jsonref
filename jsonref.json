If we watch them carefully, they will tell us,” said the University of Sydney ethologist Valentina Mella, lead author of the research published this week in the journal Ethology.Koalas, which are not bears despite a common misconception, spend most of their lives high up in eucalyptus trees. They rely on a diet of eucalyptus leaves, normally consuming up to 800gm daily. The word koala is thought to have meant “no drink” in one of the Australian Aboriginal languages. The question of their water consumption had long been puzzling.“Koalas have been alleged to never drink free water in the wild, or to drink only occasionally. Drinking behaviour has often been considered unusual and attributed to disease or to severe heat stress,” Mella said.“Koalas were thought to gain the majority of the water that they require from the moisture content in the leaves that they feed on and to drink water unintentionally in the wild by eating wet leaves after rain, or when dew is present on the leaf surface,” Mella added.Koalas sleep about 20 hours a day to conserve energy because their diet requires a lot of energy to digest. “Koalas are nocturnal animals, so they are only active at night, and they are arboreal, which means that they live in trees and rely on them for food, shelter and, as we just discovered, also for drinking,” Mella said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54f892f481745adb1ec1ddf1508aae70f4ec6ecf/162_223_797_478/master/797.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1730857cefc332c179df8bc3af0f2632","title":"picture books for children reviews","story":"A dazzling plant compendium, Axel Scheffler’s crucial guide to coronavirus and a bear in Bermuda shorts lift the spirits in lockdownNo sooner were the words “school closure” uttered than the children’s publishing world rallied. Who would have predicted that when a pandemic hit some heroes would take the form of children’s authors on livestreams? Draw-alongs from the likes of Mo Willems or Rob Biddulph (whose wildly popular twice weekly #DrawWithRob sessions have landed him a new activity book deal), and readings from makeshift studios by major authors including Julia Donaldson, Oliver Jeffers and Benji Davies (frequently upstaged by his pre-schooler, Esther), have quickly become timetable essentials, soothing and fun (and cherished by parents trying to work).Arguably the most vital contribution so far has come from The Gruffalo illustrator Axel Scheffler with his free digital information title, Coronavirus: A Book for Children. Essentially a calming, explanatory pamphlet about the virus and the impact it’s having, it features Scheffler’s familiar, saucer-eyed characters (mostly humans but there is a Gruffalo to be spotted) and is aimed at primary school-age kids. Written by staff members Elizabeth Jenner, Kate Wilson and Nia Roberts at Scheffler’s publisher, Nosy Crow, with expert input from Professor Graham Medley of the London School of Hygiene \u0026amp Tropical Medicine, two headteachers and a child psychologist, by late April it had been translated into 46 languages and downloaded more than a million times.Planned long before coronavirus struck, but with a title and content that couldn’t be more perfectly timed to cheer us all up, I Ate Sunshine for Breakfast (Flying Eye) is a compendium of plants so full of dazzling, delicious pictures that it’s like opening up a world-class garden in your hands. Written by the former head of education at Chelsea Physic Garden, Michael Holland, with illustrations by Philip Giordano, each spread looks at a different aspect of plant life including pollination and photosynthesis (hence the book’s title). Scattered throughout (like little seeds to cultivate young minds) are activities to do including leaf printing and making a shoebox plant maze. Many books have celebrated plants, but this one feels special, particularly at a time when gardening sales have gone through the roof.Speaking of shopping, at the start of the lockdown there was a reported surge in children’s book purchases, with The Big Book of Silly Jokes for Kids apparently topping one retailer’s list. Happily, there are also plenty of new releases that will appeal to those seeking laughter. Tiny Ant (Simon and Schuster) pairs Claire Freedman, author of the bestselling Aliens Love Underpants series, with illustrator Claire Powell for a vibrant tale about a jungle talent contest featuring a nervous elephant, a skunk and an acrobatic lion. It’s reminiscent of Garth Jennings’s hit animation Sing but with the added message that big isn’t always best. Powell’s pictures are a delight, especially an extreme close-up of the showstopping ant in his red spotty bow tie singing his heart out, and the detailed drawings of his home complete with a half conker bath and art deco mirror.Delphine Perret’s A Bear Named Bjorn (translated by Antony Shugaar, Gecko) is award-winning in Perret’s native France and comprises six short stories about the antics of Bjorn and his forest friends. There’s a flick of Moomins style to the simple but striking black line drawings, and echoes of Winnie-the-Pooh in the characters’ droll reflections, but Perret has a fresh and funny voice all of her own. In one episode, the friends, inspired by Bjorn’s much-loved pastime of pawing through clothes catalogues, decide to dress up as humans and throw a party. “At seven o’clock sharp everyone turns up in disguise with something to share: hazelnuts  a tart with blueberries  fleas.” The sight of Bjorn and co in heart-print Bermuda shorts and baseball caps, arms in the air, scoffing pizza like they just don’t care, should lighten the mood as surely as any lockdown disco on Zoom.• To order I Ate Sunshine for Breakfast or A Bear Named Bjorn for a special price click on the titles or go to bookshop.

The CBILS has been criticised for slow processing of applications.Under that scheme, lenders have to send data manually to the British Business Bank – the state-backed institution managing the scheme – to process the government-back loans. Boden said this method was “not sustainable”. The British Business Bank is now working on a new digital platform to speed up the process, but that will not be ready for another six to seven weeks.“My greater concern at the moment is that the processes within all the banks won’t take the strain of what’s happening to process all these loans and bounce back that quickly,” said Boden. “I think there’s going to be a scale problem here.”Starling only started CBILS lending on Monday, despite having applied weeks ago to be included.Accredited BBLS lenders told the committee there had been a deluge of claims on Monday morning.RBS’s commercial banking chief, Paul Thwaite, said staff had worked incredibly hard to get the scheme up and running on Monday morning and that the number of call centre staff had been doubled to more than 500 to deal with demand.But MPs asked whether bank systems would be able to cope with the surge in demand, including those linked to the British Business Bank.Barclays customers were reported to be struggling to access applications on the bank’s website. Hammerstein denied that the site was failing to cope, and said the bank’s technical team was increasing the number of applications the online site could handle at any one time.David Oldfield, the head of commercial banking at Lloyds Banking Group, told MPs that his team also struggled to deal with the loan processing systems linked to the British Business Bank. Those systems were originally built for another government programme known as the Enterprise Finance Guarantee, which was not designed to handle such a surge in demand.The committee chair, the Conservative MP Mel Stride, warned that he would be drawing attention to banks that were “slow off the mark”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b5433a572cfbf99966e689d8cbe79d858a2c429/128_399_2985_1790/master/2985.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a624a08646083e1ae7af32f273dd37b9","title":"food deliveries to vulnerable in uk need better coordination","story":"Consumer and disability rights groups say many struggling to access basics during pandemicConsumer and disability rights groups have called on the government urgently improve the coordination of food deliveries for vulnerable people, warning that thousands are not getting the help they need during the pandemic.The consumer group Which? said it had been contacted by more than 1,000 people who were either disabled, elderly or had illness that put them at risk of contracting Covid-19 and were having difficulties in getting grocery essentials.Sue Davies, the head of consumer protection at Which?, said: “Based on the huge number of reports we’re seeing from vulnerable people struggling to get access to basic food and supplies, it’s clear that the current system is not working for those who need it the most.“Without easily accessible and clearer information for these people, and stronger coordination between the UK’s central and devolved governments, the food industry, local authorities and local charities, there is a risk that many will go hungry during this pandemic.”The UK government has said that these five tests have to be met before they will consider easing coronavirus lockdown restrictions:Which? wants the government to simplify the system for registering for food boxes or prioritised supermarket deliveries to step up efforts to find those who have fallen through the cracks and to coordinate better with charities and the food industry to provide a more consistent service across the UK.James Taylor, the executive director of strategy at Scope, said the consumer group’s findings echoed what his charity had heard from disabled people.“Many have been forced to risk their health to visit supermarkets because they can’t get the deliveries they need,” he said.The government set up a food parcel delivery scheme at the end of last month in an effort to support some of the 1.5 million people it had identified as particularly vulnerable to coronavirus because of conditions such as cancer or severe respiratory illness.“We are determined to ensure the most vulnerable are supported during this pandemic,” said a spokesperson, adding that the government had worked with local authorities, food service specialists and NGOs to deliver at least 900,000 food parcels in nearly five weeks.However, that amounts to about 180,000 a week, a fraction of those requiring help.The Local Government Association said councils in England and Wales needed better data on those needing assistance as well as access to supermarket delivery slots and NHS volunteer responders to assist in shopping for vulnerable iniduals. It emerged this week that 600,000 volunteers were ready to be deployed but many were still waiting to be allocated a task after weeks on standby.The government and devolved administrations have shared their databases on people at risk in England, Wales and Scotland with supermarkets to set aside delivery slots for vulnerable customers. Northern Ireland has yet to do so, however.But the major supermarkets all say they cannot keep up with demand, given that the 1.5 million people identified by the government as particularly vulnerable account for a fraction of those at risk from the virus, estimated to be as many as 16 million.Some very high-risk people told Which? they were struggling to get deliveries or being forced to visit stores, while others had been unable to navigate “complex, confusing and often overwhelmed government and supermarket helplines or other support systems”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7109e853906a9bf0ea86a8ca9dce8be924ea310b/0_76_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8410688dd13fc4460798e81634227ed2","title":"uk car sales tumble services pmi recession covid 19 business live","story":"The euro is sliding after Germany’s constitutional court issued a long-awaited ruling on the legality of the European Central Bank’s massive asset-purchase programme.The judges in Karlsruhe appear to have dropped quite a bombshell -- instructing the Bundesbank that it must drop out of the Public Sector Purchase Programme unless the ECB proves, within three months, that the PSPP is needed.The ECB has already bought billions of euros of government bonds under the programme, which was created by former president Mario Draghi during the debt crisis.The court has considered a claim that PSPP was illegal as it amounted to the direct financing of eurozone governments, and concluded that the ECB needs to prove that the programme is justified.“The Bundesbank may thus no longer participate in the implementation and execution of the ECB decisions at issue, unless the ECB Governing Council adopts a new decision that demonstrates...the PSPP are not disproportionate to the economic and fiscal policy effects.Significantly, though, the ruling does not apply to the ECB’s new €750bn stimulus programme -- the pandemic emergency purchasing programme (PEPP).But it does still raise serious questions about the future of the ECB’s money-printing programmes, especially if the ECB doesn’t address these concerns.The euro has dropped by three-quarters of a cent in response, to $1.0833, amid concerns that the PEPP could be challenged next.David Madden of CMC Markets says:The ruling means the Bundesbank- the German central bank – can’t participate in the ECB’s stimulus scheme beyond three months, unless the ECB can come up with a new arrangement.Today’s news mean the ECB’s pandemic stimulus package could face legal challenges too. Hugo Boss, the German fashion house known for its sharp suits, has warned that things will get worse before they get better. There is obviously less demand for smart suits when people aren’t going to the office … meanwhile, the Berlin-based meal kit delivery firm HelloFresh is thriving. It delivered 111.3m meal kits in the first three months of the year as the Covid-19 lockdowns boosted demand for its pre-portioned ingredients and easy-to-cook recipes.Dominik Richter, the chief executive who co-founded the firm in 2011, says: “On top of our already very strong first two months of the year, our meals have attracted significant additional demand in the second half of March, as the global pandemic hit all of our markets in short order.”We also have confirmation that Britain’s economy suffered a painful slump last month, as the Covid-19 lockdown suppressed activity.Data firm Markit has reported that its ‘composite PMI’ index, which tracks activity across the private sector, fell to just 13.8 last month from 36 in March. Any reading below 50 shows a contraction, and this is the worst on record (going back to 1998) - by a long way!The service sector was particularly grim, as Markit explains, with most firms reporting a drop in business activity -- either due to business closures, shutdowns among clients or shrinking sales due to a slump in non-essential spending.New work, backlogs and employment across the service economy also slumped at a record pace. Tim Moore, economics director at IHS Markit, says the reports shows Britain is entering its worst recession in many decades.“April’s PMI data highlights that the downturn in the UK economy during the second quarter of 2020 will be far deeper and more widespread than anything seen in living memory.Just one-in-five service providers managed to avoid a drop in business activity since March, and those hardest hit by social distancing measures and travel restrictions often reported complete stoppages of business operations.”Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive, warns that the slump in car sales is bad news for Britain’s auto manufacturing industry: “With the UK’s showrooms closed for the whole of April, the market’s worst performance in living memory is hardly surprising. These figures, however, still make for exceptionally grim reading, not least for the hundreds of thousands of people whose livelihoods depend on the sector. A strong new car market supports a healthy economy and as Britain starts to plan for recovery, we need car retail to be in the vanguard.Safely restarting this most critical sector and revitalising what will, inevitably, be subdued demand will be key to unlocking manufacturing and accelerating the UK’s economic regeneration.” Tesla’s new Model 3 was the biggest-selling model last month -- as Elon Musk’s electric car company continued to deliver to customers despite the lockdown.Newsflash: It’s official -- Britain’s car industry has suffered its worst ever plunge in sales.Most of those were ‘fleet purchases’, with only 871 private buyers -- mainly key workers.The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders says is a record slump, and is urging the government to allow car showrooms to reopen once the lockdown starts to lift.As we flagged earlier, it appears to be the worst month for car sales since 1946, as the nation’s car showrooms shut down.The SMMT’s latest report, just released, shows:Ian Plummer, commercial director at Auto Trader, says few car retailers were able to adapt to the UK’s lockdown:“With retailers forced to close the doors to their physical forecourts, it’ll come as no surprise to anyone to see just how dramatic an impact it’s had on the new car market,” he wrote.“Some brands have been able to sell remotely, but uncertainty in the government’s guidelines or a lack of the required infrastructure to operate home delivery in a safe way, has limited it to all but a handful of retailers.“Whilst the market is down significantly, our data does point to a market that has been paused, rather than stopped, and ready to return to health quickly once the restrictions have been lifted.Sky News have more details.Seán Kemple, Director of Sales at Close Brothers Motor Finance, predicts the ‘drastic’ slump in car sales in April might rebound once the economy is unlocked - but 2020 will still be tough for manufacturers.“When the lockdown does begin to lift, we should see pent-up demand released, triggering a sharp rise in sales of the cars sitting in showrooms we’ve already seen this in the European used car market as dealers review and reprice their stock after lockdown. But after an inevitable uplift, the future is less certain.We might start to see supply issues, held up by restrictions on manufacturing and the stalling of overseas shipment. In the longer-term, demand trends may change. We know that in times of economic hardship, buyers often shift from new to used cars in order to get their hands on a more affordable vehicle.Conversely, some people might be too nervous to use public transport for fear of catching Covid-19, and drive to work instead, he adds.European stock markets have bounced back in early trading, on hopes that Covid-19 restrictions will ease soon.With Boris Johnson likely to unveil some form of lockdown plan this week, Italy and Spain easing restrictions, and California to follow suit on Friday, investors decided to turn away from the US-China tensions to focus on the idea that the worst part of the pandemic may be approaching its end. Budget airlines also had a torrid April.It warns that the next two months will be equally quiet:Due to multiple EU Govt flight bans and restrictions, Ryanair expects to carry minimal traffic during the months of May and June as well. As well as weak sales, the car industry is also suffering from supply chain disruption due to Covid-19.Stefan Sommer, Volkswagen’s board member for procurement, has told the Financial Times that the cost of crucial car components has risen sharply because of the coronavirus outbreak. Part makers have hiked their prices, he says, because their own output has fallen.Sommer predicted that the cost of sourcing parts would “rise in the classic value chain”.  “Now there are depreciations, while the overhead costs remain and they can’t be reduced overnight.” Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.The full scale of the crisis facing Britain’s car industry will be laid bare today, when official figures show just how few vehicles were sold during last month’s lockdown.That would be the lowest level since 1946, Reuters has calculated - down from over 160,000 in April 2019.In February 1946, just a few months after the end of World War Two, just 4,044 new cars were sold in Britain, which was still undergoing rationing and trying to rebuild after wartime destruction, under its first majority Labour government. Last month, around 4,000 cars were registered with most of the sales being fleet purchases, according to preliminary data from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). The SMMT publishes the full data at 9am.Updated surveys of purchasing managers will confirm that economic activity slumped in the UK last month. The earlier ‘flash’ PMI report, issued last month, crashed to just 12.3 - the weakest reading on record.Investors will also keep an eye on Germany’s constitutional court. It’s due to rule on the legality of the European Central Bank’s government bond purchase programme, created to save the euro during the debt crisis.A group of German academics have long argued that this quantitative easing is illegal, as the ECB is effectively financing governments.As the ECB is now firing up the programme again to address the Covid-19 crisis, there would be major shockwaves if the Constitutional Judges rule against it. They’re resisted such a bombshell in the past, though."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/148b98af6c46bf63d7154e5bf444b9e8cb9d9708/0_118_3996_2398/master/3996.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3df0a3d6a5142891364233b0390a0a81","title":"100000 tests results coronavirus self isolation","story":"Delivering the coronavirus tests was the easy part. Now we need mass contact-tracing and self-isolation On Friday health secretary Matt Hancock announced that the UK had achieved its target of carrying out 100,000 tests per day. Of the reported 122,347 tests on 30 April, a total of 27,497 had simply been delivered to people’s homes and 12,872 to other centres. Only a small proportion of those 40,000 tests sent out have been used so far. By Sunday, the figure had dropped to 76,496 to much disconcertion.Are people right to be worried about the number of tests available? There are valid concerns that while the tests are being delivered in high numbers, they may not all be usable. It is still unclear whether tests sent to care homes can be administered by staff, who are currently not registered to carry out nursing tasks. Some have even been sent tests without return envelopes. Despite some friction in the process of rolling out testing, the number of tests actually carried out is still a very impressive achievement.The real concern is our capacity to act on the results of the tests. Simply doing tests in response to demand will be inadequate. Instead we must use each result to find cases, trace those who have been in contact with a person who has tested positive and ensure that those infected, or potentially infected, self-isolate. Only these four steps used in conjunction will prevent a second wave of the virus and protect vulnerable people.Although technology and apps may well help, this exercise will require the mobilisation of thousands of workers to interview cases, identify contacts and take swabs. Contact tracing is a skilled activity, usually done by specially trained nurses or environmental health officers, and we need to ensure that we have enough trained people to do this before we get to that part of the recovery phase.Once cases have been identified, self-isolation will be key to lowering the rate of transmission. People who test positive and those they have been in contact with will have to shut themselves off to the rest of the world for 14 days. For the minority who refuse to do this, strict sanctions may be needed.If testing is not followed up by contact tracing and self-isolation, we run the risk of a large outbreak, as happened in South Korea with Patient 31 and the Shincheonji church. This patient apparently continued to attend the church even though she had symptoms and went on to generate a cluster of more than 4,400 cases of Covid-19.Those who test negative but still exhibit symptoms, especially if they have been in contact with a known case, will have to assume they have the infection. Even in people without symptoms there is no guarantee that 24 hours later they will not be symptomatic and infectious. “Treat the patient, not the test” is an often-repeated truism in medicine and a phrase we are likely to hear more and more as testing is rolled out across the country. On the other hand, people who have tested positive can assume they are immune to reinfection for at least a time.Finally, we must be careful that the data from all the tests being done does not hide the reality of the epidemic from the public. We are now moving from NHS to commercial mass-testing, and all this new testing will push up reported cases dramatically over the coming days. One of the common pitfalls when investigating any outbreak of infectious disease is changing how new cases are identified and counted mid-epidemic. For the time being we must still focus on pillar-one testing – NHS swab testing for those with medical needs and critical key workers – and reported fatalities to show how the epidemic is progressing in the UK rather than on total positives.Despite the concern over figures, we have achieved a remarkable feat in increasing our testing capacity to these levels. We are now faced with the even more challenging task of using that testing capacity, and the results generated, to reduce case numbers, reduce demand for hospital beds and reduce deaths."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ecf7dacfcb506887b743629f2459adf4acf83bc/0_409_6409_3846/master/6409.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0e241c504edae928e297622dd97724ad","title":"coronavirus is giving us a glimpse of the future of work and its a nightmare","story":"Women working at home are doing more childcare and housework, while virtual work has no knocking-off time.

That glimpse of home life: the serious man with his geopolitical analysis and the swagger of his little girl who couldn’t care less … who didn’t relate to that?In work mode, children don’t figure. And now that so many work from home, children must be somehow removed. Women report that, when making Zoom calls, the sight of a child will make them look unprofessional, whereas men fear this less because it makes them look rounded and human. At a certain level of corporate success, this may be so, but for most people the reality of work from home is fraught and muddled.As the pandemic has made visible every inequality, it has also shone a light on the domestic front. Women at home are doing more. More childcare. More home-schooling. More domestic labour. Even if they are working. The old work-life balance, never achieved in the first place, is now even more severely out of whack. Balance? It’s walking a tightrope of competing needs. Virtual work has no knockoff time: email, WhatsApp and the dreaded, supposedly upbeat, Zoom meetings mean workers are available all the time.This inflexibility is then somehow sold as flexibility, but it assumes the worker is always primed for contact. The remote worker is, for some companies, the ideal worker. They don’t need a desk or expensive office space. They don’t need a union. They are malleable and compliant at a time when we are all concerned with the job losses to come. They may not be quite as productive, but they are doing enough to make many big companies think this is the future.This future can sound bright. No more commuting. Everyone can go and live in the countryside, which we have apparently all hankered for during lockdown. We quit the city and can then afford home offices. How very free. Only none of it quite delivers. Most people who talk this talk already have a spare room in their houses. Most of them earn enough and most of them chose self-employment rather than having it foisted upon them.What we do need is to rethink how we work, and the answer cannot be an atomised and depressed workforce.People like to see each other. In real life. If anything, this situation reminded us that there is something about human contact, even eye contact, that no tech can yet produce. Spontaneity and laughter is missing from stilted digital events. Whenever you ask folk about where they got their career breaks or great ideas, it is nearly always from chance encounters a snatched conversation on the way to lunch or being asked to step in when someone else was too busy. But how are young people, who already can’t afford city rents, to work in their cramped flats? When do they get the opportunity to fly, to improvise, to step up to the plate in informal ways? Face-to-face interaction matters. Serendipity is the mother of creation.Certainly, the daft presenteeism and the ending of the standard nine-to-five – an anachronism from the days of factory work – can go. And hopefully a lot of management shibboleths, which have been farcical for decades, will recede, too. One is meetings of enormous numbers of people. When I am king of the world, no meeting will be longer than 10 minutes and, no, not everyone will get to speak. We all know this is a false democracy. In my entire career, the only long meeting I ever attended that needed hours was a case conference to decide the future of a child in care, back when I was a residential social worker. The rest have been displays of ego and territorial pissing. The same goes for brainstorming, another redundant exercise. As Jon Ronson has pointed out, brainstorming is just showtime for extroverts. Everyone else sits there waiting for it to be over. Ideas happen when you are not forcing them. Who doesn’t know that?As we come out of lockdown, a lot of workers will be asked to tolerate some very odd conditions, and this will be done in the appalling business jargon of “resilience”, “restructuring” and “change agents”. The workforce will be told this new way of working promises flexibility – but enforced flexibility is not the same as choice, which is what most want: purposeful work and some autonomy.For too many, work is not purposeful, and lockdown has brought that home, literally – but people need incomes. Those at the bottom of the heap on zero-hours contracts already know that flexibility is a one-way street. Marx talked of four kinds of alienation of labour, and the fourth is when the worker is alienated from other workers. Work is simply an economic practice, and the social elements of production go unrecognised. The great yearning you hear from many now working from home is just this – the social aspect.A post-Covid-19 future must not underestimate the importance of this to economic recovery. The social part is what makes work bearable for many. For the lucky few, work-life balance feels better than it ever was, but for many, I would wager, we are far from that. Everything is work, and life feels baggy and shapeless. There is no break, there is no off-switch, there is no childcare. Instead, we are meant to do it all – all the time. If this is the future, no wonder so many women I know can’t wait to get back to work – just so that they might actually have a moment to themselves."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64eed70af2c43a9ccb227c04ae04e874717918fd/0_237_4234_2541/master/4234.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=78d2e4e67d7170ca92d07e83c07d968b","title":"britain emergency planners pandemic government","story":"A pandemic has been warned of for years. But the government’s flat-footed response betrays its lack of emergency expertsTwelve years ago, I attended a conference on public health where a leading expert on pandemics introduced his talk by saying: “My task is to tell you things you don’t want to know, and ask you to spend money you haven’t got on something you don’t think will happen.” He then went on to describe, in considerable detail, a scenario for a global pandemic that was eerily similar to the one we’re currently experiencing.Fast-forward more than a decade, and it seems the UK government was badly prepared for the coronavirus pandemic. It’s not as if we didn’t have prior warning that an event like this was a threat. Though Exercise Cygnus of 2016 remains shrouded in mystery, the government’s national risk register of civil emergencies has long put pandemics at the top of the list of risks the UK faces. In the 2017 register, a virus symbol sits in the top right-hand corner of a diagram of likelihood versus consequences. The UK’s strategy for managing a pandemic, meanwhile, was first published in 2011. But by 2014, government attention had turned away from pandemic preparation and back to counter-terrorism planning. And by 2016, planners in the UK were fully engaged in confronting the supply-chain disaster that would be Brexit, struggling to figure out how, for example, to boost the UK’s coffee supply.Britain is experienced in planning for pandemics – so where is the emergency management of coronavirus? What we know so far about committees such as the scientific advisory group for emergencies (Sage) is that they appear to include no independent advisers on emergency planning and management. Expertise in medicine, virology, epidemiology, statistics and global health are all represented. So are behavioural sciences and psychology. Yet there seems to be a prevailing sense that the coronavirus crisis is primarily a medical and epidemiological problem – and that other aspects are mere fallout.This is not exactly true. Modelling the transmission of the virus, researching a vaccine and procuring antiviral therapies are of course vitally important. But there is more to the coronavirus crisis than flattening its curve. The measures to contain the virus are relatively simple – physical distancing, testing, tracing and isolation – but they are laden with consequences, both for society and for iniduals. Anticipating these effects and finding ways to mitigate them are the keystone of emergency planning.The coronavirus crisis is complicated by the fact we are living in a highly interconnected world, where one event can have a ripple effect across the networks on which we all depend. Halting international travel, for example, has left food producers without seasonal migrant workers to harvest crops. But the arrival of seasonal workers from abroad in the future could lead to a second spike of infections, particularly if they live in close proximity to one another. The issue of a second spike has already proved an issue in Singapore, previously lauded for its response to the virus. These are among the types of issues that emergency planners need to consider.Early attempts to deal with the crisis in the UK involved minimising its significance to the public and frantically improvising in a vain attempt to catch up with the spread of the virus. If plans existed, there was an abyss between the decisions mandated by the government and the reality of how they played out on the ground. This underlines the fact that emergency planning must be a live effort. Reality does not stand still – so neither must the plans for dealing with an emergency. Planners should be able to foresee urgent needs and prioritise them, providing enough personal protective equipment to the care homes that have become hotspots for the virus, for example, and knowing in advance how to source such equipment in adequate quantities.Numerous academics have presented fairly detailed scenarios for an influenza pandemic since 2008, which covered many of the social, economic and public health consequences that we are now experiencing. But we still don’t have a clear idea about the recovery process, and what actions the government should take to help society and the economy to recover. Although we can look back to the 1918-1920 flu pandemic for an idea of how long this recovery process might take – and the challenges that this period will present – it’s difficult to apply this knowledge to the current crisis when so much has changed.Emergency planning isn’t rocket science, but it’s distinctly challenging on many levels, involving intellectual, scientific and practical decisions. Wherever an event can be foreseen, the plans should be based on a range of scenarios. Planning scenarios aren’t predictions of the future but rather systematic explorations of hypothetical situations, answering the question: “What if…?”When disasters strike there should be three elements to the response: plans, procedures and improvisation. We can imagine the planner as an orchestral conductor, directing the members of the orchestra to play their sheet music. It’s the conductor’s job to ensure the musicians play in harmony, and although improvisation can’t be eliminated, it should be reduced to a bare minimum. Emergency planners will be needed to identify and meet the novel challenges that coronavirus presents – both now and in the future. Never have they been needed more on critical advisory committees.• David Alexander is professor of risk and disaster reduction at UniversityCollege London and vice-president of the Institute of Civil Protection andEmergency Management"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8faf8f904a43433163dace7809015c4785e7a4e8/0_133_4052_2430/master/4052.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=051957b4f47abf131e9d063f3c76aa69","title":"we created the anthropocene and the anthropocene is biting back","story":"It’s clear from a recent litany of disasters – from the coronavirus pandemic to America’s deadliest wildfire in a century – there are forces that cannot be domesticatedAbout 12,000 years ago, human domestication of the natural world began in earnest with the intentional cultivation of wild plants and animals. Fast forward to today and our dominion over the planet appears complete, as 7.8 billion of us multiply across its surface and our reach extends from the deep-sea beds, which are being mined, to the heavens, where we are, according to Donald Trump, dispatching a space force.Yet as has been made clear by a recent litany of disasters – from the coronavirus pandemic to America’s deadliest wildfire in a century – there are forces that cannot be domesticated. Indeed, our interference with the natural world is making them more liable to flare up into tragedy. We created the Anthropocene, and the Anthropocene is biting back.Covid-19 appears to have emerged in a Wuhan seafood and wild animal market, yet some scientists argue that its true origin story lies in the disruption of ecosystems. Genetic testing indicates that the virus probably came from bats, and at some point may have been transmitted via an intermediate species such as the pangolin, the most trafficked animal in the world. Although pangolins were not – officially – listed as traded at the market, it was certainly host to other wild animals such as wolf pups, crocodiles and civets.“Wild animals carry their own unique viruses,” David Quammen, the author of Spillover: Animal Infections and the Next Human Pandemic, told Yale Environment 360. “When we go into a tropical forest with its great ersity, and we start cutting down trees, and capturing animals, or killing animals for food” – or sending them to markets where they can mix with farm animals and humans – “then we offer those viruses the opportunity to become our viruses, to jump into us and find a new host, a much more abundant host”.The risk of diseases spreading from animals to humans is in fact greatest when the animals concerned are endangered and in decline owing to trafficking and habitat destruction, a recent study found. The climate crisis and human population growth are “disease amplifiers”, according to the World Health Organization.Wildfires similarly show how our remaking of the natural world has had disastrous consequences. In our new book Fire in Paradise, which is based on our extensive reporting for the  and published today, we document the destruction of an entire California city in 2018 by a fire of unprecedented severity in modern times. Claiming 85 lives, it is the deadliest ever wildfire in the state.Wildfires are native to the western US in the same way that monsoons or hurricanes are native to other places. Yet a century of efforts to stamp them out and protect human lives and property in California has left the state’s forests and grasslands unnaturally dense with flammable vegetation that would otherwise have burned off in semi-regular but low-intensity burns. To make matters worse, global heating is rendering California’s wild places ever drier.Paradise’s residents knew of the sword that hung over their heads. The town had an evacuation plan and an emergency robocall system. In the summer of 2018, a horrifying and awe-inspiring fire tornado 1,000ft wide had laid waste to an area just 80 miles away. “It’s not a matter of if,” one longtime resident, Iris Natividad, told us. “It’s a matter of when.”Even so, no one imagined how bad it would be on that morning in early November, when a spark from a PG\u0026ampE transmission tower ignited the brush that surrounded it, at one point consuming nearly 400 American football fields’ worth of vegetation a minute on its sprint into Paradise. Flames that burned as hot as a crematorium melted cars and blowtorched thousands of homes. The fire trapped people in town and caught many unaware.Paradise suffered total devastation, and the images of neighborhoods reduced to nothing but piles of ash shocked the world. We’d say this was the new normal – except that actually “it would be a mistake to assume that the region has reached any semblance of a stable plateau”, three wildfire scientists wrote for the  only a few months before the Paradise fire. We know there will continue to be huge fires. We also know there will be more outbreaks, as a consequence of extreme weather, bioersity destruction, political instability, and expanded ranges for mosquitoes and ticks.Yet one optimistic lesson from the Covid-19 tragedy is that we can act. We will heed the calls to stay home, and we will condemn the economy in the process, if it means saving lives. And we will do it overnight.On our part-domesticated, still-wild planet, in the geologic era that bears our name, we’ve learned that we do indeed possess the willpower to prevent another pandemic, and another Paradise."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/34e6c407877fbe8c687841c61cdee72cd2230d2e/0_162_5023_3015/master/5023.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9fd51928d8442cec230fb66ca3ae362b","title":"covid 19 has made universities financial forecasts redundant good luck to us all","story":"Will freshers opt to defer for a year, and can universities let them? No one knows the answers to even the biggest questionsI’m a man of simple pleasures. One of the ways I keep myself amused is chuckling at financial forecasts. HS2 is going to cost £106bn. Really? Are you sure it isn’t £107bn? Or £105bn? Or something completely different? A recent study suggests that the UK university sector is going to take a £2.472bn hit next year in lost fees. Oddly, my normal instinct to giggle at the bogus precision didn’t kick in this time.In our dreams, everything returns to near-normal. Suppose the virus naturally dies down in a month or two, or some other miracle happens, and universities can reopen. There will be a scramble to match applicants to places, and lots of details to fudge, such as what to do about candidates from overseas who have not been able to take English language tests. Yet financial necessity is the mother of regulatory invention, and we will find a way.But let’s take off the rose-saturated glasses. International students will rightly be very nervous about coming to the UK. We’ve hardly covered ourselves in glory so far, and if there are fears of a second wave, it will be understandable if few want to risk being stranded in a student room far from home – not to mention that a university is prime virus breeding ground. Universities will struggle to work out what social distancing means in practice.One scenario being considered is that all courses will have to be offered by a mixture of in-class and online materials. Perhaps lectures are delivered by video, and students come to campus only for small group interaction. Or maybe everything must go online, at least for a time, with students remaining at home. Such contingency planning is already taking place, just in case.Online education works better in some academic areas than others. Classroom-based subjects could perhaps be partly replicated, but lab or studio work presents greater challenges, to use the sector’s preferred euphemism.And so, the crunch. If universities cannot open as normal, at least in part, students could very reasonably decide to defer their places until the following year, assuming things have settled down by then, and take a gap year. But not so fast …It should not be taken for granted that universities are in a position to accept mass deferrals. Even in ordinary years it is not always possible, as highly competitive courses don’t want to tie up too many places for the subsequent cohort. Students could be told that they must reapply, and take their chances against the next year’s applicants. Nothing yet is certain, but universities will have hard, and bitterly unpopular, decisions to make.If students do defer, they are hardly going to be looking at a cornucopia of alternative possibilities. Interrail? Volunteer overseas? Intern? Work in a bar? If these were available, then probably the universities would be up and running too. In the worst case, a gap year will be a year of lying on a bed, looking at a screen. If so, a screen containing the contents of the first year of a degree programme could seem newly attractive. Many applicants, not wanting to put their lives on hold, may prefer to get on with it.But there is no room for complacency. Students who do opt for a virtual first year may balk at the expense of a traditional university, which will be making up online learning on the fly. They may well prefer to use an institution such as the Open University, which has decades of experience of distance learning. And why stay virtually in the UK? A global abundance of cheaper, even free, material is out there.Where does all this leave us? As the government is just beginning to acknowledge, it’s going to a bumpy ride, both for students and universities. And quite likely something different from anything I’ve considered will emerge. One lesson from history is that higher educational analysts are not great at predicting the choices of 18-year-olds – even those they are living with. Good luck to us all."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4bcdb06f9ceecdb2da38af728c9275eb9259e7ea/0_50_2200_1320/master/2200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b0f64267158cca83c5fbadc33d8a690c","title":"headteachers call for kinder school system coronavirus michael gove","story":"Ten years since Michael Gove’s reforms began, coronavirus shows up their failings, says the Headteachers’ Roundtable - and offers a chance for changeSchools closed, exams cancelled, a halt to Ofsted inspections and performance tables. Even the weirdest misfit futurologist employed by the prime minister’s adviser, Dominic Cummings, couldn’t have envisaged that, 10 years on from the start of the coalition government, the UK would be locked down with a partially functioning school system.Normal politics seems a distant memory. It could be 100 years, rather than 10, since Michael Gove, now a minister at the heart of the Covid-19 battle, was trumpeting traditional academic education, rushing legislation through parliament to fast-track academy conversions, and evangelising for a new generation of free schools with hotly contested claims that they would help to close the attainment gap.But, as schools grapple with assessing exam grades, virtual education and providing care for the children of key workers, questions are surfacing about what the pandemic has revealed about the last decade’s reforms – and what may need to change.The government’s new warmth towards teachers contrasts sharply with Gove’s often abrasive tone towards the profession. During his reign as education secretary, swathes of the education establishment were dismissed as the “enemies of promise”.Now some headteachers are looking for a more radical acknowledgment of what Covid-19 might mean. Stephen Tierney, chair of the Headteachers’ Roundtable (HTRT), a grassroots organisation set up in 2012 out of frustration with coalition policy, says now should be a “world war 2” moment.Tierney, who recently retired from a Blackpool school, believes the narrow “Govean” image of schools as vehicles for the transmission of knowledge – the former education secretary once described broader aims such as wellbeing and community cohesion as “peripherals” – has taken a knock.“The overwhelming image now is of schools relating in a very different way to their communities,” he says. “What does this moment tell us about what sort of society we want to build, and how schools fit into that?”The HTRT first met at a time when education policy was dominated by the introduction of the English baccalaureate, designed to encourage exam entry into the most academic subjects, and GCSE changes that, in effect, limited the number of pupils awarded each grade.“By the same token, BTecs in engineering and public services will be essential, won’t they?”Tomsett is one of few founding HTRT members still running a standalone maintained school. Rapid academisation was among the most controversial 2010 reforms, and most of the original HTRT group became academy chain leaders, defending the benefits of being in local collaborative arrangements.But according to the Education Policy Institute thinktank, set up after the 2015 election to provide objective analysis of education policy, the impact of academisation was minimal. For all Gove’s talk of a relentless “moral crusade” to narrow the attainment gap between the best and worst-off children, research suggests that at the current rate, it would now take more than 500 years to close.David Whitaker, director of learning for the Wellspring Academy Trust, which specialises in special needs and alternative provision education, isn’t surprised: “Austerity has hit our families hard. Cuts to social care, housing, and mental health provision mean more children are exposed to trauma and are cognitively impaired at a young age,” he says.The government has already tacitly acknowledged that Covid-19 school closures risk exacerbating attainment gaps, and has promised to provide laptops and boost broadband capacity for some families. But the economic shocks of the pandemic may deepen inequalities for years to come.David Laws, a former Liberal Democrat MP, now chair of the Education Policy Institute, was a schools minister in the coalition government at the time it introduced a pupil premium to try to boost attainment for the most disadvantaged pupils.He now admits the impact of austerity almost certainly pulled in the opposite direction. “When poverty and the out-of-school environment are deteriorating, it becomes much more difficult to improve outcomes for poor children,” he says.“The choice is not between tackling poverty or improving schools – both are necessary if the gap is to be shrunk.” For one thing, he says, “we need to think more about how to attract the best teachers and leaders to the most challenging schools – higher per pupil funding, by itself, may not be enough.“Obviously, the current school closures are very worrying, and it would be surprising if the gap didn’t rise over the year ahead.”Laws acknowledges that schools with high disadvantage often find it harder to find teachers and may be more harshly graded by the inspectorate, Ofsted, making it more difficult to attract the best teachers and heads.The HTRT, which recently launched a Pause Ofsted campaign, believes the Covid-19-related halt to inspections and league tables should force a fresh look at how the accountability system affects the most challenging schools – and headteacher morale.Ros McMullen, another founding member of the HTRT, retired early from her job as an executive head in the Midlands, partly because heads were being treated as the “whipping boys for all the failings of social policy”, she says. “Headship can be very lonely, and people are frightened of being sacked or exposed. Michael Gove’s mantra was about giving heads control, but the truth is that I had less autonomy as an academy head than I did in a local authority.“This moment may provide an opportunity to think again about how to create a structure in which the challenges of a school’s context are recognised and heads can get their autonomy back.”Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, has called for a “rebirth” of the school system. “My hope is that we will come out of this more strongly demonstrating that it’s the human stuff that matters in education – the relationships, the socialisation of young people, the sense of an older generation preparing the next generation to take their place.”Another original HTRT member, Jon Chaloner, now chief executive GLF Schools, a 40-school trust, agrees: “The ideal, for me, would be an ‘education policy of unity’ supported by all the political parties so that, for the next 20 years, we are all committed to the agreed course of action”.Less focus on results and inspections, more value placed on a school’s role in the community, revaluing vocational qualifications and a unity approach to education would certainly be a different recipe from the past 10 years. But the Covid-19 crisis has forced government and citizens to act in ways that would have been unimaginable only two months ago.“There is a newfound respect for people who keep society running that requires us to think again about the true worth of key workers,” says Tomsett. “School staff are currently providing them with childcare so that they can save lives. It is our contribution to a national emergency.“I think that there will be a change of tone. The new world will put staff first, rather than see them as just another dispensable resource. There might be a decade ahead of us which sees teachers become better trained, be better treated and better respected than we have ever seen. I certainly hope so.”• This article was amended on 5 May 2020. An earlier version said that Geoff Barton had been a founding member of the Headteachers’ Roundtable. This was incorrect.

The vast majority will secure a place soon and be provided with at least some reassurance about their next step in life.But the problem with awarding entry on the basis of calculated grades is that it discriminates against disadvantaged students. A number of studies have shown that pupils whose family, social, economic or other circumstances hinder their ability to study at school actually tend to do better in final exams than their predicted grades.In a normal year, many students who are initially uncertain about whether to go to university end up applying late through clearing, or entering university via a foundation year. There is a real danger that those from disadvantaged backgrounds will not now do this, as their shortened A-level experience will mean they have started to disengage with education before these opportunities arise. This will have a lifelong impact on their socio-economic status and social mobility.Young people from disadvantaged backgrounds often need more support and encouragement to apply for and go to university than others because there is not the same expectation placed on them. This is especially the case for those who obtain lower results than they were expecting.I am particularly concerned that disadvantaged students who do not make their grades because of bias in the system will disengage from higher education entirely. Having been predicted poor grades, they will have spent the spring and potentially the summer at home with no coursework, exams or volunteering opportunities to keep them enthused about learning. They are also unlikely to have parents who push them into the clearing system. It is vital that the government helps these students.To ensure that disadvantaged students with poorer grades who, in a ‘normal’ year, may have made it into university do not disengage, we’re proposing that the government approves a scheme to support them. Our chairman, Sir Andrew Cahn, and I have written to Michelle Donelan MP, asking her to do so.The scheme would allow universities to issue unconditional offers to students from disadvantaged backgrounds for entry on to a structured foundation year higher education programme in any subject from October. These offers were banned until today on the grounds they are exploitative to students. But this isn’t always the case. If we have to wait until students receive their A-level or Btec results in August, we can’t give them the security of a confirmed place for which they can start to prepare now. This is why foundation years need to be exempted from this week’s government call for universities to minimise the use of unconditional offers.While foundation years don’t guarantee entry on to undergraduate degree courses as students still need to achieve the required standard to progress, they serve as excellent introductions into university study and life. They coach students on essay-writing and provide a much-needed confidence boost for those who feel like they don’t belong in universities.Under the scheme we’re proposing, students would be offered a place on a foundation year now to end any anxiety caused by uncertainty and maintain their interest in education. We and other universities taking part in the scheme would then provide free online pre-entry advice, support and preparatory guidance to these students immediately, so that they can work through the next five months and arrive in the autumn ready to succeed.Covid-19 has strained all aspects of our society, but we shouldn’t let it disproportionally harm the futures of those who are most disadvantaged.

Others include expanding broadband so more people can work from home.“Tackling climate change has the answer to our economic problems,” Prof Hepburn told the . In their stimulus packages after the 2008 financial crisis, governments largely failed to capitalise on the carbon-cutting potential of their spending, partly because there was a lack of “shovel-ready” initiatives.This time, countries already have commitments to cut emissions under the Paris agreement, so there is a framework to require them to take account of carbon, as well as better awareness of the economic benefits of renewable energy, electric vehicles and other clean technology. “I think there is a better chance this time of a green recovery,” he said.The findings of the study, published in the Oxford Review of Economic Policy, provide academic backing to the calls for a “green recovery” that have been made by leading experts amid the Covid-19 crisis.The study also supports calls for any bailouts for fossil fuel companies or heavy emitting sectors, such as airlines and car manufacturing, to have conditions attached that would require the companies to reduce their climate impact.Brian O’Callaghan, also of the Smith School and co-author of the paper, said governments should act quickly. “Following large-scale government spending, there is often a hesitancy on the part of the public to spend more,” he said. “The natural inclination might be to take an easy pathway. But this is the single biggest opportunity for the government to shape the future decade, and it could give a significant economic boost.”The paper, co-authored by the Nobel prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz, and Lord Nicholas Stern, the climate economist, catalogues more than 700 stimulus policies and makes comparisons with the global financial crisis of 2008. More than 230 experts, including senior officials from finance ministries and central banks in 53 countries, responded to a survey on the potential for climate benefits and fiscal recovery measures.Mark Carney, former governor of the Bank of England and now a finance adviser to Boris Johnson for Cop26, called for all companies to disclose their plans to reach net zero emissions. “Every company in every sector, every bank and every insurer, every pension fund, should be expecting to develop and disclose a transition plan to net zero,” he said.The UK can seize the opportunity as president and host of the crunch UN climate talks to lead the way on an international green recovery, leading economists said, in a briefing to ministers to accompany the Oxford study results.The Cop26 summit has been postponed to early next year, giving time for the government to come up with a recovery package that would set the UK on a path to net zero emissions. The economists called for a new climate emergency committee, led by ministers, and for the UK to set up a sustainable recovery alliance with other governments.“The UK should link Cop26 with the Covid-19 recovery,” said O’Callaghan. “They have a real leadership opportunity.”Emily Shuckburgh, of the University of Cambridge, a co-author of the government briefing, said: “Shaping the national and global recovery from the coronavirus pandemic in a way that supports the response to climate change and other environmental threats simply makes sense. Not only does analysis suggest green recovery packages deliver greater economic benefit, but investing appropriately in research, innovation, infrastructure and skills training, and matching that with robust institutional structures, will help create a fairer, more resilient, sustainable world with benefits for all.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5243a7948b9d7007cfa43b4cf651fd4895534ed7/0_0_3943_2366/master/3943.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=26f4beed5129d07dd9ca9d14946cda44","title":"do you know your rihanna gowns and lady gaga outfit changes find out with our met gala quiz","story":"The gala, due to take place this week, has been postponed because of coronavirus.

Werner is keen for a new challenge abroad and has told Bayern Munich that a move to another Bundesliga club is not an option at the moment.Contrary to reports, the release clause in the striker’s contract – which stands at €60m (£52.7m) – is still valid. Liverpool are keen to get more of an understanding in the next few weeks of what will happen to this summer’s transfer window before completing any deal.The coronavirus pandemic is likely to distort the market this summer, even for the top clubs, and Liverpool are not ready to commit to spending €60m on one player. Jürgen Klopp is a huge admirer of Werner, who has 72 goals in 118 league appearances for Leipzig, and the striker was set to be Liverpool’s top target this summer if they were to invest in a squad that is 25 points clear of Manchester City at the top of the Premier League.Several other clubs are also interested in Werner depending on how other transfer business goes.

Fifa has proposed allowing extra substitutions to help players cope with greater fixture congestion after a break that involved curtailed training and no competition, and Taylor said games of less than 45 minutes each way are also under consideration.“We don’t know the future,” Taylor told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “What we do know is what propositions have been put, what ideas have been put: the possibility of having more substitutes, games possibly not being the full 45 minutes each way, there’s talk of neutral stadiums – there’s lots of things being put forward.“Try to wait and see what the proposals are and then have the courtesy to let the managers and coaches and players also assimilate all those and come to a considered view.”Taylor said a protocol for football’s return, drawn up in conjunction with medical experts and the government, was due to be put to players and coaches as early as possible next week and would be looked at club by club. He indicated that players would be allowed to decide whether they wanted to play.“They are concerned about their own safety – they are not stupid – and neither are they naive, so they would have to be satisfied it is safe to return and it is their choice,” Taylor said.Manchester City’s Sergio Agüero has said he and the majority of players are scared about playing amid Covid-19. “Sergio is a top-class player and is entitled to his opinion.” Taylor said. “It’s not a question of being scared, it’s a question of being fully informed and for the relevant authorities to try to make sure it’s as safe as it possibly can be to return.”Taylor said mid-June was the earliest realistic restart and added: “The very fact you are in professional sport you need to be very resilient and you need to be able to bounce back because you will get more setbacks than you will good times. I would like to think that’s how my members are. We shall just have to wait and look at it on a day-by-day basis and see if it’s achievable.”The health secretary, Matt Hancock, told the BBC he was “open” to the Premier League season restarting but “safety has to be paramount”. He added: “We’ve got to make decisions about what the relative priorities are of all the different things that could be reopened and do everything we can at the same time to keep R down.”Ideally the season would continue as it started, Taylor said, with home and away games and the same squads, but he accepted the most significant question had become: “Above all can they be completed safely?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/101846dcb4d1599fd14a421c040b692ec3c9631f/0_0_2952_1772/master/2952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a8a0fd4f1344cd1adcc17474d112113c","title":"calling her lifts my spirits three parents on isolation away from their children","story":"As the UK remains in lockdown, parents share their stories about how they’re connecting with their children via technology …With much of the world in lockdown, staying connected with our loved ones has never been more important. Whether we’re checking in with a call, keeping ourselves entertained by taking part in online pub quizzes, or updating the family WhatsApp with our latest baking attempts, we have a burning desire to keep in touch. Our home broadband has gone from “nice to have” to the lifeline between us and the outside world.For some mums and dads who find themselves self-isolating away from their young children, this lifeline is critical. Here, three parents describe how they are managing to stay connected with their families from afar …Rosie: ‘I haven’t seen my son in four weeks’ “Dropping my son off with his father without knowing when I’m going to see him again was the most impossible thing I’ve ever had to do. And that feeling hasn’t lessened over all these weeks of self-isolation. My son is only three years old he’s so young. I feel ready to run out of here and scoop him up at any moment – to hell with it all.“I have to remind myself constantly why I have to take self-isolation so seriously. I’ve got bad asthma. So when my doctor advised that I stay indoors for 12 weeks, I decided it would be best for my son if he was with his dad, who has lots of outdoor space. We broke up in October, so I was only just getting used to the separation. And now this.“It’s been four weeks already, which is the longest I’ve ever been away from my son. FaceTime is essential, but it can be incredibly painful as well – I have to be positive because naturally I just want to burst into tears. I call him on my laptop as it has a bigger screen and his face is the normal size. At the end of the conversation he’ll hug the phone he’s using.“He recently showed me that he can now put his own socks on and told me that he’s being ‘independent’. He’s learned quite a few new words – I’m really proud of him. He’s also been collecting sticks and stones as presents for me when we’re reunited.“We talk at breakfast and dinner – it’s like how we used to sit around the family table, and he finds it entertaining to try to feed me bits of his food through the camera.“We’ve also had some family group calls – we had a lovely one with my sister and her son, my ex-husband and my son, and my dad and my stepmum. My son was playing the keyboard, and his cousin, who has just turned two, was dancing. It was so good!”Leo: ‘I had to isolate away from my daughter when I became ill’“When I started to feel ill a few weeks ago, with what I assume was coronavirus, my 12-year-old daughter was with her mum so it was easy for me to self-isolate.“As the illness took hold, I could do nothing but be in my bed. One bright part of the day, though, was FaceTiming my daughter, which isn’t something we did much previously. My ex and I share equal custody, so I’m used to seeing her every few days.“We’ve WhatsApped each other a lot, too. That way I got to check she was OK, what she was up to and, of course, my knowledge of emojis became fairly impressive.“My symptoms are now subsiding, but we feel it’s best that she stays at her mum’s until I’m completely clear, so the video calls have been such a help. We don’t have to talk every day, but knowing I can see her lifts my spirits. The distinctive sound of the FaceTime ringtone, and then seeing her face and that she looks so well, and isn’t bored or scared, makes this all much easier for me.“It has been very hard to be away from her especially because we don’t know when this is going to end. Several years ago I went to Brazil to work for a few weeks, but this will be the longest I haven’t been with my daughter. I know she is OK, though, and I know that right now she is in the best place with her fantastic mum, and in a wonderful home.“Loneliness, of course, comes into it, but weirdly with everyone in the same boat, you can sort of move away from thoughts of pure isolation. Knowing my daughter is only a video call away helps me so much.“We chat about what we’re doing, laugh about how mad we’re going, and I can put her mind at rest about any questions she has right now. We give each other a kiss on the camera, but we can also just sit in relative silence. She is painting a lot and during one call when I was ill and quite weak, she just got on with that while I watched and relaxed. That was lovely.”Mark: ‘We haven’t told my daughter I’m back in the UK yet’“I travel a lot for work and had recently spent a month in New Zealand away from my family – but when it began to look like everything was shutting down I decided to catch a flight back to the UK so I wouldn’t be stranded.“After discussing it with my wife, we decided that it would be best if I didn’t come straight back to the family home and – as a precaution – I would spend two weeks in isolation. I was very lucky that a good friend had moved in with his girlfriend during lockdown and he kindly offered me his flat to stay in.“However, this meant telling my little girl, who is seven years old, that I was still away. Although she doesn’t totally understand everything about what is going on, she knows enough that she’s been scared of things she’s heard on the news and fearful of us getting ill. So my wife and I decided we didn’t want to worry her even more.“Every day I FaceTime her as I normally would when I’m away, and it’s been a real lifeline for me to be able to see how she’s coping and reassure her that I’ll be home soon. We even watched a film together and her mum made her popcorn just like when we have family movie nights. Doing my best to pretend that everything is normal is the right thing for her, and it helps me cope with this awful situation too.“It’s really difficult to be away from my wife and daughter, especially when this is the time you want to be close to the people you love most in the world. Hopefully one day, when this is all over, we’ll be able to laugh together about how Daddy was hiding in a flat around the corner when she thought I was calling from New Zealand.”Vodafone #KeepingtheUKConnectedWe know that now, more than ever, it is important for you to stay connected to your family.That’s why every day, we at Vodafone are working hard to maintain our network.

On ourselves, our relationships and what’s important to us. For some of us, that means reaching out to old friends, or healing old wounds with people we once thought we’d never speak to again. And in a way, the tech that helps us reconnect makes repairing those relationships easier: the screen gives us an element of safety, yet we can tap directly into those emotional connections we need to get us through this crisis.Here, three people who found isolation has had a positive effect on their relationships share their experiences – from building bridges, to creating the foundations for better communication, and reconnecting with family members they haven’t spoken to in years …Emma*: ‘Coronavirus gave me a reason to reach out to my brother’“I’d always had a good relationship with my brother, but it came crashing down last Christmas when my family discovered he’d been keeping his gambling addiction from us. He’d even taken money from Mum, and I was upset that he could put her through so much stress – I just couldn’t bring myself to speak to him. But after chatting to Mum over the past couple of weeks and hearing that he’d been helping her with food deliveries while she’s been in isolation, I decided to reach out. I sent him a text first and then he called me and we chatted about coronavirus and how we’ve been coping – a few days later, he FaceTimed me and gave me a tour of his new flat that I’ve never visited. I’d wanted to reach out to him before, but I was struggling to know how, so while lockdown is a very weird situation, it gave us both an excuse to push our differences to one side.“I also realised that life is too short – if my mum could move past what had happened, so could I. In fact, I’m probably speaking to him more now than I ever did before.”Michael: ‘Lockdown made me realise what’s important’“My ex-partner and I split a year ago and we share a young daughter, but our relationship has been really rocky ever since we broke up. We’d fight all the time and nasty words would be fired back and forth at each other over text message. But when the lockdown happened, it really made me take a step back and think about what’s important.“I reached out to her via text and also sent her some money for petrol, as she is driving our daughter between our two houses during this time – I wanted to make sure she knew I appreciated that she was helping me to see my daughter. It has felt like a real turning point for us and our relationship and it’s a really positive outcome from a situation that is out of our control. Now my daughter is with me and I’ve been sending my ex-partner pictures and we’ve been having civil conversations. Without this happening, I don’t know if we’d have ever reached this point.”Jo: ‘I’m connecting with family members I haven’t spoken to in years’“We have an extended family WhatsApp group made up of the descendants of my grandparents, both of whom sadly passed away recently. We used to use it every so often to share pictures from when people visited them, but over the years as inidual families grew, and as my grandparents got more frail, we didn’t have the same opportunities to gather together. And for some of the family, my only contact was an annual Christmas card. Since everyone has been staying at home for the past few weeks, though, the group has blown up with almost daily messages – pictures of the great-grandchildren doing their home school work, baking or learning to ride bikes without stabilisers in abandoned car parks.“My mum and dad both work in the NHS, with more than 60 years of service between them, so everyone shared videos from the 8pm clap for the NHS in recognition. And my brother, who’s a musician, livestreamed a gig on Facebook and lots of the family who’ve never had the opportunity to see him play before got to watch. It’s really lovely to feel connected to everyone, particularly as the two people that held us all together are no longer here.”Vodafone #KeepingtheUKConnectedFamily has rarely felt more precious, nor has staying in touch with each other and the world.

They married months later and now live in Hollywood, FloridaCarol Natelson and Ray Bertoia had been travelling the world for years working in casinos when they met on a cruise ship in 1995. “I was working on another ship and was moved to her ship by pure chance,” he says. “As I was boarding, I spotted her outside a cabin reading a magazine. I just knew straight away that she was the one for me.”Carol, who is American, had sworn off dating, but, despite her reservations, romance blossomed quickly. “I thought he was cute and then we ended up spending lots of time together,” she says. They shared their first kiss on the island of Mayreau in the Grenadines. “We pretty much became a couple within two weeks of meeting. We had so much fun it was like being on a holiday.”They spent three months together onboard the ship, before Carol’s contract finished. “I still had six months left, but there was no way I was staying on the ship without her,” says Ray, who is originally from Scotland.Although he had been planning a career working in the cruise casino industry, Ray didn’t hesitate to leave for Carol. They disembarked in Los Angeles, before heading to Palm Springs, where she found work in a local casino. It was hard work and long hours, but they loved the lifestyle. “We were in the pool one day when I asked her to marry me,” says Ray. “We went to Las Vegas in June to get hitched. Our witnesses included Carol’s sister and a few people we’d met on the ship.” The marriage meant Ray could start working at the same casino in Palm Springs. “Our wedding happened so fast that I don’t think anyone thought we’d last,” laughs Carol. “But here we are, 25 years later.”The couple built a home for themselves in Palm Springs. They kept up their passion for travel with regular trips to Europe. “Ray learnt to sail, too,” says Carol. “One of the things that I love most about him is that he is always up for anything and he likes to do different things.”She also loves his honesty and caring nature: “He doesn’t just care about me, he cares about everyone.” Ray says they have always been on the same wavelength. “I just liked her from the first moment. She loves an adventure and she’s a fantastic cook. I think when you know, you just know.”In 2009, Ray became seriously ill due to complications from erticulitis, a digestive condition, and ended up on life support in a coma. His mother died while he was in hospital and it took him a long time to recover. For the next three months, Carol nursed him back to health. “Without her, I don’t know what I would have done,” he says.The couple had always dreamed of moving to the beach. In 2017, they took the plunge and bought a new home in Hollywood, Florida. “We have lots of family here. We can look out of the window and see the cruise ships,” says Carol. Ray found a job at the Hard Rock guitar casino when they moved.He is currently out of work due to the pandemic, but says they are “very lucky”. “We were meant to be going on a cruise to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary this year,” says Carol. “But we’ll just have to wait a bit longer.”Although Ray was 39 and Carol was 42 when they married, it was the first wedding for both of them. “Before Ray, I was always choosing the wrong guy,” says Carol. “It’s been so great to be with someone who I can always count on to be there for me.”Want to share your story?

Then, a few months in, she found out she was pregnant again – just as the coronavirus pandemic hitI stepped out of Oxford Circus tube into mid-morning crowds and cold, bright sunshine. The consultant’s words were still ringing in my ears. “Nothing.” How could the answer be nothing? This was January 2018, six months since my third miscarriage, a symptomless, rather businesslike affair, diagnosed at an early scan. The previous November, I’d undergone a series of investigations into possible reasons why I’d lost this baby and the two before it.That morning, we had gone to discuss the results at the specialist NHS clinic we’d been referred to after officially joining the one in 100 couples who lose three or more pregnancies. I had barely removed my coat before the doctor started rattling off the things I had tested negative for: antiphospholipid antibodies, lupus anticoagulant, Factor V Leiden, prothrombin gene mutation.“I know it doesn’t feel like it, but this is good news,” he said, while the hopeful part of me crumpled. We were not going to get a magic wand, a cure, a different-coloured pill to try next time.Now, my husband, Dan, was back at work and, for reasons I can’t really explain, I had decided to take myself shopping rather than go home after the appointment. I stood staring down the flat, grey frontages of Topshop and NikeTown and willed my feet to unstick themselves from the pavement.I ended up wandering the beauty hall of one of London’s more famous department stores. I let myself be persuaded to try a new facial, which uses “medical-grade lasers” to evaporate pollution and dead skin cells from pores to “rejuvenate” and “transform” your complexion. Upstairs in the treatment room, the form I was handed asked if I’d had any surgery in the past year. I wrote in tight, cramped letters that six months ago I had an operation to remove the remains of a pregnancy, under general anaesthetic. When I handed the clipboard back to the beautician, she didn’t mention it. I wished that she would.As I lay back and felt the hot ping of the laser dotting across my forehead, I thought how ridiculous this all was that this laser-facial is something humans have figured out how to do. How has someone, somewhere, in a lab or the boardroom of a cosmetics conglomerate, conceived of this – a solution to a problem that barely exists – and yet no one can tell me why I can’t carry a baby?There is no doctor who can reverse a miscarriage. Generally, according to medical literature, once one starts, it cannot be prevented. When I read these words for the first time, three years ago, after Googling “bleeding in early pregnancy”, a few days before what should have been our 12-week scan, I felt cheated. Cheated, because when you’re pregnant you are bombarded with instructions that are supposed to prevent this very thing. No soft cheese for you. No drinking, either. Don’t smoke, limit your caffeine intake, no cleaning out the cat’s litter tray. I had assumed, naively, that this meant we knew how to prevent miscarriage these days, that we understood why it happened and what caused it that it could be avoided if you followed the rules.You learn very quickly that the truth is more complicated. After a miscarriage, no medic asks you how much coffee you drank or if you accidentally ate any under-cooked meat. Instead you find that miscarriage is judged to be largely unavoidable. An estimated one in five pregnancies ends in miscarriage, with the majority occurring before the 12-week mark. Seventy-one per cent of people who lose a pregnancy aren’t given a reason, according to a 2019 survey by the baby charity Tommy’s. You are told – repeatedly – that it’s “just bad luck”, “just one of those things”, “just nature’s way”.Just, just, just. A fatalistic shrug of a word. But this is not the whole story. “There is this myth out there that every miscarriage that occurs is because there’s some profound problem with the pregnancy, that there’s nothing that can be done,” says Arri Coomarasamy, a professor of gynaecology and reproductive medicine, and director of the UK’s National Centre for Miscarriage Research, which was set up by Tommy’s in 2016. “Science is trying to unpick that myth.”Unfortunately, the roots of this myth run deep. It’s an idea reinforced by the social convention that you shouldn’t reveal a pregnancy until after 12 weeks, once the highest risk of miscarriage has passed. It goes unchallenged thanks to age-old squeamishness and shame around women’s bodies, and our collective ineloquence on matters of grief. The bloody, untimely end of a pregnancy sits at the centre of a perfect Venn diagram of things that make us uncomfortable: sex, death and periods.that comes on after a miscarriage, I have found. A semi-delusional state that lasts for days, sometimes weeks, afterwards. After each one of mine (and there have been four now), I’ve caught myself believing I am still pregnant, despite all evidence to the contrary – the trips to A\u0026ampE, the blood, the still ultrasounds, the forms labelled “sensitive disposal of pregnancy remains”.It starts in the mornings. For a moment, stuck somewhere between sleeping and waking, I won’t have remembered, and, briefly, I’m still happy. Pregnant. When the phone rings, for a split second I’ll imagine it is the hospital calling to tell me there has been a mistake. A mix-up. They’ve got the results: I am, in fact, still pregnant. Or my husband will say, casually, over dinner, “Oh do you want to hear some good news?” and I’ll think: he’s going to tell me I’m pregnant.It is the shock, I remind myself, the trauma: it leads to disbelief. Like feeling that the loved one who has died is about to walk through the front door any minute and sit in their favourite chair. This inability to accept reality seems logical to me – inevitable, even – when there is no explanation for what has happened. The brain wants to solve problems, to make meaning.There are very few specialist miscarriage clinics in the UK. Some people end up being seen by a general gynaecologist or sent to a fertility clinic. Generally, doctors will only agree to look for a possible cause of miscarriages once you have had three in a row. Even after investigations, which in NHS centres tend to look for structural problems with the womb and for blood-clotting disorders, around half of people will never be given a reason for their losses. There aren’t even official guidelines on preventing miscarriage – only on its diagnosis and “management”.With no answers to your questions – why did it happen? Will it happen again? – you are cut adrift in a sea of recommendations from women on Mumsnet, private doctors, people offering fertility supplements, herbalists and nutritionists, and from cult best-sellers that promise to tell you how to improve the quality of your eggs. It’s been more than 40 years since embryologist Jean Purdy watched as a single-cell embryo in a petri dish ided into two, then four, then eight cells that would become the world’s first IVF baby. Humans have worked out how to intervene in order to create life in a lab, but not how to sustain it in the earliest weeks inside the body. The stage between conception and an ongoing pregnancy, visible on an ultrasound scan (at around six weeks) is sometimes referred to as the “black box” of human development.According to Prof Nick Macklon, medical director of the London Women’s Clinic and an expert in miscarriage and early pregnancy, the reason there’s been so little progress is that we’ve been asking the wrong questions. “We use the term ‘recurrent miscarriage’ as if it were a medical diagnosis, yet there isn’t one single medical cause,” he said. Some women may have a blood-clotting disorder for others, a contributing factor could be thyroid dysfunction. Many women who miscarry appear not to have an underlying health condition at all instead, their bodies seem to be less able to discern what is and isn’t a viable embryo. Yet studies of possible preventative treatments tend to recruit their subjects as if all recurrent miscarriages have the same cause.This, in Macklon’s view, is likely to explain why several large, quality trials of possible treatments to reduce the chance of miscarriage, such as heparin (a blood thinner) and aspirin, as well as the hormone progesterone, have failed to show any clear benefit, and have subsequently been dismissed by the medical community. Some of these treatments may in fact work for some women, but, Macklon says, “because of the way the study is designed, it comes out as not working overall”.A related problem lies in the mistaken assumption that most (if not all) miscarriages happen because the pregnancy was doomed to fail. In half of all miscarriages, the embryo will have a serious chromosomal abnormality that means it could never survive, but the other half are believed to be healthy embryos. Prof Siobhan Quenby, a consultant obstetrician at University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire, heads up a specialist clinic into recurrent miscarriage, one of four centres that form Tommy’s National Centre for Miscarriage Research. The key question, she believes, is establishing whether someone is repeatedly losing chromosomally normal or abnormal pregnancies. “Everyone from their third miscarriage onwards should have their miscarriage tissue tested genetically,” she said.Yet access to genetic testing is patchy. Not all NHS hospitals can do this kind of testing on site. If someone miscarries at home, the onus is on them to collect a clean sample of the tissue and take it to their hospital within 24 hours. This may not be something they can do – or even know about.Quenby is a celebrity in the world of recurrent miscarriage patients. Her name often crops up in the “miracle baby” stories that make the papers, with headlines such as “Baby joy for couple who lost 13 babies to miscarriages”. Her particular area of interest is how the lining of the womb behaves in early pregnancy – and how it might contribute to miscarriage. She is one of the authors of a study published in January 2020, which found that a repurposed diabetes drug, sitagliptin, could reduce the risk of miscarriage by boosting the number of stem cells in the womb lining. These cells are responsible for renewing the lining and reducing inflammation. “It’s still only a small pilot trial, but it is fantastically exciting,” Quenby told me. “It’s the first time in a long time that there’s been a potential new drug treatment.”Quenby is convinced it’s not so much the treatment options that are lacking, but the will to try them. “It’s the opposite of ‘we can’t do anything’,” she said. “There are tons of things we can try now.” Still, as a miscarriage patient, you run up against the dilemma that recurrent miscarriage is not a diagnosis in itself, so the difficulty is in establishing which treatment is most appropriate to you. Even with the help of the most motivated of doctors, there is going to be a degree of trial and error.Many people will be told, as we were, that the best treatment is no treatment – simply try again. This is what we did, only to miscarry for a fourth time. We were under the supervision of the recurrent-miscarriage clinic, yet even after that fourth loss, the prescription remained the same: just keep trying.It took us a year before we felt ready to roll the dice again. Shortly after I started researching this piece, in November, I found out I was pregnant for the fifth time.To be pregnant again after previous miscarriages is to live at the fork of two alternative lives. You try to think as little as possible about what’s going on inside your body, while, of course, thinking about it all the time. Alive or dead? Baby or miscarriage? In every possible scenario, you plan for the two outcomes. To a certain extent, you are forced to buy into both possibilities simultaneously. You cannot truly believe it will work out, but you have to proceed as though you are pregnant anyway, until a scan proves otherwise. Alive and dead. Schrödinger’s foetus.You treat yourself as your own walking research study: a sample of one. Perhaps you take a different brand of prenatal vitamin. Or you do different exercise. You do no exercise at all. You drink less caffeine. You drink no caffeine at all. You are more careful. You are less careful, because you’ve been unimpeachably careful before and look where it got you. Mostly, though, you just wait.Why hasn’t miscarriage medicine moved faster or farther? Why isn’t there more certainty about what works and what doesn’t? The first detailed depictions of a human embryo’s development, from three weeks to four months, were produced by the German anatomist Samuel Thomas Soemmerring in 1799, and the images are remarkably similar to graphics used in week-by-week pregnancy apps today. Yet a precise schema of measurements to date the stages of early pregnancy – between seven and 16 weeks – wasn’t established in modern clinical practice until 1973, with the advent of ultrasound imaging. We had put a man on the moon before we could routinely see, in real time, what was happening inside a woman’s womb.Pregnancy research, in general, is underfunded. A recent research review, published in January 2020, found that for every £1 spent on pregnancy care in the NHS, less than 1p is spent on pregnancy research. “Compared to other areas – such as infertility – miscarriage has certainly lagged behind,” said Arri Coomarasamy, who sees patients in both fields.“Miscarriage gets a bad deal,” agreed Hassan Shehata, a consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist, who runs the Centre for Reproductive Immunology and Pregnancy, in Epsom, Surrey. “For a start, there is no specialist training,” he said. When you train as a gynaecologist, you can specialise in sub-fields such as infertility and IVF, but there is no specific speciality in miscarriage, he explained.There are also practical difficulties to conducting studies. “Pregnancy is difficult to research as, by its nature, studying it might disrupt it,” Nick Macklon told me. This means you’re often left with retrospective population data (easily skewed by multiple factors), or studying donated embryo or foetal tissue (tightly restricted for ethical reasons – and prohibited altogether by “personhood” laws in some parts of the US, which insist on burial or cremation of all pregnancy tissue).Even when human trials of treatments are feasible, there is the challenge of persuading women who are desperate to avoid another miscarriage to sign up to a study in which they might be given the placebo. As Ippokratis Sarris, a consultant in reproductive medicine and director of King’s Fertility, a private fertility clinic in London, put it: “It’s very difficult to do a proper trial – people want to take something they think might work. How do you tell them they can’t have it until there is good evidence?”Now that I was pregnant again, there was one treatment I was desperate to try. Progesterone has long been the great hope of miscarriage research. This “pro-gestation” hormone is produced in higher quantities during pregnancy by a woman’s ovaries (and, later on, by the placenta). It is essential throughout pregnancy and helps prepare the womb lining, although scientists don’t yet understand the precise mechanisms by which it does this. In May 2019, a large, multi-centre trial of progesterone, given in early pregnancy – the Prism trial – found that for women with a history of recurrent miscarriage who had started bleeding during their next pregnancy, taking progesterone made a significant difference to the live birth rate, compared with a placebo.I was prepared to argue the toss for progesterone with my doctors this time around. I knew the new evidence didn’t perfectly fit our circumstances. I wasn’t bleeding in this pregnancy, for one thing. To my surprise, the female doctor we saw at the clinic for our first appointment, in the first month of this pregnancy, agreed to prescribe it without so much as a raised eyebrow. It was not the first time I have asked about some speculative treatment, but it was the first time the clinic had agreed.As Dan and I joined the queue at the hospital pharmacy, tucked away in a grimy building in Paddington, I felt I was holding on to something bigger than the printed prescription in my hand. For the first time, we had something, after being told that there was nothing.Then less than a week later, at eight weeks pregnant, I started to bleed.There are therapies for miscarriage that have been available privately for well over a decade, yet are no closer to becoming mainstream medicine or available on the NHS. Where questions remain over the evidence, private clinics can go ahead and offer treatment anyway – something the NHS cannot do.One therapy available at a handful of private clinics – lymphocyte immunisation therapy (LIT), in which a woman is given a transfusion of white blood cells from their male partner before she becomes pregnant – has been banned in the US, outside of a research setting. Such treatments belong to a field known as reproductive immunology, and stem from work in the 80s and 90s by an American obstetrician, Alan Beer, who once summed up his theory in the following way: “Effectively, women become serial killers of their own babies.”The idea is that miscarriage can be caused by a hyper-vigilant immune system that misrecognises the symptoms of pregnancy as a threat. In these cases, treatment may involve suppressing the immune system using steroids or intralipids (essentially an emulsion of soybean oil and egg yolk, given intravenously, sometimes referred to as the “mayonnaise” or “egg-yolk” drip). Clinics charge up to £50,000 for such treatments. However, all but one of the experts I spoke to expressed scepticism about their effectiveness.Funding high-quality trials is particularly difficult when it comes to treatments that target the immune system, because, according to Quenby, in the past there has been a tendency to over-hype the results.Quenby believes our understanding of miscarriage would improve if we considered it as a public health issue, as we do stillbirth and neonatal deaths. Both of these are more common where there are high levels of social deprivation, and it’s likely the same is true of miscarriage rates, too. Though, currently, hospital trusts are not required to report the rate in their area.But like periods, female pain, the menopause and conditions such as endometriosis, which also want for good research and understanding, it’s hard not to conclude that miscarriage suffers from a lack of knowledge and interest because it happens to female bodies. What’s more, the underlying assumption tends to be that miscarriage is always down to something a woman’s body is or isn’t doing.In 2019, researchers at Imperial College London found that partners of women who have had three or more miscarriages tend to have higher levels of damage to their sperm’s DNA. The trial was small, comparing the sperm of 50 men whose partners had had miscarriages with 60 men whose partners had not. The results will need to be replicated. And before any possible treatments can be trialled, researchers need to establish what causes such DNA damage.Still, Quenby said, “The fact that we’re even looking at it is really important.” Traditionally, men and their contribution to the pregnancy have been largely left out of the picture. In the past three years, while I have been scanned and probed and pricked for multiple phials of blood, aside from completing a form outlining his basic medical history when we were referred to the recurrent-miscarriage clinic, Dan has not been required to so much as cough and say “ah”.When I discovered I was bleeding, I did a desperate search online for answers. I decided I was either having my fifth miscarriage – or, just possibly, the intermittent, brownish spotting was a side effect of the progesterone. I knew I should phone the recurrent miscarriage clinic, or my GP, or try to get an appointment for a scan at my nearest early pregnancy unit. But I couldn’t bear to. I was not ready to talk practicalities just yet, and there was no one at the clinic to call for the sake of talking. Besides, we were due to go back for a scan the following week.In the following days, the bleeding didn’t stop, but it didn’t get worse, either. Even so, I couldn’t shake the thought that, at eight weeks pregnant, this was the exact same point I had miscarried the last three times. Dan and I made our contingencies. It was early December, and we were due to move house in a few days, and we discussed how we would fit surgery around the move, if it turned out to be bad news. I bought sanitary pads and wine. We pretended we were sanguine. We pretended we knew how we would cope. “We’re pros now,” we joked. I barely slept the night before the appointment.On 4 December, my mum came with us to the hospital and managed to keep up a steady patter about her cycling, her knitting and the roadworks on the A14 while we waited. I knew she wanted to distract me. But the only words my brain had space for were the ones I was convinced I was about to hear for a fifth time: I’m so sorry there is no heartbeat. I’m so sorry there is no heartbeat.When we were finally called in for the scan, I explained to the sonographer that I was anxious. That I’d been bleeding. I tried not to look at the print on the wall of the room – the same room we were in last time – of a red heart, printed in swirly faux-brushstrokes. I tried not to think what I thought last time: how fucking inappropriate that is. A heart, for when there is no heartbeat.I lay down on the bed and unbuttoned my jeans. Dan held my hand. I was braced for the words: So sorry. So sorry. Except they didn’t come. The sonographer was telling us that everything looked fine. She turned the screen towards us, and she was pointing out the flickering heartbeat. She was telling us that I was measuring in at nine weeks and one day. The baby was moving. And I was crying.Did I dare to believe that the progesterone was actually working? The possibility loomed in my mind that our miscarriages really had been “just” bad luck all along. At least one of our losses was down to a chromosomal abnormality known as a triploidy: essentially an extra set of chromosomes. One cause of this is an egg being fertilised by two sperm at once – as random and unavoidable as that.About two weeks after it started, the bleeding waned and our clinic suggested it was time we transferred to our local hospital for antenatal care and the 12-week dating scan. (This is normally the first scan people have on the NHS, at the end of the first trimester, and it’s used to check the foetus’s health and estimate the due date.) On the one hand, this felt like an achievement – we had never made it this far before – but on the other, it meant leaving the relative security of the specialist clinic, where everyone understands why you don’t want to think further ahead than the next appointment.Feeling like fledglings pushed from the nest, we had to brave the official NHS booking-in appointment, which involved giving our medical histories to the local midwifery team and some routine screening tests. We have done this twice before, during previous pregnancies, when we knew and worried less. Two days after the second one, I bled out the tiny embryo on our bed at home. I hadn’t dared make this particular appointment since.We got our all-important appointment for the dating scan, a little over two weeks away – delayed slightly by the Christmas break. Time passed twitchily. We congratulated ourselves for not miscarrying on Christmas Eve, on Christmas Day, on Boxing Day.On 30 December, six hours before the scan, I read a note from the hospital that said you have to pay £5 for a copy of the scan photo. Fleetingly, I debated getting some cash out, but decided this would be jinxing things. At the hospital, I squeaked my name to the receptionist. We were early. This may have been our 12-week scan, but it had taken us 48 weeks of pregnancy to get here. I really wasn’t sure if I could wait another 20 minutes.I had my spiel prepared for the sonographer – “a bit anxious” … “four miscarriages”.“Thank you for telling me,” she said, as I lay down. There was the briefest of pauses. “OK, here’s your baby.”Whereas in previous pregnancies there had only been cavernous blackness on the ultrasound monitor, now there was wobbling movement the grey outline of a head and a tiny, round tummy – a waving, wondrous sea creature emerging from the dark.“They’re a wriggler,” the sonographer told us, smiling. I gripped Dan’s hand and we watched as the baby – I will try to call it a baby from now on – somersaulted for us. For the first time, we left an antenatal unit with a scan photo and stepped out into entirely new territory.On 14 March, we hit 24 weeks, which is deemed the point of “viability” – that is, when a foetus is theoretically capable of surviving outside the womb. Whatever was going to happen to us from now on, it would not be classified as a miscarriage. Keeping this baby alive would no longer be down to my body alone. Should anything happen, doctors would have to at least try to intervene. These were not comforting thoughts exactly, but they were something.Ten days later, the whole of the UK went into coronavirus lockdown. The weekend we had quietly celebrated reaching viability also turned out to be the last weekend I would see anyone but my husband or a healthcare professional for a long time.The initial days of confinement were softened by activity and preparation: batch-cooking, arranging deliveries, cancelling plans. I comforted myself by reading the official Covid-19 guidance from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists over and over: “There is no evidence to suggest an increased risk of miscarriage … Pregnant women are still no more likely to contract coronavirus than the general population.”Slowly, though, as I watched the number of reported cases and deaths rise, marooned on the sofa at home, fear seeped under the door. Not a day has gone by, since finding out I was pregnant again, that I have not worried that my baby might die. But now, during a global pandemic, those nebulous anxieties hardened into something nameable. The shadow on the nursery wall had taken a solid shape.I woke up one night in the first week of lockdown feeling hot, my throat tight. This is it, I thought – I’ve caught it. I had barely been outside for a fortnight, though I did get my hair cut a few days before lockdown was declared. And so the taunt went round and around in my head, as I stared at the ceiling unable to sleep: your baby could die, and all for the sake of your split ends. In the rational light of day (and feeling fine), I concluded it had probably been heartburn.The world shrank. I baked bread and planted herbs. I silenced notifications and deleted social media accounts from my phone. I tracked my daily steps and counted my baby’s kicks using an app. Mixed in with the fear and stress of uncertainty, there was also a guilty kind of sadness for the things I would not get to do – things I had dreamed of for so long: a “last” holiday as a couple, showing off my bump in my first maternity dress, meeting new “mum friends” for coffee.People phoned to ask how we were coping, but it felt selfish to admit to such small sadnesses, when there were bigger worries: for my brother, who had to postpone his wedding for my cousin, who is a nurse for our four grandmothers, who all live alone. Then there were the worries of people I don’t know, but who could so easily have been us: those who have had their fertility treatment cancelled, or who will be told they have miscarried during scan appointments they have had to attend alone, in order to protect other patients and NHS staff. At the time of writing, hospitals were being advised not to offer extra scans in early pregnancy, even for people with a history of miscarriages.On 17 April, week four of lockdown, I attended an appointment for a 28-week routine growth scan by myself, while Dan, following the new rules, waited in the car. A security guard at the door checked my name off a list. The sonographer and midwife I saw wore masks and visors, while the doctor conducted my appointment from the opposite end of the consulting room. I projected my voice, like a bad stage actor: “No, no family history of diabetes”, and so on.On some days, it has felt as though the pandemic has brought my experience of pregnancy closer to the curve of normality. For so long, I had felt as if I was only playing at pregnancy, like a small girl with a cushion up her jumper. I couldn’t trust that I would get to do things other pregnant women take for granted. But then, suddenly, no one else was going to antenatal classes, throwing baby showers or browsing department stores for the perfect pram either.The temptation, when you get to where we are now, still pregnant after so many losses – and in the shadow of loss on a global scale – is to start talking about miracles. But I don’t believe in miracle babies any more. I believe we should be able to put our faith in the evidence, in knowledge of how our bodies work – or don’t work. That waiting and hoping isn’t enough. Even so, as I sit here, in my fifth pregnancy, in the third trimester, wearing my very first pair of maternity jeans, feeling our baby kick inside me, it is hard not to consider it a wonder that any of us gets to be here at all. Especially when there is still so much we don’t know.• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/edb47f7b629d5abfd62ebf9f6be39341fd404813/60_0_3761_2257/master/3761.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=68d6d9c81759030deea72b764450dc29","title":"latitude refund festival ticket coronavirus","story":"The event was not cancelled until last week amid the coronavirus crisis, worrying some ticket holdersThe organisers of the Latitude festival in Suffolk (from 16–18 July) are still saying they plan to go ahead. I have a ticket (which cost £230) and was really looking forward to it, but I find this worrying in the current circumstances.We all have a duty to support the NHS by maintaining social distancing. Why does Latitude feel it is able to go ahead safely when almost all other events (football matches, Wimbledon, Edinburgh fringe, Glastonbury) have cancelled?I would prefer not to go and to get a refund for my ticket, but its website makes clear that it will not offer refunds while the event is still going ahead. That is simply wrong. To withhold money that people, in the current climate, need, and to put profit before people? Either they are going to go ahead, endanger staff and performers and force punters to make the choice of endangering their community or losing their money. Or they are not going ahead and are withholding money that ticketholders are entitled to. Please can you put pressure on them to cancel, do the right thing, and refund ticket buyers’ money? This has damaged my trust in the organisers.You contacted us in early April, at which time the Latitude website said the event was still going ahead. We got in touch with organisers Festival RepublicLive Nation at that stage, but despite numerous requests for information and clarification, nobody got back to us.However, on Monday Latitude announced that it was cancelled, saying: “We’ve been closely monitoring this unprecedented situation and it’s become clear that it’s just not possible for this year’s festival to go ahead.”You are among thousands of fans with tickets who are now being offered a refund or the chance to roll over their ticket to next year.Its agent, Ticketmaster, has been emailing all ticketholders, saying they will all be automatically refunded unless they contact it to specifically ask to transfer their ticket over to the new 2021 date. Ticketmaster says it expects all refunds to be processed by 25 May.Meanwhile, Reading and Leeds Festivals (in August) and Electric Picnic (in September) are still going ahead.

Today brings the tea boy who became a star, high camp’s finest hour – and the most minimal chart topper ever. Check back weekdays for more picksby  Ben Beaumont-Thomas,  Alexis Petridis and  Laura SnapesAs the coronavirus lockdown continues, the ’s music desk thought you might be in need of a distraction – something to send you down memory lane, or to ert the annoyance at your housemates or children on to us. We present to you a ranking of the 100 greatest UK No 1 singles since the charts began in 1952.We’ll be counting this down over six weeks – for the first two weeks, we’ll spend Monday to Thursday counting down 10 at a time. That takes us up to the Top 20, and from Monday to Friday for four weeks we’ll have standalone celebrations of each remaining song by our team of critics.This list, and the songs’ order, was compiled via a politely raging video call between me, chief rock and pop critic Alexis Petridis and deputy music editor Laura Snapes. The ranking isn’t based on sales or longevity, it’s the fruit of that discussion: what we as critics, fans and lifetime listeners think are the most brilliant songs to top the UK charts, and, of those, which are more brilliant than others. The only rule was that an artist could only feature once.As such, it is very much open to discussion, which we heartily encourage in the comments section. We’d love to hear what you think of our choices – whether in agreement or outrage – and hear your fond or not-so-fond memories of these singles. After we’ve reached No 1, we’ll ask what you think we unforgivably missed out from the overall list, and then publish highlights from your selections. Also, note that dates listed are the dates the songs reached No 1.You could spend years arguing about what constitutes the first rock’n’roll record. Rock Around the Clock patently isn’t it, but it was, incontrovertibly, the record that brought rock’n’roll to mainstream attention in the UK: two minutes of music that sounded infinitely more feral than its avuncular artist looked and that changed pop music for ever. APBy disavowing the hollow opulence and bloated scale of pop’s reigning class, Lorde accidentally ushered in a brand new one: there would be no Billie Eilish if not for her conspiratorial incantations. While she weathered accusations of appropriation for disavowing hip-hop cliches in her obviously rap-influenced delivery, she ultimately echoed the genre’s own move towards unvarnished portrayals of teenage disaffection instigated by a parallel wave of SoundCloud upstarts. As much a generational bellwether as a pop classic. LSRecorded in a Coventry front room, Mouldy Old Dough sounds like pop music made by people who have never actually heard pop music, but have had it described to them by someone who didn’t really know what they were talking about: pub piano, growled vocals, a beat that recalls a drunk doggedly staggering home. The weirdness of 70s Britain in musical form. APIf you wanted evidence of how far out, how unbound by the usual rules reggae was, you could find it at the top of the charts in early 1971: a piano line taken – sampled if you like – from Ramsey Lewis a vocalist who largely grunted and bellowed incomprehensibly in the style of a Jamaican deejay: “I am the magnificent W-O-O-O!” It still sounds fantastic. APThe pinnacle of Roy Orbison’s career as rock’s great tragedian: three astonishing, inconsolable minutes during which stars cry, rainbows weep, golden days are sorrowfully recalled and drums beat a leaden funeral march, before it all reaches a terrible climax, Orbison desperately repeating the title as if misery is a kind of catharsis. APIt won’t be too much of a spoiler to reveal that this is the only No 1 single in this list that concerns how the brutally uncaring nature of new technology can paradoxically deepen nostalgia while rendering the past irrelevant. Trevor Horn and co turned this material into postmodern gold, building jingles, prog, orchestral pop and more into a screwball fantasy. That cold steady kick drum, meanwhile, is like techno kicking the door down to take over pop culture. BBTAfter a fitfully successful start, this was the song to turn the Kosovan-British pop singer into a global star. You can almost feel her clamp a hand on your shoulder as she adopts a stern, schoolmarmish tone to dispense those rules for breakup survival: don’t answer your ex’s calls, let them pop round or even be their friend. She’s not telling us or her mates, though, but rather herself, making for a powerful pop psychodrama. BBTBehind the simple, perky rock’n’roll facade – “the ultimate fairground anthem”, as writer Bob Stanley put it – there’s something disturbing about Del Shannon’s biggest hit: an eeriness about the rumble of the opening guitar chords and the echoing keyboard solo, a sense the vocal is slightly too impassioned and pained. The result is as compelling a single as 1961 produced. APHad These Boots Are Made for Walkin’ been sung by a man, as its author, Lee Hazlewood, had intended, it would just have been nasty. Sung with insouciant cool by the recently orced Nancy Sinatra, however, it became something else entirely: camp but tough, funny but fierce, completely irresistible. APSaturday Night just pipped Gina G’s Ooh Aah … Just a Little Bit to our 90s Eurobanger slot. First off, it’s an actual Eurobanger (not an Aussie impersonator), and like the Village People’s YMCA, it has a dance routine invented by fans that came to define the song. It’s got an immediately iconic tag (“dee dee da da da!”), plus it was the victor in one of pop’s funniest plagiarism cases: I want some of whatever the person who thinks this sounds like Lindisfarne’s Fog on the Tyne was having. LSThere will be howls of protestation at Bieber being on this list, a man routinely cited as everything that is facile about pop and celebrity. Well, he’s had his moments, but this is one of his equally frequent triumphs. Taking the Insta-filtered aesthetic of the then-popular tropical house sound and marrying it to a melody that flits like a bird of paradise always coming back to its perch, it has the melancholically fleeting beauty of a package holiday sunset. BBTProducer Richard X gets a lot of credit for the shuddering magnitude of invention behind the Sugababes’ debut UK No 1 – the first legit single of the 2000s bootleg wave, bringing together Adina Howard and Tubeway Army – but not all of it. The newly minted trio of Mutya, Keisha and Heidi pull off a more convincing “I’m grown now” transition than any of their American pop peers, thanks to the terrifying nonchalance innate to British teenage girls. It’s got a classic belting “may-ee!” (that’s “me” in millennial pop terms) and without it, you wouldn’t have Sound of the Underground – or, even, possibly, whisper it, Toxic. LSLike the Old Testament God, Craig chills on a Sunday, but unlike the Old Testament God, he spends Monday and Tuesday engineering sex and spends the rest of the days until the sabbath having it. We looked upon his creation and saw that it was good: his vocals, drilled in the dexterity of the garage rave, twine around delicate acoustic guitar lines like two lovers in Eden. BBTEvery part of Adamski’s production is perfectly designed: the sad chords, the funkily interrupted alien transmission of the synths, the prodding bassline with its edges almost imperceptibly corroded by acid. Most beautiful of all is Seal: half activist, half oracle. BBTThe product of producer Joe Meek’s twin obsessions – space travel and the recording studio as an instrument in itself – Telstar is otherworldly and breathlessly exciting, piling on layer after layer of sounds so dense with effects it is impossible to work out what instrument is making them. It’s like nothing else, before or since. APThis will get you thinking, “I miss the old Kanye” – the rapper’s touristic whirl through Ribena, wags and the epithet “rubbish” is full of wit with just a touch of his incoming megalomania. Estelle is even better, perfectly capturing the mood of uncertain excitement at a potential American lover: “Like the way he speaking, his confidence is peaking  Don’t like his baggy jeans but I might like what’s underneath them.” The bump of will.i.am’s cosmic funk production launches it into the transatlantic skies. BBTDecades of ubiquity have dulled the impact of I Will Survive, but the song only became ubiquitous in the first place because it connected with so many people so directly. The strings soar, the lyrics project defiance in the face of a controlling ex-partner, who’s tried chancing his arm again: “I’m not that chained up little person still in love with you.” API Will Survive recast in hi-tech 90s dance-pop, complete with that notorious Auto-Tune wiggle to Cher’s voice. The effect is actually used sparingly, and the song’s wild success – 11m copies sold worldwide – is not down to anything gimmicky. Rather, it’s all very old-fashioned stuff that ensures Believe will be hollered in cheese nights for evermore: a powerhouse melody Cher uses to dispense a kind of den-mother wisdom. BBT“But I don’t look back,” Robyn insists over and over on her only UK chart-topper, though the racing arpeggiated synths, never resolving to the home key, tell a different story: one of someone doomed to the purgatory of heartbreak, or worse, revelling in it (a Greek chorus of strings charged with Kate Bush’s DNA outlines the tragedy). “And – it – hurts – with – ev – er – y – heart – beat,” Robyn pants, and you feel it, each syllable landing like a tombstone. LSFor someone who admits how hopeless he was at romance, Elton John couldn’t half-sell a love song. Are You Ready for Love? runs the gamut of emotions as he tries to win someone over: he’s casually cool about devotion yet awed by it grandiose in his overtures, then almost manically overcome by fear that this person might not, in fact, be ready for love. The Thom Bell-assisted Philly soul production festoons John with strings, hand percussion, wah-wah guitar, key changes – in a sense perfectly echoing the maximalist, hasty approach to seduction that John has said he practised at the peak of his career. It’s extraordinary that it took 24 years and a football advert to make it a hit. LSThis wasn’t the stuff of high-speed swerving grime bars. Instead, Dave and Fredo use steady, perfectly calibrated flows to set themselves apart from the London MCs one generation above them, set to minimalist trap. The effect is of being told something extra clearly, as if you haven’t understood: a brilliantly withering technique. Rap’s status as a core part of British pop culture was consolidated. BBTThe pop charts were particularly dominated by sweeping, sentimental ballads until the mid-1960s, and there are PhDs to be written on the effect on pop music of a sexually repressed culture of manners. Anyway, many such ballads are suffocatingly schmaltzy, but this one is sublime. It was written by Trent with Tony Hatch, a somewhat forgotten genius of this period who shared Burt Bacharach’s knack for orchestral drama. The pair had an affair, with Hatch leaving his wife and marrying Trent – this collaboration is full of that impetuous, untameable ardour. BBTIt’s unclear whether Thunderclap Newman thought they were making a kind of eulogy for 60s counterculture, but that’s how Something in the Air turned out. Its music is ineffably melancholy, its insistence that “the revolution’s here”, a year after the hippy dream had curdled, sounds desperate and hopeless. Intentional or not, it’s really moving. APPerhaps it takes not having lived through the 80s heyday of new age, then its subsequent ubiquity and mockery to appreciate Orinoco Flow as the compositional marvel it is. Yes, the lyrics are incredibly silly – but the layered pizzicato shimmer transforms Enya’s dippy travelogue into a true pop mirage, stoking its allure as her siren song constantly slips further out of reach. LSThe lyrics are essentially a QVC infomercial for the eroto-psychedelic effects of ecstasy – “Lotions of love flow through your hands  See visions, colours every day” – and the music is shamelessly designed to intensify drug experiences. The junglist breakbeats keep the energy high, while the big piano chords and yearning vocals are like a head massage from some bloke you just met but nevertheless now feel a deeper kinship with than your immediate family. BBTChannelling Bach and the Beats, the trippy imagery of this 10m seller made it a fave of those turning on and tuning in during the Summer of Love. But the Hammond organ creates a valedictory mood as the drug epiphanies betray their lies – “Although my eyes were open  They might have just as well’ve been closed” – and the entitlement and rapacity of the now widely hated Worst Generation becomes clear: “I was feeling kinda seasick  But the crowd called out for more.” A funeral hymn, then, but no less beautiful for it. BBTYou can imagine an older relative calling this “a proper song” – unfussy and instantly classic, where the quality of Eg White’s composition gives it automatic promotion to a different league. Young negotiates the middle eight’s key changes with the same sad certainty he negotiates his emotions, choosing self-preservation over a second chance at love. BBTThe softest of soft rock, If You Leave Me Now doesn’t seem to play so much as glide along, wrapped in a blanket of French horns and strings, the drummer tapping so gently it sounds as if he’s trying not to wake someone up. It’s impossibly lush and beautifully written, but its sadness is pervasive and affecting. APThe heaviest, sweariest No 1 in UK history – with one of the best riffs, too – only reached No 25 when it was first released in 1992, but reached the top in 2009 after a grassroots campaign from people angry at a run of X Factor contestants dominating the Christmas No 1 race. Its “Fuck you, I won’t do what you tell me” climax, aimed at authority figures from the police to parents for years, was gleefully beamed at Simon Cowell in a great moment for British democracy. BBTAlmost 25 years down the line, Wannabe sounds so rinky-dink and innocent (save the “zig-a-zig-ah”, which continues up a lineage of sexy pop nonsense started by Little Richard’s “a-wop-bop-a-loo-bop-a-lop-bam-boom!” almost four decades prior) that it’s almost inconceivable it was considered such a threat at the time. But it was: in two minutes, 53 seconds, these five women undid tween pop’s raison d’etre – seducing girls into a life of domesticity via parades of harmless male crushes – and rewrote it in their own chaotic, girls-first spirit. LSDance music No 1s almost always bang, but this one pumps: a deep-house anthem of huge subtlety and power. The way the rhythm-guitar line insinuates itself, only to be subsumed by those cut-up strings, mirrors Cassandra’s audible bafflement at being taken over by a love she doesn’t understand. The confusing rush of ecstasy, in every sense, has never been so beautifully evoked. BBTDance-pop in the 90s often traded in profound melancholy – Haddaway’s What Is Love and Corona’s Rhythm of the Night being other classic examples – and Rhythm Is a Dancer is one of the saddest of all. With its gospel vocals and cathedral-ready chords, it makes raving feel like a serious spiritual quest rather than something to do on a Friday. BBTPop holds few greater pleasures than seeing a pop song about the power of pop songs take on that kind of lure itself. In Come on Eileen, Kevin Rowland reflects on the sad songs beloved by a downtrodden generation and promises his crush they’ll hum a different tune. Come on Eileen became that song: a romp through wistfulness, bonhomie and knees-up antics that distils the riotous emotional arc of a night in an Irish pub into three-and-a-half perfect minutes. LSMatching disco a Loleatta Holloway for lung power is near impossible but M People’s Heather Small – working incognito after Italian producers Black Box were refused a Holloway sample – blows the house down, and her “let me tell you, what you do to me” is so sexily intense. This is a Terminator of a song, unstoppably delivering a payload of pure euphoria as Chicago house is spliced with Italo disco to create perfect pop. BBTIt’s testament to time’s steady erosion that a song about an obsessive fan who murdered his pregnant girlfriend and killed himself because his favourite rapper didn’t notice him has become a casual byword for effusive devotion. Coming full circle, Stan is worthy of it. It’s the peak of Eminem’s storytelling skill and – in spite of the clear misanthropy of the titular fan – profoundly empathetic, as Eminem tempers Stan’s violence by understanding the desperation fuels it. LSA depressing economy of sex and power, observed with simmering beta-male jealousy, is sketched in just 12 lines over a melody that has the perfect symmetry of a model’s face. Computer Love, the exquisite other half of this double A-side, is another portrait of loneliness but couldn’t be more different: it is tender and naively yearning. BBTToo often discarded as a novelty hit, 99 Red Balloons is the best pop song about cold war anxiety in a field full of try-hard duds, and a chart-topping coronation for the tough, peppy new wave sound being pioneered by the Go-Go’s, the Bangles and the Waitresses. (The original German version is still the best, however.) LSA fabulously bitchy kiss-off to the three members of Cockney Rebel who left the band after their 1974 album The Psychomodo, the genius of Make Me Smile (Come Up and See Me) is to couch its screw-you message in the sunniest, most charming, irresistibly hook-laden music imaginable. APJailhouse Rock was intended as a joke by writers Leiber and Stoller, complete with a nudging reference to gay sex. Elvis, however, ignored the comic undercurrent, and sang it with such blazing intensity that the performance almost collapses at 1:14. If you want a No 1 that captures his early, feral power, this is it. APMost mid-00s indie nostalgia is tinged with shame: the polka dots, bad fringes and herky-jerky dancing have not dated well. But Arctic Monkeys’ debut single proper is something to look back on with pride – not because, as the NME of the era would have it, it represented any kind of jingoistic “victory” for indie over pop, but because its rattling potency and Alex Turner’s lyrics distil the pleasures of that era worth remembering: “Just bangin’ tunes and DJ sets and  Dirty dancefloors and dreams of naughtiness.” LSAfter all that Ariana Grande had been through – the Manchester Arena bombing, the death of a beloved ex, a broken engagement – she could have released 10 minutes of primal screaming and still left critics saying: yeah, fair enough. Instead, she changed the game: after the more stateswomanly Sweetener album released earlier that year, surprise return Thank U, Next accelerated pop’s processing speed (particularly liberating female pop stars in the process) and quashed the idea that empowerment is contingent on taking someone else down. Its nimbleness is the sound of Grande’s freedom. LS“Breaking up is so very hard to do” – this Burt Bacharach-penned ballad opens with a wry bit of understatement from Scott Walker, and he deals with things very magnanimously from here on out: a stiff upper lip in song. The way the choir, timpani, strings, horns, guitars and more all stay meringue-fluffy in the arrangement is Bacharach just showing off, really. BBTOriginally written for Britney Spears, although it’s inconceivable to imagine her doing it. Umbrella needs swagger and Rihanna had it in spades, turning a stunted beat and a lyric that’s pretty dorky on paper into one of pop’s great come-ons. It’s a skill that earned Rihanna a deserved place in the pantheon of pop icons. LSEric Stewart wrote I’m Not in Love after his wife, Gloria, complained that he didn’t say “I love you” often enough – not out of petulance, but to express his depth of feeling for her beyond the cliche. After a labour-intensive recording process featuring endless harmonising and dozens of feet of tape loops, 10cc came away with this work of stubborn beauty: a sublime, shimmering evocation of the ineffable bond between two lovers. It endures in every sense: Stewart and Gloria have been married for more than 50 years. LSA posthumous chart-topper after her death in a plane crash when she was 22, More Than a Woman is one of the trio of masterpiece singles she made with Timbaland, along with We Need a Resolution and Try Again. Into the producer’s serpentine frameworks stepped a woman whose calm, exacting poise let you come to her rather than she to you. It never gets less wrenching to think what else she might have done. BBTAh, the song of the summer. Its lustre has been dulled by it being played by every wedding band in the western hemisphere (and by Limmy’s eternally funny tweet), but Get Lucky still shines underneath it all. Take it off the alcopop-splashed CDJs and back into headphones and you can newly appreciate its mastery, with the liveness of Nile Rodgers’ guitar and Pharrell’s conversational charm. BBTOn one hand, All the Things She Said is the ne plus ultra of queerbaiting: two straight Russian teenagers cajoled into lesbian cosplay by some dodgy-sounding svengalis. But as ersatz as their ardour was, the duo’s debut UK single was charged with a perfect evocation of the frantic emotional tumult that rages in every closeted, yearning teenager’s head. An industrial cri de cœur with a brilliantly desperate synth climax, it was the greatest Trevor Horn banger since his mid-80s sweet spot. LSThe boy band – well, Gary Barlow – had already shown they could do serious and affecting balladry with A Million Love Songs, and then they perfectly honed that skill for this classic breakup song. There’s real poetry in the verses, which gives way to the devastating plainness of the chorus, like 100 red roses left at a doorstep. Barlow goes for total abasement, though – “Whenever I’m wrong  Just tell me the song and I’ll sing it” – so you don’t really fancy his chances. BBTYou might think using crisp drum machines and eerie synths to cover a northern soul anthem would make it more brittle, but Soft Cell’s version of Gloria Jones’s 1964 song actually has more swing and sensuality. There’s something portentous about those insistent, fateful synth stabs, and Marc Almond adds to the sense of doom with his innate flair for drama. BBTTo watch Top of the Pops as 1987 gives way to 1988 is to watch the freaks taking over the asylum: after MARRS and Bomb the Bass’s earlier acid house hits, S-Express’s sample-heavy track affirmed the sound’s chart coronation, making the Stock Aitken Waterman stable look even more square, and stuck one in the eye of London’s throttlingly cool club scene with its euphoric, queer collage. LSIt’s hard to imagine now how strange and alien Jack Your Body sounded in 1987. Other early house hits had at least come with a song or a hook attached, but this had neither: it may be the most minimal No 1 of all time. It isn’t by any stretch of the imagination the best Chicago had to offer in 1987: as a signal of a vast shift in the way pop music sounded, it’s unbeatable. APA half-cover of the Beatles’ Tomorrow Never Knows but with that band’s LSD juiced up with some kind of experimental steroid, Setting Sun still sounds extreme. Lighting up that breakbeat and demonically heaving harmonium riffs are rockets and catherine wheels of wild sound, with Noel Gallagher sounding as if he’s being dragged out of sanity. BBTA new high-water mark of commercial success for British rap was set by this incandescently brilliant wave of London MCs, each given 21 seconds of time on the mic. The energy stays permanently high, but is filtered through such distinct characters: Harvey’s rave MC, Romeo’s lascivious loverman, Kaish’s jabbing boxer, Face’s bug-eyed vampire and more. BBTThe first attempt to make Suzi Quatro a star, with the light pop of Rolling Stone, fell flat: second time around, with writersproducers Chinn and Chapman in control, everything clicked. From its opening wall of drums to Quatro’s scream of “scratch out her eyes” to its lyrically baffling but indelible chorus, Can the Can is glam-pop perfection. APEveryone with even a glancing interest in pop knows Bohemian Rhapsody, which means its sheer audacity is easy to overlook. It’s a completely inexplicable, extraordinary single, a joke that got out of hand according to producer Roy Thomas Baker, a preposterous exercise in high camp with demented lyrics, that somehow still exerts a huge emotional pull. APThe charts in 1970 were rich with hymn-like songs solemnly marking the passing of the 60s – not least the Beatles’ Let It Be – but Bridge Over Troubled Water was the blockbuster take: five minutes of booming, Phil Spector-inspired white gospel with a choirboy vocal and a simple, universal message beneath the sturm und drang. APMore fool the person who thought up Rickrolling, believing chance exposure to Never Gonna Give You Up to be some kind of punishment: the Stock Aitken Waterman tea boy’s star-making moment couldn’t be less cool or more glorious, his good-boy Redcoat brogue the cheese to SAW’s soulful, acid pickle. And, hey, if it was good enough for Larry Levan … LSThe 80s began in British pop when the stately, epic Are “Friends” Electric? arrived on Top of the Pops in June 1979: two synth players, Gary Numan looking puzzled, as if he didn’t understand how a song with no chorus had become a hit. He was six months early, but Numan was always ahead of his time: oft-mocked, his alienated-suburbanite-in-a-world-of-technology schtick now seems remarkably prescient. APGaga’s third UK No 1 outshines earlier hits Just Dance and Poker Face as the apex of her tectonic, Teutonic first-phase battering rams. While it’s heavily indebted to Depeche Mode and Madonna, Gaga’s weapons-grade persona turns a homage into a conquest, tagging everything in her wake with a lusty “Gaga, ooh la la.” LSOne of the greatest Christmas No 1s of all time is a triumph of emotional candour. It resembles a breakup song with its talk of final kisses, but was written by Tony Mortimer after his brother killed himself. The pain of those sudden calls of “stay now” is so acute, voicing the suddenness of loss.

Samanth Subramanian explores the newly distorted marketplace for masks and the lengths some will go to get themWhen the coronavirus began spreading beyond China in January, the race to buy up any available protective face masks went global.

A statement released on behalf of Formby on Monday said: “When I applied for the role of general secretary in 2018 it was because I wanted to support Jeremy Corbyn, who inspired so many people to get involved in politics with his message of hope, equality and peace.“It has been a huge privilege to be general secretary of the largest political party in Europe for the last two years, but now we have a new leadership team it is the right time to step down.“I would like to thank Jeremy, our members and my staff colleagues who have given me so much support during what has been a very challenging period, in particular when I was suffering from ill-health.“I wish Keir and Angela the very best of luck in taking the party forward and leading Labour to victory at the next general election.”Formby, a former Unite official and close associate of Len McCluskey, took over as general secretary, the party’s most senior employee, in March 2018. She received treatment for breast cancer last year.Allies of Starmer had said privately her resignation would be key to allowing the new leader to control the direction of the party.A meeting of the national executive committee will be expected to set a timetable to elect a new general secretary.Potential candidates to succeed Formby are thought to include the Unite political director, Anneliese Midgley, the Unison official Emilie Oldknow and GMB’s director of external relations, Lisa Johnson.Allies of Oldknow and Johnson say it is no coincidence that they have been linked to recent controversies after they were flagged as potential successors to Formby.Oldknow has been accused making inappropriate comments about colleagues in the controversial antisemitism report being investigated by the NEC.Johnson has been closely connected to Tim Roache, the recently resigned GMB general secretary who is under investigation for inappropriate conduct. Her supporters insist she was among the senior figures pushing for his resignation in recent days.Formby’s resignation means that most of left of the party, which until December’s general election controlled all key positions, have been removed.Focus will now fall on whether Karie Murphy, another key Corbyn ally, will remain as a senior member of the party’s leadership.Responding to the decision, Starmer said: “I would like to thank Jennie for her service, and for the personal and professional efforts she has made in advancing the cause she has fought all her life for.“Jennie has led our party’s organisation with commitment and energy through a period of political upheaval, including a snap general election last year. I wish her the very best for the future.”Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, said: “As a trade unionist and party activist as well as general secretary, Jennie has been a great servant of our movement for many years and blazed a trail as one of our highest achieving women.“She goes with our thanks and gratitude, and I’ve no doubt she will stand squarely behind us as we continue to fight for social justice and the Labour government our country so desperately needs.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/740ce47955049948ba812aec94544da8689695fd/0_0_4972_2984/master/4972.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=461992622bd9fe3fdadd9fc176e937ae","title":"labour general secretary starmers runners and riders","story":"Potential candidates for the role vacated by Jennie Formby at the top of the party machineWhoever becomes Labour’s next general secretary will have to win over most of the party’s national executive committee, where Sir Keir Starmer now commands a slim majority. Here are some potential candidates for the role.Chief of staff to Starmer, with strong local government connections, the former campaign director of Liz Kendall’s failed leadership bid would be a popular choice among MPs and those loyal to the new leader. But he may struggle to win support from the unions, who traditionally occupy the role of general secretary.Among the favourites to replace Formby, the director of external relations at the GMB union is known as an extremely capable backroom dealer who has guided the union through tricky times with employers and Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party. Her allies say she was among union officials who urged the GMB’s general secretary, Tim Roache, to step down last week.The Unison official and Labour’s executive director for governance, membership and party services was seen as a frontrunner for the job until a controversial leaked antisemitism report claimed she had made inappropriate comments about colleagues. She has denied any wrongdoing.A popular member of Jeremy Corbyn’s 2015 leadership campaign, she would be expected to command the support of many on the left of the party. She may suffer objections from some Starmer supporters because, like Formby, she is a Unite-backed official and is closely associated with Corbyn ally Len McCluskey.Scottish Labour’s former general secretary stood down in August after a row about the party’s position on a second independence referendum. He has been mentioned as a possible candidate by some on the right of the party.Some Labour sources have hinted that Starmer may wish to break with tradition and look for a candidate outside the party – an organiser from a third-sector body who will shake up the structures of the party without setting up their own power base."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d726785cfde8949db9788b814546ecd2ec14951/435_322_2939_1764/master/2939.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7de5cee8e0a5916e4aeb0ee7834c930","title":"no 10 facing fresh calls for transparency over sage pandemic advice","story":"Government publishes names of 50 members of experts’ group but list is incompleteDowning Street is facing fresh calls for transparency about the expert advice it receives after it published the names of 50 experts who sit on the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), which discusses how to handle the coronavirus epidemic.The list of names, which is not complete, was released after critics raised questions about the secrecy of Sage and the  revealed that Boris Johnson’s chief political adviser, Dominic Cummings, had played an active role in Sage meetings.The group’s membership and the nature of its advice have come under scrutiny, with critics arguing that Britain has botched key aspects of its pandemic response even as ministers claimed they were following “the best science”.The list contains the bulk of the Sage membership as well as the names of experts who sit on subgroups that specialise in issues such as outbreak modelling, behavioural science and the spread of infection in schools and hospitals.The list includes 24 instances of people asking for their names not to be made public, though some may be duplicates, as experts can sit on more than one group. Two members of Sage asked not to be named.Sir David King, a former chief scientific adviser, has warned that the purity of the scientific advice reaching the prime minister is being put at risk by the presence of political appointees such as Cummings. He said publication of the names was “a good first step” but not enough to reassure people.“What we want to see is what Sage is discussing, what their advice is, what the advice of the scientists is as distinct from that of the strategy advisers. It’s certainly a good step, but there’s a lot more to be done,” he said. On Monday, King convened the first open meeting of an “independent Sage” group, with a dozen experts whose names were made public beforehand.Around half of the members of Sage are scientific advisers from government departments, public health officials and senior NHS staff, with the other half coming from universities, the list shows.The members include David Halpern, head of the Cabinet Office’s behavioural insights team, or “nudge unit”, Prof Venki Ramakrishnan, president of the Royal Society, who attends as chair of the society’s Data Evaluation and Learning for Viral Epidemics (Delve) Group, and Prof David Spiegelhalter, chair of the Winton Centre for Risk and Evidence Communication at Cambridge University.The government stated that while the meetings were “regularly attended by officials from Her Majesty’s government”, their names were excluded from the publication list, though it did not explain why.The advisory group is co-chaired by Sir Patrick Vallance, the government’s chief scientific adviser and Prof Chris Whitty, England’s chief medical officer. The names were not made public before, Vallance has said, because of concerns over members’ personal security and fears of outside influence.James Wilsdon, digital science professor of research policy at Sheffield University, said publication of the names was “a welcome step” adding that “openness and transparency must now become the default operating mode across the Sage process”.“Too much rests on the interpretation of evidence, dilemmas and uncertainties in this crisis for the process to take place behind closed doors,” he said. “We’re in a situation of what some call ‘post-normal’ science, where the facts are uncertain, values are in dispute, stakes are high and decisions are urgent.“We need Sage to respond accordingly, start treating the public as grown-ups, and throw open its workings to wider engagement, debate and scrutiny,” he added.Philip Bath, professor of stroke medicine at Nottingham University, said: “It is very important to see who is involved in Sage and its supporting groups so that the public know who is involved, their expertise and whether they are representative of the population in respect of geography and protected characteristics.”He said he was struck by how many of the experts came from the “golden triangle” of London, Oxford and Cambridge, and why experts were not drawn from around the UK. He said the list should be improved by naming each expert’s “base speciality”, including for those who did not agree to be named.Derek Hill, an expert in medicine and medical device regulation at University College London, said that given the importance of medical devices in dealing with Covid-19, from personal protective equipment to temperature sensors to ventilators, Sage appeared to lack expertise on medical devices and the regulatory system.“This is very relevant as it impacts the risk associated with implementing some aspects of Sage advice, which should be captured in such advice. Such experts are likely to have an engineering background, and are likely to have experience in industries well as academia,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d52629910a249dbd58990c90ea765eef84cb3be1/0_31_7575_4545/master/7575.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=853404f243e5833f27cda5f7006c7e8a","title":"uk behind most european states in tackling coronavirus says agency","story":"Disease control centre delivers blow to Boris Johnson’s claims of successful strategyThe head of the EU’s agency for disease control has warned that the UK is one of five European countries failing to reduce active coronavirus infections, despite Boris Johnson’s claims of success.Andrea Ammon, the director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), suggested on Monday that the UK had yet to progress as far as the majority of European countries in tackling the disease.In evidence to the European parliament’s committee on public health, Ammon said Europe as a whole appeared to have passed the peak of infections on Saturday, with only Bulgaria still experiencing an increase in cases of infection.But she told MEPs that the UK, along with Poland, Romania and Sweden, stood out as showing “no substantial changes in the last 14 days”.“All the others, we really see this substantial decrease,” Ammon said of the cumulative incidence rate, which provides a measure of the prevalence of active cases in the population. She did not offer any explanation of the differences.The ECDC monitors all 27 EU member states plus the UK, Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland.The agency reported that as of Monday there had been 1.2 million confirmed cases of infection, with 136,347 deaths within the territory it monitors.The UK has recorded 186,599 confirmed cases and 28,466 fatalities, a death count second only to Italy, according to the ECDC’s latest data. Only the US has suffered more deaths.Last week, Johnson claimed that Britain had gone past the peak and was “on the downward slope”.The government has warned of the difficulties in making international comparisons, with the Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, insisting that while the government “will have made mistakes” the evidence will need to be assessed in the future.But Ammon’s suggestion that the UK is yet to show the sustained improvement seen elsewhere in Europe offers some grounds for caution as Downing Street seeks to champion its efforts to reduce the rate of infection.It has been suggested in Whitehall that a better insight into the relative success of governments will be found in the increase of excess deaths during the pandemic, rather than just those officially recorded as being related to Covid-19.But an EU-backed project monitoring all excess deaths during the pandemic reported that England had seen the highest rise in deaths over the five-year average compared with Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.She warned, however, against any complacency and suggested that her agency had little confidence that the reporting of deaths and infections was complete.A government spokesman said: “The UK’s approach throughout this pandemic has been guided by the latest scientific evidence.“We have seen a marked decline in both daily confirmed cases and deaths in recent weeks and our published data clearly shows this.“Other countries may be at different stages of the outbreak and there is variety in how they record and report deaths, so comparisons can be unhelpful, inaccurate and misleading”.Researchers at the University of Bonn suggested on Monday that more than 10 times as many people in Germany had probably been infected with the coronavirus than the number of confirmed cases, following a field trial in one of the worst-hit towns."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a667a8295928eabafd49cf1a18371fc94e16358d/0_30_1252_751/master/1252.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b0a6d19d9b8394b29db339eee933f1f2","title":"uk coronavirus live contact tracing app trial begins on isle of wight","story":"Trial begins for new contact-tracing app while government’s top scientists are questioned by MPs Back at the health committee Jeremy Hunt, the chair, turns to the death figures. He addresses Prof Jenny Harries, the deputy chief medical officer for England.Q: Why does the UK’s death rate appear so much higher than other European countries’.Harries says we need to wait until the pandemic is over before we can do a robust comparison. Different countries report deaths in different ways, she says. That makes comparing them “extremely difficult”.She says one way to compared them would be an age-standardised death rate per head of population.But countries do not report figures in this manner, she says.Turning back to the ONS latest weekly death figures (see 9.39am), this is from PA Media, where they have been looking at the figures in more detail.Today’s ONS figures also show there were 29,710 deaths involving Covid-19 in England and Wales up to April 24 (and which were registered up to May 2), compared with 22,173 deaths of people in England and Wales testing positive for Covid-19 reported by the Department of Health \u0026amp Social Care for the same period.This is because the ONS figures include all mentions of Covid-19 on a death certificate, including suspected Covid-19, and are based on the date that deaths occurred.The Department of Health figures are based on when deaths were reported and are for deaths where a person has been tested positive for Covid-19.Vallance says the risk to children is much, much lower than to adults.But he says it is less clear whether children are just not getting the infection, or whether they are getting it but now showing symptoms.Q: Does R have to be falling in regions for the lockdown measures to be lifted? Vallance says R does not vary much. It might be 0.6 in London, and 0.7 elsewhere.One option would be to relax measures locally. There are pros and cons, he says. But you would have to control travel between regions.Q: Is there more risk to regions with low levels of infection, and hence low levels of immunity, from the lockdown being relaxed early?He does not think it is higher than in the mid teens anywhere.He says that means there is nowhere where a large proportion of people might be immune.Q: Has Sage ever given government just one option?Vallance says he doubts that Sage has ever given the government just one option.Back in the health committee, Vallance is asked if Sage always agrees on the advice it gives to ministers.Vallance says ministers make policy. Sage does not make policy. He says ministers make policy informed by the scientific advice.Q: But do you reach a consensus?Vallance says Sage does not just give ministers 16 different opinions.It tries to set out options.But it also explains the uncertainty surrounding those options.Here is an extract from the Sage paper (pdf) prepared for a meeting on 2 April. The note is dated 1 April. The paper advises that the lockdown restrictions should be lifted “very gradually”. It says: To avoid these problems we would advocate trialling easing restrictions very gradually when epidemiologically indicated while clearly explaining why these particular activities are being resumed and how risks must be controlled if these activities are to be maintained. This will also allow an opportunity to gather epidemiological evidence about the impact of easing the restriction and be used to provide evidence to the public about the impact of that restriction. To maintain public trust and support it will be important to have acceptable and equitable criteria for selecting which activities can be resumed. For example, it may be difficult to justify easing restrictions solely for economic activities without any easing of restrictions for low risk activities with significant social and psychological benefit. Back in the health committee Vallance is now talking about masks.He says the evidence suggests that, in terms of preventing wearers from spreading coronavirus to others, the evidence in favour of masks or face coverings is “marginal but positive”.In healthcare settings there is a strong case for masks, he says.He says when people are outdoors, the risk is generally low.But he says there are circumstances in which masks can be useful. He says the risk of infection at one metre away from an infected source is 10 to 30 times higher than at two metres.Here are some lines from the Sage documents published this morning picked up already by journalists. These are from the BBC’s Adam Fleming, the Times’ Chris Smyth, and Nick Eardley and David Shukman from the BBC.Vallance says he is thinking of setting up a sub-group of Sage to look at the economics of the crisis.But he says Sage should not try to be the sum of all knowledge.Government needs to consider advice from other policy perspectives, he says.Q: Is excess deaths the best measure of the impact of coronavirus?Vallance agrees. He says there was an excellent article in the  recently making this point by Prof David Spiegelhalter, a statistician.Prof Chris Whitty, the government’s chief medical adviser, praised the same article at a Downing Street briefing last week. It’s here.Greg Clark, the chair of the Commons science committee, who is contributing to this hearing, goes next.Vallance tells him he wants to get into a “more regular” rhythm of publishing Sage papers. They should not come out only every month. He suggests perhaps every two weeks, with papers being published on a set date.But some papers do not belong to the committee, he says. They come from academics who want to be able to publish them in the usual way.Jeremy Hunt, the chair, says he wants to know why Vallance thought it was wrong to introduce a lockdown when the R was between 2 and 3, if now the priority is to keep it below 1.Vallance says it is more acceptable to have a higher R if the number of cases is smaller.There was a “very rapid” escalation of the numbers in March. And the doubling time suddenly became quicker. That is why the lockdown was essential, he says.Q: The government says it follows the scientific advice. Do you accept that Sage advice must be published?Vallance says he believes in transparency. Sage is publishing information. It has published more this morning. (See 9.25am.)But he says ministers also need advice to make decisions, and they should be able to consider that advice before it has been made public.Q: Do you still think it was right to delay lockdown?Vallance says this is a new disease. We are still learning about it.As for whether we should have done something differently, he says that is a judgment for later. But he says he is in “no doubt” that some things should have been done differently.He says maybe changing the timing by a few days may have made a difference.But he questions whether it would have been right to act three weeks earlier.UPDATE: Here is the full quote from Vallance in response to the question.In terms of what would I do in retrospect, if we knew then what we know now, I think that’s something for the future to look at and certainly there will be times when evidence didn’t allow decisions to be made that you could make now, and there’ll be times at which you look back and say that something might have been done differently, I’ve got no doubt about that.When you look at everything that happened, the speed at which it happened, maybe days either way would have made a difference, but I think it’s difficult to look back and say three weeks was an obvious point to do it, I don’t think that was clear, I don’t think it’s clear now.Sir Patrick Vallance, the government’s chief scientific adviser, has now started giving evidence to the Commons health committee.He said the best estimate of the reproduction number of coronavirus (R - the infectivity rate) is between 0.6 and 0.9.Asked if people who have had it acquire immunity, he said the vast majority of people who had it had acquired antibodies. But he said it was not clear yet how much immunity this gave people. He said “some degree of protection” would be expected, but that this would “almost certainly” not provide absolute immunity.The Office for National Statistics has just published its latest weekly death figures. Here are are the main points.Sir Patrick Vallance, the government’s chief scientific adviser, is about to give evidence to the Commons health committee alongside Prof Jenny Harries, the deputy chief medical officer for England.I’ll be covering the hearing in detail.As usual, there is a good scene-setter in Jack Blanchard’s London Playbook briefing. Here is an excerpt.Following the herd: Vallance is the most senior government figure to have openly discussed the now-notorious concept of “herd immunity” back in those heady pre-lockdown days of mid-March. At the March 12 presser, he said of the virus: “Our aim is not to stop everyone getting it, you can’t do that. And it’s not desirable, because you want to get some immunity in the population. We need to have immunity to protect ourselves from this in the future.” He fleshed this idea out on BBC Radio 4 the following morning, stating: “Our aim is to try and reduce the peak, broaden the peak, not to suppress it completely.

Warped by Victorian romanticism and our antiquated view of women, she has been taught for generations as “the lady with the lamp” who during the Crimean war in 1854 heeded God’s call to travel to Scutari, part of today’s Istanbul. With her small troupe of dedicated nurses, she scrubbed hospital floors, swept away rats, and saw to it that soldiers’ wounds were tended to properly.Yet, she did much more than this. She transformed society for generations through her social activism and intellect. Were she alive today, Nightingale would not be walking, torch in hand, among the patients of the Covid-19 hospitals named after her. She would instead be gazing intently at her laptop, her smartphone holding thousands of texts with the most influential people of the day, from the Queen and the prime minister to mathematicians and epidemiologists. Her computer would be filled with data-laden spreadsheets and she would be having a lively Twitter debate about the reliability of death figures.Of course, the question of what Nightingale would be doing requires a degree of poetic licence. But there are clues within her enormous archive of letters, books and reports that allow the exercise to rise above a flight of fancy.For example, in an 1864 letter to Charles Hathaway, a special sanitary commissioner for Calcutta, she decries the absurdity of politicised health data. “I could not help laughing at your critics who ‘exclude’ specific diseases such as ‘cholera’, accidents ‘proving fatal’ etc. It is very convenient indeed to leave out all deaths that ought not to have happened, as not having happened. And it is certainly a new way of preventing preventable mortality to omit it altogether from any statement of mortality, then they would ‘exclude deaths above 60.’ Their principle, if logically carried out, is simply to throw out all ages and all diseases and then there would be no mortality whatever.”Nightingale would be furious about Donald Trump’s fake data. But she would also fume at Boris Johnson’s early indecision and the UK’s shortages of medical equipment.“The three things which all but destroyed the army in Crimea were ignorance, incapacity, and useless rules and the same thing will happen again, unless future regulations are framed more intelligently, and administered by better informed and more capable officers,” she wrote, exasperated by inept civil servants and politicians.Nightingale came back from Scutari a celebrity. Today, she would have millions of Twitter followers and use her popularity to press and cajole the government to make informed decisions about when to come out of lockdown and how to decrease the enormous death toll in care homes. And also to fundraise for supplies, as she did in her day.Nightingale was born on 12 May, 1820 to a wealthy family. This gave her access to a first-class home education and an erudite network of influential acquaintances ranging from the mathematician Charles Babbage to Sidney Herbert, the secretary of state for war. She had a strong sense of justice and was an immensely studious child who excelled at every subject. But her greatest love was mathematics, particularly statistics. The statistician Karl Pearson wrote that for Nightingale, the study of statistics was a religious duty. “To understand God’s thoughts, she held we must study statistics, for these are the measure of His purpose.”She made her biggest impact by unleashing her quantitative skills on the data she had collected about Scutari. She used her findings and her dogged determination to drive the restructuring of the army medical services and sanitation in the UK, later taking her expertise abroad to as far afield as India and North America. The same data-led approach led her to develop modern nursing – she founded her nursing school at St Thomas’, the same London hospital Johnson was rushed to last month with the coronavirus. She also developed palliative care and midwifery, and to rethink the design of hospital buildings and the civilian health system.Mathematicians and data scientists revere Nightingale as one of history’s most important statisticians. She used data comparisons to find the causes of problems and to make forecasts.But Nightingale knew that data was only as persuasive as the graphs that illustrated them, so she became a pioneer in data visualisation. She made famous the polar area graph, which showed that soldiers in Scutari died of preventable diseases rather than their battle wounds, and that their mortality rate plummeted when a sanitation commission cleaned up the hospital’s infected water supply. She would use the information to save countless more civilians and soldiers from dying because of poor living standards and sanitation at home. In 1858, the woman who was not allowed to attend university because of her gender was elected the first female member of the Royal Statistical Society.Lynn McDonald, the author of numerous books based on Nightingale’s writing, believes Nightingale’s statistically driven ideas of social reform created the early bedrock on which the NHS was founded after the second world war.Were Nightingale alive today, I could imagine her as prime minister, guiding the UK through a pandemic experience closer to that of New Zealand and Germany. But now I am taking a lot of poetic licence.At the very least, she would not be known as the lady with the lamp. Instead, generations would know her as “the social reformer with the spreadsheet”.• Carola Hoyos is writing a screenplay about Florence Nightingale.

The number of pregnant prisoners plus inmates in MBUs was about 70 at the time the justice secretary announced plans to release the majority from prison in late March, but by late April fewer than half had been released.The government’s female offenders strategy, published in June 2018 when David Gauke was justice secretary, included plans to develop a pilot for at least five residential women’s centres across England and Wales.The plans to open a residential women’s centre come as the government released £2.5m of funding for community services across England and Wales, which support women at risk of being drawn into crime. The funding, which will be awarded later this year, will help cover core costs such as wages, rent and bills to services that could include domestic abuse support, drug and alcohol rehabilitation or work with a particular group such as women from minority ethnic communities.The support is on top of the £750m coronavirus crisis package for charities announced by Rishi Sunak, the chancellor."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51740d312f0d7c2ea41f9c29d5f3da4bd7fe75df/0_5_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4fe0e9348c396ee1e33ba1851646b03e","title":"bittersweet time travel back to edgbaston 2005 ashes cricket bbc","story":"The BBC is replaying the whole TMS commentary of the second Ashes Test from 2005 as live from Thursday, if you don’t have anything else onWho fancies a Proustian rush? Actually, who fancies three-and-a-bit days of Proustian rushes? From 10.30am on Thursday, the BBC is replaying the full Test Match Special commentary of the second Ashes Test of 2005. It appears Sky Sports are also repeating the whole thing, though I can’t quite work out why the programme begins at 12.30pm on Thursday. Those five syllables – Edgbaston ’05 – have already sent me to several happy places and the re-listen hasn’t even started yet.This column isn’t long enough to tell the story of the whole game, and this needless sentence isn’t doing me any favours with the word count either, so let’s focus on the day life changed: 4 August 2005. The exponential drama of the match, culminating in England’s heart-stopping two-run win on the Sunday morning, sometimes obscures a first day that should never cease to astonish.England were all out for 407, their highest first-day total since the second world war. And that was from 79.2 overs the pro-rata total was 462 in a day. England’s captain Michael Vaughan later said that “the manner in which we played on that first day was the turning point of the entire series”. You can probably see it now: Marcus Trescothick pinging a stream of the sweetest cover drives, Andrew Flintoff heaving sixes all over the gaff, Kevin Pietersen bringing up his 50 with the dreamiest cuff past mid-on off Brett Lee.Even without Glenn McGrath, this was against a team with a 16-year aura and a four-man attack who had 1,083 Test wickets between them. Where did England get the effrontery?It stemmed from a chat between two blokes in a deserted field on the edge of the Leeds outer ring road. In the 10-day break after the first Test, the coach Duncan Fletcher drove up to do some technical work with Vaughan at the New Rover cricket club in Adel.When they chatted between net sessions they kept coming back to how submissive the batsmen had been, Pietersen aside, in the defeat at Lord’s. They knew they had to tell the top six to be hyper-aggressive, however scary a prospect that might be, but Fletcher also stressed the need for “total conviction” in their delivery. They even discussed the tone of voice they would use.Although there was far more to Vaughan’s captaincy genius, at its heart was a simple message: attack, except in times of trouble, when you should attack even harder, because it’s by far your best chance of stealing momentum.We know all about McGrath’s injury and the toss when Ricky Ponting made the errant decision to bowl first. “He didn’t rate the English batting and it cost him and us,” said Shane Warne in No Spin.The morning session went by in a blur of boundaries, and by lunch England were 132 for one after 27 overs. They got so far ahead of the game they were able to repel the inevitable Australia fightback and they also established an undeniable template for the rest of the series. “Marcus’s 90 was worth vastly more than many big hundreds,” said Flintoff in his autobiography Second Innings. “It announced we had come to play.”Even without McGrath, Australia had Warne to apply control and he was on inside the first hour. Yet even he went at a run a ball for most of the day. While he was defending Warne’s first three deliveries, Strauss kept thinking back to Vaughan and Fletcher’s team talk. And so he boffed the next ball back over Warne’s head for four, a symbolic statement of his and England’s intent.Two overs later, Trescothick saw Strauss’s shot and raised it with the quiet fulfilment of a 14-month fantasy. During the previous summer, Warne suggested in his newspaper column that England should drop Trescothick. “I did something I had wanted to do ever since he told the world I had been found out as a Test player,” wrote Trescothick in Coming Back to Me. “I didn’t say a word I just hit him back over his head for six. It was a completely sublime moment.”England ran with the mood for the rest of the day, with Flintoff’s exhilaratingly rustic 68, including five sixes, coming from only 62 balls. Like England, Flintoff had moments of fortune he got off the mark with a mis-hit boundary off Warne that just cleared mid-off. Had that been caught, he would have had three runs in three innings in the series. Soon after he muscled Warne down the ground for six and then, in Warne’s next over, chipped him over midwicket. He was aiming for four but timed it so well it went into the crowd. “That was when I thought: ‘I’m in here,’” he wrote in Second Innings. “And things just started happening. It all came back.”Flintoff said he “bottled it” in the first Test at Lord’s. If he could have bottled how he played at Edgbaston – seven wickets, two mighty half-centuries, nine sixes, one legendary over – he would have been one of the greatest players in history.Thinking about Edgbaston 2005 triggers so many vivid memories: having a minor breakdown while writing the ’s over-by-over coverage on that final morning, giddily hugging my colleague Sean Ingle when England took the final wicket, even going to see an outdoor screening of Donnie Darko in Kensington Gardens, London, the previous night.It evokes all those little details – irrelevant to anyone else, with meaning that is impossible to convey – that stimulate a kind of ephemeral, bittersweet time travel. I can remember so much about that long weekend: what was on my iPod, what I was wearing, where I drank, who I kissed.Most of all, I remember the desperate, dizzying and ultimately euphoric experience of watching the greatest Test match I will ever see.• This is an extract from the ’s weekly cricket email, The Spin.

Was your starting point establishing those two settings?Not immediately. The director, Simon Godwin, who asked me to design, wanted the production to start with the ending. I couldn’t get my head around it for a while. It made things very difficult: if you start with this monument, right in front of audiences, you then need to get rid of it before you can begin the play proper. I loved the idea after we had talked about it enough. But that was the task to concentrate on before anything else.Then I got started on Egypt. I had some fabulous books of contemporary photographs of Egypt that Simon loved. There was dappled light, gold, the desert, areas that gave respite from the heat, shadows, back streets, seeing through from one space to another. They were very inspiring. For Egypt, water, colour and heat were important to the designs. For Rome, I thought of marble and architecture an incredibly ordered, quite cold and considered, very designed world. That contrast was a good starting point.What is it like to design for the Olivier, the National’s biggest stage?I’ve done nearly 20 shows in the Lyttelton, quite a few in the Cottesloe (now the Dorfman), but had only done the Olivier once before. That was Trevor Nunn’s Merchant of Venice, which was in the Cottesloe and then moved into the Olivier for a year. It’s kind of a responsibility doing Antony and Cleopatra in the Olivier. There are so many other productions of the play that most critics would bring up to compare. It’s a certain pressure. But we had a long run-in time, which meant we didn’t feel pressurised to come up with things.In the Olivier you look right up to the lighting rig. One of the things I felt strongly about is that I didn’t want to see that. I grappled with how to do it but we managed to fix it. I also wanted to use the space right to the back of the storage area so that was cleared. The Olivier’s drum revolve is something you want to use if the play is right. I don’t really like using a revolve to bring round the next set-up, but we managed to populate the space very fast so you were always anticipating the next scene before you properly got it. The one time we went down into the belly of the Olivier was for when the ship comes out like the fin of a shark.How precarious was it for the actors navigating the walkways around Cleopatra’s water feature?We had to make sure it wasn’t slippery! The worry was that it would stop the freedom of the actors’ movement. But what it meant was that actors were driven to the front of the stage naturally – there was a reason for them to be close up in a fairly intimate space. On this vast stage there are many scenes of just two or three people, and you need them to be in the front area.The palettes of the set and the costumes (by Evie Gurney) really complement each other. How do those two design departments work together?I normally do costumes as well. But in other European countries people don’t do both roles – they seem very different disciplines. When I do work with a costume designer, we can talk without being guarded – you can be honest and creative with each other. I can’t stop myself from putting cutout scale figures in the model boxes I make. Theatre always has people – you’re looking at human beings on stage so the costumes are inseparable from the design. On Antony and Cleopatra, I had made figures for the model boxes, which were photographed and put on the walls in the rehearsal rooms. The costume designer was then able to look at those designs and use that as an example of what she wanted to do or not. We didn’t in the end spend that much time together, it was such a big production. She was sensitive to what the design had laid down – the colour tones were there. There are a lot of uniforms in the play but her freedom was in Cleopatra, which she did very beautifully.Was there one particular theatre design you saw as an audience member that set you on this career path?When I was at Central St Martins doing stage design, I went to Germany to see some shows as part of the course. I saw the most amazing work in Berlin and was completely sure I’d made the right decision. One of those was Mary Stuart, which all those years later I told Rob Icke I really wanted to do, and he made that happen.I came from painting. I was at Camberwell art school and said I was going to apply to Central for stage design, and everyone was up in arms: “Why would you do that?!” In design, I’m closer to being a painter – I don’t start with a complete concept and draw it up on the computer and let someone else do the model. I work into the model box myself. I sort of know what I’m going towards – but I need a lot of time. There’s nothing more wonderful than exploring completely new territory. I’ve been lucky to work in very big spaces. Then it’s great to go back to the Almeida, for example, as it’s such a challenge. If Antony and Cleopatra was being done at the Royal Court, you’d think differently from the start.• Antony and Cleopatra streams on YouTube from 7pm on 7 May as part of National Theatre at Home.

Amazon workers on Friday participated in a nationwide sick-out to, claiming the company has failed to provide enough face masks for workers, did not implement regular temperature checks it promised at warehouses, and has refused to give workers paid sick leave protest working conditions and inadequate safety protections.In a blogpost explaining his resignation, Bray called the firings of organizers at the company “chickenshit”, and said they were “designed to create a climate of fear”. In resigning, Bray has become the highest-ranking corporate employee at Amazon to publicly speak out about worker conditions.“Remaining an Amazon VP would have meant, in effect, signing off on actions I despised,” Bray, who had worked at the company for nearly six years, said. previously published Bray’s blogpost in full under Creative Commons licensing, but took it down at his request.Bray cited the experiences of Emily Cunningham and Maren Costa – two user experience designers at Amazon who were fired in April after publicly denouncing the treatment of warehouse workers.Bray also cited activism among warehouse workers themselves, including actions from Courtney Bowden, Gerald Bryson, Bashir Mohammed and Chris Smalls – all of whom were fired  after organizing.A leaked memo obtained by Vice News showed how an Amazon executive denigrated Smalls, who had helped organize an action at a Staten Island, New York, warehouse, labeling him as “not smart or articulate” in a meeting with Jeff Bezos.Amazon did not respond to a request for comment, but previously cited violations of internal policies as reasons for dismissing these employees.Amazon made more than $33m per hour in the first three months of the year, according to earnings reports last week, boosted by consumers on lockdown ordering supplies to be delivered to home. The chief executive officer, Jeff Bezos, who was already the richest man in the world, has personally seen his fortune swell by $13bn this month to $145bn.“At the end of the day, the big problem isn’t the specifics of Covid-19 response,” Bray said. “It’s that Amazon treats the humans in the warehouses as fungible units of pick-and-pack potential. Only that’s not just Amazon, it’s how 21st-century capitalism is done.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee92f26e18a9ec04a77aea1b9dc652ba915ad0bf/0_155_4191_2514/master/4191.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ac2767f7a2623715cbda8d063a686215","title":"expecting the worst helped me prepare for it says charlie brooker coronavirus","story":"Black Mirror creator tells Radio Times how he’s dealing with the coronavirus outbreakThe creator of the dystopian TV series Black Mirror has said a career of anticipating the worst meant he was better mentally prepared for the coronavirus pandemic.Charlie Brooker’s scripts for the science fiction anthology series imagine scenarios from algorithms deciding who people are forced to date, to children being implanted with tracking chips, and robotic killer dogs roaming the countryside.He told the Radio Times this had prepared him for an unprecedented global crisis of the magnitude of Covid-19. “Because I’ve really always expected something like this to come along, I think maybe I’m not going through quite the level of psychological adjustment as some other people,” he said.“If you’ve spent years anticipating the worst, oddly, when the worst happens, you can stop worrying about that possibly happening because it has. So I’m dealing with this on a personal level far better than I would have anticipated.”Brooker said he was not working on another Black Mirror, which first aired on Channel 4 before being bought by Netflix, as he did not think there was the appetite for it in the current climate.But the writer said he was optimistic about the future. “If you look at what happens in classic dystopian fiction – where everyone turns on each other immediately – so far that hasn’t happened. It’s not to say it won’t. But I pivoted quite early to an optimistic view that this is terrible but, at the end of it, there’s a possibility that we’ll have the stomach to realign society a little.“Is this forcing our hands to address financial inequality and climate change? You hope that’s the outcome, rather than that it makes psychotic strongman politicians more secure.”Brooker will return to TV screens this month with a special lockdown version of his weekly news review show Screenwipe, titled Antiviral Wipe. The BBC said the first show on 14 May would feature the regular characters Philomena Cunk (Diane Morgan) and Barry Shitpeas (Al Campbell), offering their “own very special brand of in-depth reporting”.A press release announcing the show in April said other contributors would also be involved, but that they could not be named as they “haven’t been told they’re doing it yet, but have no good excuse not to”.Brooker said: “The BBC asked me to supply a quote for the press release, which is what you’re reading now.”Brooker has been congratulated for producing work that with hindsight seems impressively prescient. As Germany entered lockdown in March, the contestants of the country’s Big Brother were left unaware of what was happening in the outside world – drawing comparisons with Brooker’s 2008 series Dead Set, about reality TV show contestants who emerge to find a zombie apocalypse.“Okay, fuck it,” tweeted Brooker when the parallels were pointed out. “This is happening so frequently I’m just going to have to accept that I’m a soothsayer or a mystic or whatever you want to call it.”He added: “With that in mind, I will now make an optimistic prediction in the hope it also comes true: we’ll come out the other side of the coronavirus crisis a more empathetic, altruistic, and globally conscious society.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a489d9722d241a3bd85289a04f9dc595bad104c/0_0_4242_2545/master/4242.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0aa6f37df38e3b74fd0eff2451d45e56","title":"tv tonight the third series of the a word gets under way","story":"Max is now struggling to adapt to his parents’ separation as the Christopher Eccleston drama returns.

Steve Guest, rapid response director for the Republican National Committee, wrote in an email: “Joe Biden’s attempt to offer faux transparency ground to a screeching halt this morning.”Guest accused Biden of sending the media on “a wild goose chase” to look for records in the National Archives, which said it does not hold them, and then to the Senate.The existence or otherwise of records at the Senate, National Archives and University of Delaware has become a vital piece of the jigsaw in the allegation against Biden, who said on Friday that he was not aware of any complaint on file.Biden told MSNBC: “This is an open book. There’s nothing for me to hide.”Reade has said she filed a complaint at the time of the alleged incident and was subsequently fired. But she said last week that the complaint did not explicitly accuse Biden of sexual assault.“I remember talking about him wanting me to serve drinks because he liked my legs and thought I was pretty and it made me uncomfortable,” she told the Associated Press. “I know that I was too scared to write about the sexual assault.”Reade subsequently tweeted that the AP report was “false”. She also said she had been threatened.Reade was among eight women who alleged last year that Biden made them feel uncomfortable with unwanted touching or displays of affection. He apologised, then appeared to make light of the matter.After Biden effectively secured the Democratic nomination to face Donald Trump in November, Reade, who worked as a staff assistant in his Senate office from December 1992 to August 1993, alleged Biden pinned her against a wall in the basement of a Capitol Hill office, reached under her skirt and pushed his fingers inside her.Reade, 56, said she was reluctant to share details of the assault during initial conversations with reporters more than a year ago because she was still coming to terms with the incident and feared a backlash. Two of her associates said last week she had conversations with them that corroborated aspects of her allegation.Numerous Democratic leaders and figures in the #MeToo movement have shown solidarity with Biden. Republicans have accused them of hypocrisy, arguing they have been zealous in believing women who have accused Trump and other conservatives of assault.The president has faced multiple accusations of assault and harassment, all of which he denies.Maureen Dowd, a columnist at the New York Times, observed: “Democrats always set standards that come back and bite them. They have created a cage of their own making.”But Trump himself, trailing Biden in numerous polls, has been uncharacteristically hesitant to weigh in. In an interview with the conservative radio host Dan Bongino, he said if the accusations were false, Biden should deny them.“Just go out and fight it, it’s one of those things,” Trump advised. “I’ve been a total victim of this nonsense, false accusations.”Biden wrote the Violence Against Women Act as a senator but came under fire for his handling of Anita Hill’s 1991 Senate testimony against now supreme court justice Clarence Thomas.He said last Friday on MSNBC: “Believing women means taking the woman’s claim seriously when she steps forward, and then vet it, look into it. That’s true in this case as well …“But in the end, the truth is what matters, and in this case, the truth is the claims are false.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29a962165ef5955d285bfbf5fdbf940c1a419763/0_113_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f7c93636ee2798e144dac5fc5d5b563","title":"do you believe you were infected by coronavirus at a big event in march","story":"We want to hear from those who attended mega-events such as Cheltenham Festival and the Stereophonics concerts in CardiffWe’d like you to help us document the spread of coronavirus due to some of the mega-events that went ahead during the week beginning 9 March.Those events include: the Cheltenham Festival, the Liverpool v Atletico Madrid Champions League tie, and the Stereophonics concerts in Cardiff.Do you believe that you were infected by coronavirus by attending one of these events?You can get in touch by filling in the form below, anonymously if you wish or via WhatsApp by clicking here or adding the contact +44(0)7867825056.

We wouldn’t usually see this phenomenon in influenza or community-acquired pneumonia. It’s very much more profound and an example of very abnormal physiology going on before our eyes.”Dr Mike Charlesworth, an anaesthetist at Wythenshawe hospital in Manchester, said that while other lung conditions could cause severe hypoxia, these patients would normally appear extremely ill. “With pneumonia or a pulmonary embolism they wouldn’t be sat up in bed talking to you,” he said. “We just don’t understand it. We don’t know if it’s causing organ damage that we’re not able to detect. We don’t understand if the body’s compensating.”Charlesworth had a personal experience of the issue while suffering from Covid-19 in March. After becoming unwell with a cough and fever, he spent 48 hours in bed, during which there were signs he was hypoxic, he said. “I was sending very strange messages on my phone. I was essentially delirious. Looking back I probably should’ve come into hospital. I’m pretty sure my oxygen levels were low. My wife commented that my lips were very dusky. But I was probably hypoxic and my brain probably wasn’t working very well.”He recovered after a few days in bed, but he and others are conscious that not all cases have positive outcomes.However, it is not the fall in oxygen levels itself that leaves people feeling breathless. Instead, the body senses the rising levels of carbon dioxide that typically occur simultaneously as the lungs are unable to clear gas as efficiently. But in some Covid-19 patients, this response does not appear to be kicking in.“I don’t think any of us expect that what we’re seeing can be explained by one process,” said Bannard-Smith.Swelling and inflammation in the lungs is likely to make it difficult for oxygen to enter the bloodstream. There is also emerging evidence that Covid-19 can cause blood clotting. The vessels in the lungs that collect oxygen and transfer it into the wider bloodstream are so tiny they can become blocked with the smallest of clots.Several clinical trials are looking at whether blood thinners could prevent or treat complications of Covid-19, including respiratory problems and low blood oxygen.Some have suggested that, since people are often oblivious to falling oxygen levels, those with Covid-19 symptoms or a positive test result should be given pulse oximeters, a simple device that clips on to the finger and can be used to detect oxygen levels at home. However, as yet there is no evidence that early detection of hypoxia would help avoid severe outcomes and Charlesworth said the practicalities would be difficult.

(For those not familiar with the dimensions of the reindeer, that’s roughly equivalent to two husky lengths or eight loaves of sourdough bread.)The light-hearted advice is part of a viral public health awareness campaign that seeks to inform residents and pay homage to the region’s cultural history.The guidelines from Yukon’s department of health also advised residents that keeping the distance of four ravens – the official bird of the territory – will help prevent transmission of the virus.The most recent ad, released at the end of April, advises residents to maintain a distance of one cord of wood – the standard measurement for chopped firewood. “A cord of wood is actually 2.4 meters8 feet long, but extra space means extra-safe,” the poster says.Despite the recent lockdown-inspired popularity of home baking, sourdough bread was included to reflect the baked delicacy’s deep historical ties to the region. Early miners and their families fiercely protected sourdough starters and anyone who survived a winter north of the Arctic Circle became known as a “sourdough”.(Provincial authorities also caution that while a one caribou – 2m – is a safe distance in terms of social distancing and Covid-19 mitigation, Yukoners should keep more than 90m away from actual caribou.)Because of its geographic isolation and low population density, the Yukon territory has only recorded 11 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, but has put measures in place to limit travellers at its borders with British Columbia and Alaska, where tourists often arrive.The Yukon isn’t the only region drawing iconic figures and images to remind the public of physical distancing. When public health officials in Toronto first began asking residents to avoid congregating, they used the length of one hockey stick as a reminder – a measurement that has been updated to three Canada geese."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c36e0d494293f8ba64d8dfc89f99ec95688b4969/0_189_3048_1829/master/3048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ee75b0322109684914192606db807b47","title":"five eyes network contradicts theory covid 19 leaked from lab","story":"No current evidence to suggest coronavirus leaked from Wuhan research lab, agencies sayThere is no current evidence to suggest that coronavirus leaked from a Chinese research laboratory, intelligence sources have told the , contradicting recent White House claims that there is growing proof this is how the pandemic began.The sources also insisted that a “15-page dossier” highlighted by the Australian Daily  which accused China of a deadly cover up was not culled from intelligence from the Five Eyes network, an alliance between the UK, US, Australia, New Zealand and Canada.British and other Five Eyes agencies do believe that Beijing has not necessarily been open about how coronavirus initially spread in Wuhan at the turn of the year. But they are nervous about getting involved in an escalating international situation.On Sunday Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, said: “I can tell you that there is a significant amount of evidence that this came from that laboratory in Wuhan.”No evidence was offered by Pompeo to back up his assertion but information has been circulating over the last month in the UK, US and Australia aimed at raising questions about the high security Wuhan Institute of Virology, which has long specialised in researching coronaviruses in horseshoe bats.Stories have suggested that workers in the lab may not have always used full protective equipment, and that in one instance a bat urinated on a researcher who did not subsequently become ill.But there is nothing to indicate a leak from the lab could have caused the pandemic, sources say.Claims are even made that the virus was genetically engineered in Wuhan, although there is both scientific and intelligence agency agreement that there is no evidence for this.American scientists who have worked with the Wuhan Institute add its safety standards are comparable to Western equivalents – and the prevailing theory is that the virus was passed onto humans via one of the country’s live animal markets.Australia’s Daily  – a Sydney tabloid owned by Rupert Murdoch – has been focusing on the Wuhan lab for several days, culminating in a weekend report which cited a 15-page dossier compiled, it said, by “concerned Western governments” amid an investigation by British and other members of the Five Eyes intelligence agencies.Intelligence sources in Australia were quick to say they believed it was based on open source, public domain material. One told the  they believed the information that appeared in the News Corp title was most likely to have originally come from the US: “My instinct is that it was a tool for building a counter-narrative and applying pressure to China. So it’s the intent behind it that’s most important. So possibly open source leads with a classification slapped on it.”Downing Street said that the UK did not comment on intelligence matters – although British sources also said they did not recognise the dossier as based on classified information provided by the country’s spy agencies.Downing Street said it would not comment on intelligence matters, but a No 10 spokesman said: “Clearly there are questions that need to be answered about the origin and spread of the virus, not least so we can ensure we are better prepared for future global pandemics.”Neil O’Brien, a Conservative MP and secretary of the China Research Group, said that Beijing could help fend off speculation with greater transparency: “If their government were less secretive and authoritarian they would cooperate more and so potentially put to bed wilder ideas about the origins of the virus.”Last week, the New York Times reported that White House officials, led by deputy national security adviser Matthew Pottinger, a former China reporter with the Wall Street Journal, pressed the US agencies to gather information that could support any lab theory.A report in the Washington Post two weeks later highlighted a leak of US diplomatic cables from 2018, claiming that a site visit showed the WIV had insufficient appropriately trained technicians for the high security work.The lab itself says it is distressed by talk of leaks. Scientific American re-edited an interview with the virologist Shi Zhengli last week to address “the tenuous suggestion” of the lab theory, and noted the “genetic sequence” of Sars-CoV-2, the scholarly term for coronavirus, “does not match any her lab had previously studied”.Charles Parton, a former foreign office official and senior associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, said: “People pushing these sort of lines are doing everybody a disservice.“It will inevitably prompt a Chinese reaction at a time when there is a need for a proper scientific understanding of its causes, and, in the longer term, to work together to stop pandemics happening again.’’"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bcccc157ccea069755c1c3d5edd9901778ba7340/0_1238_2625_1575/master/2625.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=be4ec65a13055af6370f3ffa7dddc851","title":"guinea pigs isle of wight residents mixed reactions to contact tracing app coronavirus","story":"Coronavirus app being trialled on island as part of plans to prevent second outbreakIsle of Wight residents have complained they have been “left in the dark” about trials of a pilot NHS coronavirus contact tracing app on the island as part of UK government plans to prevent a second wave of infections.The plans have nonetheless been welcomed in principle, although people are concerned that the app, which uses bluetooth technology to register contact between users when they come within about 2 metres of each other for at least 15 minutes, would only be truly effective after the lockdown has been eased.“It is important that we learn from other countries like Germany and South Korea which adopted a test, track and trace approach. Having a pilot on an island makes sense and, as we have a relatively low number of cases, it could be a safe place to do it. It will be the only way to get out of the lockdown which is causing many a great deal of economic hardship, isolation and stress.”“I am supportive of trialling the technology but not if it requires the early lifting of lockdown or social distancing, which I’m assured it will not. The efficacy of this app may soon be called into question if it does not register contact between people who have not been together long enough or by providing false positives if people are in close proximity but have a wall iding them.”“I have isolated since the day over-70s were told to and I only go out for short walks when no one is about using my access to webcam at the bay which shows the footfall at the time.

Today I feel liberated, but with caution – that’s the important thing, we can have the freedom but we must be really careful.”An estimated 4 million people returned to work on Monday as part of what the Italian government called the second phase of the country’s coronavirus emergency, with the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, appealing to the public in a Facebook post on Sunday night to “act responsibly”.The easing of restrictions is gradual, with factories geared towards exports and construction sites allowed to resume activity immediately. Bars and restaurants can offer takeaway services but will not fully reopen until 1 June. Retailers, museums and libraries will open from 18 May, hairdressers and gyms from 1 June and schools from September.Usually buzzing with activity in the morning, people wearing face masks queued outside bars in Orvieto as they waited for their espresso. “This is a great step even if we have to remain cautious – it gives you something else to smile about,” said Slavik Cebanu.Jaskaran Singh, who works in Caffè Barrique, said: “We are happy to be able to open even if things are still restricted, and to see some movement. I just hope everything goes well.”Although the infection rate has been steadily falling, fear of the virus lingers. The vast majority of daily new cases are being registered in the northern regions of Lombardy, Piedmont, Emilia-Romagna and Veneto. No new cases have been recorded in Umbria for the past few days.“Certainly, the fact that there are zero cases is important for us, but at the same time it doesn’t mean we’re fully secure as the virus is still there,” said Valentina Santanicchio, a chef whose restaurant in Orvieto, Capitano del Popolo, has been providing home deliveries. “In some ways, I’m more afraid than when we closed, as a lot will now depend on people managing the moment in a responsible way.”Maintaining physical distancing will be crucial to ensuring Covid-19, which has claimed almost 29,000 lives in Italy, is kept at bay. People can now visit relatives and partners within their regions and go for a walk or exercise in a park, but most civil liberties remain curtailed. Travelling between regions is still banned, unless it is for a valid reason.Walter Ricciardi, the scientist advising the health ministry on its coronavirus measures, said the country would go straight back into lockdown if the infection rate rose again. “We’re still in a risky phase,” he told La Repubblica. “It will take two weeks to see how it’s going.”In Lazio, the region surrounding Rome, 53 new cases were recorded on Sunday. “Slowly, I feel optimistic, but let’s just hope we don’t go crazy and start peaking again,” said Marsha De Salvatore, an English teacher and founder of Rome’s Comedy Club.De Salvatore has thalassemia, a blood disorder that requires transfusions every two to three weeks. “I’ll take walks as far as possible but for the rest, things will mostly stay the same,” she said. “The one thing I can’t wait to do, once more restrictions are lifted, is have a coffee in a bar.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44e27edda18a46ad3c7f5c3597aee15307d02c76/0_207_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=024262629a6677fb63f441c321a6d36c","title":"north korean defectors sorry after false kim jong un speculation","story":"Thae Yong-ho and Ji Seong-ho both said in South Korea that leader was gravely ill or deadA former senior North Korean diplomat has apologised after saying Kim Jong-un was probably so ill he could not stand, days before he emerged on state media smoking and walking briskly at an event attended by hundreds of officials.Kim disappeared from state media for three weeks, an unusually long time, leading to concerns over the nuclear-armed state in the event of an unexpected succession.High-profile defectors from the country speculated that Kim was suffering from a grave illness or could even be dead. North Korean media on Saturday broadcast video of Kim during a ribbon-cutting ceremony for the inauguration of a fertiliser plant.One of the defectors, Thae Yong-ho, former deputy ambassador to Britain and one of two defectors elected to the South Korean parliament last month, on Monday issued an apology for his claims.“I am aware that one of the reasons why many of you voted for me as a lawmaker is with the expectations of an accurate analysis and projections on North Korean issues,” he said in a statement. “I feel the blame and heavy responsibility.““Whatever the reasons, I apologise to everyone.““I have pondered on myself for the past few days, and felt the weight of the position that I’m in,” Ji said in a statement. “As a public figure, I will behave carefully going forward.“Ji had told Reuters on Friday he had received information about Kim’s death from a source he could not disclose.South Korea’s ruling Democratic party criticised the pair for carelessness. One party member urged them to be excluded from the intelligence and defence committees, while another said the defectors contributed little to South Korean society.Ji’s party acknowledged he had made “rash, careless” remarks but criticised the ruling party for undermining the two and “instigating hatred” towards them.The blunders highlight the difficulty of getting reliable information on North Korea. The secretive country has for decades kept tight control on information, and news on the health and whereabouts of its leader are shared with only a handful of most trusted aides.Thae wrote in his memoir that when former leader Kim Jong-il died in 2011, even the foreign minister did not know until ministry staff were called to watch a state media announcement.The South Korea government, which gathers intelligence from various sources, had urged caution on speculation about Kim’s health and said it saw no sign anything serious had happened.Daily NK, a Seoul-based news outlet with sources inside North Korea, had reported in April that Kim was recovering from a cardiovascular procedure."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ff4d557c7b1da0859bd63fe36ef4320dbe89ec5/0_259_5000_3002/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b50fcaca2f2a7ef4e1ba006c0e74d7fb","title":"venezuela jordan goudreau raid maduro","story":"Jordan Goudreau, who was linked to plot to topple Maduro, said his troops are still in action as government said it foiled ‘invasion’A former US special forces soldier linked to a murky and apparently bungled attempt to topple Venezuela’s leader, Nicolás Maduro, has insisted his troops are still in action after launching “a daring amphibious raid” into the country.In a video released late on Sunday – hours after Maduro’s government claimed it had foiled a United States-backed sea “invasion” near Venezuela’s main international airport – Jordan Goudreau claimed the battle was not over.“Our men are continuing to fight right now,” claimed the 43-year-old American citizen, who was last week linked to what was described as an audacious but half-baked plot to invade Venezuela and remove its leader. “Our units have been activated in the south, west and east of Venezuela.”The former US special forces medic, who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, offered no evidence for those claims and it was unclear where the video had been recorded. There were no reports of fighting in the capital, Caracas.But earlier on Sunday Venezuela’s leaders claimed they had frustrated what they called a US-backed assault near the port city of La Guaira, 20 miles north of Caracas, killing eight alleged assailants.Venezuela’s interior minister, Néstor Reverol, claimed a platoon of “terrorist mercenaries” had tried to make landfall using speedboats but been repelled by security forces.“Some were shot down and others detained,” Reverol said in a televised statement, accusing the group of plotting to assassinate the leaders of Venezuela’s “revolutionary government”.Reverol said “a meticulous land, sea and air search” was under way to capture any remaining invaders, vowing: “We will remain in permanent state of alert and resistance.”In a telephone interview with the Washington Post on Sunday night, Goudreau claimed the operation had involved “60 troops”, including two former US special forces members, who had arrived in Venezuela by land and sea.Speaking to the Associated Press on Monday, Goudreau claimed 52 of those fighters – including two US veterans – had infiltrated Venezuelan territory and were “in the first stage of a mission to recruit members of the security forces to join their cause”.“I don’t care about politics,” he said. “I care about my men on the ground right now who are in the most dangerous phase of the operation.”Venezuela’s defense minister, who was last year accused of plotting against Maduro, appeared on state television flanked by armoured vehicles and heavily armed troops clutching assault rifles and rocket-propelled grenade.“A group of mercenaries has attempted to trample our sacred soils and has received an emphatic response from our the weapons of our republic,” Vladimir Padrino López said, denouncing what he called a “crass” imperialist incursion. Padrino López said Maduro had ordered troops to scour the country’s Caribbean coastline for accomplices.The commotion comes almost a year to the day after a botched attempt to remove Hugo Chávez’s authoritarian successor from power.On 30 April 2019 opposition leader Juan Guaidó – who dozens of countries, including the US and UK, recognize as Venezuela’s legitimate interim leader – sought to spark a pre-dawn military uprising dubbed “Operation Freedom”.But those efforts fizzled and Maduro remains in power, albeit facing massive challenges as a result of Venezuela’s continued social and economic meltdown and now, the Covid-19 crisis, which doctors fear could bring the country’s crippled health system to its knees.Guaidó denied any involvement in the alleged invasion on Monday although Goudreau provided a Miami-based journalist with an eight-page services contract supposedly signed by Guaidó and two political advisers in October for $213m.Sunday’s supposed invasion is the latest chapter in the bizarre and shady tale of an apparently ongoing plot to overthrow Maduro that is being partly led by Goudreau, a sharpshooting, muscle-bound mixed martial arts enthusiast from Florida.In a lengthy report on Goudreau’s travails last week, the Associated Press claimed he had founded a private security company called Silvercorp USA in 2018 and last year decided to capitalize on Donald Trump’s obsession with overthrowing Maduro.The report said Goudreau subsequently came into contact with Clíver Alcalá, a retired Venezuelan army major general who has admitted to plotting against Maduro and handed himself over to US authorities in late March after being indicted in the US on drug trafficking charges.Alcalá reportedly told Goudreau he had three camps of willing combatants waiting near Colombia’s border with Venezuela and the American offered to train them for “a rapid-strike operation” to take out Maduro.Goudreau reportedly boasted of high-level contacts in the Trump administration but the news agency said it had found no evidence of US support for his actions."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ee8217d7aeec457a67a0b4b84428ba810de9fca/0_448_6633_3979/master/6633.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6d699ddc9ad767f88158571cdca705e2","title":"world leaders pledge 74bn euros to research covid 19 vaccine","story":"EU-hosted talks tout cooperation but is not addressed by India, Russia or USWorld leaders, with the notable exception of Donald Trump, stumped up nearly €7.4bn (£6.5bn) to research Covid-19 vaccines and therapies at a virtual event convened by the EU, pledging the money will also be used to distribute any vaccine to poor countries on time and equitably.But in a sign of the fractured state of global health diplomacy, the event was not addressed by India, Russia or the US. After a weekend of persuasion, China was represented by its ambassador to the EU.A separate Covid-19 summit was staged earlier in the day and addressed by the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, and other world leaders including the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani.So why are men more vulnerable?“The honest answer is none of us know what’s causing the difference,” said Prof Sarah Hawkes, director of the UCL Centre for Gender and Global Health.However, there is a growing belief among experts that more fundamental biological factors are also at play. While there are higher proportions of male smokers in many countries, the differences are nowhere near as extreme as in China. But men continue to be overrepresented in Covid-19 statistics.The EU-convened virtual summit was addressed in person by the leaders of France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Canada, Japan, Jordan, Norway, Israel, South Africa and the EU, and took the form of a pledging marathon.But the US state department released a statement welcoming what it described as “the pledging conference in Europe”, even though the fundraising summit had always been envisaged as a global, rather than strictly European effort.The US also highlighted its “vaccine partnership to prioritise drug candidates and streamline clinical trials”. Trump has suggested a vaccine will be ready by the end of the year but many scientists are sceptical that even with global cooperation such a timetable can be met.The money is largely designed to speed up the process by raising guaranteed funds to coordinate research and incentivise pharmaceutical companies to distribute any vaccines and therapies to poorer countries, something that did not happen in the 2009 swine flu outbreak.The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said any distributed vaccine “won’t belong to anybody”.“Those who invent it of course will be fairly paid, but access will be given to people across the globe by the organisation we chose,” he said.So why are men more vulnerable?“The honest answer is none of us know what’s causing the difference,” said Prof Sarah Hawkes, director of the UCL Centre for Gender and Global Health.However, there is a growing belief among experts that more fundamental biological factors are also at play. While there are higher proportions of male smokers in many countries, the differences are nowhere near as extreme as in China. But men continue to be overrepresented in Covid-19 statistics.EU officials said pharmaceutical companies who will receive the funding will not be requested to forgo their intellectual property rights on the new vaccine and treatments, but they should commit to make them available worldwide at affordable prices. A similar process has occurred through Gavi, the global vaccine fund, which gives a global alliance leverage over the distribution and price of a vaccine.Boris Johnson was introduced to the summit by Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European commission, as “a man who has been though every possible emotion in the past month”. The UK prime minister insisted the search for a vaccine was not a competition between countries, but instead required cooperation that “defies the usual ways of operating”.He said: “We’ll need a truly global effort – because no one country, and no one pharmaceutical company, will be able to do this alone. The race to discover the vaccine to defeat this virus is not a competition between countries, but the most urgent shared endeavour of our lifetimes. It’s humanity against the virus.”Many leaders used their brief speeches to assert their support for the existing multilateral architecture for global health, including the World Health Organization. The US last month suspended funding for the WHO, criticising its relationship with China.Erna Solberg, the Norwegian prime minister and summit co-host, said “we support the leadership of the World Health Organization”, adding that without the UN body “an effective and coordinated response to the pandemic would not be possible”.She said that “multilateral cooperation is more important than ever” and the meeting was the start of a global movement “never seen before”.At the parallel “non-aligned movement” summit, Rouhani attacked the US decision to pull out of the WHO, describing it as “a strategic blunder”.The WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom, in his address to the EU-convened event , pointed out how quickly the genetic sequence of the virus had been shared by China amongst scientists globally.The EU said near the close of the summit that a total of 7.36bn of the €7.5bn sought had been pledged, with the largest national pledges coming from Japan and Norway. France, Italy and Germany all pledged around €500m each. Turkey’s contribution will be announced later in the month.The precise value of inidual countries pledges announced during the two-hour event was hard to calculate since some leaders drew on previous pledges, or earmarked their national contribution for specific bodies like the Red Cross, the WHO or Gavi. Von der Leyen said the summit had revealed “fantastic momentum” and that it was possible to turn the tide against the virus.From the €7.5bn initially sought, €4bn is for the development of a vaccine, €2bn for treatments and €1.5bn for the manufacture of tests, according to the European commission.The precise methodology of the new fund, including how to select a vaccine for funding and the strings to be attached, was not made clear during the many rhetorical speeches. But the world leaders want to work with existing global health bodies such as Gavi as much as possible.The driving idea behind the summit, pushed by the Gates Foundation, is that an alliance is needed not just to coordinate research for a vaccine, but also for therapies and testing.Jeremy Farrar, the Wellcome Trust director, said: “I would have loved China and the US to be part of the fundraising summit … both countries had incredibly deep medical knowledge innovation and expertise and a strong manufacturing base.”He added: “My guess is that those countries that have not yet signed up will sign up in the course of May to make sure this is a truly global event. We need everyone.”David Salisbury from the thinktank Chatham House noted, however: “We have to admit there is a tension between countries that want to protect their populations and the desire to spread the vaccine equitably. It will not be a vote winner to offer a share in available vaccine to less-privileged countries.“The factories for the biggest vaccine manufacturers are in Europe, the US and India. Will European manufacturers be obliged by the EU to restrict sales first to European countries?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c464bb69d009f4dc144f449f5d1b8074b8b9d37/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e2618ac23bf0c6ccbdef2b38e2a11855","title":"coronavirus latest at a glance","story":"A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreakKey developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:According to research by both the Reuters news agency and Johns Hopkins University, at least a quarter of a million people are now known to have died as a result of the pandemic.

Some realistic pessimism might help us curb disappointment Time is humanity’s ultimate organizing principle, and many, myself included, have longed for a neat finale during this pandemic – a day we can patiently wait for, when this will all be over.At first, political authorities in many countries spoke of societal lockdown in terms of weeks – a challenge, yes, but a manageable one there are even those who treated it as a rather novel adventure. More recently, as understanding of the pandemic develops, that metric is shifting, discouragingly, to months – even years.Last week, Chris Whitty, the UK chief medical adviser, said that social distancing would have to continue at least all year, while Canadians have been told to expect limits on travel and gatherings for likely around a year and a half. Donald Trump recently admitted that America’s pandemic guidelines – which he initially claimed would be null by Easter – would likely remain into summer and, enigmatically, “beyond that”. Some regions are considering how to gradually reopen their economies, yet the experiences of Asian countries where infections surged as restrictions eased serve as cautionary tales. Dozens of experts have attested there will be no quick return to our previous lives.Now that we are no longer at the beginning of this pandemic but in the seemingly interminable middle, the more relevant question to ask is not “when will this end?” but “how can we cope with this dragging on?”Looking forward to plans can be psychologically beneficial, keeping us engaged in life. But given the current circumstances, “Either focus on the right here, right now, the immediate days and weeks – we all have a lot of control over the next week,” says Aldao, “Or try focusing on the more distant future – maybe a year or more from now.”Aldao’s advice dovetails with the wisdom of the US navy vice admiral James Stockdale. Stockdale, who spent seven years as a prisoner of the Vietnam war, is renowned for his articulation of what is now called “Stockdale’s paradox,” a “hope for the best, prepare for the worst” ethos captured by his quote: “You must never confuse faith that you will prevail in the end … with the discipline to confront the most brutal facts of your current reality.”An advocate of steely pragmatism in the face of adversity, Stockdale observed that his cellmates – “the optimists” who believed they would be free by Christmas, then, when that didn’t happen, by Easter, and so on – became demoralized and “died of a broken heart”.While our circumstances are distinctly unlike Stockdale’s, his wisdom regarding how to cope with uncertainty still resonates: we cannot afford to spend the entirety of this pandemic expecting normalcy to manifest just around the bend – doing so only compounds our pain.So, aside from cancelling our plans and relinquishing faith in a clear-cut end date, how do we really confront the most brutal facts of our current reality, without getting bogged down by the sheer glumness of it all? It may sound counter-intuitive, but according to the psychologist and self-awareness researcher Dr Tasha Eurich, we can start by planning ahead for worst-case scenarios.“We’re not going to be able to control the uncontrollable, but we can make a contingency plan,” says Eurich. “For example: if we’re all locked up in our houses until there’s a vaccine, the question should be, ‘Using everything I can control, how can I create a livable new reality, knowing that it won’t last forever, but knowing that my plan for a four-week isolation is going to be a lot different than for one that’s 12 months long?’”You don’t want to get stuck ruminating on your fears, “but you have to figure out what could happen so you can control what you can, without it becoming a source of constant sadness,” she says. Make a plan for tangible circumstances, like what you will do if you or someone you live with gets sick, if your business cannot reopen, if a natural disaster occurs while you’re in lockdown – then put it aside and try not to worry about it.You can also shift your focus inward. “Imagine you’re sitting with your grandkids in 50 years and they ask you, ‘What was it like during the pandemic?’” says Eurich. “Ask yourself, ‘What are the things in my life I want to use this as an opportunity to get clearer on, and how can I reframe my situation with that longer lens to figure out what I should be focused on right now?’”If you find yourself worrying, Eurich suggests assessing your wellbeing in the moment – and appreciating what you do have. “To me, hope for the future can be replaced by hope for the present – gratitude,” she says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/001824fcdca88c7e63d7d632e110bb964e567924/0_0_1309_785/master/1309.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0209fd902b4d96971e82e63e7cb10162","title":"stranded at sea for months due to covid 19 and refused port three times sailor docks in fiji","story":"Wong Tetchoong set off from Singapore in February but the coronavirus pandemic meant he could not find anywhere to dockA Singaporean man has been rescued after being stranded at sea for three months and being turned away from three countries as ports around the world closed due to coronavirus.The man, who has been identified by Fijian media as Wong Tetchoong, 59, set off from Singapore on a sailing adventure on 2 February that was meant to last for three years.As news about the Covid-19 outbreak began to spread around the world, Wong tried to dock in various countries, but was turned away international borders and ports were closed.“I sailed to Papua New Guinea from Indonesia because the weather was okay, but when I reached the borders, they were closed so I continued again to the Solomon Islands. It was also closed, then I went to Tuvalu and they didn’t let me in, but the Tuvalu people provided me with food,” Wong told the Fiji Sun.After six days and six nights of sailing from Tuvalu, Wong made it to Fijian waters on 28 April. By this point his yacht was damaged and strong winds prevented him from sailing into the harbour, so he was rescued by a Fiji Navy patrol boat, which brought his yacht safely to shore.“We received a call, a message from his daughter indicating that he was not given rest in some of the other countries, so he came down south towards Fiji,” Timoci Natuva, Maritime Commander for the Fiji Navy, told the .After discussions between the ministries of foreign affairs in Singapore and Fiji, Wong was granted permission to dock in Fiji, despite the strict border restrictions that the country has introduced in response to Covid-19.“Due to the weather he encountered he had some defects on his boat – his rudder, engine and his autopilot – he could steer, but he couldn’t manoeuvre effectively, especially in narrow passages … we had to send a patrol boat to tow him in, guide him in,” said Natuva.After his boat docked at Vuda marina, on the country’s west coast, ministry of health officials boarded in full pesronal protective equipment and performed health checks, before taking him to hospital in Lautoka.Fiji has had 18 Covid-19 cases and has implemented strict measures to stop community transmission, including curfews and lockdown of some cities. The country has not recorded any new cases in more than two weeks and has had no deaths from the virus.Natuva said Wong seemed to be in good health, but was fatigued from his travel. He is in discussion with his family and the Singaporean government about a potential return to his home country.Vivian Balakrishnan, Singapore’s minister for foreign affairs, thanked the Fijian government for its assistance, writing on social media that “the support from our Fijian friends for a Singaporean in need is especially heartening during these challenging times.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f3d7cac45d391a458e4e2614bc32ff951c3a660/0_189_5658_3395/master/5658.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c8bd8d18c0fb87df7d1a603269aaa63","title":"who says it has no evidence to support speculative covid 19 lab theory pushed by us","story":"Health body says any ‘aggressive investigation of wrongdoing’ regarding virus origins makes understanding it harderThe World Health Organization says the United States government has not given any evidence to support Trump administration officials’ “speculative” claim that Covid-19 originated in a Wuhan lab, as China dismissed the theory as “insane”.Donald Trump has repeatedly said that he has proof the virus originated in a laboratory in Wuhan – whereas scientists believe it jumped from animals to humans at a wet market in the city last year.The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said on Sunday that the US had “enormous evidence” to back the theory. But the administration had not produced it publicly or provided it to the WHO, said its emergencies director, Dr Michael Ryan. “So from our perspective, this remains speculative.“Like any evidence-based organisation, we would be very willing to receive any information that purports to the origin of the virus,” Ryan said, stressing that this was “a very important piece of public health information for future control”.“If that data and evidence is available, then it will be for the United States government to decide whether and when it can be shared, but it is difficult for the WHO to operate in an information vacuum in that regard.”Ryan said it was important for the WHO to learn from Chinese scientists’ data and exchange knowledge to “find the answers together”, but cautioned against politicising the issue. “If this is projected as aggressive investigation of wrongdoing, that is much more difficult to deal with. That’s a political issue,” he said.Chinese state media attacked the US claims, with the state broadcaster CCTV labelling them “insane and evasive” in a Monday opinion piece entitled “Evil Pompeo is wantonly spewing poison and spreading lies”. The state-backed Global Times also published an editorial accusing Pompeo and Trump of “bluffing”, and said if the US had evidence it should present it.“If Washington has solid evidence, then it should let research institutes and scientists examine and verify it,” the editorial said. The Global Times’ editor, Hu Xijin, tweeted that demands to investigate the Wuhan lab were an attempt to “fool the American people”.Last week Sky News reported the WHO had been denied any involvement in China’s investigations into the origins of the virus.Intelligence sources have told the  there is no current evidence to suggest coronavirus leaked from a Chinese research laboratory. Reports in Australia suggested its intelligence officials believed a “dossier” – touted by the Trump administration to support the laboratory theory – was compiled from news reports rather than actual material from the “Five Eyes” spy network of Australia, the US, New Zealand, Canada and the UK.The WHO’s technical lead on Covid-19, Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, stressed during Monday’s briefing that there were some 15,000 full genome sequences of the novel coronavirus available, and “from all of the evidence that we have seen ... this virus is of natural origin”.While coronaviruses generally originate in bats, both Van Kerkhove and Ryan stressed the importance of discovering how the virus that causes Covid-19 crossed over to humans, and what animal served as an “intermediary host” along the way.Several nations, including Australia and the UK, have called for an independent investigation into the outbreak, angering China.Scott Morrison, the prime minister of key US ally, Australia, said on Tuesday it was “most likely” that the virus originated in a wildlife wet market. Australia is a member of the Five Eyes intelligence network, that includes the US. Morrison reiterated his call for an independent investigation into the virus’s origins and said he had written to G20 leaders asking for support for a “proper review”.Citing an internal Chinese government report on Tuesday, the Reuters news agency reported international anti-China sentiment was at its highest since the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre.According to the report, which Reuters said was presented in early March to top Beijing leaders including the president, Xi Jinping, the global hostility could tip US-China relations into confrontation once the pandemic was over.On Monday the US deputy national security adviser, Matthew Pottinger, sounded a warning to Beijing and asked in a speech – delivered in Mandarin – “whether China today would benefit from a little less nationalism and a little more populism”.Around the world infection numbers and fatalities have continued to rise. The death toll has passed a quarter of a million globally, and the US’s daily toll is projected to double by June to 3,000 according to the New York Times, which cited “internal document” containing projections “based on modelling by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and pulled together in chart form by the Federal Emergency Management Agency”.By Tuesday morning the United Kingdom was approaching the death toll of Italy with 28,734 fatalities recorded. So far at least 29,079 people in Italy have died of Covid-19 – the second most globally after the US – although it is believed by experts that the true death toll is higher.

I had an early taste of it in the summer of 2016. After finishing college for the year, I found myself at home with a gap in my schedule and a need to maintain my own sanity. A language learning site had a 50 per cent sale, so, obviously, I decided to learn Greek. And yet, more than teaching me about Plato’s cave or Alectryon turning into a rooster, I ended up intrigued at how much it schooled me about Irish, and how you don’t always need to attend a class –or even be in a country – to learn a language.I have a good level of Irish, despite never attending a Gaeltacht, Gaelscoil, getting grinds or studying it in college nor could my parents converse in the language. Seeing that learning Irish is back on many of your bucket lists, after running through the mill of language pedagogy, mostly on the “cheap” and “free” end, I feel I have lessons to save you the hassle.So how did I learn Greek? My main method was been a mix of Rosetta Stone (a paid language app), conversations with Greek friends online, watching some Greek Spongebob, reading a Mr Men book, some Skype tutorials included in my subscription, as well as a few trips to Greece for a film festival. So, what are my key takeaways?After winning a raffle to represent my film camp at a youth media festival called Camera Zizanio at 16, I fell headfirst into the rich world of Greek culture. I continued to be invited in years that followed, and this gave me an urge to learn the intricate language – and be able to read its road signs after getting lost in the small town of Pyrgos on too many occasions.Compared to earlier encounters, it was here I realised that language learning lives and dies upon the altar of motivation. At school, languages seem to be taught in a pressure cooker, with the impetus being to pass an exam. For Greek, it was different. The idea of being able to read and communicate made a huge difference to my learning. In writing this article, I spoke to Darach Ó Séaghdha, author of Motherfoclóir. His book, Twitter and podcast look at snippets of Irish words, in what is usually an irreverent swipe. “The big thing is small achievable goals,” he says. “It might be as simple as going to an ATM and using the Irish language service.”2. Be confident with your mediocrity or you’ll never get betterThere is a New Yorker cartoon that goes, “Let me interrupt your expertise with my confidence” The special ingredient, it seems, is having the courage to look stupid.The next time I met a speaker, I caught them off-guard with a cheery “how are things?” in my best Greek and, naturally, got a big laugh for my pronunciation.Yet, these awkward moments are where you learn the most. They are even something to be proud of. Well, maybe.Ó Séaghdha adds: “Once you’re in a conversation and realise a mistake isn’t the end of the world – that’s when you start properly learning.”On my next trip to Pyrgos, I got soaked in the rain and walked into a taverna where the waiting staff could not speak English. So, I said, in my faltering Greek: “My shoes are wet, do you have any old newspaper?” To my astonishment, it worked.The staff were impressed, and also likely welcomed the free entertainment. These innocuous interactions made months of practice worth it, and I long remember them where the people in question probably do not. I do appreciate that in the current climate, this may not be an option.3. Chat with other learners onlineI was an attendee at the first pop-up Gaeltacht in 2016. What began as an idea for Dublin’s Gaelgóirí to go for drinks on a Thursday night, turned into an open source idea used all over the world – and even in other languages including Manx, Scots Gaelic and Cornish. It seemed to capture a zeitgeist of a new generation of Gaelgóirí who were erse, urban and connected through social media.The pop-up Gaeltachtaí have been put on hold for the foreseeable future, but that’s not to stop it from moving into the cibear-Gaeltacht.For the purposes of this article, I hosted an online pop-up Gaeltacht, helped along with a newfound adeptness in video conferencing.Seven of us dialled in from a range of locations – Laois to Limerick, London, and Belfast. I was unsure how people would react, pencilling in just 15 minutes for our experiment, though most of us ended up staying for over an hour. Success!There are certainly kinks to be smoothed out nonetheless, it has potential.Besides transcending the need to share a physical space, online pop-up Gaeltachtaí have advantages that I overlooked. Some callers remarked they hadn’t been able to attend pub-based pop-ups due to work or childcare, so this could be a new way to learn. 4. Embrace social media, TV and onlineIf you would like to do some passive learning, “like” or “follow” some of the gamut of Irish media and allow them to slowly conquer your newsfeed.These include TG4’s youth channel Bloc , as well as RTÉ’s Beo ar Éigean podcast. BBC’s Faduda is particularly good for learners, with a range of 60-second vlogs from Irish speakers around the world. Musically, there has been a rise in Irish releases over the last five years. You can now find original music in most genres as Gaeilge. These range from the haunting vocals of Muireann Nic Amhlaoibh, to the often controversial Belfast rap group Kneecap . Nos.ie is a good resource here.Duolingo, the lime green bird, now teaches 35 languages for English speakers. Their press office tells me that demand is presently at an “all time high” during lockdown.I first tried Duolingo in earnest in 2018, completing a 30-day streak in Russian, returning two years later to try Scots Gaelic.Overall, I found it to be very good. Duolingo has improved how it “gamifies” its app by collecting badges and an in-app “currency”’ to buy outfits for Duo and other perks.My main critique is the way it teaches through translation to be problematic. I think when you learn a language through the lens of another, it’s difficult to truly attain it. Duolingo is similar to the paid Rosetta Stone app, which uses no direct translation, a method I preferred. The main thing with both apps is to ritualise them before the novelty wears off - and it does. I personally found it easiest to pair practice with a routine you already have, such as making TikTok’s or sourdough bread. Used with a mix of approaches, Duolingo can be a powerful and free resource.Its press office says there are 969,000 Irish learners on the app worldwide. This includes regular users as well as anyone who has tried the course in the last year. They could not say how far people have taken their learning, or how many have completed the course since it launched in 2014.6. Enjoy broadening your mindIn Motherfoclóir, Darach’s late father, Dónal, who spoke seven languages, suggested “an idea was like a liquid and languages were like differently-shaped glasses the liquid would take the shape of whatever glass it was poured into’’.For me, I’ve found learning languages broadens my mind to see the same thing in so many ways. Being able to speak Irish gives me a sense of pride, and is an inclusive expression of Irishness that can belong to anyone.As well as Irish and Greek, I’ve had a go at a number of languages in a distinctly non-committed way, all of this facilitated by free resources. Win, lose or draw, I never come back not having felt enriched – or with a slightly better understanding of a culture by learning how they express themselves.For those of you with time to fill, this could be just what you’re looking for.

Internationally, the target adoption rates for tracker apps has been estimated at up to 60 per cent of the population, but Mr Harris says a US app similar to the one being developed by the HSE needs at least a 25 per cent uptake in order to have a significant impact on the rate of infection.“The fact is that for contact tracing operations, every additional contact that the app can identify will enhance our existing contact tracing processes. The more people that use the app, the more effective it will be.”The model Ireland is using for its contact tracing app will be “less intrusive” than the types being developed in other countries, according to HSE chief executive Paul Reid, speaking on Sunday.The model, similar to the approach being followed in Germany, which retains data on the mobile phone rather than being centrally collected, will “mitigate” any data protection concerns, he said.The HSE would engage with the Data Protection Commissioner on privacy aspects and was aiming to have the app ready by the end of May.Mr Reid said the app would work on Bluetooth technology and users would have the option of providing details of their phone number.The HSE is continuing to work with Apple and Google to ensure these companies can provide the support required for the plan, he added.The app will work with a smartphone that is generally less than five years old.In some countries that have already developed apps, the take-up has been disappointing, but the technology is seen as a useful supplement to manual tracing of contacts of people who become infected. The Irish team developing the app is working closely with EU counterparts and the national health service in the UK to make sure the technology can be used across borders, according to the Minister.The app is to undergo extensive testing and trialling over the coming weeks, Mr Harris said in a briefing note on the project. The focus of contact tracing services is on the proximity between two app users within critical windows of time but location data from the app is “not of interest” to the HSE, he said.Use of the app will be limited to people aged 16 years or over as this is the digital age of consent.While the app will not record or collect exact location information, users would be given the option of volunteering their “general locality”, according to Mr Harris.As part of testing procedures, up to 2,000 volunteers will install and use the app for a period of time.In relation to the cross-border use of the app, Mr Harris said inter-operability between EU member states and use of the app across the Border “presents specific challenges which have yet to be addressed”.“The specific challenge of North-South travel in Ireland and across the Irish Sea has been highlighted in EU meetings convened to discuss eHealth and the app.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4243086.1588356643!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus the reopening ireland plan in detail","story":"The current restrictions on social and economic life will be maintained for a further fortnight, and will be eased in stages from May 18th, the Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has announced this evening.“We need two more weeks,” Mr Varadkar said to effectively control the spread of the virus, warning that opening up the lockdown now could result in the country going “back to square one”.He announced two minor changes to the current restrictions - the 2km limit will be extended to 5km and over 70s will now be told that they can leave their homes but only if they avoid all contact with other people. Otherwise all restrictions will remain in place.Mr Varadkar said that on May 18th, should progress in containing the virus continue in the intervening two weeks, then the restrictions will be eased in a series of five stages, three weeks apart. “Our plan is to re-open the country in a slow, staged, phased way,” Mr Varadkar said.On May 18th, some retail outlets such as garden centres and DIY centres will be allowed open, some outdoor sports will be allowed and small groups of family and friends will be permitted to meet in the open. Construction and outdoor work will restart.In later phases, other businesses will be allowed reopen. Schools and colleges will reopen in September and October at the beginning of the next academic year. Cafes and restaurants will reopen on June 29th and pubs will reopen on August 10th.However, Mr Varadkar warned that the easing of the restrictions will depend on there being no “second wave” of the virus which could overwhelm health services.“Unfortunately the risk of a second wave of the virus is ever present,” he said. “So we can only move from one phase to the next if the virus stays under control between each phase. And there is a risk that we’d have to go back a phase if that happens.“In any scenario, at least until we have a vaccine or effective treatment, there will be a long-term need for physical distancing, good hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene, regular cleaning and for people to stay at home and isolate if they are sick.”Micheál Martin said he agreed with the cautious advice of the public health officials but called for clarity about the leaving certificate.Mary Lou McDonald said that it was “essential” to have a roadmap for the reopening of Ireland, and said that the testing capacity needed to be improved to allow for the lockdown to be lifted.In a televised address on Friday, Mr Varadkar said thousands of lives have been saved “because of the sacrifices and choice you have made”.“When we come through this, we will come together as a nation and grieve for everyone who has died over the course of this emergency,” he said.But he warned that the phases of reopening the country may have to be reversed back a step, if the rate of the infection increases significantly as the lockdown is eased.“We need two more weeks of tight restrictions,” Mr Varadkar said, so the virus does not have a chance to make a “comeback”.The curve has been flattened but “we have not yet won this fight”, he said.“I know for me the worst part has been the daily text message I receive at around 5 o’clock every evening of the number of deaths, and number of new cases,” the Taoiseach said. “I yearn for the day it stops.”The Full PlanTaoiseach Leo Varadkar has said that Ireland will begin re-opening from May 18th under a roadmap which contains five phases.The first phase begins on May 18thIn this early stage, up to four people not of the same household will be able to meet outdoors while maintaining strict social distancing. Funerals will still be a maximum of ten people. Outdoor workers in construction can return including gardeners and those working on allotments. But remote working will remain in place for the vast majority of businesses. Garden centres and hardware stores can reopen as well as opticians, bike repairs and phone repairs.Electrical outlets may open\u0026nbspTennis courts and golf courses can reopen but social distancing will apply. Outdoor public amenities and tourism sites may open. A maximum of four people can engage in outdoor sporting and fitness activities. Schools and college buildings will be opened to allow teachers to organise remote learning.The second phase begins on June 8thIn this phase, people will now be permitted to travel up to 20km but will be advised to avoid all unnecessary journeys. Over 70s will be allowed to shop at specific hours. Visits to homes of over 70s will be permitted by no more than a few people for a short period of time and they must wear gloves, face coverings, maintaining strict 2m social distancing.For everyone else, up to four people may visit another household for a short period of time while maintaining strict social distancing. In terms of funerals, slightly larger numbers of people can be in attendance at funerals but they will still be restricted to immediate family and close friends.There will be a “phased return” of other workers who can maintain a distance from others of two metres at all times.\u0026nbspBusinesses that can maintain remote working will be asked to do so. Small retail outlets, with a small number of staff, and open marts could also\u0026nbspreopen.Libraries can open with limited numbers. People can engage in outdoor sporting and fitness activities where there is a small group team but this does not include matches.The third phase begins on June 29thTravel restrictions will remain at 20km. Cafes and restaurants that can adhere to social distancing guidelines will reopen. Creches will be reopened but only for the children of essential workers. Hospital and prison visits may resume but consideration will have to be given to the availability of PPE in each unit.Businesses will be asked to continue with remote working where possible but organisations where employees have a low level of daily interaction may return. There will be a phased reopening of non-essential retail outlets on the basis of restriction on the number of staff and customers per square metre so that social distancing can be maintained. This will be limited to retail outlets with street-level entrance and exit i.e. which are not in enclosed shopping centres due to higher risk.Playgrounds will be reopened where social distancing and hygiene can be maintained. Some “behind closed doors” sporting activities will be permitted. Public transport will remain restricted. The Government will consider implementing travel restrictions on numbers travelling to and in major urban centres.The fourth phase begins on July 20thIn this phase, people can now travel outside their region. A slightly larger number of people (more than four, but the exact number has not yet been specified)\u0026nbspmay visit another household for a short period of time while maintaining social distancing. Small social gatherings by family and close friends will be limited to a maximum number of attendees for a limited period of time where social distancing can be maintained. The same will apply to other social gatherings outside of family and friends.Creches for all other workers will reopen but only for one a day a week to start with. Businesses will be asked to stagger work hours but Government will ask that remote working will continue. Hairdressers and barbers may reopen as well as museums, galleries, religious places of worship. Hotels and hostels will reopen on limited occupancy. Hotel bars will remain closed. Caravan and holiday parks may reopen. Restrictions on the numbers allowed to travel into urban centres will be decreased on public transport.The last phase begins on August 10thPubs, bars, nightclubs and casinos will reopen where social distancing and cleaning can be complied with. Festivals and other cultural gatherings may be held but with restricted numbers. Large weddings will still be restricted due to risk, as will other large gatherings. Normal visiting will resume in hospitals.A phased return to normal work will start around this time. Shopping centres will reopen as well as theatres and cinemas that can maintain social distancing. Close physical contact sports like rugby, boxing and wrestling will be permitted. Gyms can reopen where there is regular and effective cleaning.Sports spectatorship which involves mass gatherings will be permitted, but only in accordance with both indoor and outdoor number restrictions. Indoor recreational venues like roller skating, bowling alleys and bingo halls may open where numbers can be limited. High-risk organisations which cannot maintain social distancing will be asked to implement plans for how they can eventually return to full complement. Some time after this period, schools will reopen.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4244837.1588658779!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"pubs may be allowed to reopen before august 10th if they can enforce social distancing","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUnder the existing plan, published last Friday, pubs are not due to reopen until August 10th.

All say that the phased reopening of commercial and social life will only proceed if the suppression of the virus continues.The  also understands that Ministers have been discussing new travel restrictions for people coming into Ireland once the reopening begins here and in other countries. Officials from the departments of health, transport and justice, as well as from the Attorney General’s office, are understood to be consulting on options.Officials monitor the numbers of travellers coming into the country every day and their reasons for making the journey to Ireland. The numbers are currently extremely low. However, once countries begin to reopen, the numbers are expected to grow quickly and there is concern that incoming travellers could carry the virus into the community.QuarantineThe feasibility of enforcing a 14-day quarantine is likely to be discussed. At present, travellers are asked to confine themselves for 14 days but the only supervision is a follow-up phone call. One proposal likely to be discussed in the coming weeks is that travellers coming into Ireland should be required to stay in a facility – such as an airport hotel – for 14 days, or pending a negative test for the virus, though this is thought to be difficult to manage. However, senior sources said that there would be no restrictions on the Border with Northern Ireland.A further 16 people diagnosed with Covid-19 have died in the Republic, health officials disclosed on Monday, bringing to 1,319 the total number of deaths associated with the disease.Six more coronavirus-related deaths were recorded in Northern Ireland, bringing the total number of hospital fatalities in the North to 387.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Garda\u0026iacute to release figures on arrests over breaches of travel restrictionsMore than 80 per cent of people with respiratory illness concerned about testingMale aged 20 charged over September 2019 incident at Athboy, Co MeathMay 5th marks International Day of The MidwifeRemote hearings \u0026lsquoa way of tiding us over until we get back to physical hearings\u0026rsquoArea ideal to restore habitats and woodland but destruction extensive, says authorSenior Government figures have indicated that they are prepared to amend the Reopening Ireland planYoung Greens express disappointment at party\u0026rsquos decision to enter formal negotiationsStalled property market and the prospect of another economic downturn have badly hit solicitorsCovid-19 restrictions puts husband\u0026rsquos visa on holdMinister seeks seasonal vaccination for children and others in recognised at-risk groupsParty leaders are likely to agree a timetable for talks on formation of the next governmentHealth system stuck in \u0026lsquoparalysis mode\u0026rsquo for the past two months during pandemic crisisEvidence emerges of large increase in travel across Border region despite virus hazardsFr William Stuart says situation is critical in Lebanon camp. \u0026lsquoPeople are starving\u0026rsquoTasc study is surveying people across the labour force affected by pandemic impactSixty members of Children\u0026rsquos Rights Alliance want department retained in current formWashing hands regularly and properly will prevent against spread of Covid-19, says Prof Martin CormicanStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4244877.1588629112!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"near full flight without social distancing prompts aer lingus review","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t “The safety and security of Aer Lingus’s customers and crew is our top priority and any process changes that are identified as being required will be implemented as a matter of urgency.” Photograph: Colin KeeganCollins Dublin Aer Lingus is to conduct a review after pictures emerged of an almost full flight with no apparent evidence of social distancing measures.The airline said any process changes required would be implemented as a “matter of urgency”.The move came as pictures were shared from inside the cabin of a Belfast-London Heathrow flight on Monday morning, showing row after row filled with passengers.Passenger Sean Mallon told BBC Radio Ulster there was “no social distancing whatsoever”.“I would say there was about 95 per cent of the seats taken on the flight,” he said.In a statement, Aer Lingus said: “In light of the unexpectedly high loads on the Belfast-London Heathrow service this morning and the level of demand for the route, Aer Lingus is reviewing its processes and procedures applicable to the operation of this service.“The safety and security of Aer Lingus’s customers and crew is our top priority and any process changes that are identified as being required will be implemented as a matter of urgency.” – Press AssociationEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4243939.1588523161!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"britain rejects request for permanent eu office in belfast","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMichael Gove wrote to the SDLP, Sinn Féin, Alliance and the Greens saying that an EU office in Belfast was unnecessary. Photograph: Chris J RatcliffeGettyThe British government has been accused of being “petty”, “provocative” and “unhelpful” after it rejected a request for the European Union to have a permanent office in Belfast. British cabinet office Minister Michael Gove responded to the North’s four pro-Remain parties – Sinn Féin, the SDLP, Alliance and the Greens – to say that an office was unnecessary.Mr Gove said it would facilitate, where necessary, ad hoc visits by EU officials to Northern Ireland but it did not accept any permanent EU presence was required in Northern Ireland.The four parties wrote to the British prime minister Boris Johnson last month urging that an EU office be re-established. The EU also made a request for an office in Belfast.The previously permanent European Commission office closed at the end of January when the UK quit the EU.There was an expectation at the time that some form of EU presence would be created later to assist continuing EU-UK business, but Mr Gove, responding on behalf of Mr Johnson, appears to have closed down that possibility.The current stance of the British government appears in direct contrast to its position in February last year when it said it not only supported having an EU office in Belfast but in London, Edinburgh and Cardiff as well.Just over a week ago Mr Gove told British MPs there was no need for a “mini embassy” in Belfast.In the 2016 referendum, 56 per cent of the electorate in Northern Ireland voted to stay in the EU.EU fundingNotwithstanding the negative response, the Irish Government appears not to have given up hope that an office might yet be created. Previous figures from the European Commission office in Belfast show that going back to 1989 the EU supported the peace process, agriculture, fisheries, jobs and much more to the tune of more than €13 billion. It also plans to continue providing peace funding in the North.“We would see no issue in terms of the Good Friday agreement in having an EU office in Northern Ireland, not least given ongoing EU support for the peace process,” said a Department of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman on Sunday.“The Irish Government hopes this matter can be accommodated in a way that satisfies both sides’ needs and sensitivities,” she added.The Sinn Féin MP for North Belfast John Finucane said Mr Gove’s “mini embassy” comments were “provocative and deeply unhelpful at a crucial period in Brexit negotiations”.“The ongoing opposition by the British government to a European Union office in the North is in bad faith,” he said.SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said the British government response was “petty” but “unsurprising”.Alliance leader Naomi Long also described the decision as “petty”.“This gamesmanship from the UK government is reflective of their wider approach of not taking preparations for the implementation of the Ireland-Northern Ireland protocol seriously,” she said. The DUP and Ulster Unionist Party, however, supported the British government’s position. In a brief statement, a DUP spokesman said, “We agree with UK government policy.”The Ulster Unionist Party leader Steve Aiken said there was no need for a permanent office in Belfast“The idea of EU ‘perm reps’ with extra jurisdiction powers like the EU had in the Balkans is simply not acceptable in the UK – and it is inconceivable that any EU country would accept that on their sovereign territory,” he said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsGreen Party leader Eamon Ryan is to meet Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin on Tuesday morning to begin the process of negotiations that the three men hope will result in a new coalition government.The three leaders are likely to agree a timetable for negotiations to take place over the coming weeks, as well as broad outlines for how the process will work.The move, which follows a vote by the Green parliamentary party on Sunday to enter formal talks, takes place against differing background noise in the Fianna Fáil and Green Party organisations. The membership of all three parties will be ask to approve a final deal, if one is agreed by negotiators in the coming weeks.The Greens’ leader has received fierce criticism on social media following the party’s decision, though there has also been significant support for the measure. And Mr Ryan received a boost on Monday when the deputy leader of the party, Catherine Martin, who voted against entering into talks on coalition, said she accepted the result of the parliamentary party’s vote and would engage “in good faith” with the talks process.Speaking to The , Ms Martin said she would support all efforts to arrive at the best programme for government possible and then make a judgment on whether to support entering into coalition on the basis of the document.Ms Martin and others in the parliamentary party had wanted firm guarantees from Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael on a number of issues, including committing to a 7 per cent annual reduction in greenhouse gases, before agreeing to enter government negotiations.She argued that further clarifications would help to build support for any deal with the membership of the party, where a two-thirds majority in favour of any deal is needed to enter government.“I think it would have been better to iron out any ambiguities from the outset,” she said.OppositionMeanwhile, the Fianna Fail members of Donegal County Council have written to Mr Martin to express their opposition to any coalition with Fine Gael and the Greens and have called for a national government as the best thing for the country and the party.The chairman of the party’s Donegal councillors, Patrick McGowan, and the group’s whip, Ciarán Brogan, wrote to Mr Martin on behalf of all their colleagues warning that the party would be “destroyed” in the next local elections if it entered government with Fine Gael now.They warned that if a deal with Fine Gael proceeded the party would “lose all credibility completely undermine our republican, historical and established principles which have served Fianna Fáil well since our formation allow Sinn Féin to staunchly establish themselves as the main opposition party and alternative political or establishment force in waiting and cause our party to be destroyed in forthcoming electoral outings, losing many seats, presumably at the 2024 local elections”.The group also said it was opposed to a coalition with the Green Party.“Any move to include the Green Party and their urban-based and climate-centred agenda would further exacerbate the urban-rural ide and create further devastation to rural counties like Donegal,” they said.Senior Fianna Fáil sources acknowledge that there is opposition to a coalition with Fine Gael and the Greens throughout the organisation, but say there is little evidence that it represents a majority view in the party. Dublin Fingal TD Darragh O’Brien pointed out that the party’s councillors in the constituency had voted to back a deal with Fine Gael.Several Oireachtas members who have spoken to The  in recent weeks said they believed a coalition deal would ultimately be accepted by the party organisation, though they said there would undoubtedly be an internal party fight.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":null,"title":"danish grandparents allowed hug grandchildren schools across","story":"Grandparents were given the all-clear to see, hug and even kiss their grandchildren by Denmark’s Health Authority on Monday in new national guidelines for people most at risk from coronavirus. The fresh advice also increased the age of people automatically classified as at risk from 65 to 70 years-old. The new Danish advice was published as countries across Europe begin easing some of the stringent lockdown measures that have changed everyday life on the continent. You can of course give hugs to those closest to you, for example your partner, children and grandchildren, the guidance reads. But avoid handshakes, hugs and kisses on the cheek with anyone apart from those closest to you. The guidelines were changed to better balance the risk of infection with Covid-19 with the long-term dangers to mental and physical health that come with continued isolation, The Local website reported. Of course, we recommend that people who are at increased risk remain aware and still look after themselves,” Camilla Rathcke, who helped revise the government advice, said. “But we also recommend that you try to find a small group of people you can meet, she told the Danish state broadcaster. Fit and healthy people should not isolate themselves just because they fall into a high risk category, such as those with heart and lung disease or reduced immune systems, she said. Ms Rathcke said, “It is neither good nor necessary to isolate yourself in the long term, and that is why we have come up with new recommendations on how to continue living your life, even if you have an illness or a condition that increases your risk.We have seen a tendency for some people to shield themselves almost a bit too much. Perhaps so much that they have become lonely and sad through sitting about at home by themselves. Denmark was one of the first countries in Europe to go into lockdown and was the first country outside Asia to begin easing its lockdown measures.It was the first country in Europe to reopen its schools and nurseries. They reopened on April 15 with social distancing measures for children up to the age of 12. Hairdressers and small businesses opened five days later. Last week, the government in Copenhagen said the spread of Covid-19 had not accelerated since the loosening of the restrictions.  The so-called \u0027R rate\u0027, which shows the average number of infections one person with the virus causes, has increased slightly in the past two weeks but remains below 1.0, it said.Coronavirus infection rates had increased from 0.6 to 0.9 since schools reopened. “There is no indication that we are heading into another wave. That has been the concern, but I can\u0027t see that at all, said Christian Wejse, a scientist at the department of infectious diseases at Aarhus UniversityGovernments around the world want the \u0027R rate\u0027 to be below 1.0 - meaning each infected person transmits the virus to less then one other - before loosening their lockdowns.Denmark’s government will not decide which other restrictions could be lifted until “very close” to May 10, Mette Frederiksen, the prime minister, said on Sunday.It is insidious, this disease, and things might look different in a few days,” she said in a television interview.  If you go too fast and become impatient and open up too much, then we risk the infection spreading and us losing the control we have achieved the first time around,” she said. The second phase of easing the Danish lockdown could include reopening shopping centres, cafes and restaurants and schools to pupils above the age of 12. Denmark has recorded 484 deaths from 9,670 confirmed infections since the pandemic. Its close neighbour Sweden, which never closed its schools for the under 16s or entered lockdown, has announced 2,769 from 22,721 cases. Germany plans a partial reopening of its schools this week. First, 11 and 17-year-olds who are set to take their final exams will go back this weekend in parts of Germany, although other regions of the country have set a later return date. France will begin a staggered reopening of schools from May 11, beginning with nurseries and primary schools.At the weekend, Spaniards were allowed to leave their homes to exercise for the first time since March 14. Their schools will not open before September. Parks and gardens have reopened in Italy, the worst hit countries in Europe,  and visits to family and partners are now allowed but schools are expected to stay closed until September. In Belgium, restrictions were slightly eased on Monday but schools are expected to start reopening from May 18. Dutch primary schools will open on May 11 with secondary schools to begin a gradual return from June 2. In Greece, final year students will return from May 11 before all over 13s return the week after.  June 1 has been mooted as a possible return date for primary school pupils. More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"golfers anglers ready cast coronavirus lockdown restrictions","story":"They describe their passion as naturally self-isolating and even warn that large crowds and successful fishing don\u0027t mix.It is little wonder, then, that, as football\u0027s Project Restart stutters, it is angling\u0027s When We Fish Again proposal that is actually leading the drive for sport\u0027s return from the coronavirus lockdown.Calling itself an inherently social distancing sport, the Angling Trust has submitted a 15-page report to the Government which is fast gathering support, raising hope that recreational fishing could resume within days.Strict stipulations would include local fishing only, no sharing of tackle, online or electric tickets and a 15-metre (49ft) riverbank gap between anglers.Golf authorities have also submitted a proposal for courses to reopen when the lockdown is reviewed later this week, with proposed safeguards to include the removal of bunker rakes and no touching of flagsticks. Craig Tracey, the chairman of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Golf, said that the sport can, and should, return quickly.Anglers also believe that they have a compelling case and have cited Germany, Holland, Norway, Denmark and Ireland as countries that have continued to allow fishing while still limiting the coronavirus spread.The majority of anglers practise self-isolation and social distancing as a matter of course - anglers tend to seek solitude even in normal circumstances, said Jamie Cook, the chief executive of the Angling Trust.In its submission to the Government, the Angling Trust also explained that 62 per cent of the sport\u0027s participants identified fishing as their sole physical activity. For many, this is their only exercise, said Mr Cook.Angling is also estimated to contribute around £4 billion to the UK economy and, in Holland, fishing permit sales have increased by 30 per cent during the coronavirus lockdown.With the UK\u0027s trout season usually starting in early April and the coarse season opening on rivers in mid-June, anglers are particularly keen to see the benefits of one of the wettest winters in recent years.Martin Salter, the former MP for Reading and the head of policy at the Angling Trust, has suggested a phased resumption, stressing fishing\u0027s erse appeal and its potential to reduce pressure on other public spaces.Sir Charles Walker, who is the chairman of the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Angling, also cited the mental-health benefits. It is an activity which is already prescribed by several NHS Trusts for mental health wellbeing, as well as military charities to combat post-traumatic stress disorder.People are more vulnerable - the longer this goes on, we are storing up a mental-health crisis, said Mr Walker. Allowing people to resume their lives step by step will be a really powerful weapon in mitigating those risks. Mr Walker now hopes that other sports can follow angling\u0027s lead.The focus has been on professional sport which covers a fraction of the population, he said. All of us weekend warriors, putting on our football boots or grabbing our fishing rods, covers millions and millions of people.Hopefully, what we and golf have done will be held up as best practice.Under golf\u0027s proposals, no one will be permitted on to the premises unless they have pre-booked a tee-off time that will be staggered at a minimum of 10-minute intervals.The two-metre (6ft) social distancing gap must be observed and players would not be able to touch each other\u0027s equipment.With no bunker rakes, players would be expected to smooth over the sand with clubs and feet. There would be no benches, bins or water stations and, while flagsticks will remain, it is strongly recommended that a sign is affixed stating that it is not to be touched.Clubhouses themselves are unlikely to reopen imminently and some sports would also need time to bring staff back from furlough to open their facilities. There is also caution within the Government over the potential message that could be sent to other sports, especially contact and team activities, which will almost certainly remain shut for the foreseeable future.As well as the proposals from angling and golf, most sports have been in talks with Sport England and the Government about how they could be phased back.What we are anxious to make sure is that, when there is clarity about what the circumstances under lockdown are, and if there is some gradual easing of that, then what does that mean in terms of what is possible, said Tim Hollingsworth, Sport England\u0027s chief executive.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"schools seek ruling post lockdown absentees","story":"Headteachers have urged the Government to tell them whether to fine parents who refuse to take their children to school after lockdown.School leaders are urging ministers to clarify whether it will be compulsory or optional for pupils to attend school when it has been opened again for their age group.Ordinarily, children are only allowed to miss school if they are too ill to go in or if they have advance permission from the headteachers.Parents can be issued with £60 fines if their children are absent with no good reason, which doubles to £120 if it is not paid within 21 days. If it is not paid after 28 days, parents face prosecution by their local authority.But it is unclear whether or not schools should record and report absences in the usual way when schools begin their phased return next month.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Headteachers (NAHT), said it is up to the Government to instil confidence in parents that it is safe to take their children to school. If parents don\u0027t have the confidence, it\u0027s not the job of headteacher to make decisions about whether they should be fined or not, he told The .If we open schools and no one arrives, it seems a bit of a pointless exercise. Children are precious to parents. They won\u0027t want to be taking any risks with their health and future. Their level of confidence in taking part is a very serious matter.NAHT, the main union for primary school headteachers, is undertaking a survey on parental attitudes to schools reopening and will report back to ministers with its findings this week. Primary schools are expected to reopen as soon as June 1, with Year 6 pupils likely to be the first back.Year 10 and Year 12 pupils are expected to form the first wave of pupils returning to secondary school at a later point. The earliest possible return of primary schoolchildren is intended to minimise the threat to early years development and help parents to return to work.Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said that ultimately parents will vote with their feet, adding: If they don\u0027t think it is safe to send their children to school, they won\u0027t do so.He said that official guidance should make it clear that children who are likely to develop severe health issues if they get coronavirus, or those who live with vulnerable relatives, should not be expected to come to school.Government guidance will need to be very clear about who should be shielded in this way, Mr Barton added.It would be unthinkable to fine parents who are too worried to send their children to school, he said.School attendance should be based on families feeling confident that it is safe to return to school rather than any element of compulsion. We will need to be able to demonstrate very clearly that there are robust systems in place to protect children and staff from infection while they are in school.Read more: \u0027Schools should absolutely reopen in June\u0027 -  readers on primary schools reopening Rob Campbell, the chief executive of the Morris Education Trust, a multi-academy trust in Cambridgeshire, said that leaving the decision of whether to fine parents up to headteachers is the worst possible scenario.He said: We are happy to put in place what is determined by ministers. But if it\u0027s left up to headteachers, they are in the firing line. What if one makes a different decision to another up the road?

It can to a degree be applied to all of Germany — corrected for demography, of course.”It is still not clear whether those who recover from the virus have any form of immunity, or how long it may last, Prof Streeck told Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper.“But we can draw conclusions from the laboratory,” he said. “Trained immune responses can block the virus, and we know in the case of other corona viruses that you can have at least partial immunity.”So far 165,745 have tested positive for the virus in Germany and 6.866 people have died, according to Johns Hopkins University. That suggests a fatality rate of 4.1 per cent, but most scientists believe there are many more undetected infections.The majority of those who are infected show only mild symptoms, and a fifth show no symptoms at all, the Gangelt study found.“The fact every fifth infection apparently has no noticeable symptoms suggests it is not possible to identify infectious people this way,” said Prof Martin Exner, another of the study’s authors. “Every apparently healthy person we encounter could be unwittingly carrying the virus. We have to keep this in mind and act accordingly.”The Gangelt study has proved controversial in Germany. Rival scientists have questioned its methodology and they were quick to cast doubt on Monday\u0027s findings.Prof Gérard Krause of the Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research pointed to the fact only seven people are known to have died of the virus in Gangelt.“That means one death more or less would make a really significant difference to the study,” he said.The findings come as Germany faces a “week of truth”, with the first reliable data on lifting its lockdown expected within days.Despite widely reported claims of a second wave in Germany — repeated by Dominic Raab in a Number 10 press conference — there is no data on the effects of easing restrictions yet.The shops were allowed to reopen in Germany two weeks ago, but new infections take time to develop and German government scientists assume a lag of 10-14 days before they show up in tests.With a delay in reporting after a holiday weekend, the first reliable figures are expected from Tuesday ahead of talks between Angela Merkel and regional leaders on Wednesday to decide future lockdown measures.Mrs Merkel is under growing pressure from the business community to speed up the reopening of the economy, and several regional governments are threatening to go it alone if there is no national concensus on easing restrictions further.North Rhine-Westphalia, the most populous of Germany’s 16 states, says it will reopen nurseries and kindergartens unilaterally if other regions do not agree.Lower Saxony is pushing for restaurants, pubs and beer gardens to be allowed to reopen from next week, and Saxony-Anhalt has already broken ranks, announcing it will allow gatherings of up to five people in public and an end to the ban on visiting relatives in retirement and care homes.“Our companies want and need to know when social and economic life will start again,” Dieter Kempf, the president of the German Federation of Industry (BDI), said. “Every week of lockdown is costing the German economy a mid double-digit figure in the billions.”Even after the reopening of shops, the current lockdown is costing every German €60 a day, Prof Jens Südekum, a leading economist claimed.“Lift the lockdown before it is too late!” the German Association of Small and Medium Enterprises said in an open letter to Mrs Merkel at the weekend.The Munich-based Ifo Institute warned on Monday that the German car industry faces the bleakest prospects in its history.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"dame judi dench mangy cats costume looked like five foxes f","story":"Audiences for the Hollywood version of Cats were haunted by the terrible costumes and CGI. So too was its most venerable star, Dame Judi Dench.The Oscar-winning actress has disclosed that, when she signed up for the film, she expected her character Old Deutoronomy to look rather elegant.Instead, she told Vogue magazine, she ended up as “a battered, mangy old cat. A great big orange bruiser. What’s that about?” As for the cloak she was made to wear: “Like five foxes f---ing on my back.”At 85, Dame Judi is the oldest person ever to grace the cover of British Vogue. Edward Enninful, the editor, called her “the unassailable queen of stage and screen” and said: “She brings great perspective and a message of hope from her own quarantine in the English countryside.  “Ever modest, the dame is not a fan of the term ‘national treasure’. But treasure her we do. Now more than ever.”Dame Judi was photographed for the cover in early February but part of the interview was conducted after lockdown.“I am sure I feel, like everyone else, such unprecedented times are quite hard to comprehend. What is a good thing is that it has made people aware of the predicament of others who are completely alone. If a great deal of kindness comes out of this, then that will be a plus,” she said. She dismissed any talk of retirement when the interviewer raised it, admonishing: “Don’t use that word…. Wash your mouth out.” The actress said she lived by the words of Dylan Thomas: “’Rage, rage against the dying of the light.’ Never was a truer word spoken.”Her dream role, she said, would be to play someone “who everyone this is a kindly, saintly, beatified kind of person, and she’s actually killing people.”One of Dame Judi’s most memorable roles was playing M in the Bond franchise. Asked if a woman could ever be cast as the spy, she said: “I don’t think Ian Fleming would want a female Bond.” Female action leads are a perfectly good thing, she said, but “call it something else, then.”:: The full interview is in the June issue of Vogue, available from Thursday May 7   More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/politics/2020/05/04/TELEMMGLPICT000230566264_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq1qK9fS0WD7QU0EDCDdqwlh8X6iOpiIWEItn7dHA-Jwo.jpeg?imwidth","title":"public opinion no obstacle lifting lockdown","story":"Polls show not a love of lockdown but rather a willingness to follow the Prime Minister\u0026#39s leadMuch has been made of the fact that the public tell opinion polls they don’t want lockdown to end. Only 11 per cent, for example, are ready for pubs and restaurants to reopen only eight per cent want to allow mass gatherings straightaway. From this it is concluded that Boris Johnson will find it hard to persuade people to lift restrictions.That is surely a false conclusion. It is more likely that people are simply following the logic of public policy. Since the middle of March, in the most concentrated public messaging campaign ever, people have been told that they must stay at home to save lives. After a bit of grumbling at first, they decided to do so. Even if it does later turn out that the policy was wrong, it was rational to comply.Since then, the statistics have appeared to reinforce the original message. Only in very recent days have hospital death rates started to fall, and the late arrival of care-home death figures has added a new dimension of anxiety. It feels as if the crisis continues.You change your mind only if presented with clear information and argument from those in authority. No such information has yet been furnished by experts and no such argument has yet been made by ministers. Returning from his own hospitalisation due to the coronavirus, Boris Johnson went out of his way to say that the Covid “mugger” had not yet been wrestled to the ground.What the polls show, then, is not that the Prime Minister is confronting a terrified populace who won’t do what he wants. It is that the populace has followed his lead so far. If people are shown clear evidence that the situation on the ground is changing, then their attitudes will change too. They will almost certainly follow his lead again.If the statistics continue their present trends, the public will be ready for change surprisingly soon.Universities, which are now suffering so badly from the lockdown, should reconsider their almost unanimous hostility to Brexit. Under EU membership, students from other EU countries were allowed to study in Britain at the same rates as British students (and vice versa). They were also entitled to British government-backed student loans.For the time being, these arrangements remain in place, but they will soon come up for review, and they should change.The policy has meant that EU students have escaped the much higher fees which are chargeable to other foreign students. This in turn means that universities which fill up with students from the EU forego the financial benefit that would accrue if non-EU foreign students could take up their places.There were 139,000 EU students in the United Kingdom in 2017-18. If they were now to be replaced by non-EU students and by EU students paying the full whack, much more money would come in and there would still be a decent amount of space to give places to larger numbers of British students.The Government would benefit too: in 2018-19 it handed out £532 million in loans to EU students. It is quite likely that most of that enormous figure will be lost, because EU states tend not to enforce repayment, since it is not their money at stake.Of course it might turn out that our least successful universities would not be able to find enough replacements to survive. To put it brutally, that too would be a bonus.It may be well, in terms of health, that we should all wear masks as we increasingly venture out to shop, but if I were a retailer, I would have a simple anxiety.As has often been discussed in relation to wearing the burqa, having your face visible is a fairly basic part of the mutual trust necessary for successful citizenship. If your shop is full of people wearing masks, how do you identify a shoplifter?Given that it is more or less summer, could there not be more experiment with selling things outdoors? Obviously, social distancing remains a problem, but grocers’ shops have managed to make it work, so I do not see why much larger spaces should not do so too as we start easing restrictions.One factor which helps is that such large spaces are temporarily available. These are otherwise known as station car-parks. Although some trains are running, the station car-parks I have seen are operating at about two per cent of normal capacity.It would be a good moment to try out farmers’ markets andor car-boot sales on the deserted tarmac. Many of the stations have enough room to provide room for controlled parking as well as market stalls.Last week, this column proposed VE Day as an opportunity for church leaderships to show some return to life after the virus. There is still not much sign of episcopal activity, but the grass-roots are stirring to get round the bureaucracy.It was planned to ring church bells 75 times in honour of the 75 years that have passed since May 1945. But of course we are not allowed peals of bells, thanks to Covid-19. Under the rules, bells may not be rung except for the purpose of testing them. An enterprising vicar known to me has therefore arranged for the bells in the churches under his care to be “tested” 75 times this Friday.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

That suggests the same could be happening elsewhere in the universe, the researchers indicate, and that alien life could be growing in similar places.Away from Earth, there are many exoplanets that are much bigger than our planet and have large amounts of hydrogen in their atmosphere. Those atmosphere tend to extend more than those that are similar to our atmosphere, meaning they are easier to see through the telescopes we use to scour the universe for alien planets.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIn the past, those detections have been something of a disappointment, since scientists have believed that those worlds with large amounts of hydrogen would be less likely to support life. But research on them has been limited.Now scientists have attempted to address that problem by E.coli and yeast – two fundamentally different forms of life –\u0026nbspin laboratory environments akin to those worlds, on Earth. Doing so would allow the researchers to understand how such basic life forms would flourish on other planets.AI could trick us into thinking we have found aliens, scientists warnThey discovered that both were able to reproduce normally, though slowly, in atmospheres that were made entirely of hydrogen.The growth of E.coli was around two times slower, while the yeast grew about 2.5 orders of magnitute more slowly. That is thought to be a result of the lack of oxygen.Researchers hope that if such microorganisms are growing on other planets, they may one day be detectable from Earth. They tend to produce a huge variety of gases, which could eventually become thick enough on their home planets that we would be able to spot them from across the universe, they suggest.The discovery also shows how experiments in labs on Earth could help illuminate the search for alien life on other planets, they write in the study.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

Applications are via a short online form which requests only basic details.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe figures for approvals dwarf\u0026nbspthose under an existing scheme for emergency loans designed to help small and medium-sized firms get through the coronavirus pandemic.Whats is ‘bounceback’ loan cheme and how do businesses apply?Bank bosses were grilled by MPs on Monday about the slow pace of lending under the government’s Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CBILS) which allows lending facilities of up to £5m for firms turning over up to £45m.David Oldfield, chief executive of commercial banking, at Lloyds Banking Group, admitted: “We had a slow start ... it did take us some time to build momentum ... each day that goes by we are managing to get more loans out to customers.”Banks have blamed the design of CBILS, which leaves them on the hook for 20 per cent of any losses from bad loans. Given the tens of billions of pounds set to be handed to firms under the scheme, those losses could be significant.Another hurdle has been the requirement for banks to assess if companies are “viable” before lending under CBILS. Many companies have not been able to pass the requirement because the economic outlook is so uncertain and some have seen their revenues collapse due to the lockdown.Bounce-back loans, announced by chancellor Rishi Sunak last week, to respond to demands for the smallest firms, significantly cut down on red tape, with companies reporting on Monday that they had completed the application process within minutes.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Like many other nations, we have\u0026nbspseen share prices tumble, unemployment claims rise and businesses shut up shop – in some cases permanently – as a result of social distancing restrictionsHowever the technical, commonly-accepted definition of a recession is a contraction\u0026nbspin gross domestic product (GDP) for two or more consecutive quarters.In other words, the\u0026nbsptotal amount of goods and services produced by the UK would have to fall for a total period of six months.Tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world in maps and chartsWhen can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsListen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastThe latest quarterly figures available only\u0026nbspcover the three months from October 2019 to December 2019, well before the first case of Covid-19 was reported on 31 January and the beginning of the lockdown in March.That showed UK GDP as remaining\u0026nbspflat, with zero growth from the previous quarter.Figures for the first quarter of 2020 (January to March) will not be published until 12 May, with the second quarter to follow three months after that.It means that,\u0026nbspunless the previous quarterly figures are revised, we may\u0026nbspnot\u0026nbspknow for sure if the UK is\u0026nbspin recession until August.How bad will the recession be?The Treasury’s official forecaster,\u0026nbspthe Office for Budget Responsibility, has predicted the UK GDP could fall by a staggering 35 per cent in the second quarter of 2020 (between April and June).That would make it\u0026nbspthe worst slump in over 300 years – since the Great Frost of 1709, when temperatures plummeted to -10C.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Spain’s economy also contracted by around 5 per cent in the first quarter.Overall the global economy is expected to shrink by 3 per cent in 2020,\u0026nbspmaking it far worse than the 2008 crisis and the worst since the Great Depression. Of the major nations only China and India are expected to record growths in GDP for 2020.How long will it last?The predictions for the UK\u0026nbspare based on the assumption that the\u0026nbsplockdown\u0026nbspwill last three months (until 23 June) and that economic activity will gradually return to normal over the three months after that.What will actually happen remains uncertain. Boris Johnson is facing increasing calls to set out his “exit strategy” to remove restrictions and an announcement is expected early next week.However some restrictions may have to remain in place for much longer and a return to normal life involving pubs, restaurants and football games (for example) looks increasingly unlikely this year.If so, the effects on the UK economy could be even worse than predicted.When will the UK economy recover?Assuming a six-month lockdown effect, the OBR expects\u0026nbspGDP to rebound by 27 per cent in the third\u0026nbspquarter of 2020 (July to September) and 21 per cent in the fourth quarter (October to December).Under this scenario the GDP would return to its pre-virus level by the end of the year.But any recovery depends on the persistence of Covid-19 and the possibility of a “second wave” of infection.“The forceful impact of COVID-19 and the global lockdown has thrust the economy into unknown territory where we could see GDP declining at a record quarterly rate,” said economist\u0026nbspKemar\u0026nbspWhyte, of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research.“Nonetheless, instant and significant recovery remain a distinct possibility if the spread of the virus comes to halt quickly.”Office for Budget Responsibility\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Applications are via a short online form which requests only basic details.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe figures for approvals dwarf\u0026nbspthose under an existing scheme for emergency loans designed to help small and medium-sized firms get through the coronavirus pandemic.Whats is ‘bounceback’ loan cheme and how do businesses apply?Bank bosses were grilled by MPs on Monday about the slow pace of lending under the government’s Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CBILS) which allows lending facilities of up to £5m for firms turning over up to £45m.David Oldfield, chief executive of commercial banking, at Lloyds Banking Group, admitted: “We had a slow start ... it did take us some time to build momentum ... each day that goes by we are managing to get more loans out to customers.”Banks have blamed the design of CBILS, which leaves them on the hook for 20 per cent of any losses from bad loans. Given the tens of billions of pounds set to be handed to firms under the scheme, those losses could be significant.Another hurdle has been the requirement for banks to assess if companies are “viable” before lending under CBILS. Many companies have not been able to pass the requirement because the economic outlook is so uncertain and some have seen their revenues collapse due to the lockdown.Bounce-back loans, announced by chancellor Rishi Sunak last week, to respond to demands for the smallest firms, significantly cut down on red tape, with companies reporting on Monday that they had completed the application process within minutes.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

During their peak, as many as 30 of the meteors can be seen each hour.One of the most remarkable things about the\u0026nbspEta\u0026nbspAquariids\u0026nbspis their speed. They shoot into Earth\u0027s atmosphere at about 150,000mph, and can leave glowing lines across the sky as their glowing debris is left in their wake.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe show will be best viewed in the southern hemisphere, since the constellation from which they emerge is higher up in the sky and therefore any meteors are more easily spotted. In the northern hemisphere, they will often seem to skim across the horizon, giving them the name Earthgrazers.As ever, the key to seeing any meteor shower is to go somewhere that is relatively dark so that light pollution will not get in the way of the view. That may be complicated by coronavirus lockdowns and social distancing, and any trips should only be made if they are recommended.First credible evidence emerges of person being killed by meteorTo get a view, look up into the sky and try to hold your gaze there. Over time – after about 30 minutes or so – your eyes should be able to see better in the dark and any meteors will come into view.Meteor showers come when the Earth moves into the debris from comets that have moved around our Solar System. As those leftovers collide with the Earth\u0027s atmopshere, they break up create blazing lights in the sky.Each year, the Earth moves regularly through those chunks of debris. That means that the meteor showers are predictable and come at the same time each year.The debris that create the\u0026nbspEta\u0026nbspAquariids\u0026nbsporiginally came from Halley\u0027s Comet. When it makes its regular trips into the solar system – each orbit takes around 76 years – it leaves behind new debris, and the leftovers from the same comet also lead to the Orionids in October.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There will likely be a small holepunch notch in the top left of the device for the front-facing camera, but that means the phone will probably not have the Project Soli hand-gesture technology or facial-recognition found on the Pixel 4.It is expected that the device will be launched on Friday 22 May, priced at $399, although it could be delayed by the coronavirus outbreak. Google has already cancelled its IO conference\u0026nbspwhich was due to be held in May over concerns about spreading COVID-19.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It took 91 days for the global death toll to pass 100,000,\u0026nbsp16 days to reach 200,000, and a further nine days to reach a quarter of a million.The crisis has prompted an alliance of world leaders to hold a virtual summit on Monday in which they will discuss funding for a vaccine as well as developing better treatments and more efficient testing.People in many countries across the globe, and notably in Europe this week, are cautiously returning to work, but authorities remain wary of a second wave of infections, and a vaccine is the only real silver bullet to allow something like normal life to resume.The video-conference’s aim is to gather around €4bn\u0026nbsp(£3.5bn) for vaccine research, some €2bn (£1.75bn)\u0026nbspfor treatments and €1.5bn (£1.32bn) for testing. Officials say that amount is just the start, as much more will be needed in the months ahead to scale up production and distribution.In a statement ahead of the meeting, the leaders of France, Germany, Italy, Norway and top European Union (EU) officials said the money raised will be channeled mostly through recognised global health organisations.

The company has developed rechargeable, lithium-ion battery-storage projects called Tesla PowerPack and Powerwall, which have been used in Wales\u0026nbspand other parts of the UK.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe company also built the world’s-largest lithium-ion battery in South Australia, which Tesla claims\u0026nbspcan provide enough power for more than 30,000 homes.However, rather than being a direct energy provider, the company could also be using the application to launch its Autobidder service in the UK, which uses machine-learning to give information to other companies so they can better “autonomously monetize battery assets,” according to a company product page.How Tesla revolutionised the electic car marketTesla recently partnered with Octopus in the UK for Tesla car owners who have solar panels or a Powerwall to offer cheaper energy.“Your solar system, Powerwall and EV charging are connected to Tesla’s energy management platform. It is designed to improve the way you use your energy to power your lifestyle and allows any stored by your Powerwall to be exported back to the grid, to benefit both you and the community” the company wrote on an FAQ page.\u0026nbspWhether these activities are part of its application remains to be seen we have reached out to the company for comment.On Friday, Tesla founder Elon Musk deducted $14bn (£11.2bn) from the company\u0027s value after tweeting that the company’s stock was “too high” in a series of tweets where the CEO also said he would be selling almost all of his possessions.Asked whether the tweets had been checked by his lawyers before being posted, Musk said “No”.Musk has also tweeted about the lockdown caused by the coronavirus pandemic, which he called\u0026nbsp“fascistic”.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And that is a cost very much worth paying.“Even despite mass furloughing, unemployment is still soaring, with over 2 million new claims for benefits coming though.“This should remind us how badly needed the retention scheme is, but also that we are likely to be living with the legacy of high unemployment that coronavirus has given Britain, long after it has been phased out.”The figures came as pensions minister Therese Coffey said the government had received 1.8 million claims for Universal Credit between 16 March and the end of April.Ms Coffey said that overall, the volume of welfare claims had been six times bigger than pre-coronavirus during that period, and that in one particular week the increase had been tenfold.Additional reporting by agenciesOffice for Budget Responsibility\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

A replacement will be announced in due course.”In a damning response to Ms Stone’s investigation, the Commons Committee on Standards said the MP had “used his parliamentary position in an attempt to intimidate a member of the public into doing as Mr Burns wished, in a dispute relating to purely private family interests which had no connection with Mr Burns’ parliamentary duties”.Boris Johnson says he feared never meeting his newborn son WilfredJohnson’s mindless optimism won’t pull us out of this crisisJobs on line if Johnson gets lockdown exit strategy wrongJohnson’s bluff and bluster will not be enough against StarmerThe committee found that he “persisted in making veiled threats to use parliamentary privilege to further his family’s interests even during the course of the commissioner’s investigation, and … misleadingly implied that his conduct had the support of the House authorities”.The committee – which includes lay members as well as MPs – took the highly unusual step of recommending a seven-day suspension, which is almost certain to be upheld by the Commons.In a tweet, Mr Burns said: “With deep regret I have decided to resign as Minister of State for International Trade. Boris Johnson\u0026nbspwill continue to have my wholehearted support from the backbenches.”Only scant details are given in today’s report of the financial dispute in which Mr Burns intervened.The standards commissioner said she was approached by the complainant – who is not identified – over a letter on Commons headed notepaper received in February last year.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive updates on politics every morning by emailIn it, Mr Burns stated that his father had made extensive attempts over a period of years to reach a settlement on a company’s repayment of a loan but was reluctant to take legal proceedings “because of age and family sensitivity”.Urging the company to respond to his father’s demands, he added: “Failure to do so will ensure my involvement to secure the return of the money owed to my father.”And he warned: “I am acutely aware that my role in the public eye could well attract interest especially if I were to use parliamentary privilege to raise the case (on which I have taken advice from the House authorities).”In a submission to the commissioner’s inquiry, Mr Burns said he believed he was adhering with parliamentary rules in using the notepaper.“My letter was one written by a son which is very concerned at the stress and distress that the complainant’s repeated refusal to engage of the subject has caused to a man in his late 70s. If the charge is being a caring son, I would accept it,” he said.The commissioner found that Mr Burns’ use of Commons notepaper in his correspondence with the complainant appeared “more deliberate than accidental”.The report said: “The Commissioner concludes that Mr Burns should have realised that the words used in his letter would be received as a threat, and on the balance of probabilities she thinks that that was Mr Burns’ intention.The commissioner also revealed that during the course of the inquiry, Mr Burns suggested that it would be “ironic” if the complaint led to the revelation of details of the dispute which the complainant had previously attempted to keep concealed. Ms Stone said this suggestion was not “respectful of the standards system of the House”.Stating that it would be possible for the MP to give an apology without revealing details of the dispute, she added: “Mr Burns’ conduct in this matter does not reflect well on him personally.“However, I think his conduct has a wider impact. It gives fuel to the belief that Members are able and willing to use the privileges accorded them by their membership of the House to benefit their own personal interests. That Mr Burns has not acted on his threat to use parliamentary privilege will do little to dispel that belief.”Ms Stone’s report was completed last October but publication was delayed by the general election.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Leeds Green Watch firefighters observe a minute\u0027s silence outside the fire station in Kirkstall Rd, in memory their colleagues that lost their lives in the line of dutyStaff at The Berkeley hotel give food to ambulance workersOne of a small group of anti-lockdown protesters speaks to a police officer as they gather outside New Scotland Yard in Victoria, LondonBonnie the Llama grazes in a field in the Scottish Borders alongside a sign supporting the NHS as the UK continues in lockdownColonel Tom Moore and his daughter Hannah celebrate his 100th birthday, with an RAF flypast provided by a Spitfire and a Hurricane over his home in Marston Moretaine.

I am sorry I did so and regret it.”He added: “My motivation was to try and get the company to engage with my father on a long running dispute. To this day they have not done so and my father is taking court action. This has had a significant negative impact on his health.“At the time I wrote I was under a huge amount of personal stress as I explained to the Commissioner privately.“It has been very distressing to me that I have added to my elderly father’s worries. To be asked every week by him if there is news on the inquiry has been very hard to take.“I profoundly regret involving myself in this in any way and if I could turn the clock back I would not have done it.“A second Tory minister, Greg Hands, was told to apologise after admitting to using free Commons stationery and postage worth a total of around £4,500 to send a newsletter to constituents in his Hammersmith and Fulham seat.The standards committee noted that the international trade minister\u0026nbspinitially agreed to issue an apology, acknowledge he had breached Westminster rules\u0026nbspand pay for the mailshot. However, a few days later he withdrew his offer.The committee noted that his move came shortly after the prime minister called a general election and said that “he may well have been motivated by the desire\u0026nbsp to avoid the embarrassment of having to make a public apology for breaking parliamentary rules during an election campaign”.In a report upholding Ms Stone’s finding that Mr Hands had breached the rules, the committee said he should make a personal statement of apology to the Commons, not only for his breach but also for his “inappropriate conduct” in forcing a delay to the conclusion of his case.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Sir Patrick Vallance said: “When you look at everything that happened, maybe days either either way would have made a difference.”But he rejected the idea that ministers should have\u0026nbsp brought in the restrictions at the start of March.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHe told MPs: “I think it\u0027s difficult to look back and say, that\u0026nbspthree weeks (earlier), was an obvious point to do it but I don\u0027t think that was clear, I don’t think that is clear now”.Sir Patrick had been pressed by Jeremy Hunt, the former health secretary, on whether a lockdown at the start of March, which would have prevented events such as the Cheltenham Festival, would have made a significant difference.Ministers came under pressure in the days before Boris Johnson announced the sweeping restrictions after\u0026nbspcountries including Ireland and France announced their own lockdowns.Sir Patrick also said the evidence suggested many UK cases came from from Europe, rather than China, telling MPs: “There was a big influx of cases, probably from Italy and Spain in early March, seeded right across the country.”Sir Patrick said the risk of contracting coronavirus is about the same for a person spending one minute at two metres away and six seconds at one metre away.He played down the importance of face coverings, despite Boris Johnson claiming they could play a role in disease prevention and in giving people confidence when the lockdown is eased.Crucially, Sir Patrick also said that controlling outbreaks in care homes would be “critical” to preventing a second peak of the epidemic – another apparent pointer to restrictions staying in place for now.“That is an important part of this epidemic and needs to be controlled,” the chief scientific adviser saidThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Mr Erdogan also announced that authorities would allow the sale of facial masks, banned to prevent price-gouging.The lockdown on other major cities, including Istanbul, Ankara, and Izmir will continue, and Mr Erdogan warned that if social distancing and hygiene rules were not maintained, including the wearing of masks in businesses and offices, the government could reverse course and reimpose stringent rules.\u0026nbspTurkish women face high levels of violence, whatever the statisticsPPE supplies from Turkey ‘only enough to last few hours,’ report saysRAF plane on botched government PPE mission lands back in UKUK ‘only asked Turkey for PPE help on Sunday’We are at an important point in the fight against the epidemic,” Mr Erdogan said. “Our number of patients is constantly decreasing, and the number of patients that are recovering increases exponentially. We will return to normal, but this will be a new normal. Nothing will return to the order we knew before in our country as well as the whole world.Turkey has imposed draconian restrictions on public life, shuttering most businesses and barring anyone under 20 or over 65 from the streets. Weekends have been even more severe, with all but essential medical and security workers confined to their homes in 31 provinces.The removal of the restrictions comes as the country has seen the daily death toll from Covid-19 plummet from a peak of 127 on 19 April to less than 65 over the last two days. But the Istanbul Chamber of Medicine, a doctors\u0027 association, has warned against easing measures too soon. Turkey has the eighth most coronavirus cases and 12th highest number of fatalities in the world despite possibly undercounting infections.\u0026nbspAt least 3,461 people have died of coronavirus in Turkey and more than 127,000 have tested positive. The chamber said that the number of deaths in Istanbul province, the region of the country hardest hit by coronavirus, was between 3 and 35 per cent higher this year than previous years, suggesting a possible undercounting of cases.\u0026nbspDespite the decrease in the number of patients applied to hospitals and the inpatients in the eighth week of the pandemic compared to previous weeks, the danger remains serious in Istanbul, said a statement by the chamber.\u0026nbspThe discussion about the relaxation of measures should be evaluated in the light of this fact and that the cost of an early and wrong decision will be heavy.The staggered approach to removing restrictions resembles the strategy employed by other nations, including France and neighbouring Iran, which are lifting lockdowns in various regions according to colour codes corresponding to the severity of the pandemic.\u0026nbspTurkey’s economy was already in dire straits before the pandemic struck, with inflation rising, the currency losing value, and a $437 billion mountain of foreign debt bearing down on the country.\u0026nbspMr Erdogan has been eager to get the wheels of the economy spinning, and the government has permitted some construction, manufacturing and mining to continue even as much of the country was shut down to prevent the spread of the airborne pathogen.\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

with hopes being pinned on the antibody test, which can tella person has had the disease and is immune to it.So what needs to happen before lockdown can be lted On Monday, May , Mr Hancock was joined by Professor Jonathan Van-Tam in the daily coronavirus press briefing.The Deputy Chief Medical Officer for England laid out a five-point criteria of what needs to be done or met before relaxing the lockdown restrictions.This is an area that has already largely been met around the country, as hospitals begin to feel an ease of strain.Field hospitals were set up to help them deal with this pressure, like the Nightingale Hospital at the London ExCel Arena.It was set up in early April with a capacity of , beds - but on May , it was placed on standby and stopping admissions, as it currently only has  patients recovering from coronavirus.Similar has happened at the other temporary hospitals across the UK, with Manchester, Birmingham, Cardf, Glasgow and Belfast also having centres.The UKs daily death toll hit its peak on April  when nearly , people died in and out of hospital due to coronavirus.Yet, since the start of May, deaths have fallen each day including  on May  - the lowest rise in five weeks.Although this still needs to be lowered, the consistent fall provides hopes that Covid- is becoming manageable and the end is in sight.The infection rate remains over the , new cases limit - which has been seen as the target level before lockdown measures will be eased.On May , the increase in cases rose by , - a decrease of less than  from the previous day.Chief Medical Officer Professor Chris Whitty revealed at the beginning of May that lockdown would remain in place until daily coronavirus cases fell below the , limit.This is one of the most pressing concerns at the moment with hospitals still looking to get their hands on Personal Protective Equipment .NHS staff around the country have been pushing for the government to bring in more PPE, with some even needing to hold their breath and wear bin bags in their attempts to prevent from catching the virus.As for testing, this can be broken down into the swab tests and the antibody versions.Swab tests are currently being carried out either at home or at one of the drive through centres with Matt Hancock revealed that over million have been carried out, including , on Sunday - which the Health Secretary expected to be lower than his , target.This test is currently available to million people, notably those that are key workers, their families and those with symptoms.Yet, antibody tests have been considered a key component to limiting the coronavirus spread, as it would showsomeone has had the killer bug and whether they are immune.There is not currently an approved antibody test, but Mr Hancock did reveal some people - including himself - are receiving regular blood tests to seethey have antibodies for coronavirus in their system.The final test is that the government and medical professionals must be certain that there will not be a risk of a second wave of infection, similar to that in Germany.Professor Van-Tam said on May : We have to be confident that the adjustments we contemplate are not going to risk a second peak of infections and this is really a matter of deep scientic discussion.Its one we are keeping under detailed scientic review as the days and weeks go by.Mr Hancock outlined the new contact tracing app in the press briefing, which is being trialled in Isle of Wight.This noties peoplethey have come into close contact with someone who later tests positive for coronavirus or is showing symptoms.It allows people to quickly self-isolate before spreading it further.The strategy was successful in other countries including South Korea, where less than  people have died from Covid-.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Especially when you are dealing with a government like China’s.As viewers of the series Chernobyl know, non-democratic governments have a history of covering up their errors.In that case, the Soviets did everything they could to stop the world learning about the meltdown at their nuclear reactor.Today the Communist Party of China has done everything it can to hide what happened in Wuhan. Especially the origins of the disease which has shut down the world.Yesterday President Trump broke one of the taboos in all this. Which is needed.The question is: What is the likelihood the coronavirus originated in the exact part of China that has a laboratory looking into just such viruses To date the Chinese authorities have allowed the world to believe in the bat-eating, wet-market theory on the origins of the epidemic.They prefer embarrassment over suspicion.But all along, people have wondered whether something less “accidental” is at play.Now the US President has told reporters he has seen strong evidence that Covid- originated from the laboratory in Wuhan. The President’s remarks change the game.China should be in enough trouble as it is. Evenit was true that the virus is an accident caused by a strange food custom, the Chinese Communist Party has a lot to answer for.Why did it keep the news of the virus to itself for so many weeks  Why did it pretend it is not lethal as we now know it is Or pretend that it was hard to transmit  Why did they refuse to allow in inspectors from the World Health Organisation And why have the WHO now been refused inclusion in China’s own investigation into the origins of Covid- Questions also remain over the WHO’s seeming collusion with China over the crisis.The CCP’s actions would be bad enoughthe virus came from a wet market. But it must know that it is in a whole dferent realm of troublethe virus turns out to have come from its lab.If the CCP knew all along the virus had leaked from there then its cover-up is even more appalling. Because it means they knew exactly what they — and soon the world — were dealing with.But in the absence of trust-worthy information, darker and wilder theories take shape in the shadows. For example, could the virus have come from the Wuhan lab and been released deliberately To those deeply skeptical of the CCP, it’s not hard to believe it might have done that.They are in a trade war with America with a President who was making them lose. Now the CCP has managed to shut down the entire US economy with a virus.The question for the rest of the world will soon be simple: What to do about this There are several steps. The first is to try to determine exactly how this virus came about. To have an international  look into every possible cause. With no area of inquiry ruled out.That  should also investigate how the communist regime lied their way through this virus. We need to learn just how they managed to make a local problem into a global one.Then there is the question of what price they should pay. For accidental or not, there is no way that the CCP should be allowed to get away with this.Goodness knows they have tried. Throughout this crisis there have been a set of PR gestures by the Chinese authorities.The government and government-linked firms such as Huawei have made a big show of donating masks and other equipment.It is dismal. Like watching somebody who has just burned down your house offering you a watering can.Last month, German newspaper Bild infuriated China by suggesting Beijing should pay reparations for the coronavirus pandemic.It printed an “invoice’ for nearly billion eurosleading the Chinese embassy in Berlin to accuse the paper of stirring up prejudice.But once the engine of the other global economies — including ours — roars back into motion, we must make China pay.We must re-think our relationship with them. We should recognise the country is not just a competitor but a liability.We must punish them for the large-scale theft of information from British and American businesses it has engaged in for years.We must do whatever we can to disrupt their “belt-and-road” empire-building, which the CCP has worked its way into, and “bought up” small and poor countries.But it is not only such countries that are at the mercy of China and its President Xi Jinping. We may be in Britain too.Before this Wuhan disaster kicked off, our Government approved Huawei to provide part of our G capability.All of our allies warned against this. Our intelligence-sharing partners in the Five Eyes networkall strongly warned the British Government against allowing a firm that is indistinguishable from the CCP from having such access.Experience shows Chinese firms cannot be trusted to provide such sensitive — and strategic — technology.The Huawei decision was a rare misstep by the Johnson government. Now is the time to correct it.We do not need to provoke China. But nor do we need to pander to it. And we should not be putting our future security in their hands.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.

Living by the sea, in paradise, with a triangular- torsoed Hollywood hunk.But thenyou take a glance at your social media, you’ll notice that absolutely everyone  is living the Hemsworth dream.It’s an endless parade of people’s perfect sourdough baking and of jolly board games with the kids.This morning, my Instagram feed featured a young family doing a fancy dress dinner, a girl on an enormous horse, a woman sprawled on the bonnet of a Mercedes SL, a man with a cute dog, doing exercises, and a shot of some cows taken through a wisteria bush.On Instagram, no one is ever bored, it never rains and everyone’s breasts are perfect. Especially Chris Hemsworth’s.This is having an effect on the nation’s teenagers. They have been told there will be no exams this year and that all their school work was for nothing. They’ve been told they have to stay indoors and that they can’t see their friends.And it’s driving them mad because they do not read newspapers. They do not listen to the BBC news. And they replaced Radio  with Spoty five years ago.This means they never hear any actual news. So they don’t know what’s going on.Instead they look at their phonesand all they can see are pretty girls with swimsuits up their a*** cheeks, and Chris Hemsworth, and parents who have turned the cellar into a nightclub and lots of cute ducklings.And they’re thinking, as they watch the rain trickle down the windows at their house: “Why can’t I have some of that ”But while they are helping save lives, who is there to help them The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.

So I’ve come up with another idea . . .If you are an old person stuck in a tower block, waiting for Covid- to stick its warty little head through the letterbox, post a picture of your surroundings on Instagram. Don’t hold back. Show us the overflowing cat litter and the photograph of your husband, alone in his hospital bed.Show us also pictures of your sister who is in a care home and hasn’t had a visitor for five weeks.And your food cupboard which has nothing in it any more. And your empty bottle of Senokot.In fact, we should all get in on the act. Don’t wait for a joyous moment to photograph and share. Send us instead pictures of stuff you didn’t enjoy.The particularly gruesome bit of wax you’ve just pulled out of your left ear. The turd your dog just did on the mat. Your fat other half slobbing out in front of the TV.Your kids throwing Monopoly pieces at one another after a row over Fenchurch Street station.Instead of sharing your perfect loaf, send pictures of the charred wreck that went wrong, the scarf full of dropped stitches, the wonky self-assembly garden furniture that broke the first time you sat on it.Hit us with the reality of lockdown. Admit that it’s one part happiness and nine parts ditch water.And then maybe teenagers will start to understand that le is bookended by the lucky and the not so lucky. At one end you’ve got the Hemsworths. At the other you’ve got a frightened old man in a tenement block in Bermondsey.Maybe then they will understand they are somewhere in the middle, and stop bloody complaining.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.There is much debate about what increases your chances of dying from Covid-.Well, I don’t know about you but I’ve addressed the issue by sitting on a sofa for six hours a day, eating slabs of Cadbury’s Fruit  Nut chocolate and getting up only to go to the fridge for another bottle of wine.I guess I’m working on the principle that soon I’ll be so fat, there won’t be room in the house for me and the virus as well.But there is one problem.There are now so many empty bottles sitting by the bins at the bottom of the drive I just know my neighbours will assume I’ve been throwing illegal parties, and call the police.A nurse made headlines this week after moaning about the cramped conditions on a London Tube train at .am.She said she was risking her le at work and pointed out that she shouldn’t have to risk it even more while commuting. Fair point, you might think. But hang on.In the olden days – before March – people may well have been on a Tube train at that time because they were coming home from a club.But these days, nobody on a Tube train at quarter to six in the morning is there for fun. They’re ALL going to work.There’s nothing wrong with that. It’s what most of us have been told to do all along. But I do agree that commuting on a cramped Tube is bloody dangerous.So I ask once again for parking restrictions to be lted immediately, as this would allow people to go to work in the blissful self-isolation of their own cars.I WAS told this week, by The Times newspaper no less, that this summer’s must-have accessory is a straw handbag. No it isn’t.As no one’s looking and no one’s going out, this year’s must-have accessory is the pyjama bottom teamed with odd socks.An aerial photograph of Portsmouth taken this week showed that the colour of the sea has turned from the usual mud brown to a shimmering, aquamarine blue.It’s the sort of colour you usually associate with the Caribbean, and it is genuinely amazing.Naturally, green people are saying it happened because the lockdown means less traffic. And they may be right.Or, let me just lob this one in . . .  it happened because the photographer was experimenting with some of the filters on his new phone.My phone’s got so many thatyou gave me long enough, I could take a selfie and make me look like Chris Hemsworth.

If the current measures start to erode, unforeseen dangers could arise.Yet, move too quickly and you risk being blamed for getting it wrong.In some form continuing to isolate without isolation will be necessary, but avoiding great damage to the most disadvantaged children, many of whom are receiving no schooling at all, is vital for our future.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.

Many studies show women are more focused on building community and teams.They are more likely than men to cultivate a erse set of advisers to help them succeed. They are also more likely to follow advice.A study by management consulting firm McKinsey found that women are more people- orientated and spend more time developing and coaching other leaders in their organisation. In other words, they don’t need to reserve all the glory for themselves.There is something  at play too, though. Female leaders are more likely to be blameddecisions are unpopular or ineffective. They are questioned and second-guessed more often than men.But then Covid- entered the equation and presented world leaders with a new challenge — an invisible enemy that is highly contagious, unpredictable and deadly.This pandemic has been an unprecedented test for all concerned.And guess what  A disproportionate number of those who have passed this test — countries such as Germany, New Zealand, Iceland and Finland — have women at the helm.It is not exclusively female-led countries that are doing well, of course. But bearing in mind only seven per cent of all world leaders are women, about  per cent of countries led by women are doing well when it comes to containing Covid-. Global health experts have concluded that one thing that has led to success in tackling coronavirus is — speed.Prof Tom Bollyky, director of global health programme at US think-tank the Council on Foreign Relations, said: “Countries that have not dithered in their response, that have mobilised quickly, have done well.”New Zealand’s PM Jacinda Ardern put it simply: “Go hard and go early.”The number of Covid--related deaths is predicted to be substantially lower in areas where leaders acted sooner, even by a week, because they flattened the curve and prevented new cases.Many women acted first and made the brave decision to shut down le as we knew it, even though that was an unpopular thing to do.But it seems women leaders are listening to World Health Organisation advice and also looking at other countries for guidance.They don’t think they have all the answers but women are able to put their ego to one side and let experts guide them — something which cannot be said of Donald Trump.Incidentally, I have not seen any women leaders making unfounded or dangerous suggestions about possible cures. Can you imagine a woman leader suggesting that people inject Dettol into themselves, as dingbat Trump recently suggested Or can you imagine a woman suggesting to people that they can fight coronavirus and winthey are strong enough This pandemic is not a battle to be fought and won. It is a virus, which can affect literally anyone.No one knows how they will be affected and that bullish “fight it” approach is, in my experience, very male. Conversely, the decision to protect everyone, putting the most at risk first, is more female.It’s interesting that some male leaders seem more interested in covering up the problems. Like Donald Trump, who thinks he is an expert on everything and more fixated on garnering praise for what he has done than fixing and getting right what has not gone so well.I know I am talking in generalisations here but my experience of women is that we want to understand the mistakes and fix them, not cover them up.This pandemic has been full of dficulty and tragedy for everyone.But perhaps one good thing that will come out of it is that the world will acknowledge women deserve an equal  when it comes to leadership.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.

Still, saying goodbye to their companions was devastating for people. Their dogs are their company, love, loyalty and trust – their everything. Driving the dog away, I’d burst into tears.”Six weeks into lockdown the owners are missing their dogs, but Michelle sends them daily pictures and videos to reassure them.“Some of the dogs slept in the bottom of their owners’ sleeping bags so we bought sleeping bags for them to burrow into,” Michelle says. “Others preferred to be on top of duvets. Their kennels are heated and during the day we keep the dogs busy, playing in our three acres of grounds, so there’s no time to pine for their owners.”One dog – Miss L, a young husky – is a case in point. Her owner was distraught when he said goodbye to her – they’d been together since she was eight weeks old – and he was worried about how she’d cope without him. But Michelle discovered she loves cheese, which helped gain her trust, and now Miss L is settled in, making friends with fellow lockdown pups.Some homeless people, however, couldn’t face being parted from their canine companions so remained on the streets. Michelle and her team are there to support them too.“We’re operating the mobile clinic as a food bank for dogs, and the   emergency line,” Michelle says. “We’ve had people in dire financial straits contact us saying they can’t afford to keep their dogs and we’ve organised food parcels so they can stay together.”In the current crisis, working on the streets, Michelle and her volunteers are effectively on the front line. A medical supply company donated gloves and masks and Deborah Meaden sent hand sanitisers to help them.Still, Michelle has been diagnosed with pneumonia, possibly Covid- related, and is recovering at home with her ex-street dog Brock by her side while her team continue DOTS’ work.“I just want to get better and back out there, helping the homeless community,” Michelle says. “There will be some emotional reunions when this is over.”When British schools went into Covid- lockdown, a nationwide network of teachers, including Sandra Obike, stepped up to support NHS heroes.Sandra, who is head of design and technology at Swanlea School in east London, immediately put her skills and workspace to best use – first, sourcing spare unused personal protective equipmentthat could be donated to a nearby major hospital, and then using her school design and technologylab to create  brand new visors for key workers.And she isn’t alone – DT staff at more than  British schools are now collectively involved in the fight against Covid-, manufacturing and donating more than , items of vital PPE including visors, goggles, scrubs, masks and more.“We’ve been doing things since the very first week of lockdown, communicating using sites like Facebook, sharing resources and free design templates,” explains Sandra.“I asked our school headteacherwe could use the materials, space and machinery, and she instantly said yes. I also had a contact at Royal London Hospital, and asked: ‘Can I help  Would it be useful to have some visors ’, and she jumped at the chance.“I knew immediately that we had some unused PPE like goggles, aprons and gloves – so we sent that to the hospital at the start of April, so they were able to start using it as soon as possible.”Sandra, her boyfriend and one of her DT colleagues then set to work at school, creating new visors while safely observing social distancing. They used open-source design templates – provided for free by expert companies like Kitronik and Smoke  Mirrors, who’ve also been key to this Covid- effort – and their ingenuity with the materials they already had.“We were working pretty much like an assembly line, cutting the material, sterilising the parts, assembling it all and then bagging everything for delivery,” says Sandra.“As a teacher, I’m now working from home and interacting with students, but making visors was something I could do while still continuing my day-to-day job. I felt like it was something I could do in the interim, to keep key workers safe, while there was a shortage of PPE.”It’s clear that Sandra is passionate about her DT teaching profession: “We’re educating the engineers of the future,” she says.There’s also no doubt that creating visors is for her a very personal response: “A lot of my family members and friends work within the NHS, as doctors and nurses,” she says. “My mum is retired, but still helping out in a care home. As technologists, we’re problem-solvers – we try to work around the issue, and find a way to do things. For instance, we’ve got two large-scale laser cutters at our school, which meant we could cut quite a bit in a short scale of time, and some places have used D printers – so you work to the best ability that you’ve got.”Teamwork is at the heart of this story, too. This is about colleagues and collaborators, from dedicated DT teachers to suppliers who donate materials free of charge.“Social media has mobilised our effort, on a national scale,” says Sandra. “Where there is surplus, we’ll try to logistically pass it around the network across Britain. Seeing the sheer numbers of what people have done and contributed – that’s when it hits home how amazing this is.“As a teacher, this is a small thing I can do, so that someone who’s potentially putting their le at risk can go into a safer situation at work, and do something big. Everyone is working together for that common goal. It goes to show how much we love the NHS, and how much we want to step out to support them.”Big-hearted Brits are making a dference to other people’s lives every day in this time of crisis – and sometimes it’s the little things that mean the most.Five-year-old Lucy Dawson has been busy delivering handmade paper flowers to her neighbours in Fakenham in Norfolk – leaving them with a note on their doorsteps in the hope of raising a smile and lting people’s spirits during the lockdown.“I learnt to make the paper flowers at my breakfast and after-school club before the lockdown. I wanted to cheer people up,” Lucy says.Her parents, Shelley, , and Marc, , couldn’t be prouder of their daughter, who’s received chocolate and cards from grateful neighbours.Lucy says: “I felt happy and proud that I helped to cheer people up. It gave me happy tears.”Mum Shelley says: “Lucy is creative and loves crafting. She suggested leaving the flowers on doorsteps with a note as a little surprise.”For many neighbours, locked down until the coronavirus has passed, a surprise gt has been the highlight of their day.Lucy and her mum have been careful to observe social distancing and to make the doorstep deliveries during their daily exercise session, using plenty of hand sanitising gel along the way.Shelley says: “She’s a caring little girl. Her grandad Andrew, who’s , lives next door and we can’t see him at the moment. So she leaves handmade gts on his doorstep because she misses him so much.”One note from a neighbour was wrapped around a chocolate bar, and said: “This is just a little thank you from us, it made us smile and we really needed that today.”Dad Marc adds: “We’re extremely proud of what Lucy has done for her neighbours. The look on her face when she received the thank you gts and notes is something me and Shelley will never forget.”A neighbour who works as an AE nurse in King’s Lynn was especially touched when she discovered Lucy’s flowers on her doorstep. She and her family wrote a note of thanks.The Dawsons needed something to feel good about. Shelley was meant to start a new job as a commercial property manager this month but it fell through because of the coronavirus crisis, while Marc has been furloughed from his job as a mechanical supervisor.“We’re busy home schooling and trying to keep Lucy busy,” he says. “She’s an only child and I think she’s getting a bit bored! She misses her friends but she’s working hard at her reading, writing and maths – and she and I love to play football in the garden.”The Dawsons are Norwich City fans, so they were delighted when Lucy won a Community Hero award from the club recently for her flower initiative.And she’s not stopping there. Lucy’s planning to leave handmade cards on neighbours’ doorsteps next.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

You can see the owner trying to pull back on the cord and he pulls the monkey while it hangs on to the kid, and in the start yanking the cord to propel the bike.Once the theory was shared, users flooded the comments section.One remorseful watcher wrote: Wow, I just rewatched it, and, yes, I absolutely saw the cord. Gross! So that sort of explains why the other guy was filming...he was the “training” session. That’s so sad.Another added: The monkey isnt trying to pull the kid with it, its just trying to grab onto something so it doesnt get pulled away.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

An airstrip was bulldozed last year to build a horse riding track, while a boathouse nearby shelters Kim’s Princess  luxury yacht, valued at around  million in .Details of his waterpark were also revealed in a rare sketch done by Italian chef Ermanno Furlanis, who worked in Pyong-Yang for the dictator in .Former dictator Kim Jong-Il was often seen at the aquatic park with girls often spotted leaving the luxury barge in a boat.Chef Furlanis, who worked in North Korea for  days, said he had managed to catch glimpses of the barge despite authorities often turning his head so he could not see certain areas of the barge.He told The Sun four years ago: “I think it was for training of the swimmers. The athletes are held in great honour in the country.“They were young athletes, swimmers or basketers.”But he said he also believed the barge was used for “amusement” as well.The experienced chef, who has worked all over the globe, said: “ also some young girl, I saw two, one time the yacht of Kim Il Sung arrived from there.”He said he could not see the detail of the floating park as it wasnt near the kitchen.Cooking for Kim Jung-Il, the leader of North Korea in the late s, the chef said the structure featured a landing bay for smaller boats as well as three floors of accommodation, a guard tower and a waterslide into a pool.The rare sketch revealed that the aquatic park was mobile, moving through the hundreds of islands near the base.From his vantage point of the kitchens, Furlanis said he could see a guard tower on either side of the pool while there were rooms where people could stay and enjoy themselves.The chef said he enjoyed his time working there, telling The Sun: “They have been very polite and gentle with us.”He also said the people were highly refined, and that they appreciated his meals.But he was unable to see much more of the barge or the dictator himself.The chef recalled being ordered to turn his head to avoid seeing Kims yacht arrive.Furlanis said: “I could not even stare at him, they turned myin the other direction.“Nobody could stare at him. It is sacred… like worship.”While the rest of the country was gripped by famine, Furlanis was commissioned along with several other chefs across the world to make international food for the tyrant.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I described the findings and asked his guidance.Richard said: The whole area before then was a large hill called Windridge Hill for obvious reasons.This was quarried away to almost high tide level, then the houses when built into the hole with cellars, undercrofts etc.However these early cellars, this one looks to be for coal, were built out not only underneath the pavement but out into the road.The load on the roads would have been much lighter than now.I have seen these places turned into wine cellars, a place to grow mushrooms, andbig enough, a grotto type bathing area..."},{"url":null,"title":"brits urged rubbish tips queues demand","story":"HOUSEHOLDERS are being urged not to rush to dumps when they reopen — amid concerns over long queues trying to get rid of lockdown rubbish.Many waste and recycling centres closed because they could not be operated within social distancing rules and to allow councils to focus on household waste collections.But concerns have been raised over an increase in fly-tipping.The Government has since said it wants to see councils reopen tips, with social distancing in place, but residents should only goit is essential.Greater Manchester is one of the areas where tips reopened.Long queues have been reported and across the country residents are being urged by councils to avoid rushing to tips and to “reduce, reuse and recycle” their rubbish wherever possible.The District Councils Network and County Councils Network have issued the warning as they fear a surge in demand.They say nearly all councils have reported higher than usual levels of waste in recent weeks.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.Councils have seen reductions to their teams, as staff self-isolate and collections are disrupted by social distancing.Dan Humphreys, of the District Councils’ Network said: “It won’t be possible for everyone to suddenly get rid of rubbish they have built up over recent weeks all in one go.”Sam Corcoran, communities and environment spokesman for the County Councils Network, said: “We would encourage residents to only take a trip to their recycling centreabsolutely necessary.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He’s just Jamie Oliver with a skipping rope, I assumed, before this wretched lockdown business began.A character we’ve all seen in our local park, with a pair of boxing gloves and a stopwatch, charging financial managers £ a haemorrhoid to do some sit-ups over by the ornamental lake.One of Britain’s ever-growing army of personal trainers who,he wasn’t bouncing around on YouTube every morning, would be clogging up Love Island or Ex On The Beach.That’s what I thought, anyway.Then the coronavirus hit, the local swimming pool shut, the man became a phenomenon and before I could come to my senses, Joe and his infernal timing device were beeping away in my living room, every morning, as I joined in his PE lesson. Inevitably, it didn’t last.First, Joe’s routine did me what I can only describe as “a mischief”.Then, one morning, aged , I caught sight of myself, in a picture frame, doing his “reverse frog shuffle” and thought: “Stuff this for type two diabetes. I’m out.”I’d got no closer to understanding Joe’s astonishing popularity, though, which is truly global.Over , people log in just to stare at his fairly spartan living room, every Monday to Friday.Hundreds of thousands more appear when Joe starts his  minutes of physical jerks.So, in an attempt to unlock the greatest mystery of the outbreak, I kept watching Joe and swtly came to the conclusion success was not linked to his presenting skills.But while they are helping save lives, who is there to help them The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.

Nah, only joking.”The jokes need to go the same way as the viewers’ poems, in honour of Joe, which he was actually reading out loud, until modesty finally prevailed.Much safer ground is the “spot the dference” competition, which borders on insulting, when he’s merely placed his wall atlas upside down or swapped his electric guitar for a ukulele, but does hint at the drive, ambition and ego behind the man.One day he replaced the atlas with a picture of himself, the next with a picture of his “other house” in Los Angeles and suddenly the penny dropped.Joe’s loaded and his head is not just on its way to Hollywood, it’s already there, making movies and doing squat thrusts with Gwyneth and Brad.The weird thing is, in other presenters, soap actors or comedians, I’d roll my eyes at the folly.With Joe Wicks, I don’t. ’Cos I can’t help it, I quite like him.Part of that may be linked to his no-frills background and a level of personal generosity that’s way beyond most of us .But I like to think it’s got more to do with the fact that, at a time when other cynical, doom-mongering TV hosts are desperately trying to read the public mood, reinvent themselves and force their agenda on viewers, Joe Wicks is just doing what he’s always done.

Yellow and black tape will tell people where to stand in lts.One-way systems will be the norm in offices and on train s and at bus stops.Face-to-face meetings will only be able to go aheadabsolutely necessary and be time-limited.Employees will even be told not to share stationary such as pens.The message to employers is to allow their staff to work from homethey’re not needed in the workplace.It means home-working will likely become the default for millions of Brits for the foreseeable future.But employers will have to monitor the well-being of staff working from home by keeping in touch to ask about their welfare, physical health and personal security.The Government has told industry groups the new measures will have to be in place for between six and  months.They were told there will be a “gradual winding down” after the winter, The Sun has learnt.It is understood the y timeframe has been influenced by growing fears among the Government’s medical advisers that the coronavirus is seasonal.An industry source said: “If it survives the winter, these measures will have to be in place longer.”But one positive industry bosses are drawing from the new measures is the impact it will have on dampening traditional flu.The draft papers cover seven dferent settings: offices, hotel and restaurants, shops, factories, outdoor workplaces and those who work in vehicles and other people’s homes.Staggered sht times, less sharing of equipment and continued maximisation of home working are among a number of ideas listed as part of a draft government strategy to help businesses prepare for ato work.Increased hygiene procedures and the installation of protective screens are also included in the plan.Efforts to avoid employees working face-to-face will see them working side by side or facing away from each other, according to the plans leaked to Buzzfeed News.There will be limits on the number of people in stores so Brits will be asked to shop alone to enable shops to be allowed to open and kick-start the economy.The advice for reopening non-essential shops such as clothes stores will be similar to the supermarket rules.Tape setting out two metre distances will have to be put on shop floors, and Brits will need to queue outside.Many shops will go cashless to stop the spread of the virus through money.In cities like London, maintaining the two-metre rule would make it impossible for workplaces to operate anywhere near full capacity.Platforms and bus stops will contain two metre markers to maintain social distancing and one-way systems will be in place.A complex blueprint for schools to open in waves of dferent age groups is being planned.Reopening primary schools is a priority for the Government in order to minimise the threat to early years development and help parentsto work. But Year  pupils will be first backthey are forced to stagger the reopening dates as they are at the most crucial stage of their learning.PM Boris Johnson wants the first schools to reopen on June .Year  and  pupils are expected to be the first wave of secondary schools to open.No firm date has been set for reopening workplaces but The Sun revealed last week that May  has been pencilled in as a target date as long as the Government’s five tests for lting the lockdown measures are met by then.Mr Johnson will publish a “roadmap” strategy on Sunday, detailing exactly how restrictions will be eased in order for Brits to safelyto work.Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said measures such as shields, masks and limiting the amount of contact time with colleagues could be alternative approaches taken by employers.But the draft guidance did not contain details about what personal protective equipment staff should wear when theyto work.The Trades Union Congress refused to support the plans as they stand, saying they “fall far short of giving any guarantees to workers about their health and safety”.Ministers confirmed that the Government has started stockpiling face masks for public use.Scotland boss Nicola Sturgeon revealed she shares Boris Johnsons hopes of being able to start easing the coronavirus lockdown towards the end of May.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There is a big dference between the . million shielded people, known as extremely critically vulnerable, who have been sent a letter advising them to shield for  weeks, vulnerable people with pre-existing health conditions of any age, and healthy over-s.This needs to be made clearer – you cant just have a blanket over-s group. Thats unsustainable. Its not a static group.The minister added: There arent enough supermarket delivery slots to cater for that amount of people.What we are going to see is more self-selection and personal responsibility.People will self-select whether they are vulnerable or not. The over-s are a very sensible group – by and large, they knowthey should be staying indoors or not.Meanwhile Tory Sir Graham Brady said on Monday night: We have today the most healthiest, active elderly generation of all time and it would be tragicGovernment threatened this by trying to extend a so-called lockdown for those judged to be most at risk based on age.Why dont we just give them the best information and advice and let them limit their risk themselves In the original Government guidance, anyone over , regardless of their state of health, was advised to be particularly stringent in following social distancing measures.But on May , that was withdrawn and replaced with new advice which listed all over-s as clinically vulnerable.Amid confusion over the guidelines, Health Secretary Matt Hancock tweeted: The clinically vulnerable, who are advised to stay in lockdown for  weeks, emphatically DO NOT include all over-s.The Department of Health and Social Care confirmed over s are not included in the most at risk group , who have been told to isolate for  weeks.On Monday, the Prime Ministers official spokesman said: Over-s are classed as being in the clinically vulnerable group – they are not necessarily in the clinically extremely vulnerable group, which are those people who are shielding.Therefore the advice to them is to take particular care to minimise contact with others outside their household.Asked whether the over-s would have dferent rules from other sections of the population, the spokesman added: We know that, as you get older, there is a higher risk of coronavirus having a more serious impact. Complications and deaths are more common in the elderly, even those without pre-existing conditions.But as we look forward it is perfectly reasonable that we will look at how guidance will apply for dferent age bands, and we will continue to be guided by the science.The UK coronavirus death toll hit , on Monday as another  patients died in the lowest rise in more than a month.The last time the UK recorded such a low  hour fatality rate was almost five weeks ago on March  when  deaths were reported.However there is often a drop in Mondays figures due to a lag in reporting over the weekend with Tuesdays number likely to be higher.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But we cannot wait for the data to catch up while people are dying.Trevor Phillips, ex-chairman of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, said: “They say viruses don’t discriminate.“But the faces of those who have died saving lives tell a very dferent story.“We won’t know the truth about coronavirus until we treat this question with the same seriousness we treat the search for a vaccine.”Heroic medics who have died on the front line are also disproportionately from an ethnic minority.Britains coronavirus death toll, rose to , yesterday - second only to Italys among European nations.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Teams around the world are striving to make a coronavirus vaccine - including one at Oxford University which has started trials - in a bid to unlock the crisis. Mr Hancock suggested that the government would not need to make the vaccine compulsory as a high level of demand from the public is expected. When asked about making a vaccine compulsory for children, Mr Hancock said: I think that the extent of the publicaposs reaction to following the lockdown shows that we will be able to achieve very high levels of vaccination without taking that step. Addressing potential opposition from anti-vaxxers, Mr Hancock added: I think there has been no greater demonstration in modern history that vaccines save lives than the need for a vaccine to save lives and to get the world going again following the outbreak of Covid-. And we will only license a vaccine when it is both effective and safe and...and when the independent regulators license a vaccine in this country they will do so knowing that it is safe and everybody should follow that advice.When asked, Mr Hancock said he did not rule out compulsory vaccinations - but added that ministers are anticipating enormous demand for vaccination anyway. Professor Jonathan Van-Tam said it is more likely than not that the first vaccines will be licensed for use by adults. Mr Van-Tam pointed out that data shows children are less vulnerable to the virus, saying this will have to be borne in mind. US President Donald Trump previously said he expects a vaccine by the end of the year.  However, experts have repeatedly warned it will take up to  months before one is available.Vaccine trials have been set up around the world, including one in Oxford which involves more than  people. Today, Business secretary Alok Sharma said: Last week, thanks to the UK Governmentaposs financial support of £ million, the Oxford vaccine entered clinical trials in humans. I can update the Housethat, as of today,  people have taken part in that trial. Mr Hancock also announced at todayaposs briefing that the NHSX apostrack and traceapos app will start to be tested on the Isle of Wight from tomorrow. It comes after the UK announced  new coronavirus deaths in care homes, hospitals and the wider community today, down from  yesterday.It is the lowest daily death figure since the end of March. The Government missed its , tests target for the second day in a row yesterday, with , tests.  On Saturday, , tests were handed out despite Health Secretary Matt Hancockaposs aim for , a day. Speaking at todayaposs press conference, Mr Hancock said from tomorrow Isle of Wight NHS staff will be able to download the app. From Thursday, each of the islandaposs , households will receive a letter about the trial and be asked to install the app. In response to missing the target, Downing Street said it had capacity to carry out over , tests a day.

You can unsubscribe at any time.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailBritain is preparing to ease some of the lockdown that has kept us all indoors for six weeks. And to do that, thereaposs one big thing youaposll need to do - download a new NHS app. The app will be the cornerstone of a test, track and trace programme of contact tracing, following anyone who is carrying Covid-. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said it will let the NHS “hunt down and isolate the virus so it is unable to reproduce”. And that in turn “allows us to take a more targeted approach to lockdown” - keeping only the restrictions we really need, while lting others.Mr Hancock said the programme - to go live in mid-May - is a “huge national undertaking of unprecedented complexity”. And there are still doubts about whether itaposll work. So what does it all mean for you  Hereaposs an explanation. What is apostest, track and traceapos   Itaposs the government plan that will guide the second phase of Britainaposs coronavirus outbreak. Once lockdown starts to ease, itaposs vital to keep a close eye on how quickly Covid- is spreading to make sure there wonapost be another peak. That means testing everyone who might have Covid-, tracking all their movements, and tracing everyone they might have been close to in. The programme will be done using an NHS appplus , human contact tracers, , in call centres and , in the field. Why is contact tracing so important   The strategy must be in place before Boris Johnsonaposs plan to ease the UK lockdown can happen. To stop a second terrying peak of the virus, health officials must know exactly where it is in the community and how fast it is spreading. With proper contact tracing, anyone who is infectious can quickly be isolated from their friends, family and co-workers. That will mean the aposRapos number - the number of people infected by each Covid- carrier - will stay low. If R is below , the virus spreads slowly in the community. If it is above , it spreads exponentially and can end up doubling every few days. If apostrack and traceapos works, it means society can slowly open up again, with people ing to work and having limited contact with friends in a new normal, while not being overwhelmed by disease.How will the app work  Using Bluetooth Low Energy signals - designed not to drain your battery too fast - the app will log each time it comes into close range of other devices also running the app. Itaposll register every time your phone comes within  metres of another personaposs phone for more than  minutes. It will then keep an anonymous record of all these logs securely on a useraposs phone. If someone develops symptoms of Covid-, they can use the app to inform the NHS.  That will then trigger an anonymous alert to any other app users the infected person came into contact with by analysing the collected logs. The app will advise what action to take, including telling people to self-isolatenecessary. People can use the app to order a home testing kit to be delivered to where they live. If the person you came into contact with tests negative, youaposll get another alert saying it was a  alarm. When will the app be ready to download  The app and a team of human contact tracers enter trials tomorrow on the Isle of Wight. NHS workers will be asked to download the app first, and letters will go to all , of the islandaposs residents on Thursday asking them to join in. Officials hope the system - including the app - will be ready for use nationwide from mid to late May. That is once it has passed initial teething problems and , contact tracers are in place. This means we know lockdown wonapost be lted until at least mid-May, despite the PM outlining his aposroadmapapos this coming Sunday.  Will it work  We donapost know. The crucial thing willbethe government makes the right calls when easing lockdown. That includes having enough human contact tracers as backup, and some experts have warned , wonapost nearly be enough. But we also need lots of people to download the app - likely % to % of the entire population - for the app to work. Some researchers say up to %. Yet in Singapore, just % or so used an app launched in March. If too few people download it, the virus will slip out of control and infect people undetected because contacts will go unseen. Mr Hancock admitted the app would not be enough on its own - people need to take an active part. He said: “It isn’t just about the technology and people in call centres - it’s also about citizens acting in the right way. “Acting in the right way to download the app, because that protects you, it protects your family and protects the NHS - but also acting in the right way to do contact tracing yourself.” Will it mean everything opens up again  No. First of call, the Deputy Chief Medical Officer has said we have to get cases lower before we can take any action. That includes on the Isle of Wight, where restrictions will remain despite the trial. And when we do, there will still be social distancing restrictions - just fewer of them. Mr Hancock said: Test, track and trace will help us to get the R down, and to get the number of new cases down and to keep it down, but not on its own.

Deputy Chief Medical Officer Jonathan Van-Tam said itaposs still unclear whether antibodies given by the disease will protect a patient from catching it again. He said the overwhelming majority of people who had recovered from Covid- were found to have antibodies in their bloodstream. But he said: The next question is, do those antibodies protect you from further infections. And we just havenapost had this disease around ... for long enough to know the answers to that with any surety. He added that antibodies produced in response to other human coronaviruses donapost persist necessarily for years and years and years although it was unknown what would happen in the case of Covid-. We will simply have to follow people who have recovered and test them repeatedly until we have an understanding of how antibodies last and how long they protect for. He said multiple studies were underway in the UK, which will follow people who have recovered from the disease for at least a couple of years. Itaposs just one of those where we canapost make the science go any faster than how quickly our bodies go in terms of maintaining the antibodies. Like everybody  in the world we just have to be patient and cautious until we get those answers. Mr Hancock said the government was in discussions with Swiss pharmaceutical firm Roche over antibody testing.He revealed that having recovered from coronavirus, he is now taking part in a trial to analyse patientsapos antibodies.But he said he would not yet feel happy being in a crowded room.

The group of a dozen experts were gathered by Sir David King, a former government chief scientic adviser. He assembled the rival boffins to look at how the UK is handling coronavirus over fears that ministeraposs claim to be following the scientic advice, but have failed to share recent the information behind those decisions with the public. Sir Davidaposs group, which held its meeting online, said it has been organised “in response to concerns over the lack of transparency” from SAGE after it emerged that Boris Johnsonaposs top aide Dominic Cummings and another Tory aide had attended a meeting in March. It came as Downing Street published the names of the more than  scientists who sit on SAGE. Scroll down to see how the rival scientists compare to the government position. The list of names showed that around half of the experts come from universities and another half is made up of Government chief scientic advisers, public health officials or NHS senior staff. One Google executive, Demis Hassabis, attended in a personal capacity as a data scientist, the company confirmed after people raised questions over the inclusion of a figure from a private company. Mr Cummings is not listed as a member, despite reports he attended meetings and contributed to discussions. Two members of the group did not give permission for their names to be published. The minutes of the groupaposs meetings have not been released, and neither has the most recent advice which No  claims underpins their decisions. The new Independent SAGE group warned that lting lockdown at dferent times across the country could lead to anger and resentment. Officials are considering how coronavirus restrictions could be lted, and later this week Boris Johnson is expected to set out a road map out of the lockdown. They also warned that Britainaposs strategy could be overly reliant on finding a vaccine. Professor Gabriel Scally, who is President of Epidemiology  Public Health Section of the Royal Society of Medicine, told the committee that we needed to prepare for a vaccine that could be several years away. Professor Scally, who advises the Irish government, added: We can hope for the best, but we must plan for the worst-case scenario  and find ways to keep going on that basis and ways to keep our economy and society operational. Professor Susan Michie warned that lting certain restrictions for dferent sections of the economy, areas or age groups risked undermining the collective solidarity that has been so important for trust, for adherence, for helping each other. She added thatspecic groups such as the over-s are asked to stay in lockdown while others are not, the message would have to be much more nuanced. Professor Michie also said the Government must ensure those who are forced to self-isolate, as a result of having contact with someone infected, have financial security.

The tough measures will be imposed in a bid to stop a deadly second wave. Boris Johnson is expected to relax some rules and firms could reduce distancing at workthey get PPE. But TUC boss Frances O’Grady branded the move an “open goal” for rogue bosses to cut corners. While there may light at the end of the tunnel for cooped up Brits, experts warn strict measures will be brought in to avoid a ­deadly second wave of coronavirus. While some restrictions look likely to be eased in the coming weeks, regions could face local lockdownsthere are signs of another outbreak there. As the death rate rose by  to , – the smallest rise since last month – leaked guidance showed the Government is considering relaxing the ­two-metre distance rule for some businesses as they slowly start to get the economy moving. The documents, covering seven key sectors of the economy, recommend companies adopt extra measures such as physical screenskeeping a gap between workers is impossible. But union chiefs warned they could not back the proposals as they fear rogue bosses would not implement the rules properly – putting staff and the wider community at risk. Boris Johnson, seen today arriving at No with a coffee in hand, is expected to reveal the first ­relaxation of some lockdown rules on Sunday, days after the ­three-week review is completed on Thursday. The Government hopes the “test, track and trace” approach – eventually used alongside the new NHS app being trialled on the Isle of Wight – will allow it to take a localised approach.  Soa city such as Manchester, for example, became a virus hotspot after the ­lockdown had been eased, testing could begin on a large scale and contact-tracers deployed. A source said: “If you saw a worrying increases of ­transmission in regions, then you would want to move quickly to try to stop those.” Schools and non-essential shops could be closed, to help drive back down the crucial R transmission rate between people, while the rest of the country continued as normal. Wearing face masks is likely to be the new normal for shoppers still fearing a second wave of the virus. As part of the national easing of restrictions, the PM is expected to say primary schools could reopen for some pupils – most likely Year Six – as early as June .  But other tough ­restrictions will remain until there is a vaccine, with cinemas, pubs and ­theatres likely to stay closed for months. And those who can work from home are expected to be asked to continue. Department of Business officials are drawing up guidance to get people back to work in the coming weeks. Recommendations could include staggering sht times to ease the rush hour, avoiding hot-desking or sharing pens, closing lts and canteens. Bosses are currently advised to keep workers two metres apart wherever possible.  But the guidance states: “It will not always be possible to keep a distance of m. In these circumstances both employers and employees must do everything they can to reduce risk.” Cabinet minister Ben Wallace signalled some firms will be allowed to adopt other measures, even halving the distance to one metreworkers are given screens and protective kit. He said: “You could wear PPE, that could be a possibility, or indeed you could find other ways of doing it, shielding for example.” But unions slammed the guidance – which only asks firms to “consider” the moves – insisting bosses should be forced to adopt them.  TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady said: “Throughout this crisis the TUC has sought to engage constructively with ministers. But we cannot support the Government’s back-to-work plans as they stand. They are an open goal for rogue employers, who will cut corners and put their workers, and the wider community, at risk. “We want new binding rules for employers to publish their risk ­assessment. We want clear ­guidance to set out the minimum standards that employers must meet in order to protect public safety. And we want ministers to outline a new tough approach to enforcement.  Unless the Government ­signicantly strengthens its plans, safe working will not be ­guaranteed. The current proposals fail to provide clear direction to those employers who want to act responsibly.” Labour leader Keir Starmer has called on Mr Johnson to form a “national consensus” on the next phase of the coronavirus response as ministers work on the plans to ease the lockdown. He backed the ­extension of ­measures ahead of talks with the PM this week. Mr Johnson yesterday co-hosted a virtual conference of world leaders aiming to raise more than £.billion to develop a vaccine. But China and the US failed to turn up. No played down their absence insisting the summit was “only the start” of the pledging process.

He inspected further and made an opening big enough to get his head through to take another look. To his shock, Jake discovered there was a huge area underneath his home in Plymouth, Devon, so he opened it up to investigate.Inside the tunnel he discovered items including paint cans and an old newspaper that proved the tunnel had been blocked up for more than  years, the Plymouth Herald reports.And he found evidence on bottles that the tunnel itself was from the early s. Jake said: “While having a lazy coffee standing outside the basement front door of the property I noticed a patch in the wall of a texture dferent to the rest. “I also noted that the patch was the same distance from the coal cellar already exposed, currently used for storage. “Curiosity and a little boredom got the better of me, after which I grabbed a drill and began working pilot viewing holes into the wall.  “Once I had made two holes, one for viewing, one for a torch, I peered through into the dark dusty expanse and realised that it was another cavern of sorts. After realising what was beneath his house, Jake opened the wall up so that he could climb down and walk inside. He added: I proceeded to hammer out a larger opening through which I could get a better idea of the space, andI should carry on making mess. “Upon creating a large enough hole to fit through, I shone a torch into the dark, revealing the larger than expected space before me. “The cavern had a lot of builders waste from another era, so I climbed inside to explore and take a closer look.  He soon realised the area was bigger than he had expected. Jake added: I measured the rough area of the space and observed its structural integrity. “I was pleased to note that the stone arched ceiling was in great condition and the expanse measured a healthy m deep, m high, and m wide. In the area, Jake found piles of building waste and other rubbish, so started digging through it all for clues. “Upon inspection it confirmed that the space had been covered up for many years.  “It had been used as an easy space, to hide the waste from renovating the property’s roof, guttering, doors, and windows many years ago before being covered up. “As I moved deeper into the cavern I began to search for evidence that would tie it to a grouping of years so as I could more accurately determine how long it had been covered up. “In the dark I collected bottles, paint cans, and my golden find was the remains of a newspaper, though was more comparable to mushy silt. After an arduous process of preparing the newspaper in a bath filled with water, Jake was finally able to open a few pages in search of a date. He added: “I laid the items I had collected out in the clear light to identy their age. “The paint cans were extremely degraded but had enough detail to show that the labelling was of a s s era style. “The bottles, after a quick wipe, were etched with detailing common also of the early s. “The biggest reveal was the newspaper, it almost disintegrated upon human touch, so a CSI style method was used to carefully peel back the congealed layers. “I proceeded to run a warm bath and soaked the congealed brown mess in the solution for a period of time, after which tweezers and vibration were used to slowly work shards of the paper free while submerged. “After as many fragments of the paper had been recovered as possible, I photographed while still submerged and removed what was salvageable for drying. “I scanned through the jumbled pieces looking for dates or usable information to determine the era. “There were little hints the style of writing, no colour, picture style, currency and then finally a date! “What was barely readable was the year , this along with the other pieces of evidence fitted, meaning the cellar had been blocked up for over  years. Armed with evidence, Jake contacted a historian friend, Richard Fisher, to ask for his input. Jake added: That evening I excitedly reached out to a local historian, Mr. Richard Fisher. I described the findings and asked his guidance.” Richard said: “The whole area before then was a large hill called aposWindridge Hillapos for obvious reasons. “This was quarried away to almost high tide level, then the houses when built into the hole with cellars, undercrofts etc. "},{"url":null,"title":"britain connects what happened zoom","story":"NewsBritain Connects: What happened when Boris Johnson fan Zoomed Labour supporterWhile Lynda Felton-Scott and Jovan Nepaul might not have much in common on paper, both their lives have been upended by the coronavirus crisis.

Lynda, , is a retired nurse from Batley in Yorkshire, while Jovan is a -year-old politics student from West Bromwich. Yet both of their lives have been upended by the coronavirus. While Lynda’s health problems mean she is shielding at home and receiving food parcels, Jovan has been forced to come home from university and is volunteering in the community. This week, we asked Lynda and Jovan to be the first participants in a ground-breaking new project, Britain Connects – launched today by the Daily Mirror and . A year after we pioneered Britain Talks, which was aimed at getting the UK chatting across the Brexit ide, this is a new virtual version. This time we want to build on the new connections forming across Britain as we face the Covid- pandemic together. “Jovan is a lovely young man,” Lynda says, after the pair connect via Zoom, chatting for almost two hours. “It felt like we really did know each other straight away. I’d love to go out for a cup of tea with him when the lockdown is over. On paper, we seem dferent - we voted dferently in the election - but we share a lot of the same values.” Jovan agrees. “I would have never spoken to someone like Lynda in my normal le,” he says. “We just wouldn’t have met and politically we seem very dferent, but we had a lot in common..”  The Daily Mirror asked the pair to meet up for a virtual chat, as our country reaches a moment of peak isolation. Lynda, new to modern tech ‘whatnot’, chats from the living room of her flat in Batley Carr. Jovan, a digital native, is in his childhood bedroom in the Midlands with his guitar. Our readers up and down the country are overcoming isolation by connecting with people they wouldnapost usually meet for an online chat. Do you want to join them YES IaposM IN Lynda thinks the Prime Minister is doing a reasonable job, “the best of a bad lot” who will “get Brexit done”. Jovan is a Labour supporter who “did everything in my power to stop Boris being elected” and voted Remain. Born  years apart, Lynda’s biggest fear is of catching Covid-, while Jovan worries far more about what comes next for his already-struggling generation.But, as they chat, they discover they both come from NHS families. Jovan’s grandmother came to Britain from Ghana in the s to work in the health service as a midwe. His mum is now a matron at Birmingham City Hospital. “She’s at the hospital right now,” Jovan says, “on the frontline. We’re very proud of her.” Lynda’s dad was a pharmacist from Wallasey, as well as a navigator in the RAF during the war. And it even turns out Lynda, a former theatre and paediatric nurse, was a matron herself too. “I was nursing for  years,” she says. “Twice my letime,” Jovan laughs. “I retired two years ago otherwise I would have been on the frontline myself,” Lynda says. “You know what it’s like, mum’s in there all hours,” Jovan says. “On her day off yesterday she was called out and was there for the whole day.” While Lynda voted Conservative and Jovan is an active member of the Labour Party, both are upset by the lack of PPE for frontline workers. Lynda previously ran a care home and is especially worried for carers. Jovan worries for his mum and her colleagues.  “My mum said one of her staff members had to go in with a motorbike crash helmet because they didn’t have enough PPE,” Jovan says. Lynda nods. “I was screaming at the TV news. I could see what was going to happen and I couldn’t do anything about it.” Jovan says: “I hope this is a  moment where people say there’s been a particular way of doing things that hasn’t really worked… so we need to fund things, we need to treat people with more dignity and respect.” Lynda nods: “Exactly.” For Britain Connects, the Mirror and Express are also partnering with the Behavioural Insights Team. “The coronavirus crisis has created a shared experience without precedent for all of us,” Antonio da Silva says. “This unique situation also means that while we adjust to the pandemic there is an opportunity to connect and bring people closer together as never before. “We will draw on evidence from behavioural science to help make that contact as fruitful as possible and in the process learn more about bridging ides between people.” It turns out Jovan and Lynda share many interests. Born in Liverpool, Lynda talks about nights spent as a student nurse at the famous Cavern Club, watching the Beatles. Jovan plays bass in the Themselves Houseband, as part of a collective that organises arts events in London. “I went to school with Paul McCartney and John Lennon, that’s my only claim to fame…” Lynda says. “I think that’s cooler than anything I could ever say!” Jovan laughs. Jovan is a keen cyclist and is amazed when Lynda produces her exercise bike. “It keeps my legs exercising while I watch the telly,” she says. “I do  pedals a few times a day. That’s more cycling than you today Jovan…” While Lynda is living off hot cross buns and prosecco brought round by a neighbour’s son, Jovan is desperately missing trips to the pub. They say they are both “living like students”, staying up late in front of the TV. They both wish they could get to the hairdresser, and Lynda teases Jovan for hiding his lockdown locks under a back-to-front baseball cap.

Heaposs swapped his role as a member of the Nightaposs Watch for a role as a delivery driver with Asda, working at the Belfast Shore Road store.Michael, who played Bowen Marsh, Lord Steward of the Nightaposs Watch, in the hit fantasy series, says he absolutely loves his new position as a key worker and is proud to be able to play his part in feeding the nation.The -year-old actor said: Every single person has a role to play in these times. People now should really appreciate the hard work that everybody does – I think people who work in supermarkets have often been taken for granted.Michael, who has also starred in The Tudors and in Soft Border Patrol had several acting jobs lined up before the coronavirus outbreak, which were put on hold.It was then a friend told him Asda were looking for people to help during the crisis, so he got in touch.  He continued: I came down, got a job and I absolutely love it. The job means I can continue to have that interaction with people like I get in a theatre. Itaposs kept me mentally in a good place and it continues to do so. I’ve been having a brilliant time meeting people I’ve never met before. I do about  to  calls a day when I’m working, so Iaposve been getting to know lots of dferent people. Some of them have come to be regular customers too – itaposs nice to have a rapport with them.

Bea Levache from Kent, redecorated her homeaposs utility room, the stairs, the office as well as designing a feature wall at a cost of just £. Proud mum Susie Levache, , said the -year-old developed her DIY skills, including using a power drill and a handsaw, and was ‘a natural’ who did a ‘blinding job’. The portrait photographer shared before and after photos on Facebook - to which she received thousands of responses. Susie and Bea’s brother Ted, , also lent a hand, and the family aimed to reuse as much as possible, so only needed to buy a few extra items from eBay for the projects. Writing about the home office transformation, she said: I usually tackle all the DIY projects alone but my -year-old daughter took an interest and actually I figured I had a lot of time on my hands to recty anything she might damage. Turns out after telling her to just go for it - she’s a natural and did a blinding job-with direction she did this herself. She was VERY handy with a handsaw We just used some thin MDF strips, paint and a roll of wallpaper to transform my office. Susie added: I supervised and told her how to use the spirit level and how to measure and cut the MDF strips we had.  She was really nervous to begin with as she was worried that she would mess up. The room was gloomy and hadn’t really been used properly for ages anyway so she had nothing to lose - then there was no stopping her! This gave her the confidence to just go for it and after the first two  she then did the rest alone. Susie watched as Bea successfully marked, leveled, glued, pinned and added a dado rail before filing the room ready for painting. The office ling took just a few hours to do and the following day to paint.  Susie said she had been steadily renovating the family’s s semi-detached house for  months, and decided to use the time at home to give the plans a boost. She homeschools Bea and Ted in the mornings, but after week two of lockdown, the children seemed ‘bored’, so she asked them to help with DIY projects in the afternoon. Susie said they have been as resourceful as possible during lockdown by using things, such as paint, that they already had in the shed and loft. The only purchase they’ve made during pandemic has been kitchen handles. After seeing how the new home office looked, Susie encouraged Bea to decorate the stairs with black ling using the assistance of her brother Ted - totally unsupervised.  She said: Then we used up some old tester pots I had to stencil and hand paint an accent wall in a funky animal print design. She had the patience of a saint for hand painting that job! Then the family moved onto the kitchen utility room makeover which had the floor completed before lockdown but still required a lot of work. Susie said: ‘The room was full of orange pine. I taught Bea how to use the drill and change the drill bits and how to use the little work bench. She filled the existing drawer holes, drilled new holes and put in dferent drawer pulls. They look fantastic! The whole room was then transformed with chalk paintso all of it including the handles came to about £ - we loved the end result.  Bea spent three days redecorating the room. Susie wrote about her achievement on Facebook in a post that was liked nearly , times. She shared: We had a grim aposdumping groundapos utility room to part renovate - I showed her how to use a power drill at the weekend . My daughter customised the fronts of the drawersthen we used leftover paint to repaint the cupboards. We also made little initial blackboard effect plaques from leftover mdf, paint and glue - then aged them for the laundry baskets.  As before,my  year old and I can do this - ANYONE can do this. The duo also used their DIY expertise to transform an old broken rattan table for the family’s dreamy outdoor terrace. Bea used leftover tiles to create a stunning mosaic on the table before placing the original glass on the top to finish. The tiles for the garden table were left over from previous tiling where the family had purchased the amount needed including spares for breakages and luckily, there was none.  Susie said: The table now has pride of place on our terrace. During lockdown, we have taken all the blankets out, sat by the fire and drank hot chocolate in the cosy haven. ‘It’s definitely a makeover we are proud of. It was probably around £somebody wanted to have a go at upcycling. It’s comforting that all the blood, sweat and tears that went into the planning, faffing and upkeep of the terrace garden - that it is enjoyed by everyone. Susie posted her DIY successes online and received hundreds of questions from parents wanting to do the same with their kids so she created an Instagram account dedicated to sharing her tips and decorating secrets.  She added: We have been staggered by the reaction. Some of the posts have had thousands of likes. We’ve also had some great messages from carpenters and builders lending advice which has been terric. Susie added that the family DIY projects havenapost just resulted in an incredible home transformation - it has also helped Bea’s confidence. She said: I was always a creative child and my daughter thought she didn’t have any skills before lockdown, I hope this will give her confidence that it’s all there. She just needed to believe she could do it!  Initially she was quite timid about using the power tools and things, but now she’s so proud of what she’s achieved. Pre-lockdown I would never have thought to include Bea in my work - this period has really shown me that children are far more capable than we may think. The family’s six-week complete ‘spring fling’ came after Susie decided to decorate the house. She revealed in a recent social media post: aposNo more white box. My husband has zero interest in DIY and interiors which leaves me in charge!

Italy is among the worldaposs hardest-hit countries after registering almost , deaths since the start of the coronavirus outbreak. But the country has now partially relaxed some restrictions as the county enters aposphase twoapos of its exit from lockdown. More than four million people have now ed to work as the nation attempts to get its economy back on track. Pictures showed trains and other commuter services packed as employees reopened businesses and citizens ed home. The government has said parks can reopen, giving children the chance to run around, while relatives can once again meet up. For the latest updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog. However, friends have been told to keep apart and most shops must stay shut until May . I woke up at . a.m. I was so excited, said Maria Antonietta Galluzzo, a grandmother taking her three-year-old grandson for a walk in Romeaposs Villa Borghese park, the first time they had seen each other in eight weeks.  Gianluca Martucci was one of the few able toto work, pulling up the shutters on a small warehouse in the backstreets of Rome for the first time since March , when the nationwide lockdown came into force. It is good to be back, but the world has totally changed, he said. Although he was happy to be back in business, he was anxious that infections might take hold again as more people mixed.  The government has been very wise so far, but I worry that we might be starting up a little too soon, he said. I donapost knowthe country could survive a second wave.Officials cautioned against moving too swtly as new coronavirus cases passed . million globally and deaths neared a quarter of a million.Italy has the worldaposs second highest toll after the United States. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said his country was still in the full throes of the pandemic, stressing the so-called phase  of the lockdown must not be seen as a signal that weaposre all free.  The easing of the lockdown has been blighted by a lack of clarity over exactly what activities were allowed from Monday, and even whose houses people will be able to visit. The confusion was only worsened by guidelines issued which quickly became the butt of widespread criticism and mockery on social media. These spelled out that visits to even distant relatives will be allowed, including the children of cousins, or the cousins of spouses, as well as visits to anyone with whom one has a stable bond of affection.  However they did not say whether friendship counted as a stable bond of affection. Conte said that phase two would include more testing to see who has the virus, with  million kits sent to the regions in the next two months.

The man – who was walking whilst holding shopping bags – turned around to see the horric sight of a two tonne vehicle careering towards him upside down. The terried pedestrian dropped his shopping bags and ran as fast as he could – an action that may well have saved his le. The incident is believed to have happened in Dagenham, East London on Saturday May . CCTV footage showed the man walking along the pavement with his shopping as the Audi appears to try and pass a truck on a narrow residential street. The driver seemingly misjudges the gap and as they accelerate. The Audi caught the side of wide vehicle sending the car spiralling in the air and onto the pavement to exactly where a pedestrian was walking with shopping bags.Fortunately the man had enough time to hear the initial collision, turn around to see the the vehicle heading straight towards him and just enough time to run. The car came to a stop where the man would have been walking. Many users on social-media pointed out that had the man been wearing headphones he may not have heard the fracas and may well have been killed.

Andrea said: “I had my latest injection two days ago.  “I feel great to have even more but some doctors think itaposs enough, though I still want them bigger. “My doctor said he will do more injections for me but said I have to wait for at least two months. “I like my new lips a lot, it was hard to eat after the injection and two to three days after the procedure gets more dficult.  “There are no restrictions to what I can eat. “I think my lips are lovely, I love them. “I am not surethey are the biggest lips in the world but they are one of the biggest, I think.”  She began her transformation on  and said she now feels happier and more content with having bigger lips. Speaking last September when she had completed  lip injections she said: I like my lips now more than before.

The Queen was believed to have a personal furtune of £million in  with the majority of the British monarchyaposs wealth coming from inherited land and investments. This is in addition to the sovereign grant to pay for the royal familyaposs expenses, which comes from taxpayers. But that wealth pales in comparision to the coffers of the House of Saud, the ruling family in Saudi Arabia. The monarchy is said to worth more than £TRILLION - more than  times the wealth of the British royal family. And with that amount of cash, the royal family expect only the best. Private jets, luxury superyachts, helicopters, palaces, luxury chateaus, gold furniture in their lavish homes - and even a gold-plated tissue dispenser. Among one of the biggest spenders in the royal family is Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman. On one wall in one of his Saudi Arabian royal palaces hangs a Leonardo Da Vinci painting worth £million. The crown prince, who is heir to the throne, is also said to have bought a £million superyacht, £million chateau in France, two homes in London and an entire compound on the southern coast of Spain. As deputy prime minister - his father King Salman is Prime Minister - the crown prince is said to be the power behind the throne. Along with his massive spending, he has also made some important cultural changes to Saudi Arabia, including removing the ban on women being able to drive. But with a personal fortune of almost £.billion he can certainly afford to splash the cash. Unlike the British royal family, the Saudi monarchy hasnapost gained its wealth from land - instead their vast fortune comes from the huge oil reserves in the Middle Eastern country. The crown prince also seems to have turned his attention to acquiring a football club and is believed to be heading a consortium who wants to buy Newcastle United. However, he refuses to be drawn on how large his vast wealth actually is.  In an interview with  CBS News, the Crown Prince insisted that his finances were a private matter.He added: I’m a rich person and not a poor person. I’m not Gandhi or Mandela. I’m a member of the ruling family that existed for hundreds of years before the founding of Saudi Arabia. His father the king, who came to throne in , is believed to have a personal fortune of £.billion. One of the wealthiest members of the Saudi royal family is Prince Alwaleed, who was said to have a fortune of £billion and was the th richest man in the world. But then he was arrested under the orders of the crown prince. He was one of the three members of the royal family to be arrested in November  as part of an anti-corruption drive by the government. He was freed a few months later and is believed to have made a financial settlement and fallen out of the Forbes rich lists. However, the prince still owns a huge superyacht which was used in the James Bond film, Never Say Never Again. He also has but a mere two palaces with a third currently being built. The Kingdom Palace is the residence the prince calls his main home. Worth £million the sand-coloured palace boasts  rooms, five kitchens, including one solely for desserts, a lagoon-shaped pool and a -seat cinema. In addition , tonnes of Italian marble were used in the palaceaposs construction and the floors are covered in silk oriental carpets. And thereaposs no chance of the prince ever getting bored when heaposs at home as the palace has  TVs. As well as his lavish palaces, Prince Alwaleed also owns the Kingdon Resort, which has three lakes and huge gardens. His third palace, which will be called Kingdom Oasis, will have its own private zoo. However, despite their lavish spending the Saudi royal family insist they plough billions into charitable projects every year. Prince Alwaleed bin Talal has set up his own charitable organisation, Alwaleed Philanthropies, which he has given billions to. He said: Philanthropy is a personal responsibility, which I embarked upon more than three decades ago and is an intrinsic part of my Islamic faith. And when King Salman came to throne one of his first acts was to donate £billion to ordinary Saudi people.

We had very limited time to look at things. The document itself didn’t give much hope for reconstruction and didn’t do a lot of things. For me, I wasn’t just thinking of Dundee Football Club but other clubs who would be hurt in all of this. That was my main focus – I didn’t want anybody to get hurt.The change came after a lot of conversations with a lot of clubs and the appetite for reconstruction was greater than I first thought. There are other things, which I don’t want to get into, but we were trying to help these clubs who were going to be hurting. I was trying to soften the blow for everybody but also trying to use the time [between the deadline and submitting the ‘yes’ vote] to make Scottish football, through reconstruction, a better overall product that has more value going forward. That’s something we have been discussing for a long time, but we have the time now to really dig in and look at it. Getting to that stage, we had over % of the clubs vote a certain way so, in order to get going, so to speak, I changed my vote so we could get on to the next phase.As far as the Premiership goes, all we did was vote to put it into the hands of the board. They now have in their hands the chance to say what they want to do with it. They can try to play [the remaining matches] later. There are options they will have to weigh. We weren’t weighing those options.GC: What went through your mind when you saw the incomplete vote had been published JN: I wasn’t best pleased. I know there was a statement saying: “We had to put something out because we had a board meeting,” but the statement could have been as simple as: “We have an incomplete vote, there is a statutory  days and we have not received every vote.” By the way, it wasn’t just our vote, there were others that weren’t received either. They could have said it was an incomplete vote without any detail and that would have been more appropriate in my opinion.GC: At that point, you have said you weren’t aware it was your vote that was missing, what did you think then JN: I don’t know what happened, I have no idea. What they say is it got caught in the spam folder, which you have to believe. We did intend to vote a certain way and then changed it after I had more information. I talked with a lot of people. I pace when I talk on the phone. The Saturday, I walked . miles while on the phone, mostly inside my house. I averaged over the period before I voted over  miles a day, just on the phone.GC: What was the major part of changing your vote JN: The biggest thing was, the only way I could see, once we knew what was happening, that we could help anybody – it’s not just helping people but a longer-term, bigger picture – is reconstruction. Speaking with a lot of clubs, there was much more of an appetite for reconstruction than I understood going into this. That was the main thing.GC: Can you understand why other people saw Dundee as the bad guy JN: Obviously, people think we have handed United the league, Rangers think we have handed Celtic the league, although that is in the hands of the board, which they have a representative on. Over % voted for it and it was going to happen one way or the other – we represent % of that vote, total. The only way going forward would be league reconstruction. Yeah, I can see why I am the bad guy, but  or % of the league are also that same bad guy. The league did, in putting it out there, put us in a bad position.GC: The WhatsApp messages . Did that influence your thought process JN: It’s unbelievable. The way that was handled was not businesslike and was very poor. It has caused a lot of bad blood throughout the league, the way that was done, taking private messages and putting them out there. Of course, they have been taken out of context at some levels because you don’t know exactly what was going on and what the conversations were. There were a lot of conversations going on at that time, loads of them, so you don’t get the full context of it but you do get one view and that’s what they wanted.GC: You mentioned ‘handing’ Dundee United the Championship. Did that come into the thinking at any point JN: Obviously as Dundee Football Club, we don’t want to hand our rivals anything but, at the end of the day, it was inevitable that was going to happen. I had several conversations with Mal [Brannigan, Dundee United managing director] throughout this, several conversations with Rangers, with Celtic, with Hearts, I’ve had conversations with quite a few people. You could tell early on that there would be promotion relegation and there was no way around it because over % of the clubs wanted that to happen. Whether or not we wanted that to happen, it was going to happen. I’m not going to make a decision based on what happens to United – I have to make the decision on what’s best for Dundee Football Club and what’s best for Scottish football.GC: To make it clear, what was the benefit to Dundee in changing your vote JN: We were in the worst position possible – we were in third place. There’s not much benefit one way or the other that we could get out of this. When people ask me that – I ask what do you think we could we have gotten out of this  So, the best thing we could possibly get out of this is a proper conversation about reconstruction. That might not benefit us in the short-term, but in the long-term, it would benefit Dundee FC and all of Scottish football. That, for me, was the best thing we could get out of this. Does that do anything for us right now  No. But we need to look at it in a much bigger, broader picture as opposed to: “What does it do for me right now ”GC: After the whole process, are you happy with the end result JN: I’m not happy with the overall process, I’m not happy with where we are, I’m not happy football clubs are losing money, I’m certainly not happy people are dying of coronavirus in the wider world. We still don’t know what is actually going to happen. All of this might be for nought, we might be shut down for a long, long time and be having much dferent conversations in the future. You can never be happy in these situations, just be pragmatic and get through it as best as we can.GC: Are you confident reconstruction is going to happen and benefit the game in the long-term JN: We are having good conversations. We have to jump through a load of hoops and we have  clubs we have to satisfy, on some level. For me, the most important thing in this is that Scottish football – and, in turn, Dundee Football Club – comes out with a product that is better than we currently have. Sky Sports and our media partners need to be a part of this, too, and help us understand exactly what it is going to take in order for us to be a more attractive product, a more saleable product. We want to be on TV, we want more people to come to games, we need to make games have more meaning, we have to do things that might be outside of the box to bring viewers to the table – that’s the angle I come at it from. I can’t talk to you about the specics of what the group is talking about because we are trying to work through all of these things but the principle, from my point of view, is we have to absolutely make it a more attractive proposition for fans and for viewers. There are ways of doing it.What I want to get out of it all is a product that is better that, in turn, brings more money in that, in turn, makes the product even better and it turns full circle. For me, that’s the goal. It’s a long-term vision but we have the time right now to pay attention to that and work through these things. It might end up this scenario ends up being a change-stage process, whenever we get started again, for  , and then reconstruction might start in  .GC: Do you have a preference for which way the league might be set up JN: I really can’t talk about that because of the [reconstruction working] group I am in. A lot of the setups have merits, a lot have issues but as long as whatever format is setup makes it more valuable, more interesting, then I would be open to just about any type of system. At the end of the day, the top tier brings in the most money and that’s where the eyes are but we have to be conscious of down the leagues, they rely more on gate than TV money, and we have to make sure those games are maintained or even enhanced in some way. It is a balancing act, it’s not as simple as just I like this one or that one.GC: How confident are you we might get consensus at the end of this JN: I don’t know. We have only had two meetings so far. There has been a lot of work gone into those meetings. I thinkwe get to a proposition where all clubs benefit financially, the pie actually grows rather than just cutting it up in dferent ways, you’d have a better chance of getting a consensus. If the goal makes the product better and eventually the product is worth more, that makes more sense –you just change for the sake of it, it doesn’t make much sense to me.GC: Do you see it being better to make a permanent change or a temporary one like was suggested in Hearts’ first statement after the reconstruction talks were announced JN: I don’t know, that’s the problem. I don’t think it’s as simple as we can make one big change right away. I think it might be something that phases in over time. But like I said, we have to have all the stakeholders talking in order to see what that means. We have to make sure all the contracts are being satisfied and these conversations take time. It might be that we have a staged-process but at this point, we are so early in the process, I don’t know what that would % look like. We are still working through all the iterations.GC: Getting all the stakeholders talking – has that been made more dficult by the way things have happened over the past few weeks JN: I think within the group, it’s been fine. Everybody is professional. Honestly, there has been no animosity on the phone calls. Any time we run through anything like this, tensions run high and people say things and do things. For the most part, it’s just business and forgivable and off you go. There may have been one or two things that were done that will be more dficult for people to let go but, hopefully, we can all focus for the proper greater good of the game. If we have a proposition that is best for everybody, I would hope we look at the proposition and not really consider anything ."},{"url":null,"title":"fan reaction spfl vote u turn john nelms","story":"John Nelms says he understands the frustrations of Dundee fans after his voting U-turn saw Dundee United crowned Championship winners # but insists the decision was “for the best of the football club”.And he’s thanked “amazing” supporters who have already spent their hard-earned money on a season ticket for the next campaign despite not knowing when it will start or what it might look like.The Dens Park managing director was at the centre of the voting storm that engulfed Scottish football last month as the Dark Blues’ deciding vote swung from a ‘no’ to a ‘yes’ and allowed the SPFL’s resolution to end the   season in the lower leagues to pass.It also granted rivals United the league title and promotion to the Premiership. After an unclear club statement that later emerged to be Dundee’s notice of submitting a ‘yes’ vote, some Dark Blues fans reacted angrily to the decision.Askedhe understood the feelings of the supporters, Nelms told the Tele: “Absolutely. I don’t ever really say which way I vote, I give principles of what we’re doing and why we’re doing it.“The last daywe did a holding statement saying we’re not going to make a statement until we actually do something and then the next statement came out because we actually did something and voted.“But, people didn’t realise that we actually voted. So, we had to put out another statement.“You know how I am, I don’t talk about players# contracts, I don’t do things like that because I don’t think it’s appropriate at the time because you are negotiating. You can’t do that in the public eye because it’s not beneficial for the football clubyou do it that way.“We talked about it and I could see why the fans were concerned.“Honestly, I’m not surethe fans can see it or not but we are doing whatever we can do for the best of the football club, always. Not once in a while, not when it suits, always.“We will make decisions that might not be popular among the fans in the short-term but overall in the long-term it will benefit the football club. That’s the way we will run the business and I don’t think we’ve done anything but that. I’ll take the heat for it and that comes with the territory.”The club haven’t had any match income for over seven weeks due to the coronavirus shutdown.Nelms says Dundee are in a “stable position” but accepts there is no way of knowing what the future might hold.“At the moment, the way we have the business set up, with insurances and the way the“It is a new reality. Our business has changed from getting excited and ready for the next match to basically survival.“We are trying to prepare for when we come out of this but we don’t really know what is going to happen – we have nine dferent budget options for next year.“We don’t know when we are going to start playing again and that is the hard, frustrating part of it all.”Asked how much the club is losing per month, Nelms replied: “This is one of these things where I won’t talk about specic numbers.“Every club is going to be dferent – most clubs don’t have the insurance policies we have in place so they will be losing more than we will.“The government has really stepped in and helped out the mid-sized to lower-end clubs.“At the bigger clubs with the salaries the players are on, although the furlough helps, it doesn’t help a huge amount.“I would say Dundee Football Club and others around the size of our club are at a pucker point where it really helps us out and it helps out clubs below us but above it won’t help out as much.“We’re OK at the moment but we don’t know what is going to happen.”Despite not knowing when the next campaign will be, fans have already been putting money into the club by buying season tickets for  .An “amazing” gesture says Nelms.“You can’t thank people enough in a day and age like this where every day you are living basically day-to-day to see people step up and buy season tickets is amazing,” he added.“It’s incredible to see the number of people who have bought them with a big unknown going forward.“We will be playing football at some point in time, we just don’t know exactly when.“The fact they have faith in the club and desperately want to see their team is helpful – and also helps us build the team based on the support we have.“We know there are things that are way more important now than football butpeople want to dig in their pockets then great,not we’ll see you when we are all back together and have a good product on the park.”"},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey - after centuries of mystery."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-new-transplant-system-launch-date-confirmed","story":"LEGISLATION to introduce an opt-out system of organ and tissue donation for deceased donors will come into force in Autumn ."},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"skyes-limit-sabhal-mor-ostaig---unique-gaelic-only-college-set-stunning-island-location","story":"AS global interest in Gaelic grows, students from across the world are travelling to Skye to study at Sabhal Mograver Ostaig, the National Centre for Gaelic Language and Culture."},{"url":null,"title":"screen-siren-mae-west-stopped-traffic-glasgow-visit","story":"ldquoCHILDREN adore me, cooed screen siren Mae West when she met a young fan in Glasgow during the heyday of her career."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-woman-discovered-first-human-coronavirus","story":" June Almeida, who discovered the first human coronavirus, was the daughter of a bus driver from Glasgow.

upgrade north east sports pitches to be discussed","story":"Further plans to improve sports pitches in the north-east are to be discussed today.Live Le Aberdeenshire, which is part of the local authority, has been outlining its new open space strategy, which will see pitches and green spaces across the region improved.Decisions have already been made on the areas for Buchan, Formartine and Kincardine and Mearns.Plans are to be discussed at today’s meeting of the Marr area committee, which covers Aboyne, Alford, Banchory, Huntly and their surrounding areas.More than £ million could be invested into the Marr areacouncillors back the proposals.A total of £,, has been identied in estimated costs, with more to be identied at a later date.In Aboyne and surrounding area, the report outlines investigating options to upgrade the pavilion at Tarland and the changing pavilion at Aboyne, as well as establishing a pitch in the area to be used for competitive sports.Alford and its districts could see £m allocated to develop the outdoor adventure offer at the Sir Arthur Grant Centre and Alford Ski Centre, as well as improvements to the existing grass pitches at the new school campus, and establishing new competitive sports pitches to improve football capacity.In Banchory, £.m has been identied to investigate options for an all-weather pitch provision as well as a changing pavilion to increase training and matchplay capacity for rugby and football, and £, to consider adapting the existing surface at Hill of Banchory School to a football compliant one.Meanwhile, in Huntly, a number of options are to be considered such as £, – much of which will be externally funded through developer obligations – to look at a replacement all-weather pitch at Christie Park, and £, to develop adventure sports opportunities in the area at the Nordic and Outdoor Centre.A report prepared by Tim Stephen, service manager for facilities and funding, which will be heard by councillors, said: “Live Le Aberdeenshirehas been overseeing a project to maximize the access to outdoor spaces, for the benefit of health and wellbeing, and to look at improving the ability of organised sports clubs to access grass and synthetic pitch facilities.“This report helps deliver council priority five – encourage active lestyles and promote wellbeing with a focus on obesity and mental health.“This report is also integral to the delivery of the -year sport and physical activity strategy – specically objective one – ‘health and wellbeing’.”Councillors of the Marr area committee will meet online today via Skype to discuss the proposals.Following this, engagement will be made with other committees before being brought before councillors in September."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast podcast episode 9 niblicks spoons and touchscreen carts","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management.

From his throne he dispensed news, advice and anecdotes – albeit not always historically accurate. His inimitable irony, perfectly-timed humour and the occasional reprimand to a wayward customer were all fuelled by a generous glass.As former president of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association and Keeper of the Quaich, Donald knew the intricacies of the business intimately from personal experience. His taste was eclectic and his appetite substantial, extending from Dom Perignon and Saint-Émilion Grand Cru to Tennent’s lager and Glen Dronach single malt. On a hot day he’d have an icy Martini or a gin and tonic, proportionately scaled up in a pint glass. Being askedhe had time for a quick ‘small one’, he would reply: #I’ll decide the size for myself,you don’t mind.#The records suggest that his frequent claim to be Scottish Slimmer of the Year, after getting his weight down from  stone to  stone, was fancul.Big D, as he was often called, was fastidious about standards in the little public bar, training his regulars to clear tables of empty glasses and plates promptly, and to keep the log fire stoked on winter evenings.If one of his regulars turned up untypically well-dressed, Donald would raise an eyebrow in mild surprise:  #What’s the occasion for the suit   A funeral   Your latest marriage   Or has your court case come up #In summer, an erratic stream of foreign tourists would have their first encounter with a Scottish pub, standing in the doorway bewildered as to what happens next – sit or stand  Fight their way to the mobbed bar or go to a table and wait for the non-existent waitress  Donald would call them over to his corner and was soon plying them with drinks, food and conversation, not infrequently paying the entire bill for his astonished guests.When a tourist asked him about the quaint red GPO telephone box in Church Square, he told them: #We have the fastest modern communications here – telephone, teletext and tell Donald.#Donald was a Francophile and loved his summers in Collioure, where #Le Grand Ecossais# was almost as well-known as in Argyll. A fixture of the local bars and restaurants, and frequently crossing the border to patronise Spanish hostelries, he revelled in the region’s seafood, wine and culture.His hobbies included cooking, opera, reading and lively conversation on a sweeping range of topics from local history to civil engineering. His knowledge was genuinely wide, but when occasionally encountering someone with a superior command of the topic in question, he would quickly change the subject and admonish: “Och, you’re showing off now.”Donald Clark was born on  July , in Rotten Row hospital, Glasgow. He was the youngest child of Donald Clark and Elizabeth Inglis, following by nine years his only sibling, Fiona.His early years were spent in Inveraray where family le revolved around his parents’ hotel in the little white-washed town.He was schooled at Inveraray Primary and Larchfield in Helensburgh, then Strathallan from  to  where he acquired his love of sports. Contrary to what his dimensions in later le would suggest, he was athletic when young, excelling at rugby and playing for his school and West of Scotland First XV and the old boys’ As.Donald also enjoyed curling, motor boating, snow skiing and water-skiing, where his party piece was to mono-ski down Loch Fyne while drinking a pint of beer.Although not a shinty player, he used his sports experience to coach the Inveraray team in the s and like his father chaired the club.

They feed on flying insects and spend most of their le in the air # including when they sleep # usually coming down to earth to breed. They are fast fliers, often chasing one another over buildings when they give a screeching call.Swts arrive back in Argyll in early May and breed in towns, villages and other buildings in Argyll. They spend around three months in Argyll, departing early-mid August to their wintering grounds in Africa.The British Trust for Ornithology’s Breeding Bird Survey indicates the population of Swts in Scotland has declined by around  per cent since . A similar decline has taken place in England and Wales. The reasons for the decline are not fully known but are believed to be related to changes in insect numbers and a lack of nesting sites as buildings are modernised.Argyll is at the north-western limit of the world range of Swts. Their distribution and numbers in Argyll is not well-known and the purpose of the Argyll Bird Club Survey is to try to find out the size of the breeding population and where they remain.If you have a Swt nesting in your building, or near you, or would like to take part in this survey further information is available at http:argyllbirdclub.org argyll-surveysFor more information about Argyll Bird Club, email Jim Dickson at Argyllbirder@outlook."},{"url":null,"title":"remembering key workers in inveraray","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsInveraray#s war memorial was lit up blue this week in tribute to the work being done by NHS staff and other key workers during the coronavirus crisis.The tribute was organised by Inveraray#s branch of the Royal British Legion Scotland.

We felt there must be another way to help high risk groups.\"Equally, local businesses were worried about the virus affecting their trade. In order to help sustain all aspects of our community, wersquove tried to take a broad approach.One solution was the creation of the first Newstead Village Newsletter ndash a simple, four-page leaflet which included useful information and several helpline numbers. ldquoMelrose shops offering home deliveries were also included in the newsletter, says Lisa. ldquoWe put the information online but that excluded those without internet access. So, a printed version delivered to every home was essential.Local Volvo dealer John Cleland kindly offered to take care of the printing, while Gala Le said they would deliver. But these exciting plans looked to be scuppered with the imposition of lockdown.Thankfully, though, postman Keith Borthwick came to the rescue, explained Lisa.She says: \"He made sure that every house received a copy of the newsletter with their mail. Feedback has been brilliant. Itrsquos proving a great resource to help people access local shops.The village has also created a highly productive WhatsApp group, which is proving to be a \"great way\" to keep in touch with residents in isolation, says local volunteer Sonia Kelly.ldquoShoppers message when theyrsquore heading out, and those in need then get in contact,\" says Sonia. \"The system works well and is based on being neighbourly. Therersquos so much community activity taking place, itrsquos bringing everyone together in the most resourceful way.Jane McNeil is also one of Newsteadrsquos busy shoppers. ldquoI started volunteering because I wanted to help those who had made me feel welcome since moving to the village,\" she says.\"It started with a couple of neighbours and has grown since then. Irsquom a great believer in treating others as I would hope to be treated. With so many new friendships being forged, my hope is that after the pandemic, we can maintain this level of care for our neighbours.Another shopper is Jackie Kerr, who helps out a couple of the villages older residents. ldquoI shop a few times a week for Nancy Howieson, who is , and her mother Georgina Paterson ndash who recently celebrated her th birthday. They live separately and are usually very independent. So, itrsquos a dficult time for them now, but Irsquom happy to help in any way I can.Nancy and Georgina are well known around Melrose, where they founded Tweedbank Art Club and put on regular shows. ldquoWe love to paint, says Nancy. ldquoWe are the best of friends and usually see each other every day. Mum has led an exciting le including travelling the world and being a maid at Buckingham Palace for Princess Alice. Shersquos a bit fed up as she likes to get out but is still managing to paint.Whilst her mother continues to paint her way through the lockdown, Nancy has been busy tackling her garden. ldquoI try not to bother folk, but my next-door neighbour has been such a help offering to cut my grass and digging out some tree roots. Everyone in the village is being really friendly.With so many currently living in isolation, volunteers are also reaching out by phone. ldquoIf people arenrsquot on the Internet, itrsquos easy for them to be left out, says Liz Ellis, who has lived in Newstead for  years. ldquoTherefore a few of us are making regular phone calls to people all over the village just to say hello, seethey need anything and have a friendly chat. Irsquove never experienced anything like this in Newstead before. I canrsquot get over the amount of support being offered everyone is desperate to help each other.,params: .pushThe Neate family are also playing their role in raising village spirits. Toby, aged nine, and his seven-year-old brother Rueben, along with other Newstead children, have been displaying colourful paintings in their windows and have decorated the village phone box with rainbows. ldquoIt makes us really happy that our art is helping to keep the village smiling, says Toby.Meanwhile, dad Tristan, who manages Neate Maintenance, has offered to help Newsteadrsquos army of NHS workers. ldquoThe pandemic is putting pressure on many key workers who are working extremely long hours. Im sure they have little time for gardening right now. In , Irsquod like to thank them by volunteering to their cut grass or do some weeding.Lisa, the resilience co-ordinator, says shes \"never felt prouder\" of the village.ldquoCoordinating the resilience group is a pleasure,\" she says. \"Wersquore seeing so many incredible acts of kindness, often between complete strangers.

outbreak.It is estimated that the public is collectively owed about pound billion from travel firms.Forced instead to turn to their banks for help, many customers have now been told they are not eligible for a refund.Heres what you need to know.Why arenrsquot travel firms giving refunds Consumer watchdog Which  recently revealed that  of the UKrsquos largest airlines and travel firms are illegally withholding refunds which should be paid to customers within  days.Instead, most customers have been offered vouchers or credit notes, with many complaining that they have been unable to claim a refund online, or get through to customer services on the phone to ask for their money back.Should I ask my bank for a refund Customers who have been refused a refund by travel firms and paid for their trip using a credit card can claim the money back from their provider under Section  of the Consumer Rights Act.Credit card providers are jointly liable with the retailer or trader for any breach of contract for misrepresentation, providing the value is more than pound and less than pound,.However, Which  has warned that some credit card customers have been told by their provider that theyre not eligible for a refund through the scheme.Others have been informed that their claim wonrsquot be processed until they have tried to claim the cash from the travel firm first, even though this is not a legal requirement.Customers are also able to claim through a process known as chargeback, which allows a transaction to be reversedyou are unable to resolve a dispute, including services not delivered.This covers all card payments and is a process agreed between financial institutions and the relevant card scheme, such as Mastercard and Visa.What are Mastercard and Visarsquos chargeback rights Mastercard said there is a chargeback right where firms have cancelled goods or services, even where this is due to government restrictions, insolvency or other exceptional circumstances.It is also validthe cardholder doesnrsquot wish to accept the firmrsquos offer to rebook or claim a voucher, but the issue should first be attempted to be resolved with the firm.Visarsquos guidance also states that firms should process a refund promptlycustomers decline a credit note or voucher, and cardholders do have a right to complain when goods or services are not provided.However, Visa does make an exception where firms have failed to provide a service due to a government-imposed travel ban, stating that this ldquosupersedes Visa rules on dispute rights.For this reason, Mastercard customers are likely to be more successful when making chargeback claims for coronavirus-related cancellations.If flights are cancelled due to closed borders, customers will still have a dispute right under both Mastercard and Visa, as EU-wide rules around refunds override the government travel ban, according to Which .Which banks will refund under Section  and chargeback Banks have said that they will assess each case inidually when it comes to refunds from firms only offering credit notes or rebooking a cancelled trip.This is what the major banks told Which  about issuing refunds:Where a provider has not met their legal obligations to the customer, Barclays will consider both chargeback and Section  claims, provided the relevant criteria are met.HSBC, including First Directand MS Bank, will allow a chargeback or Section  claim to be made for goods or services not received, but customers are encouraged to contact their airline first.Lloyds Group, including Halaxand Bank of Scotlandsay thata refund is not offered by the travel firm and a customer has proof of this, the bank can pursue a disputed transaction claim under scheme rules.Bankrsquos position is that every chargeback and dispute is dferent, and each claim will need to be assessed on a case-by-case basis with the customer to work out the best solution.Nationwidealso says each case will be looked at on a case-by-case basis because it depends on the type of good services being purchased and what the terms of the agreement are with the merchant.Similarly, RBS, including Natwestand Ulster Bank, said cases would be considered on an inidual basis.If a claim made with the merchant in the first instance is not satisfactory, customers can contact Santanderto raise a claim.,params: .pushWhere the merchant has offered the chance to rebook for free and or provide vouchers and the customer is not satisfied with this then Starling Banksays it would initiate a chargeback.If a merchant is not offering a refund, or are asking customers to contact their card issuers to process a refund, Tesco Bankcustomers can raise a dispute.The Co-operative Banksays thatcustomers tried to resolve the issue with the merchant first but there was no refund or resolution, the bank would look at each case inidually to verya dispute chargeback right existed. If a chargeback right existed but the cardholder accepted a credit voucher, this would not affect the cardholderrsquos original dispute rights. The bank would also not reject a Section  claim outright in these circumstances.If customers are offered a voucher or a chance to rebook, TSBwould typically accept the claims and each case will be considered inidually.If the customer is unhappy with the solution offered by the merchant, Virgin Moneywould consider the terms and conditions.

Irsquom sure of it, and took a photo.But there wasnrsquot really anything of much interest to see other than a slab on the ground where I believe the well once stood.It seemed so forgotten, and put me in a melancholy mood for a moment.I reflected on the way something that had been a tradition for so long, and such a part of many peoplersquos lives can just vanish, and be utterly forgotten.I know it was just a well and so might not seem important.But it was a meeting place for ordinary people for generations.The simple shared routines and places in our lives are often the ones we remember with nostalgia.We donrsquot think of them as history or worthy of recording until all memory has gone, and itrsquos too late.I thought about this as we were going on our local family walk this week.I suppose we all know we are living through a time that will be recorded by history.But when all this is over, and things are back to ldquonormal what simple things will you, and your family, remember from this time and what will you want remembered For me, this includes seeing the Greenhills carpeted with wildflowers for the first time that I can remember, watching children cycle on empty streets and deserted car parks, and queuing in shops, keeping our physical distance while also trying to stay social.For sure the toilet roll panic will be part of history.But all of us will have special moments and places that connect to the emotions of this time.There will be stories of peoplersquos wonderful community spirit, what it felt like to be confined in the house for weeks, and how we entertained ourselves.We are all historians of our own time, and we should find ways to record and remember the simple, but important, things we have felt and encountered during this time of crisis.Because memory fades, and as the fate of the Bickers Well shows,memories are not recorded or stories of them not told, they will be forgotten.And so this was why I decided to re-visit the story of the Bickers Well for my column this week.It may have originally seemed there was not much to tell about it.Yet once there was.But the memories and the stories connected to it seemed so simple and obvious at the time that nobody really thought them important enough to record or keep treasured.Now all that remains of those stories is a slab on the pavement.The technology we have makes it easier now to share and record our lives.So letrsquos use it to consciously be historians and storytellers of this dficult time to capture images and feelings, the happenings that may today seem too simple and commonplace to record, but in future will be a fascinating insight to our lives in this historic event.For me, that is the lesson of the Bickers Well."},{"url":null,"title":"boys-birthday-bagpipe-tunes-bring-smile-kids-faces","story":"Sam Johnston, , of Tweedie Place, North Berwick, has been playing lsquoHappy Birthdayrsquo on his bagpipes for other young residents in the Walker Homes Glen Ora development.Law Primary School P pupil Sam, who plays for Preston Lodge Pipe Band, is helping children with birthdays celebrate their special day despite lockdown.It started when one mum, Fee Andrews, posted on a neighbourhood Facebook group asking for people to hang out of their windows and sing lsquoHappy Birthdayrsquo to her son Brodie.Samrsquos mum Fiona suggested that he could play the bagpipes and, after playing for four-year-old Brodie, who described the experience as ldquogood, Sam has been inundated with requests.In keeping with social distancing guidelines, Sam plays the tune by his front door, with neighbours welcome to stand on the pavement and sing along.Fiona said: ldquoHe has been practising in the garden every day, and is doing his lessons online.ldquoHersquos doing something good for his community ndash giving his pipes a blow and doing something nice forthe kids that are stuck inside.ldquoI am really proud of him.

They have now been working from home for more than a month and have continued to support vulnerable and disadvantaged young people with ious issues which has brought about some ldquounexpected outcomes.Lynne Anderson, transitions development worker, has noticed that she is able to use her time more wisely by phoning her clients instead of driving up to an hour each way to visit them at their homes.She said: ldquoWe can use this situation to learn how things work dferently. There are opportunities to continue doing some of the activities we are doing remotely when weto normal.She is one of several staff members who have had to change the way they give support over the past weeks but it still focuses on many of the same issues. They provide help with filling out job and college applications, and provide young people with emotional support and tutoring. The response has also generally been very positive, with staff members reporting engagement levels of up to  per cent from their clients.Natasha McInninie, transitions service co-ordinator, said: ldquoI am surprised by how resilient young people are. I thought we would lose a lot of young people through this situation. However, it has actually made them engage more.Emma Scarclfe, acting chief executive, is also very pleased by how both Bridges Project staff and the young people they work with have responded to the current crisis.She said: ldquoBridges Project has adapted quickly to the unexpected situation around Covid-. Engagement continues to be extremely high and the commitment and dedication from staff to change their working practices so quickly to suit each inidual young person has been a complete triumph. Wersquore all very proud of the way young people have adapted and how resilient they are.However, there are also issues which have become ldquomagnied during the lockdown, for example, people who have dficult relationships with their family members struggle with being ldquolocked up together over such a long period. Others are affected by less income and need help with accessing food parcels, Universal Credit and other types of financial support.Many young people also need help to deal with the impact the Covid- crisis is having on their mental health. This is particularly the case for those who were already struggling with social anxiety or social isolation prior to the lockdown.Lynne said: ldquoIn the beginning, the young people thought it was fantastic. Now the reality of the lockdown is settling in and it is starting to become challenging.This trend has also been observed by personal development worker, Chris Nicol, who said: ldquoThe young people were dealing with it well during the first few weeks but have seen a downturn in their mood over the last two weeks. This is due to a combination of boredom and too much time to think but also not seeing their friends. They have realised how important those social anchors really are.He highlighted the importance of keeping young peoplersquos motivation and confidence up during these challenging times.He explained: ldquoI remind them that they need to focus on the fact that this will last for a relatively short period of their lives and things will go back to normal.Thank you for reading this story.

At a crucial time in the survival of the language, graduates have helped create a Gaelic speaking workforce that now holds key posts across a wide range of sectors in Scotland.Sabhal Mograver Ostaig is one of the key partners in fulfilling the governmentrsquos objectives in the National Gaelic Plan, which aims to increase the number of people speaking the language and accelerate the growth of Gaelic.Many people are keen to learn more about the language because of its rich culture and the college provides a wide range of short courses in Gaelic language, song and traditional music. Ceilidhs, workshops, conversation circles and music sessions all create an encouraging atmosphere that bring together students from  countries across five continents.As a modern, innovative college, Sabhal Mograver Ostaig has excellent learning resources on campus including an exceptional library collection, residential student accommodation, broadcast and recording facilities and a Gaelic medium childcare facility on site. It also has a growing international reputation for academic research.The college was founded on the principle of being part of the local and wider community and its activities are greatly enhanced by co-operative links, being home to a number of signicant national creative and cultural projects such as Tobar an Dualchais, Ainmean Agraveite na h-Alba and Cagravenan Graphics Studio.

All our lives have been changed beyond recognition by coronavirus and we have no idea when, or , they will everto normal.This is a time for sober reflection. And serious consideration of how, as iniduals and a society, we will recover from the psychological, social and economic effects of this crisis.And yet Boris Johnson wants to focus on bunting, street parties and how ldquogreat Britain is as we mark the th anniversary of VE Day on Friday. Not even a brush with death and stay in intensive care, it seems, can cure the Prime Minister of crass attempts to distract us from how poorly he and his Government has handled things.But what really galls me about Mr Johnsonrsquos jingoism is how it overshadows and insults valuable lessons from the end of the Second World War, not least around how to rebuild shattered lives and countries following unimaginable loss and trauma. That is, after all, what the war generation largely succeeded in doing across western Europe after Germany was finally liberated from the tyranny of Nazism in May .With few members of this extraordinary generation left ndash and the virus having a devastating impact on those that remain ndash opportunities to listen to their thoughts and experiences firsthand are running out. It is particularly cruel that so many of those still with us are currently having to be shielded away from families and friends. I trust technology will help us hear their voices this week.The timing of this anniversary, in the midst of a global pandemic, gives people of every age a unique opportunity to reconnect with the war generation at a deeper level. From  to  lives were changed and lost abruptly, hopes and dreams shattered. Unexpected opportunities arose and dferent paths had to be taken. People, communities and entire spheres of le were forced to re-evaluate what mattered. Certainties, priorities and value systems changed. We are going through some of these things now, albeit in a dferent way. But I donrsquot doubt the experiences of  years ago can give us strength and solace in the dficult months and years to come.Though all my grandparents have been dead for many years, I am lucky enough to have treasured wartime photographs, letters, medals and memorabilia. On May  I will be thinking particularly of my two grandmothers, one a young mother whose wounded RAF gunner husband had just ed home after six years away, the other a munitions worker in a strange city celebrating her rd birthday alone. Both struggled in the aftermath of war to find connection and fulfilment, but succeeded in raising loving families. Both were and remain much-loved.I will also be thinking of the Scottish soldiers still fighting their way across Europe until the very end of the war, as well as those who stayed on to build the peace. I will think, too, of the Germans, freed on May  from Nazism but destined to be ided until . My American husbandrsquos relatives, who in May  were still fighting in Asia ndash and would continue to do so well into the next generation ndash will also be on my mind.As the poignant footage of VE Day shows, the end of war was celebrated with tears of joy and relief, passionate kisses, warm embraces and dancing in fountains. But, as my own family recounted to me firsthand, it was also tinged with loss, sadness, trauma and fear for the future. Some did meet again, many, of course, did not.This extraordinary generation rebuilt the country in the aftermath, creating many of the institutions we value most today, not least the NHS. And, as -year-old Captain Tom Moorersquos astonishing fundraising efforts highlight, they keep contributing in the most inspiring ways.We donrsquot need bunting or a commemorative coin to celebrate VE Day, Winston Churchillrsquos victory speech on the telly or Joan Collins wrapped in a union flag . And we certainly donrsquot need Boris Johnson insulting our intelligence with a jingoistic reframing of the past when he should be concentrating on the present.If we choose to look beyond flag-waving, history, as ever, has much to teach us.

There are a range of ways to do this.\"Andits very vital you work next to each other then potentially things like shields that you see in supermarkets, or indeed PPE, is a way forward.\"However, business leaders said clarity was needed on issues such as PPE and whether firms could be held liable eventhey fulfilled their obligations to protect employees from coronavirus.Adam Marshall, Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce, said the issue was one of the \"key questions weve asked\".He told BBC Radio s Today programme: \"We need as much specicity as possible so businesses can ensure theyve taken all the steps they can in order to protect their people.\"And, as much as possible, we want to see consistency across the UK. It would be very confusing and costly for businesseswe saw dferent nations going in very dferent directions.\"They[bosses] will want to know that theyre not going to be held liable for horrible things that may unfortunately happentheyve done everything in their power to keep their people safe.\"Whereas, by contrast, youd want to see those employers who didnt take adequate steps face the consequences of that so the question of legal liability is extremely important.\"Mr Marshall insisted there was a need for \"clear guidance\" on PPE.\"Were still waiting for more detail on that and its going to be hugely, hugely important for a lot of firms because the number of questions were hearing from businesses about protective equipment grows by the day.\"A UK-wide procurement strategy will be \"hugely important\" in order to source and manufacture the necessary PPE, he added.In other developments:*Mr Johnson, in an interview with the Sun newspaper, told how, during his treatment in intensive are for Covid-, he feared he might not live to meet his son Wilfred, who was born on Wednesday*Mr Wallace said the Government has been \"trying to source as many masks as possible\" in case guidance for their use by the public changes*Gavin Williamson, the UK Education Secretary, announced a package of support worth almost pound billion to help universities weather the coronavirus crisis ndash this is expected to produce a knock-on windfall for the Scottish Government of around pound million and*Sir David King, the Governmentrsquos former Chief Scientic Adviser, will host a meeting of experts this afternoon in response to concerns over the \"lack of transparency\" coming from the Sage group of advisers.Meanwhile, rail union leaders have voiced \"severe concerns\" over any moves to increase train services as part of the expected easing of the lockdown.The three main rail unions have written to Prime Minister Boris Johnson warning that increasing services would send out a \"mixed message\" that it is OK to travel by train, despite official advice suggesting otherwise.\"This mixed messaging could be dangerous and lead to the public flouting the rules on travel and work,\" said Aslef, the RMT and TSSA.The letter continues: \"We will not accept new working patterns that put the lives of railway workers and passengers at risk.\"To be clear - we are not convinced that there is any basis at this time for a safe escalation of services."},{"url":null,"title":"ve-day-75-extra-bread-workers-enjoy-day-off-herald-reported-day","story":"ldquoIt has ended because Germany is utterly exhausted ndash beaten in the field, bankrupt in politics, besmirched in repute by Hitlerrsquos lies and blunders, and the bestial cruelties of his system and its instruments.

And we will make sure that support is available to enable people to isolate effectively.ldquoHowever, it is important to stress that ldquotest, trace, isolate, support will be most effective when levels of infection are low ndash lower than now ndash and stay low, and that its success relies on all of us knowing and agreeing what to dowe have symptoms, and being prepared to self-isolate when advised to do so.ldquoThis will not be easy.

forced to pay out a substantial legal bill after losing a court battle over controversial plans to extend a retail park.Council officials had granted planning permission for a cinema, hotel and food and retail outlets to be added to Westway Retail Park in Cumbernauld, but the owners of a shopping mall in the town centre challenged the move at the Court of Session.The court ruled against the councilrsquos decision and found that its reasons for granting permission were ldquoperverse and inadequate and ldquomaterially flawed.In a written judgment on the case, Lord Burns stated: ldquoI find that the respondentsfailed to fulfil their statutory duties under the  Act that they erred in law that they failed to give proper reasons and that they acted unreasonably.He ordered that the council should now ldquore-examine the application.The retail park, around . miles from the town centre, currently has a number of home and DIY stores on site.However Dutch firm Promontoria Holdings applied for planning permission to extend it and develop a number of other leisure and shopping outlets.The councilrsquos planning committee approved the plans in June last year but the owners of the townrsquos Antonine Shopping Centre, Bridges Antonine LLP, sought a judicial review of the decision.They claimed that, as the council had failed to carry out a Retail Impact Assessment, officials ldquoacted unreasonably and perversely in concluding that the Westway proposal could be developed without detriment to Cumbernauld Town Centre.Lord Burns agreed and found that the local authority failed to properly assess the impact the proposal would have on Cumbernauld town centre, adding that the centre had problems with ldquoretail contraction and vacancy issues.He also found that councillors were not provided with sufficient information to make their decision.The council could now be forced to pay Bridges Antoninersquos legal costs in the case, as well as paying for their own legal fees at the expense of the taxpayer.This is likely to run to tens of thousands of pounds.Tom Tyler, Investment Director at Bridges Antonine, claimed planners failed to listen to their concerns and left them no option but to pursue legal action.He said: ldquoWe are delighted the Court of Session has agreed with what we told the council from day one, namely that councillors had not been provided with the correct information.ldquoThis led them to make a decision which would have had a catastrophic impact on Cumbernauld Town Centre.ldquoWe consistently sought to find a solution to this issue but planners failed to listen to our concerns and forced us to take legal action.ldquoThis will result in signicant costs which will be picked up by council tax payers of North

[They] had been booted out... and the Germans had heavy protection in place for all the harbours on the coast.ldquoBritish Vice-Admiral John HughesHallett said that lsquothe only way we were going to get back in was to take our harbour with usrsquo.He was being flippant but lots of military commanders thought, lsquothatrsquos actually a good idearsquo.ldquoThere was lots of activity at Rigg Bay but the first inkling that the estate factor had about the presence of the military was signs going up on the estate fences saying military property ndash please keep out. There was no consultation.Garlieston is just one of several locations north of the Border that played a crucial role in preparing troops for D-Day. From the Tarbat peninsula to Highland lochs, the countryrsquos contribution was huge.But, for Mr Walter, the technical ingenuity involved makes the work that took place in his village particularly notable.ldquoThe area was chosen for the evaluation of three prototypes owing to its remoteness and beach conditions similar to northern France, he said.ldquoOf the three prototypes, two were quickly eliminated. The pier head for the one that was sent to war was based on quite an old design by Lobnitz and Co, which was based in Renfrew.ldquoThe key innovation was the floating roadway designed by Allan Beckett, who was a military engineer. He designed it pretty much from scratch and that is what made the whole thing work.ldquoThe contribution that the geography provided was absolutely huge because it meant that prototype evaluation was able to take place beyond the reach of German reconnaissance and pretty much out of sight.The components were later assembled and towed out to France under the noses of the enemy.ldquoPerhaps the most striking thing about the project was the timescale, said Mr Walter. ldquoWhen you think about civil engineering projects now the timescales just go on and on, as do the budgets, whereas here we are talking about a project that went from a cold start in  to trials in  and full implementation on D-Day in June .As well as hosting experimental engineering work, Scotland became a vast training camp.On the beaches of the Moray Firth and along the Tarbat Peninsula, army, navy and artillery units were put through their paces, honing the ability to launch coastal assaults and deliver live gunfire support.Elsewhere, castle estates such as Inveraray and Achnacarry hosted thousands of soldiers who learned how to deploy small landing craft which were vital to the June  landings.ldquoThe beauty of Scotland is that it was unlikely to be raided by the Luftwaffe, said historian Simon Forty, whose book, D-Day UK:  Locations in Britain, charts sites where the attack was planned and prepared for.ldquoIt was out of the way. It provided the armed forces with protected water and inlets that they could use.ldquoTherersquos a strong case for saying that the training that took place in Scotland was the most important for the actual D-Day landing itself because it was in Scotland that troop training with landing craft took place.For Bob Towns, President of Nairn Legion, the sheer scale of activity underlines the importance of memorials such as the one erected on the townrsquos links to honour the rd British Infantry Division.ldquoWalking along the seafront of Nairn on a bonny day, without something like the memorial being there, you would never know what went on, he said.ldquoThatrsquos where the team was built up... so that, when it came to the actual day, they knew one another, they knew how the others operated, and that helped them get the men ashore.

They have discussed the full suite of topics typically included in FTAs, allowing, the department said, for talks to get underway quickly.The UKrsquos negotiating objectives make clear any future agreement must protect the NHS and continue to uphold the countryrsquos high standards on food safety and animal welfare.The Government added that it was committed to a transparent approach to the trade negotiations and would publish a summary of the first round once it had concluded.Commenting on the start of the talks, Adam Marshall, Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: ldquoWhile most UK businesses will be focusing on the immediate challenge posed by coronavirus, strong trading arrangements with both the European Union and USA will support recovery and future growth.ldquoThe Government has set a high ambition for UK-US talks and it will be particularly important to get the details right over the coming months to ensure that any prospective agreement delivers tangible benefits to businesses and communities across the UK.He went on: ldquoCompanies will welcome the focus on helping more UK SMEs grow their trade with partners in the US and on finding ways to move goods, people and data across borders between the two countries more smoothly.Mr Marshall added: ldquoWe will be working constructively with the Government to ensure the needs of UK business communities are considered in negotiations with the USA and with other key trading partners."},{"url":null,"title":"original-airwaves-joke-every-occasion","story":"Comedian and radio presenterBorn: November , .Died: April , .RADIO presenter, comedian and panto star Lou Grant has died after suffering with dementia for several years. The -year-old, however, managed to retain the impish sense of humour and mild devilment which served him so well in his career.It was a career that saw Grant storm national television, perform with iety and comedy greats such as Dave Allen , Bob Monkhouse, The Krankies and Sydney Devine.Yet, while West Sound Radio and theatre audiences loved Lou Grant, his love of a little anarchy could cause radio programme controllers to scratch their heads in dismay, theatre directorsrsquo mouths to fall open wide, and, on one occasion, a helicopter pilotrsquos head to shake in disbelief.There was little doubt that Lou Grant Ritchiewas born to make people laugh. Although he grew up close to the race track ndash his father was an Ayr bookmaker ndash schoolteachers would not have bet against young Lou choosing a showbiz career.Seduced early on by the lights of the townrsquos Gaiety Theatre, aged  the teenager landed work as a page boy showing audiences to their seats. At , he was working on comedianrsquos follow spots, lighting up the stage while magic was being performed ndash and dreaming of such a le for himself.Her Majesty contained that dream for two years when he was sent on his National Service stint to Malaysia with the Royal Scots Fusiliers. Demobbed in Yorkshire, Lou Grant landed work in the Butlins holiday camps, in Skegness and Filey, as a Red Coat. Not only did he meet great friends such as Monkhouse and Allen, he met his future we Margaret, also a budding entertainer.The couple based themselves in Maggiersquos home town of Birmingham while Grant worked the working menrsquos clubs all over the north of England and south Wales. ldquoHe told me of how tough this le was many years later, said chum and one-time panto partner Sydney Devine. ldquoI knewhe had survived these clubs he had to be very good. And he was.Grant was talented enough to win TVrsquos Opportunity Knocks. He recalled many years later: ldquoOpportunity Knocks was the earliest version of Britainrsquos Got Talent and after winning the show I toured with Hughie Green, his assistant Monica Rose and acts like muscle man Tony Holland.The profile of the show helped Lou Grant to work continually throughout the Sixties and Seventies. Audiences loved his cheeky delivery and he became a warm-up man alongside old pal Monkhouse on TV show The Golden Shot.Lou Grant also travelled abroad with the White Heather Club tartan iety shows, headlined by stars such as Andy Stewart. At one gig in Canada, Grant actually became Andy Stewart, reveals old friend and West Sound colleague, Jim Higgins. ldquoAndy Stewart was taken ill and the promoter suggested to Lou that since he looked a little like Andy, and the audience didnrsquot really know what Andy looked like outside of a photo, that he take his place. Lou laughed and said he only knew four Scottish songs. But he was up for the challenge and he sang those four songs on a loop. To this day those audiences donrsquot know they were being entertained by Lou.Grantrsquos stint in England had come to an end in  when he moved back to Scotland in the hope of landing work with Ayrrsquos new radio station. Managing Director Kenneth Roy realised he had a major talent on his hands.Former Programme Controller Gordon McArthur smiles as he recalls how Lou Grantcould also present a regular challenge. ldquoLou would sometimes ignore music policy. Hersquod suddenly announce lsquoIrsquom not playing that!rsquo and put on a Scottish traditional record he liked. But it was harmless fun. And the listeners loved this.One morning Grant played an early Elvis rocker, faded the record and then announced in a straight voice: ldquoI donrsquot know who told him he could sing.Sydney Devine recalls the ldquogreat, fun times working in panto with Grant in the mid-Eighties. ldquoLou was a master comedian and he was so fast and slick. And he was also wicked. Wersquod have young actors in the show who were straight out of drama school, who wouldnrsquot put a comma out of place and needed to stick to the script religiously that was all they knew. But each night, Lou would ad-lib, not quite giving them their feed line on time. The audiences would love it. It showed how he could play with a script, get laughs, and get it right back on the page. He was a master. And the producers never knew what Lou was going to do next.Writer and comedy actor Russell Laine agrees that trying to tie Grant to a tight script was like trying to catch the wind in a jeely jar. ldquoWe had a magic act, Fernando Natasha, he recalls. ldquoI was Natasha, and he was the very funny drunken magician. And his ad-libs were brilliant.Lou Grant was always his own man. Gordon McArthur recalls a stint in Belize, where charity supporter Granthad gone to back the Forces at Christmas time. ldquoWe went out there to record messages from the troops for broadcast at home, and the trip involved us taking a helicopter high above a mountain on the Belize Guatemala border to get to a tiny campsite. ldquoMy greatest memory of that trip is seeing Lou leap down several feet from the helicopter onto the peak of the mountain ndash wearing a Santa hat.The entertainer seemed to work to his own clock. ldquoLou would MC many charity events over the years but the little problem with Lou was he couldnrsquot stick to just the allocated ten minutes. He had a story for every occasion. But that was his great strength.Former West Sound colleague Jim Higgins agrees Lou Grant loved to walk the fine line between professional conformity and mild anarchy. ldquoI can remember him telling me he had a walk-on part in Crossroads [the s TV soap based in Birmingham.] Lou wouldnrsquot just walk on. He was determined to say something, evenit was just lsquoGood morning,rsquo because it was a challenge to him, and those words meant he was paid extra.And he got extra attention. ldquoOh yes, says his friend. ldquoBut that was Lou. He loved it. And even off-stage he lit up a room. You couldnrsquot get angry with him.The comedianrsquos health worsened on the death of his we in .Sydney Devine maintains his friend is a very hard act to follow. ldquoLou was a wonderful wee man, and so well-loved. He was one of the originals.Lou Grant Ritchie is survived by his son Andrew and daughter Lindsey.BRIAN BEACOM"},{"url":null,"title":"opinion-andrew-mckie-sport-may-trifling-matter-compared-economy-absence-oddly-unsettling","story":"In the weird new world of ldquoself-isolation , lots of us must have found ourselves thinking along similar lines. After all, isolate, like insulate, comes from a root that means island.On one level, Donne was certainly right. A paradoxical effect of lockdown has been to emphasise how dependent we all are on other people for the most basic things. Even the folk who were congratulating themselves on their sourdough starters a few weeks ago have discovered that you may be able to make bread without buying yeast, but it gets much trickier when therersquos no flour in the shops.Naturally, thatrsquos a trivial example compared with the real suffering of those who have lost loved ones, or who have seen their livelihoods destroyed. But while wersquore all affected to some degree by the current restrictions, their effects are very far from being equal.Some people ndash especially those whose who can work comfortably from home, or whose income is secure ndash are clearly finding the lockdown irksome rather than traumatic. There are lots of other factors involved those who are in a household with others may be finding it easier than those separated from loved ones . Hence the predictions of a spike in both the orce rate and the birth rate as a result of the pandemic.How big your house is, whether it has a garden, the reliability of your broadband, or your proximity to the countryside, or to a shop carrying essentials, all have an impact on the ability to cope with the current curtailments on our freedom. The most signicant consideration, however, is a matter of attitude.The ndash to me, rather surprising ndash results of a poll conducted at the weekend indicate that only one in five of us thinks that it would be a good idea for schools to go back, while not more than about one in ten thinks that the time is right for pubs and restaurants to reopen. No doubt much of this caution is based on the fact that the authorities, political and scientic, stress the importance of maintaining restrictions until we are certain that we are well into the downward slope of the diseasersquos transmission. Itrsquos probably, for the moment at least, the sensible view.But in the UK, complaints seem to be limited to crackpots from the anti-vaccine movement or conspiracy theorists convinced that G masts are part of a Tory plot to murder the population. Indeed, most of those who are complaining loudest about the policies designed to deal with the pandemic are cross about the measures that have not been brought in ndash demanding that the airports should be closed, or that it should be compulsory to wear masks and gloves.Itrsquos rather alarming to see the eagerness with which some have embraced the opportunity to boss everyone  about, shop their neighbours, or argue that coronavirus proves the case for something ndash communism, nationalisation of utilities, universal basic income, the sugar tax, halting immigration, a smoking ban ndash that they already believed in.On the whole, however, the attitudes towards lockdown from those who are not seriously affected by personal or financial loss seem to be less a matter of political disposition than of temperament. What matters is how social you are, rather than how socialist.The clearest examples are in those activities which depend for their appeal on the fact that they are communal: not so much having a meal in a restaurant or chatting to friends in the pub, which most of us will be missing to some degree, but gatherings which rely on mass shared responses for their emotional pull. Those of us ndash and I admit Irsquom one ndash who arenrsquot particularly susceptible to this sort of thing, or whose idea of hell is crowded gatherings, will no doubt shrug, but it shouldnrsquot blind us to the real loss which many people will be finding it.For some it will be church or mosque, for others nightclubs or music festivals. But some of the effect even of those activities can be satisfied in isolation. You may not be able to go to the cinema, but you can still watch a film live music may be preferable to recordings, but therersquos no overall shortage of music and people are not entirely deprived of the consolations of religion just because services are suspended.The great exception to this, and the one that seems to be a trial for a lot of people, seems to be sport. I was annoyed by the interruption to the Six Nations, but I wouldnrsquot say that the near-disappearance of competitive sport has made much dference to me. But for those who follow a football team, or racing, who count the days until Wimbledon rolls round, or were keenly anticipating the Olympics, this must be a considerable deprivation ndash and at exactly a time when that sort of distraction, as well as a sense of tribal belonging, would have been most welcome.Sport may be a trling matter when compared with the NHS or the economy but the loss of it should seem ndash even to those of us not much bothered by it ndash one of the strangest aspects of the current lockdown. And, unfortunately for the fans, it also appears to be one of the things that will be hardest to get back to normal.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

But now they have become the ldquonew emergency service as shoppers shun the queues to get into the big stores and opt instead for their neighbourhood convenience store such as Spar, KeyStore, Nisa, Londis, Premier and Day-Today during the coronavirus crisis, according to the Scottish Grocersrsquo Federation .Representing about , convenience stores theand breadth of Scotland, the industry bodyrsquos members have stepped into the breach to ensure that customers have easy access to a reliable supply of essential groceries.

Folk can do this by picking a m stretch of road or path, or by walking through a local greenspace and counting the number of instances of dog fouling in that area. You can then submit this information to Keep Scotland Beautul. The data is to be used to increase awareness and drive action to tackle what the charity has described as one of Scotland’s worst environmental complaints.Paul Wallace, campaigns manager with Keep Scotland Beautul said: “It is extremely disappointing that the thoughtless actions of irresponsible dog owners means that our shared enjoyment of our local open and green spaces, and a brief escape from the stresses and strains of the current situation, can be ruined.“That is why Keep Scotland Beautul is calling on iniduals and families to take part in #TurdTag, helping to gather evidence from communities across Scotland to get an accurate picture of the scale of this problem – it is simple and easy to take part as part of the daily exercise allowed in guidance from the Scottish Government.” Results should be submitted to cleanup@keepscotlandbeautul.org by May , and shared using social media and the hashtag #turdtag copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The academic suggested that the next stages of coronavirus containment could be developed earlier in the islands # but onlya comprehensive testing strategy was in place.Orkney and Shetland’s parliamentarians, Liam McArthur MSP, Alistair Carmichael MP and Beatrice Wishart MSP have called on the Scottish Government to provide assurances that they will engage meaningfully with Professor Pennington’s proposals and be open to considering how they might be implemented safely.Mr McArthur said: “Public safety must be paramount as decisions are taken about how and when the current restrictions might be lted.“In that context, however, Professor Pennington’s suggestions, which have already attracted a great deal of interest in Orkney and other island communities, deserve serious and urgent consideration.“If the Scottish Government genuinely want to treat the Scottish public ‘as grown ups’ then suggestions like these need to be dealt with in a transparent manner.“I have already written to both the Health Secretary and the First Minister to make this point, and to seek clarity on what consideration is being given to a more localised approach for the islands.  It is important that all options to tackling the coronavirus remain on the table during this unprecedented time.”Mr Carmichael added: “I hope that the Scottish Government will engage with these proposals seriously. That engagement must, however, also include close cooperation and discussion with local communities to ensure public confidence in safety.“This is not a plan that can be run centrally. Local input and know-how is key and islanders should be at the heart of how we translate these proposals into action.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Mr Russell’s comments come in the wake of the First Minister’s announcement of an expansion of testing.Following the exchange, Mr McArthur said: “There is an increasing level of public interest in the proposals put forward by Professor Pennington and Dr Allyson Pollock in recent weeks that the islands could start to ease lockdown restrictions sooner than mainland Scotland.“Such a strategy could only be adopted, however,a rigorous and extensive system of testing, tracing and isolating was firmly established. The First Minister’s announcement today of a further expansion of testing perhaps paves the way for such a system being put in place.“Public safety, of course, remains the priority and must underpin any decision taken in relation to how and when restrictions are eventually lted. That is true of our island communities as it is other parts of the country.“However, ministers must not discount possible options without proper consideration. I therefore welcome Mr Russell’s assurances that the government will engage actively and constructively in the debate about whether and how our islands might safely take the lead.“This is unlikely to lead to any quick decisions, not least as the stakes are so high. It is encouraging, however, that Ministers are prepared to keep an open mind over the coming week.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Until late last year, a suitable vessel proved dficult to source, said the council.It then became known that the Nordic Sea, which operated on a number of passenger routes in the far north of Norway, had become available.Following visits and sea trials involving Orkney Marine Services and Orkney Ferries staff, the vessel was considered as a suitable replacement for the Golden Mariana.As the Nordic Sea was operating under a Norwegian Passenger Certicate, it was known that a number of requirements would have to be met before she was considered ready for a UK passenger certicate.With surveys now completed and a works list developed, the decision to complete the purchase was made and the vessel departed Bergen for Orkney yesterday morning, Thursday.On arrival, the vessel was handed over to Orkney Islands Council, but due to Covid- restrictions and the need for some works to be carried out to bring her up to the full UK Classication and Certication, it will be a while yet before the residents of Papa Westray are able to benefit from their new passenger ferry.The purchase of the new vessel was part funded by the Scottish Government and Transport Scotland.More details in The Orcadian Marine Scene section next week.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This technology exists. If we simply used the electricity to generate hydrogen, and store it just like the old city gas, we can run all our power needs through hydrogen fuel cells. Simple, cheap and clean. Or we could let global heating destroy our children#s future because nobody wants to see a big windmill near their property. I#m old enough not to care.To give a hand to each.#To leave the oyster-bed.#The sun#s shining here and like the old oyster, I can#t be bothered, either, John. Have a nice evening, do.Love it, thanks JT 🙂No real need for fuel cells. Hydrogen was % of coal gas, can be stored in gasometers and burnt in gas fires and used to power piston engines, gas turbines and most conventional heating systems. A hell of a lot cleaner than burning wood chip. Now forget the windfarms, obsolete technology, use tidal generation and mini modular nuclear.That way we will have a living planet worth saving, not a mass of concrete, steel and fibreglass.I#m not sure windfarms are quite obsolete yet# with the technology that is available at scale onshore wind is the cheapest source of new electricity. Perhaps not on peat bogs though. That#s not to say we can#t do better with other renewables.PS circa Dads Army, I am not that old!!!At  dollars a barrel so called renewables will need to reduce costs by a huge margin to compete with oil. At the current oil price of less that  dollars a barrel wind, tidal and solar no hope.Renewable energy is not produced in barrels. Where did you hear that We continue to burn oil and gas because the infrastructure is there and the investment has been made. But when it comes to investing in new electricity generation, onshore wind is the cheapest. Also # I am not sure how such a low price is beneficial to the oil industry what with their high fixed costs As a patriotic Brit I am all for us standing on our own two feet and generating cheap and reliable energy. Shetland aside, as a nation we are net importers of oil and gas. Why rely on the likes of Russia or our Middle Eastern friends when we can spend that money at home and have jobs for Brits producing clean and plentul energy  Let#s stop living in the s. Let#s have clean, reliable British energy instead.I tend to lean in the direction indicated by John Thomas.For reasons of cheapness , safety and reliability I can’t see why wind and tidal forces should not be the primary options for energy generation. Winds are unlikely to stop blowing and sea tides are unlikely to dry up , so how can they not be major considerations Nuclear power is also in the running provided that the associated risks can be accepted. No matter what the no doubt wellintended may suggest, there ARE risks which do not raise their ugly heads with wind and water. Reliable , sustainable , and non polluting. What more could one ask for in this struggling , changed 🌎 world we occupy for a short time. Now Thorium nuclear is clean, no long half-le isotopes produced and no danger of meltdown.They are also neither cheap or reliable. Back up will also be requiredfor when the sun doesn#t shine or the wind isn#t suitable at more expense. More renewables will inevitably contribute to increased fuel poverty.Michael Moore # Planet of the Humans # a documentaryon the renewable energy scam that the left want banned # who would have thought !The more you look into the problem of energy supply against saving the environment, the more contradictory conclusion one gains. Wind and Solar maybe cleaner, but how much land and natural habitat being destroyedwould be required to power a city of several million##.and this is just  city     What energy source would be required alsothere are days of no sun or no wind. What backup technology would be in place, and would this also be clean energy  It seems ironically disturbing that cleaner energy through wind and solar, would also have a negative impact on the environmentyou take into consideration the polluting processes involved in the manufacturing of such devices.as well as the huge amount of land required , which would also be expanding as the population grows. I would assess cleaner energy via wind and solar would have a larger impact on the natural eco-systems and the environment and would still be reliant on fossil fuels. As far as I can see, disturbing as it may be, the only source for future energy demand is to go nuclear.And no , I am not a pessimistI’m a wary realist.Better than a blinkered optimist.Nuclear Energy does have its dangerous pitfalls, but we are already using this technology to generate electricity. I believe % of our electricity is produced by nuclear power  In France I believe this to be much higher  Although it may be dficult to assess the impact of solar or wind generators on the environment on a large scale, it would have to be balanced between the use of such technology to this of the environmental and eco-systems which maybe affected.I do not know how much land would be required to provide electricity to a city of several million, but I would hazard a guess it would be quite considerable  This use would also have to compete with farming and agriculture not to mention living space for housing etc etc.  from the shore would these wind turbines be  I suspect it would be quite close  Will our seashores be lined up with thousands of wind turbines I would also suspect the cost of such a scenario would be very high in adoption and maintenance.lol Hayden. Disturbing as it may be, I do not think we will have much option but to go nuclear. If it were a case of saving the environment and eco-systems, one may not have any choice We are already using this technology to produce electricity, andit is the case of minimizing our impact on the environment and eco-systems, then nuclear maybe the only way Cleaner energy may be, morally, more suited, but one must also take into consideration the impact on the environment and eco-systems and how this may change towards a negative once we realize the full influence of this compared to the potential benefits I cannot give any answers to what a large scale wind or solar scheme would be to power several millions homes, but I would suspect it would be considerably large in land area  One could use the same land for agriculture and farming and possibly housing  Shetland is suited for wind generating power schemes, but what would be the benefits to this of tourism, bird populations and property values, not to mention the visual impact of those people living near to such schemes and the consistent vibrating noise.Agriculture, farming and housing would not be adversely affected.

But with no likelihood of visitors coming to our place anytime soon, there is something slightly morose and sad about making the buildings and cabins look neat, well maintained and tidy.It all seems a bit soulless and Marie Celeste-like with no guests.While being locked down at home, being busy, fixing and decorating, and even dare I say it, having a good time with family, there is an emerging sense of frustration, even perhaps inadequacy.Others are out there being essential, being key workers and worthwhile, ‘fighting’ the virus, supporting the vulnerable, while I….make a patio.I think for many people, there is a need to feel useful, and it is perhaps why for me the motorbike ride is so important.While there is nothing heroic about delivering a few medicines, it gets me out of the house # we might have a big cabin, but it still induces a fever.Being part of a support network and involved in helping the community works both ways and fulfils a very real need in those helping.Perhaps everybody wants to feel essential.We can laud the NHS staff, care workers, shop assistants and delivery drivers, but no one is going to clap for the furloughed hospitality workers and idle outdoor instructors.As a volunteer, however, we can all feel that we are doing our bit.There is a huge grey area surrounding the concept of key worker and essential.At first glance, it may seem obvious as to who is key # doctors, nurses, carers and the like but then there are the people who support them.Key workers need paid, so require office staff. They need fed, so also use food shops.They need to get to work, so are likely to drive a vehicle, so they need fuel. Andthe car breaks down, they will need a mechanic.They need water and electricity and the internet, and might also need a treat delivered from a mail order company during their well-deserved down time.Then there are the people who support the people who support the people who support…and so on.And so there emerges a whole network of service providers, businesses large and small # a web of commerce and production.In order to provide for the frontline, a whole system of interrelated businesses exists, many which might not appear to be essential, but may provide a key element, a small cog in the big picture.In the short term key workers can perhaps get by, but society shouldn’t allow its critical people to just muddle through, as the lockdown period extends, then the need for this support becomes more evident and relevant, and so the web of essentiality widens.As more roles, jobs and links in society are realised and considered necessary, and indispensability spreads, recreation and tourism won’t get much of a look in.We could argue that people need to visit the Old Man of Storr for our economic well-being as much as for their own health and well-being, but for the time being the beds and hot spots will remain empty.So, in order to be relevant and useful, we should perhaps look to our other skills.If tourism is our only income then we have to be creative, not only to make provision but to keep spirit and self-actualisation alive.Economically,tourism is a second income, the icing on the salaried or pensioned cake, then perhaps we just take the hit, and revert back to a less affluent lestyle.Many tourist providers left skills and talents in a previous le, perhaps now is the time to revisit and reimagine those skills.As I understand it, Skye is still waiting.Perhaps by the time this column is online, the virus will be more evident, during this waiting game now more than ever we need to be physically distant, and careful with how we operate.But it is crucial that we also need to look after our mental health and well-being, and so delivering the prescriptions is really as important to volunteer as it is for the receiver.Humans are a social animal, and we need to be part of a community, because we are all essential.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/norrie-grandfather.jpg","title":"norrie t macdonald the cycle of the sea and island traditions of the","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineAlthough Shinigeadh was our training pool as youngstersand probably today seems quite safe and relatively innocuous it was also my first introduction to the concept of ‘industrial’ fishing.was strictly for deployment only by the stronger adults.It consisted of a stf polefrom which was slung a netted hoop, around - feet in diameter.It was to our mini-bamboo rods, what the Broch purse-seiner was to the Scalpay ring-netter.There had obviously been a couple of nights where our amateur, one-at-a-time, efforts to procure a decent supper had been insufficient to adequately harvest the bounty on offer.I remember the bodach and both the uncles appearing with the borrowed ‘poc’, intrigued as to what purpose it could possibly serve.’.A couple of pocketfuls of just-about-right, newly boiled, potatoes were the secret weapon.The cuddies scattered as the ‘poc’ got lowered into the sea.Crushing a potato into small pieces and scattering on the surface elicited a frenzy of activity.The timing of the hauling of the ‘poc’ was crucial.A miss, and you could maybe only land a couple.A full hit and you might struggle to lt it out of the water at all, requiring a re-submersion.This could result in losing the lot, the elusive cuddy being much quicker than the second haul.It took the knotting of the legs and sleeves of one of the standard, adult, blue boiler suits to make a receptacle big enough to take that night’s catch home.It was the first time I observed the tradition of the ‘share’.Walking back through the village, it was like we were expected.Several caileachs came to their gate with a basin, each the recipient of half a dozen dozen fish, dependent on their familysize.It was a tradition Iain ‘Scud’ MacLeod, George ‘Baba’ Richards and myself continued as we graduated onto the big bamboo in Bayble School.They were my fishing buddies as we moved onto the next level in our adventures.The full bamboo rod required technique and balance.Especially when we moved further afield onto the more dficult fishing hot-spots. every night.We were careful not to take the prime spots lest we got a mouthful, but we were tutored and encouraged, warned about any pitfalls and certainly well chaperoned for our own education and safety.We moved further up towards the Tiumpan where the rocks were more daunting, each climb steeper and requiring a working knowledge of the way down.With a -foot pole and in wellies.’ were the favourites, not too tricky a climb and with deep water just off the inside-point. were reserved for night when we felt particularly brave or even simply when they hadn’t been claimed by the adults.They were prime locations, great fishing spots, but generally could only accommodate a single rod.’ were up at the Tiumpan itself and required the right combination of tides and prevailing wind to be accessible, safe and productive. .The big rod came with several dferent options.The flywhich mimicked sand eels, consisted of usually three, four or six hooks, depending on what you were after .It could be deployed with, or without, a weight on the end.’was an issue.In the deeper water, a ‘dandy’ was best. This involved far less effort, a simple up and down motion of the tip of the rod producing plentul yields.’, basin outstretched, every night we caught more than was our fill.We also, as we got more adventurous, took to a bigger, single, hook and a longer, single trace .Barring this, a rubber eel.We were moving up from cuddy to lythe.What a fright the first one gave me!Two pulls of almighty force, then ‘I give up’.Deadweight.The sense of yet another ‘graduation’ was palpable, but the lythe was no grand fighting fish.It marked another progression up whatever the fishing ‘ladder’ was.By this time we were regulars in the town and had had our introduction to Meg’s ‘Electro Sports’ shop.He had, to our limited experience anyway, a huge assortment of rods and tackle for us to gawp at.Naturally, we moved up to spinning rods, monofilament, lures, kosters and paternosters., in competitions to see who could be the first to ,  or even .Traumatised for an hour or so, they would get ed to the water as the sun began to set.With spinning rods we learned a completely dferent set of rules.What was deep  yards out and what was disaster for your tackle.How to tie a proper knot and which kit worked best for the conditions.How to unravel a reel-tangle with three mackerel on the line .The cost of losing gear was beginning to hit the pocket-money hard.The only real solution was to get better at making your own.You learned how to make your own trace # downy seagull feathers were better, but not as practical as sheep’s wool # and how to tie knots that never ‘slipped’.Graduating onto more ‘specialist’ fish and fishing became a challenge after years of cuddies, mackerel and lythe.Fancier bait lugworm, real sand eel, salted herring even, were meant to be great to entice the bottom feeders flounder, sole, gurnard, possibly haddock and lingyou could reach with a long cast.Ok, so we mostly caught dogfish and, like every single other thing we pulled up, handling one came with its own set of rules.Mackerel have a nasty wee ‘sting’ in front of their anal fin, a small protrusion of cartilage bone which can catch the unwary out.Gurnard require welding gloves and a lesser-spotted dogfish will try to wrap its tail around your arm and give you a nasty ‘Chinese burn’.Rub your fingers against the ‘grain’ of one’s scales next time you see one.It’s like rough sandpaper.Everyone’s ambition, however, was to get out on one of the village boats.We had grown up with Roddy Alec and ‘Saight’, the last proper village fishermen who plied their trade on the ‘Fisher Lass’ out of Portnaguran.The ‘Fisher Lass’ was a substantial wooden boat, somewhere between the privately owned ‘rowing’ boats # each one now had a Seagull, Mariner or Evinrude rather than rely on such menial propulsion # and the commercial trawlers.Hers was a serious purpose we just wanted some fun.Whilst the rocks could disappoint, we were brought up with the notion that being a quarter mile offshore must come with an assurance of plenty.There were boats on the Portvoller side as well.The trick was, in the absence of having a boat in the family, knowing someone who did and whose father uncle was prepared to take responsibility for you for a couple of hours.Three a side, with mackerel or herring running, was huge entertainment.It was, necessitated by space and safety, ato hand lines again and a degree of ‘back to basics’ which felt very raw..A fish meal factory, dependent mostly on locally caught sand eels, but which handled mackerel and pout when available it could stink out the entire town given the right conditions.My father would come home, not entirely fragrant, and I would rush to get the folded-up daily paper from his lunch box.There were days, especially in the height of summer, when I couldn’t get beyond the back page .Little did I realise, until many years later, the destruction caused by overfishing of the type to assault the senses so violently..Barryhad procurement of his uncle’s boat and we made an anchor out of an old engine, attached a buoy and plastic ring, then ran yds of mm, in a loop, to the shore.The rest, you might say, is piracy.All good fun until the fishery cruiser, possibly the ‘Minna’, I couldn’t comment, came along one morning and confiscated the net, cod ‘n’ all.Now this could have been a delicious irony.I referred last week to the passing down of genes through the generations.The son and ‘heir to fresh air’ was never a guy to show his hand early, certainly not while in school.We had no clue what career path he would decide on, his head, whilst not always in proximity, wascertainly edging closer to the clouds.“I’m going to sea Da, to do marine engineering”, he one day boldly announced.Luckily, no one had a feather handy.And that’s what he did.He qualied as a ship’s engineer.It shouldn’t have been too hard to figure out where this notion came from, however., MacIver was the Chief Engineeron the old Fishery Protection Vessel, “Minna”.It is indeed a tangled web.Years later I ended up, standing on several fish boxes in the mart in Stornoway, as a fish-salesman.In my apprenticeship, under George Prince Jnr, we oversaw the landing of tens of thousands of tonnes of sand eels to HBP.The fishery was devastated, almost entirely, by local vessels and a couplefrom Barra.But while the smell was awful, the money was fantastic for all those involved.As the years progressed, the main catch moved from fish to prawns.I could tell the dference between a dab, a plaice, a brill, a turbot, a halibut, a megrim and a witch, but saw increasinglyless and less of them each year.My good pal Stuart Keyte – the local fishery officer # and I bought a small, Orkney origin, ‘clinker’-built -footer to work some creels and have a bit of ploy.You can get used to two lobsters for breakfast.But only for a wee while.Despite HBP closing down and the fishery banned, the knock-on effects of overfishing, several stocks over several decades, were beginning to take their toll.I could go to the rocks for nights on end and catch nothing.As it was, I ended up on the rocks anyway.A spell clam fishing with John Murdo ‘Easdaidh’ MacLeod was my swan song.I loved it.We left the harbour every day at am and headed for, guess where Correct, the Tiumpan.As day broke we would haul the six dredges and he would get the frying pan on whilst I sorted the catch.I could see the lights in my house going on from half a mile at sea .We had two rolls each and a cup of coffee.A huge scallop, bacon, black-pudding and fried egg on each .“If they fit through the handle of the basket, throw them over” was the rule of thumb.I’m guessing we could have been inside ‘the limit’.I’ve never fished a Loch nor a river.Not remotely interested.Given my track record, I’d have probably used a bit of dynamite, certainly a bit of mono.Just for dramatic effect.Mother Nature, left to her own devices, is a truly wonderful thing.Stocks will, eventually, recover and, managed properly could give sustainable employment for years to come.Maybe even endless fun for kids who have got too accustomed and fed up, paralysed even, from the catatonic effects of lockdown.Remember what Dougie said to Para Handy ‘The herring in Loch Fyne comes in cycles’‘Ach man’, replied Macfarlane, ‘There wass herring in the Loch long afore the cycle was inventit’.Everything goes around folks.Remember it when you contemplate your next move.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/EARIE-QUIRAING-5.jpg","title":"litir do luchd ionnsachaidh an gobha ruadh agus domhnall an oir","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine..

We must test, trace and isolate to stop this virus spreading.”Last Friday the Scottish Government promised enhanced outbreak investigation measures at all care homes where there are cases of Covid- – including making testing available to all care home residents and staff, whether or not they have symptoms.A mobile testing unit, manned by the army, was set up in Broadford yesterday .Kate Forbes, the Scottish Finance Secretary and MSP for Ross, Skye and Badenoch, said she expected “full testing of care homes in Skye to be carried out”.She added: “I firmly believe that the local community should be treated with respect and informed about the scale of the Covid outbreak.“This affects friends, relatives and colleagues and so it is only right that people are given accurate and comprehensive information. I expect full testing of care homes in Skye to be carried out.“I am unaware of the situation alluded to by the worker who had to inform colleagues by email.#In light of the outbreak at Home Farm, I firmly believe that the local population deserve the full truth and public health agencies have been transparent about the situation.“This should continue as we all try and limit transmission of the virus any further.”Meanwhile, MP Ian Blackford urged people “not to drop our guard” against the virus.He said: “The spread of the virus in the Highlands has been relatively limited until now, although we certainly have got to make sure that we continue to protect people here.“A place like the Isle of Skye has a large percentage of elderly people.“In my own district the over- are  per cent of the population. We must make sure that we continue to respect the lockdown and continue to do the right things.”Mr Blackford repeated his previous call for holiday-home owners to stay away.He added: “I know this is a beautul area but my message to those will think about coming on holiday here and to second-home owners is please respect the challenges that we face.“You’ll always be welcome in the Highlands when it’s right to welcome people back, but not now.“Don’t think about coming over the course of the next few weeks and months while we battle this invisible killer.“We’re nowhere near through this.

Otherwise they could have bill shocks and in the worst case could be left in debt as their payments do not cover the higher consumption.”He continued: “Recent usage reports indicate that households are using around a fth more energy as they stay at home during the lockdown.

However, cafés and restaurants will reopen under phase three, from June .Pub representatives Licensed Vintners# Associationand the Vintners# Federation of Irelandhave now joined forces to urge the Irish Government to put forward pub reopening datespublicans follow strict measures.The measures are:Dispense-only bars, with no sitting, standing, ordering, payment or drinking at the bar itself.Customers will be seated at tables at all times, with table service provided.No more than four people per every  square metres a maximum of six people allowed at one tableHand sanitiser used before entry, with staff washing hands every half hourOutdoor spaces must enhance social distancingNo live music or DJ and the safe use of toilets, which may include limits on the number of customers using them at one time.Gardaí or the Health Service Executive will have the power to close any business flouting the public health guidelines.The LVA and the VFI believe that under these strict guidelines, pubs should be allowed to reopen on June  instead of August .We don#t believe it is in any way appropriate that the Government should apply one rule for some hospitality businesses and another rule for others, said Donall O#Keeffe, chief executive of the LVA.He said that trading will be extremely dficult under these new guidelines and that the pub experience will drastically change.We are making a series of radical proposals to how bars should operate for the reopening scenario.Trading will be extremely dficult under these circumstances.There is no doubt that the pub experience as we know it will have to change dramatically.However, for those who want to trade, these measures will have the essential impact of protecting the health and wellbeing of staff and customers alike, Mr O#Keeffe said.Chief executive of the VFI Padraig Cribben said that the roadmap as it stands is not tenable.The public health restrictions will present real challenges to all hospitality venues, it doesn#t matterthey are a pub, a restaurant, a cafe or a hotel, he said.There is no denying that and there is no getting around it.Addressing those public health requirements will be necessary for all hospitality businesses whenever they reopen.Pubs across Ireland are up to that challenge and will do what is required for maintaining a safe and healthy place of business.He added that the two groups hoped to meet minister this week.Many pubs in Ireland closed their doors at the outset of the coronavirus emergency, before even being instructed to by the Government, amid concerns over social distancing.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Schools here have been closed to all children, except those of key workers and those classied as vulnerable, since March  as part of national efforts to stem the spread of the coronavirus.In the Republic, schools were closed by March .On Friday night, the Irish Government outlined its road map for reopening society and businesses across the country in a slow and phased manner, beginning on May .The plan sets out five stages for unlocking restrictions at three week intervals, but schools will remain closed until September.As the Executive this week considers its approach to exiting the lockdown, First Minister Arlene Foster told yesterday#s daily Stormont briefing that she could not saythere was a possibility of schools opening before September.The DUP leader said schools cannot be reopened in isolation from everything  as it would have a knock on impact on people in work, childcare, transport and other areas.It is part of the whole plan that the Executive is working on, Mrs Foster said.Deputy First Minister Michelle O#Neill added that schools would be affected by continued social distancing.However, Michael Allen, principal of Lisneal College in the Waterside area of Londonderry, said more political direction is needed.Mr Allen said: We need some clarity from government, even just a proposal of whether it#s going to be June or October - something needs to be spelt out for us to consult on.If the plan is to reopen prior to the end of the current academic year, then we would need some outline of what the science is around that.My major concern is thatthe government get it wrong and there is a second wave, it could totally disrupt another academic year.We are trying to calculate grades for Years  to  at the moment andwe were to have another lockdown from September to Christmas, for example, that could prove even more challenging for a cohort of pupils who would have two years disrupted.Justin McCamphill, NASUWT national official for Northern Ireland, also believes that the ongoing speculation around when schools here might reopen is unhelpful.The NASUWT has already issued five conditions to the government to consider around theof schools - including a demand that teachers have access to personal protective equipment , including face masks, gloves and aprons where appropriate.The only valid decision can be made when the public health advice is that it is safe to do so, Mr McCamphill said.That is not the case at the minute and I don#t see it being so in the foreseeable future.While the Republic of Ireland is looking towards the beginning of September, it#s possible that the Executive may go for the same date.But it is not necessarily the case that everything will be back to normal by then and the government will have to factor in issues around social distancing and PPE provision for teachers.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

There#s nothing to keep you motivated apart from the thought of the funds being raised. There#s not another village coming up, not a mountain top to look down from.I#ve a pain in my left leg I#ve never had before, and getting across the finish line and getting to sit down with a beer is going to be the best feeling ever.It#s all about the money raised for Trocaire.

All Mike asks for inis a small donation to the NHS as healthcare staff fight Covid-.How to NOT go to school has since been translated by teachers in Italy, France, Germany and Holland, while another version has also been translated by British Sign Language.Teachers from as far as Mexico and New Zealand also got in touch with Mike, who said he never expected the response to be as great.It#s just incredible to see this little book go so far, said Mike, who left Northern Ireland to study at St Andrew#s University in Scotland in . It#s really nice because my class can see their class mascot - PomPom the ninja - become famous which is wonderful.We#re raising a bit of money for the NHS as well which is a good outcome. It#s just brilliant.An Italian school teacher wanted to give it to their kids so she#s translated it. Lots of people seem to want to contribute and help which is amazing.I sent it to my old French teaching assistant, who now teaches as an English teacher in France, and she was saying that it has gotten really big there. There#s lots of English teachers in France sharing it with their pupils to help learn English which is really fun.Each chapter explores a dferent issue children may be experiencing during lockdown, interwoven with Parsley#s adventures with her brother Po, their nanny goats and an eclectic group of imaginary friends.After Mike first wrote the story he contacted artist Sarah Beswick and professional illustrator Rebecca Sampson, who created the drawings for the book.Reflecting on his first thoughts for the story, Mike, who is married to Rebekah, explained that he wanted to help the parents of his pupils use it as a tool to discuss mental health and wellbeing.I knew the lockdown was going to be an enormous upheaval and I wanted to give them a way where they could openly talk about mental health and deal with those issues, he stated.The style is a bit like all of the books that we have been reading in class, such as the Philip Reeve and David Walliams books.I enjoy writing. I do it for fun and sometimes I share it with the children in class, but I have never had anything published or anything like that so it#s incredible.It was just shared online and Facebook has done the rest.Fans have already asked for a sequel, perhaps looking at how children can go back to school once the lockdown is over, but Mike hopes he can get How to NOT go to school published first.When askedwriting children#s books is something he could see himself doing full-time, Mike added: I love teaching and I want to keep teaching, but it would be amazing to write as well and be published.The ideal would be able to do both of them but we#ll seethat#s possible.To download How to NOT go to school, visit parsleymimblewood.wordpressBelfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Andrew MaddenTwitterEmailMay   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailA £m funding package for the north west has been hailed as potentially transformational for the region#s economy.On Monday, the Executive agreed to match UK Government funding for the Londonderry and Strabane City Deal and Inclusive Future Funds.This brings the total cash injection for the region to £m, which will be aimed at creating jobs, improving infrastructure and boosting economic growth.SDLP leader Colum Eastwood MP said he hopes some of the money will go towards the expansion of Ulster University#s Magee campus in Derry.Investing in skills and providing our talented young people with the opportunity to live, work and set down roots here is essential to building sustainable communities that thrive, he added.“This has been a long time coming. We have been forced to wait for far too long for the chance to build more for our people and our communities. Now that we’ve secured the potential of the City Deal, we can’t take our foot off the pedal. We need to turn the page on the years of neglect and under-investment by expanding our university, investing in our young people and delivering new opportunities.” Foyle DUP MLA Gary Middleton said the funding will progress some key projects in the area, such as the Maritime Museum at Ebrington, the Walled City Experience and the redevelopment of Queens Quay.The DUP ensured that City Deals were part of the confidence and supply agreement in  with the aim of ensuring that all of Northern Ireland benefited. The additional funding for all City Deals announced today is welcome news during this dficult time. I particularly want to put on record my thanks to my party colleagues within the Executive and all parties who worked collectively with all of the key stakeholders over the past few years to get this over the line. This is a signicant step forward.”Sinn Fein MLA Martina Anderson said the package was transformative for the entire north west region.“Following years of unrelenting Tory austerity which has deprived Derry, Strabane and the wider region of much-needed public services and investment, we can see the clear benefits of having a local Executive in place, she said.“Crucial to this has been the role of Sinn Fein Finance Minister Conor Murphy and his determination to ensure that this administration redresses regional inequalities by investing where it is required.“While we will always have much to do, particularly in the face of a global pandemic crisis, this funding and last week’s rescue package for City of Derry Airport will be central to our economic recovery when the crisis has ended.“It will also be fundamental to ensuring we realise the vast economic potential of the entire north west region in the longer term.”Finance Minister Conor Murphy has also announced funding packages for other Northern Ireland regions, including £m for the Belfast region , £m for the Mid, South and West, and £ million for Causeway Coast and Glens.Belfast Related ContentAnalysisJohn SimpsonOpinionRunning out of reasons why Northern Ireland needs more financial aidNorthern Ireland Executive ministers face a continuing critical assessment from UK ministers and the Treasury.

FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappActors Paddy Jenkins and Damon Quinn join family and friends to raise a toast outside Roselawn Cemetery in Belfast as the hearse arrives during the funeral of actor BJ Hogg. By Ivan LittleMay   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailThe cast of the hit TV comedy Give My Head Peace yesterday raised a socially-distanced glass and gave a fond farewell round of applause to the actor BJ Hogg, who created one of the show#s most popular characters and who died last week.Observing coronavirus restrictions at his funeral, BJ#s friends and colleagues stayed well apart as they sipped their own small measures of Black Bush whiskey, the actor#s favourite tipple.The Hole in the Wall gang had been joined at a Lisburn funeral home by some other well-known actors and technicians who had worked with BJ throughout his illustrious career on stage and on screen.The star of The Fall TV series and the Oscar-nominated short movie Dance Lexie Dance died suddenly last week on his th birthday.His costume designer we Elish and their children Nathan and Abigail watched as his coffin was brought from the funeral parlour to a waiting hearse.Nathan had posted a video online of his father singing a powerful song from the Ulster Scots musical On Eagle#s Wing, and he added a message saying: Love you Dad. What a Voice.There were lighter moments on social media too. Some fans of BJ#s alter ego from Give My Head Peace , Big Mervyn, the dim-witted loyalist, wonderedhe would get a paramilitary-style funeral anda service would be conducted by the show#s fundamentalist Protestant cleric, Pastor Begbie.In the end there was no funeral service but Paddy Jenkins, the actor who plays Pastor Begbie, was among the mourners at the funeral home, along with other GMHP performers including Tim McGarry, Michael McDowell, Damon Quinn, Dan Gordon, Alexandra Ford and Marty Reid, who plays Big Mervyn#s sidekick, Uncle Andy.BBC floor manager Stephen Killen was also there, as were Game of Thrones star Ian McElhinney and his playwright we Marie Jones and actors Alan McKee and Marty Maguire.En route to Roselawn Crematorium, the hearse stopped briefly outside BJ#s old boyhood home in Westbourne Terrace, Lisburn.Some of the GMPH team went on to stand at the gates of Roselawn as BJ#s hearse arrived for cremation.No one is currently allowed inside the church there due to the Covid- crisis.Paddy Jenkins, who also worked with BJ on On Eagle#s Wing, reflected on a dficult day.He said: It was heartbreaking to realise that BJ#s loved ones didn#t get the chance to say a proper farewell. But the times we are living in mean nothing is the way it is supposed to be.There mightn#t have been a normal funeral for BJ today, but I know the family and all of us are determined that he will eventually get the sort of thanksgiving service that he so richly deserves once the current coronavirus emergency eases.

Adele Heaney has been working in the Covid- centre at the Mater Hospital in Belfast after being redeployed from the Royal Victoria Hospital to combat the outbreak. The Dungiven native recently featured in a BBC documentary called ‘First Time Doctors’ that revealed the realities of le as a recent graduate on a busy hospital ward. “The purpose of the show was to get an insight to what it’s like being a doctor for the first time and the trials and tribulations of le inside and outside of work,” she told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “So many people just see the doctor and that side of things, so the show was quite nice as it showed a bit of le outside work. “Everyone has had that experience of being the ‘newbie’ in the job and having to learn how to do things in a fast-moving environment. “It was daunting having cameras following you around but the thing that we wanted to show was what it is like for us as doctors.” Coming the end of her second year as a doctor, Adele has found herself thrust onto the frontline of the worst pandemic since the  Spanish Flu which killed an estimated  million people. googletag.cmd.push Adele has pleaded with the public not to become complacent and praised the vocal support that has come from the #ClapForCarers campaign on Thursday nights. “The first week they did that I was very emotional, to be honest,” said Adele. “When you’re in the hospital and you’re doing a dficult job, having tough conversations and seeing people pass away, it’s nice to see people appreciate the sacrices you are making. “The public have been trying to do their best to go by what the guidelines have been telling us – social distancing and staying indoors. We have to keep going with what we’ve been told. “Everybody in the community has their part to play. Your part might just be staying in the house but that is so, so important to flatten the curve and for us to beat this together. “We’ve seen the news reports from Wuhan and Italy, and we’ve seen how devastating the disease can be, so it’s important that we protect ourselves to protect other people.” While tackling the pandemic represents a ‘steep learning curve’ Adele points out that all healthcare staff are coming from a similar position. She said: “Lots of my senior colleagues who have been in the profession for over  years have never experienced anything like this. “I don’t think there is anything in training that really can prepare you. We’ve had to adapt quite quickly to a new style of working. “Coming into work and wearing a mask all the time has been dficult, but we have some amazing senior colleagues who we’ve been able to learn from. “It’s been dficult whenever we’ve had to make phone calls to families about their relatives who are really unwell, you’re not able to have those face-to-face reactions like you normally would. “Learning on the job has been hard, but it’s very humbling to be part of that and to be there for their family members when they aren’t able to be.” Born and bred at the foot of Benbradagh, Adele has already set her sights on a speedywhen the coronavirus threat finally eases. “To be honest, the thing I’m looking forward to the most is being able to come back home to Dungiven and be able to see my family and my boyfriend again,” she said. “It is very dficult when you’re doing this when you are so far from home. We have this persona of doctor but when we come home from work, we like the same things as everyone . “People have made sacrices of moving out of their family homes and not seeing their children or husbands or wives, so people are looking forward to being reunited with their families. “That contact with people is probably the thing I’m looking forward to most, as I’m sure most people are.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

At the weekend, the Irish government outlined its roadmap for reopening society and business. The British government is set to publish its plans this Sunday. Speaking at today’s COVID- press conference First Minister Arlene Foster said the NI Executive is working ‘actively’ on its plan and continues to make progress. She said people would be ‘anxious’ to know of NI’s plan but cautioned that social distancing measures are ‘likely to be with us for some time’.

She went on to say that people ‘cannot afford to be lax’ and act like coronavirus has been beaten as it still ‘poses a threat to you and those you love’. Restrictions won’t be kept in place any longer than is necessary, she concluded. Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill said any approach must be ‘cautious and gradual’ as COVID- is still spreading and taking lives. She asked the public not to take matters into their own hands. The plan will be published as soon as possible, ‘hopefully later this week’. Any plan is ‘not a green light’ for people to do as they choose as the Executive is looking at the safest possible approach, the Deputy First Minister added.

Elected representatives from across the north west have called on the Executive to sign off on a medical school at Magee and match funding for Derry’s City Deal. The Executive will meet today and SDLP MLA Sinead McLaughlin today said that with three weeks to get it over the line it must be top of their agenda. “I urge all Executive Ministers to make a call this week. Let’s get it done, together,” she added. googletag.cmd.push An Ulster University spokesperson stated that it is steadfast in its commitment to establishing a Graduate Entry Medical School in a bid to address the challenges of a healthcare system at breaking point, and to future proof care provision across Northern Ireland. “The University’s completed Outline Business Case was submitted to the Department of Health on st October and we are hopeful that it will be reviewed by the Minister as soon as possible. “We continue to work with the General Medical Council to gain full accreditation. The GMC’s Stage  process can only be completed when it recommends progression to Stage , and that is only possible when a funding decision is confirmed. googletag.cmd.push “To complete the next stages with the GMC in preparation and readiness for a  intake of students, confirmation of a funding commitment is required by the end of May.” The department of health is readying its own business case for medical expansion in Northern Ireland but gave no assurances that a medical school will be based in Derry. Meanwhile, another government department, that for the economy, has told the Derry News that Ulster University’s business case for expansion to , full-time students requires ‘signicant work’. Long-running plans for a medical school at Ulster University’s Magee campus have been plagued by set-backs. A revised timeline targeted student enrolment in . The Derry News asked the department whether it expects the medical school to be approved and for medical students to enrol at Magee next year. In response, a Department of Health spokesperson said: “The establishment of a Graduate Entry Medical School is one of the priorities of the restored Executive in New Decade, New Approach. “The Department of Health has been clear that there are two separate business case processes in relation to the development of a Graduate Entry Medical School. “The first process, which has been under way since , has involved signicant assistance from departmental officials on the development of Ulster University’s own business case. “Ulster University has been grateful for this assistance, which has ensured that their business case meets the standards within government financial guidance.” He added: “The second process is the development of the Department of Health’s own business case which will outline the need to be addressed by any expansion of medical education. “That business case will be formally submitted to the Minister very shortly. It will be appreciated that the department’s immediate and overriding priority has been the local response to the Coronavirus pandemic. “The Department of Health must ensure that any proposal represents value for money for health and social care. It is for the Executive to collectively decide on the best approach for Northern Ireland as a whole.” COMMITMENTS There was renewed optimism in January of this year when a deal was agreed by Northern Ireland’s political parties to restore devolved government three years after it collapsed. The New Decade, New Approach document contains firm commitments to a Magee Medical School from both the British and Irish governments. It states: “The Executive will expand university provision at Magee in line with commitments made by the previous Executive, including through the establishment of a Graduate Entry Medical School.” Furthermore, under the section outlining the UK government’s financial and economic commitments to Northern Ireland it says: “Capital and resource funding for the Medical School in Derry subject to the Northern Ireland Executive’s approval of the project.” While the Irish government adds that it is ‘willing in principle to contribute to capital investment to support expanded provision at Ulster University Magee Campus, alongside the commitment made as part of this agreement by the UK Government.’ The commitment made by the previous Executive was for , full-time students at Magee. In   there were , full-time students enrolled at Magee – , overall. Five years previous,  , there were , full-time enrolments – , overall. In a statement to the Derry News, spokesperson for the Department for the Economysaid it is committed to engaging with Ulster University regarding expansion of its Magee campus, including taking account of priorities set out in New Decade, New Approach. “The university confirmed in correspondence to the Department in September  that it has remained committed to securing expansion of its Magee campus, and at the same time confirmed that the business case required updating prior to any consideration by the Department or Executive. “The Department also recognises, however, that the business case requires signicant work.” The Department of Finance voiced its support for the establishment of a medical school in Derry saying it is one of the priorities of the restored Executive in New Decade, New Approach. Sinn Feacutein Finance Minister, Conor Murphy hosted a meeting with representatives of the North West on April  to discuss the Magee Medical School, City Deals and the Inclusive Future Fund.

Taking to Twitter the Sinn Feacutein Vice-President said: Delighted that the Executive has agreed to match fund Derry  Strabane City Deal Inclusive Future Fund of pound million transformative for Derry and the NW  goes some way to redress decades of underinvestment after years of hard work by political, community  business leaders. In a statement to the Derry News over the weekend Derry City  Strabane District Council said that ‘all project proposals’ have been submitted to the government at this stage. googletag.cmd.push It is a year since it was announced that the Derry region will receive pound million from the UK Government. The package - pound million for the Derry and Strabane City Deal and poundm for the new Inclusive Future Fund - aims to boost the economic potential of the city and wider region. It has now been matched by the NI government bringing the overall total to poundm. Last week, deputy chair of the Northern Ireland Assembly’s economy committee Sinead Mclaughlin asked Minister Diane Dodds for an update on Derry’s City Deal. The Minister said the North West deal is ‘still being worked on’ and she ‘hopes Heads of Terms will be signed off in May or June’. She added that ‘signicant work has gone into it’. googletag.cmd.push Heads of Terms is a document which sets out the terms of a commercial transaction agreed in principle between parties in the course of negotiations. In November of last year the local council stated that this document would be signed-off within weeks. Once it is signed, work will progress on the preparation of a portfolio of outline business cases for the full range of projects, a process expected to take - months. Alongside this, confirmation is needed of required revenue funding to support capital investment, in particular in relation to the proposed Graduate Entry Medical School. A spokesperson for the local council said it is continuing to engage with partners and stakeholders to progress with a pathway and timeline for bringing forward the City Deal to the next stage. All project proposals have been submitted to government at this stage and Council continues to work with Government to advance with the signing of the Heads of Terms. She added: “Much has already been achieved in terms of the scaling and prioritisation of projects, the proposed governance structures and the processes and timelines involved since the initial City Deal funding announcement. “Discussions in relation to Northern Ireland Government ‘match funding’ to the UK Government poundm Future Fund element of the funding package are continuing.” In terms of the Graduate Medical School and the much-needed expansion of the Ulster University Magee Campus, the council spokesperson said that these are ‘key catalyst regeneration projects’. They have been described as critical to achieving growth and prosperity for Derry and the wider North West City region. “The Mayor last week led calls for the immediate sign off on the approval and long-term commitment of funding for the Graduate Entry Medical School at Ulster University’s Magee campus. “The project has cross party support and there is widespread acknowledgement that it is a hugely important project for the city and wider North West region. “Derry City and Strabane District Council has voted unanimously on a number of occasions in support of the project, acknowledging its signicance to the North West and to Northern Ireland as a whole. “The development of the Medical School and the expansion of Magee are intrinsically linked and will contribute to the overall growth of the City Region alongside the City Deal proposals.” Meanwhile, the Department of Finance voiced its support for the establishment of a medical school in Derry saying it is one of the priorities of the restored Executive in New Decade, New Approach.

In my own constituency, people would love to see city deal status even within our devolved settlement for the city of Derry. We need to look at this in a more fluid way and to get away from the politics and find the democracy, he said. Today, SDLP Leader Colum Eastwood has welcomed the announcement of Executive match-funding for City Deals after the party first raised the proposals over five years ago. googletag.cmd.push Mr Eastwood said that Derry’s City Deal has the potential to transform the North West economy, driving new investment and attracting new jobs. Colum Eastwood MP said: “The SDLP has been fighting hard for fully charged City Deals with the power and potential to transform the North’s economy for over five years. Despite the initial disinterest from the Executive, we have always maintained that these deals would have a signicant impact on our ability to reimagine infrastructure, attract new jobs and stimulate economic growth. “In the talks that restored the Executive, I made it a personal priority to secure resource for university expansion in Derry. Investing in skills and providing our talented young people with the opportunity to live, work and set down roots here is essential to building sustainable communities that thrive. googletag.cmd.push “This has been a long time coming. We have been forced to wait for far too long for the chance to build more for our people and our communities. Now that we’ve secured the potential of the City Deal, we can’t take our foot off the pedal. We need to turn the page on the years of neglect and underinvestment by expanding our university, investing in our young people and delivering new opportunities.” Executive confirmation of a multi-million package for Derry has been warmly welcomed by Sinn Feacutein MLA Martina Anderson as ‘transformative for the entire north west region’. The Foyle MLA was commenting after the Stormont Executive today confirmed match-funding for Derry’s planned City Deal and Inclusive Growth Deal. “This is a hugely positive day for the north west and represents the culmination of a great deal of work over the last number of years,” Martina Anderson said. “Confirmation of the match funding means we now have a package of pound million between the City Deal and Inclusive Growth Deal. “This package will be transformative for the entire North West region and required the collective attention and action of the Executive, both governments and other partners. “Following years of unrelenting Tory austerity which has deprived Derry, Strabane and the wider region of much-needed public services and investment, we can see the clear benefits of having a local Executive in place. “Crucial to this has been the role of Sinn Feacutein Finance Minister Conor Murphy and his determination to ensure that this administration redresses regional inequalities by investing where it is required. “While we will always have much to do, particularly in the face of a global pandemic crisis, this funding and last week’s rescue package for City of Derry Airport will be central to our economic recovery when the crisis has ended. “It will also be fundamental to ensuring we realise the vast economic potential of the entire north west region in the longer term.” Meanwhile, Foyle DUP MLA Gary Middleton also welcomed the approval of match funding for the City Deal and Inclusive Future funding package by Executive Ministers this afternoon.Mr Middleton said,“I wholeheartedly welcome the announcement today of match funding for the Londonderry and Strabane City Deal and Inclusive Future Funds. This doubles the total funding pot to over poundmillion, adding to the funding already secured through the UK Government.This will allow for progress on some of the key projects such as the Maritime Museum at Ebrington, the Walled City Experience and the redevelopment of Queens Quay.The DUP ensured that City Deals were part of the Confidence and Supply agreement in  with the aim of ensuring that all of Northern Ireland benefited. The additional funding for all City Deals announced today is welcome news during this dficult time.I particularly want to put on record my thanks to my party colleagues within the executive and all parties who worked collectively with all of the key stakeholders over the past few years to get this over the line. This is a signicant step forward.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Sport Psychologist Dr Noel Brick is currently involved with Slaughtneil hurlers and has worked with Derry senior footballers. Michael McMullan asked him how athletes should approach lock-down. Its been  days since Leo Varadkar stood on the steps of Washingtons Blair House and insisted that all outdoor mass gatherings of more than  people be cancelled. Our world, has we knew it, has changed. Within hours of the announcement, sporting bodies put their wheels in motion to cancel games and clubs closed their gates to collective training. googletag.cmd.push While Brick, a Kerry man living in Ballycastle, accepts most athletes are driven by the desire to compete and beat others, they often have a dference psyche. He is a lecturer in Sport and Exercise Psychology at the Coleraine campus of Ulster University, has studied to PhD level at University of Limerick and holds a Masters from Staffordshire University. Brick has a background in long-distance running and has managed his own fitness testing business. He is well-placed to assess the needs of the sporting world, albeit in very surreal circumstances. “A lot of athletes are self-driven in the goals that they set for themselves,” he said. “A lot of those goals are not just about competition, they are about improving themselves by getting fitter, getting stronger or improving their skills.” googletag.cmd.push The important thing now, Brick feels, is to reset any goals. Special consideration should be made to aspects an athlete can measure. “Even though competition is very important, through the normal training cycle, there is that competition with themselves and it is about getting better. It is those type of goals that become really important now. These are things that are under your own control and you can reference yourself.” WHAT NEXT  So much of sport planning is about tapering down and peaking at the business end of competition. Coaches often have plans broken down into weeks and even days. Thats all up in the air, but any work done will be worth it, as Brick explains. “Itwill pass and we will come to a time when we do get back to competition. Normal might be dferent for a while, but eventually we will get back. It is recognising that too. Whatever training athletes are doing right now, it will become beneficial.” “Through a normal season you dont always have the time to improve on the things you might get better at. Now, you can reframe it as an opportunity to work on something to get better at and when we do get backyou are a better player.” Inidual work would be aerobic fitness, increasing strength and acceleration, as well as working on technical skills. Its about getting your weak side up to a level you can use under pressure and speeding up the execution of skills. It could be something as simple as rehabbing an injury. What that target is, is irrelevant, but Bricks message is consistent. “It is that competition with yourself and looking at your own improvement. It is something you can control and work on and measure. “There are so many things about this situation at the minute, and this is le in general, that we dont have control over. We dont know when it will end. “We have control over the small things, like washing our hands, but we have no control over when sport happens again and le gets back to normal. “It is about the things you can control right now...working on things like your touch, on your acceleration – you have complete control over these things.” “It is hugely important as we manage our emotions, as we go through this. If you are focussing on things you cant control...you are going to feel anxious, down and all those negative things.” CONNECTIONS Aside from the competitive streak, the sporting environment is one of inclusion. Dressing room banter and the slagging around training breeds a team spirit. After a stressful day at work, exercise and collective training is a welcome release. Without the regular bond, it presents a mental strain. “For our own mental health, it is so important to stay connected to people we normally connect with,” Brick stresses. It is important for team environments to still foster that togetherness, evenit is an articial way, via video conferencing. “You are apart from each other, you are doing a bit of training together but separately. That connection is massively important. “We all take part in sport because we love taking part, but we also enjoy the company of the people we take part with. Keeping that companionship and connectivity is so important. “We are physically distancing and socially isolating, but through that, it is important that we dont completely socially disconnect from other people. It only has benefits and one is for our own mental health.” To conclude, Brick highlighted an non-sport theme he has noticed with many of his students and clients. “People are taking the time to slow down to a certain extent, to reconnect with what is important in le and spend time with family. “That is a positive. We get wrapped up in our work bubble or our sport bubble, we forget about the important things.” RELATED - Derry GAA doctor on the importance of exercise. Click here...

Most of the club football I have watched over the past decade has been senior league matches my own club Ballinascreen have been involved in or the club championship, when I try to attend all the games as I love watching them. So apologies to some of the great players out there who have been outstanding at intermediate and junior level, I’ve kept it to the senior club  here. Michael Conlan Dedication and a serious quest for goalkeeping excellence were his traits, a key part of the three in a row Ballinderry side in -. The final of , in particular, Mickey C’s width and accuracy in his kick outs to his teams ‘four in midfield’ tactic was key to their victory that day. Fine shot stopper too, made his body big, gave the forward less to shoot at. Edges out Antoacutein McMullan and Thomas Mallon. googletag.cmd.push Ciaran Mullan Selected not so much for his defensive skills, as his attacking runs from the full back line for Eoghan Rua, playing a key part in their two county titles of  and . Loved to win ball out in front of his opponent and destroyed many a forward’s resolve by racing forward repeatedly, often up the right hand side of the pitch. Loved the wide open space at Owenbeg, in particular, where his pace was there for all to see. Brendan Rogers With serious pace and raw talent, Brendan transforms the way we think about modern full backs. His forays up the pitch often veered over to the sidelines and racing - yards up the pitch and nobody could catch him. Instrumental in Slaughtneils four in a row and his importance to the team was illustrated last year when he was hampered by injury. Incredible dual player. googletag.cmd.push Karl McKaigue Best man marker in the county, his one on one stats are astonishing against star opponents. Can play a bit too, but tends to keep it simple and save his energies for his defensive duties. Keeps it clean too, quiet, no-nonsense, great reader, interceptions, timing of the tackle superb these are his main traits. Ciaran McFaulBetter known for playing at midfield for Glen, or even in the forward line, but he is as complete a player as there is in Derry club football at present. Great ball carrier, his pinpoint passes often put it on a plate for his full forwards. Great long range scorer as well, but it’s his ‘lead by example’ attitude with Glen that impresses me. Chrissy McKaigue Undoubtedly the driving force behind Slaughtneil’s phenomenal run to four county and three Ulster titles. Fierce will to win, excellent athlete, a ball carrier, dictates the play, his tour de force against Diarmuid Connolly and St Vincents in the  All-Ireland semi final was as good an inidual display as I have seen, racing forward to score four outstanding long range points. Sean Leo McGoldrick Another great ball carrier, an orchestrator, extremely comfortable and elusive on the ball, plays almost like a quarter back at times for his club. Part of the famous McGoldrick clan that have played a huge part in putting Eoghan Rua on the footballing map with an incredible two county titles in  and . Enda Muldoon Big Enda had it all, great fielder, outstanding passer, long range points of either foot, excellent free taker. Played well over two decades with Ballinderry winning eight county titles and, of course two Ulster’s and an All-Ireland club. Always did the business when it counted most as well. One of the all time greats of Derry football, and modest with it. Privileged to have been a team mate for several years. Patsy Bradley The most spectacular sight in Derry football was Patsy taking off and ‘leppin’ above and across several opponents, attempting a miraculous catch. You never knew where, or even how, he was going to land, but more often than not, he either emerged with the ball or got a big fist to it. A fierce competitor, and tremendous athlete, he was the Slaughtneil folk hero that got the crowd roaring and inspired his team every match without fail. Danny Heavron Danny has been a shining example for his club right throughout this decade. Has played effectively in defence as a sweeper, at midfield, or anywhere in the forward line. A great athlete, a playmaker, a great score taker from play and frees, Danny came back from several career threatening injuries to lead Magherafelt to a memorable county title win in . Mark Lynch Extremely powerful runner with the ball, two great feet, fine fielder, accurate free taker often putting up a big scoring total. Could play equally effectively at midfield, number  or full forward. Another player who has combined an outstanding county career whilst giving his all for his club, Banagher. I chose Mark just ahead of Christopher Bradley who was majestic at number  in Slaughtneil’s run to their first Ulster Club title in . Conleith Gilligan Along with Enda, he was the outstanding club player in the county for at least  years from  until his seventh county medal in . Extremely hard to dispossess , evasive, some absolutely outstanding scores of either foot. Brushed off a lot of crap from opponents and just got on with the football. Infectious character who was an outstanding servant for Ballinderry. Paddy Bradley Paddy was still a seriously good forward for Glenullin in the first six or so years of the past decade. His first touch was outstanding. Raced out to the ball, sometimes double marked, controlled it first go either with a catch or palm down to himself, then literally fired it over, straight as an arrow, with unerring accuracy, often from - yards out. Derry’s best ever forward in my letime. If it was a team of the last four years alone, young Shane McGuigan of Slaughtneil would undoubtedly have been chosen, a class act. Colm McGoldrickDeceptively languid style, but Colm has been a consistently top club player for Eoghan Rua right throughout the past decade since their vivacious first county title in . Always finds space against even the tightest opponent, the target man, wins serious ball down the channel, good in the air and has scored umpteen goals for his team over the years. A real pity he was never tempted to give the county team a proper rattle as I believe he would have been a huge asset. Just ahead of Emmett McGuckin. Benny Heron Outstanding player for Ballinascreen over the past decade, a fantastic ’turn on a sixpence’ style has destroyed many an opponent. Great finisher, goals and points, he has rattled up some serious tallies. If I was managing Benny I’d have him up top close to goal every time, where he is a deadly assassin. However, a sublime playmaker further out the field as well, with great stamina.Eoghan Brown, another great club forward, was also considered here. RELATED - Michael McMullans selection.

Her death on Saturday morning at Altnagelvin Hospital has left a profound sense of sadness among her friends and neighbours in the street, which she called her home for so many years. As her remains were brought to Long Tower church on Sunday evening, neighbours stopped to remember a special lady, known for her warm generosity and heart of gold. It was a journey that Bridget Carroll had made thousands of times before, to a church that became her second home. googletag.cmd.push Affectionately known as ‘Wee Bridget’ to all her family and friends, Bridget was a daily Communicant until chronic illness took hold several years ago. At every Benediction service, Holy Hour, Parish Retreat, and Stations of the Cross, Bridget could be found in her familiar seat at the back of the church. Indeed she was a particular devotee of the yearly parish retreat and loved getting the traditional new outfit for the last day. Born in Kilkenny on July , , Bridget came to live at Nazareth House in Fahan as an infant, and received her education at Nazareth House in Bishop Street. googletag.cmd.push Her first job was working in the Nazareth House care home where she loved caring for the elderly residents and listening to their stories. Bridget moved to Dublin to work in the Mater Hospital with her best friend Kathleen, and stayed in the Fair City for  years. However Bridget missed the sense of home she felt in her adopted Derry, and ed to the city where she settled into le working at a number of cafes in the town, becoming a familiar face to many. For many years she lived in the iconic Rossville Flats in the Bogside, and she was delighted when she was relocated to her new home in Bishop Street when the flats were marked for demolition. Bridget’s many friendships formed the centre of her le, always staying in touch with her childhood friend Kathleen Smith who is now living in Dublin, Rita McDaid, Monica Gransha, and Kathleen Doherty from Sunbeam Terrace. You knew she had come for a visit when you heard the doorbell ring, the door open, and her familiar voice shout out – ‘It’s only me!’ The  year old loved to have a chat and always kept up with the local news buying every local newspaper each week. Bridget was a member of many groups often giving her time as a volunteer in Termonbacca, with Cursillo, St Joseph’s Young Priests Society, as a regular chapel cleaner and a parish reader. Bridget also loved travelling and was the first to sign up for any bus runs in the parish. Her favourite run without question was to the pilgrimage site of Knock, but her trips also took her as far as Lourdes on six occasions, Fatima, Buncrana, and Lough Derg. She spoke often of her devotion to the Blessed Mother and Padre Pio, it was this faith that helped her in recent years as she battled her deteriorating health. Several years ago she moved from her flat at the bottom of Bishop Street, to Alexander House at the top of Bishop Street. Here, Bridget found a new sense to the meaning of home. She formed new friendships with the staff and fellow residents, and received dedicated and loving care around the clock. Bridget Carroll will be remembered for her straight talking, unforgettable laugh, loyal friendship and beautul spirit. She often said that even though she was not born here, she felt that she was a Derry woman at heart. Many will miss chatting to her and giving her a wave as she made her way to and from the city centre for her shopping. Bishop Street will never be the same again without her.

He sat down with Michael McMullan to talk about how he almost missed out on Derry’s greatest hour. When Brian McGilligan shakes your hand, it stays shook. Locked, like a wench. It reminds you of the toughness of a man who turned the midfield battlegrounds of Ireland upside down. A man who Ireland manager Kevin Heffernan took one glance at and knew he would not need baby-sitting when faced with any form thuggery the Australians could heave at him. The man that, alongside Anthony Tohill, formed the perfect midfield partnership. A duo that dozed all before it. googletag.cmd.push He is one of six players to start and finish all five games on the way to the historic summit of . It is put to him that he played a central part in something that has never been equalled. “Do you think so sur ” came the instant reply. With  minutes of the All-Ireland Final gone Niall Cahalane’s mis-directed fist pass is too high and squirms through the fingers of Teddy McCarthy. McGilligan laps up the gt before slotting over his third score of the campaign. Four minutes previous, with Cork - to - ahead, he was involved in the move that led to Johnny McGurk’s point - Derry’s first of a jittery start. googletag.cmd.push The midfield warrior’s input didn’t end there. Wing-forward Barry Coffey had a height advantage over Johnny McGurk. The pre-game chat suggested that goalkeeper John Kerins was expected to exploit it. Kerins’ th minute kick-out was angled towards Coffey, who was hugging the Cusack Stand sideline. McGilligan scampered across - effortlessly almost - before thundering through Coffey for the breaking ball. His physique didn’t suggest he was fast. He was deceptive. “Over  metres nobody could touch me,” McGilligan states. “Tony Scullion would be close, Joe Brolly over the first  or  yards would have been fast but I would have stuffed them after that. “Every evening after school you were running and feeding sheep. I was naturally fit and was carrying no weight.” In Coffey’s wake and with the leather in his grasp, McGilligan thumped the ball goalwards. It was the days when you had to fight your own corner. He had done his bit. Now the forwards needed to man up. Enda Gormley nipped ahead of Cahalane to flick the wet ball into the path of Damian Cassidy. Cassidy’s left-footed kick evaded Cahalane’s intended block and hung in the air above full-back Mark O’Connor before Seamus Downey punched to the net and Derry were two points ahead. The measure of a leader is how they respond to adversity. As Derry’s landmark Sunday flirted with failure, before it had left the starting blocks, McGilligan was involved in three of the game’s key moments. The craved All-Ireland title would follow, but it so nearly passed him by. *** It’s a Wednesday night in the McGilligan household. Like a scene from game day in any corner of Ireland. Brian Oacuteg and Fiontan are gathering their gear for a game. Cathair points me in the direction of the farmyard. After a day on the site, Brian senior is out feeding the stock. In full view below, through the open side of the shed, is the Benedy. We head up to the house. Traversing back through the living room is like walking through a museum. The walls are scarcely visible, around framed pictures of Dungiven, Derry and Ulster teams. Charting the career of one of the Derry’s most famous sons. But hurling was his first love. He was reared in the cottages at Owenbeg and went to Dernaflaw school which, despite its small size, also produced Joe Brolly to Derry’s winning team. “The Damperwas there and we had a pretty good hurling team and won a couple of Feacuteiles,” McGilligan recalled. It was pre-Kevin Lynch’s and Dernaflaw would always be beating Dungiven at underage. McGilligan’s football career began as a goalkeeper at U and U. The genuine interest wasn’t there but with flailing numbers, he played almost out of necessity. Now at ‘the big school’ in Dungiven, the oldest of a family of six was now needed on the farm. Spare time was a limited commodity. “You had to go and look sheep and feed them. That was every evening. My fatherwas working and it was up to me. My motherwould lt me at the school gates.” An U title in  was followed two years later by U glory but it wasn’t until the minor grade, under George Murphy, that he made the breakthrough. A championship game with Magherafelt came around the corner and his dual with Joe Beattie, who had a huge reputation at the time, changed the direction of McGilligan’s career. “They threw me out at centre-half back to mark him,” he outlined. Dungiven went on to win two minor championships, but he never was able to break into the mould at county level. In his final year, , he watched on as an unused substitute as Cork beat Derry in the All-Ireland Minor Final. “They put on every Tom, Dick and Harry. It was all about who you were, who your father was and what pedigree you had. They weren’t going to put a rahery like me on,” McGilligan said. As he admits himself, there is a stubbornness. He stuck at it and took his chances when they came. One Sunday, Dungiven reserve manager Liam Harrycoaxed McGilligan from a corn field to make up the numbers for a trip to Ballinderry. Never an easy place to go to. “It was like something from a ‘Carry on’ film,” McGilligan described. “A boy was going to hit a penalty and somebody would run up behind him and trip him. It was the Wild West - there is no other way to say it.” The experience of the reserve and senior games on a Sunday was a lesson for a decorated career that would follow. Andy Murphy came in as manager in . He saw something in McGilligan and pushed him towards the team. His instincts paid off. A year later at Ballinascreen, a star-studded Magherafelt side led Dungiven - to -, as the county final ticked into the final moments. Liam McElhinney’s kick hung in the air. It was the last hurrah. Out of nowhere, McGilligan got a fist to the ball – punching to the net. It lives long in Dungiven folklore and that winning goal helped him to the first of five county medals. His career began to take root. *** It was Sunday, June   at Omagh’s Healy Park. Derry were trailing Tyrone by ‘five or six points’ and Jim McKeever called Brian McGilligan from the dug-out. There was no warm up required. “I was mad keen to get on. I thought I should have started,” McGilligan recalls of his debut. “I went on and I won a couple of balls and we turned it, but Noel McGinn hit a wonder strike.” The goal ended Derry’s hopes but Tyrone would later have a major part to play in McGilligan’s summer. The Kevin Barry’s club in Philadelphia came calling and he headed across the pond. As time went by, he felt he may never . “I wasn’t for coming back. I had work and plenty of money...everything…and the weather was favourable. I was playing football and hurling – it was a home away from home.” With no mobile phones, communication wasn’t as it is now. The weekly phone call kept tabs on how everyone was back home. “Every time I would ring, my mother would say ‘that boy Heffernanwas ringing again’ you would need to ring him.” If the Ireland manager wasn’t ringing the McGilligan household, ‘Heffo’ was ringing then Derry official Patsy Mulholland. The calls continued. Homesickness began to creep in ‘a wee bit’ and with the chance to represent his country, it eventually swayed McGilligan and he dialled Heffernan’s number. Still in Philadelphia, would he be guaranteed a seat on the plane to Oz  Onlyhe was playing the football he was before be left, insisted Heffernan. “You know yourself - boys go outand go off the rails and are messing about. I wasn’t at that. Yes, I enjoyed a beer but I was working hard every day,” McGilligan continues. The football was a good work out, ‘a couple of’ evenings a week. The system wasn’t abused. After a weekend of thinking and a Mondayhome, Heffo booked McGilligan and Dermot McNicholl, who had also spent the summer in Philadelphia, into Tyrone training on the Tuesday night. Art McRory was putting the finishing touches to their  All-Ireland Final with Kerry and had a savage routine in place for McGilligan. “It was strange because we were two Derry men. There was no love lost but we were well looked after – we were treated as part of the .” McGilligan battled with Plunkett Donaghy, Audi Hamilton and Harry McClure in the training games. “The only dference was -we were doing  sprints, I was made do five or six more. If there was half a dozen sI would be doing  of them.” It was the same in the gym sessions. The first set was fine, the second and third set had McGilligan going around on his knees. “I got a lot of abuse. It was bordering on brutality. I remember Art talking to Fr Brian D’Arcy, who was down watching training. “Art said ‘look at the big Derry b*****d, that’s the place for him – on his knees’ and I felt like getting up and striking him.” As the Tyrone sessions were tapering down, McNicholl and McGilligan’s time was up. They thanked Tyrone for having them there and wished them well for the final. McRory was appreciative of the bite the two Derry men brought to their preparations but had a final word of apology for big Brian. The extra training was ‘preferential treatment’ at the request of Heffernan. “The whole thing was pre-planned but it worked,” added McGilligan. He was on the trip to Australia, where he played at full-back as Ireland recovered from a first test defeat to win the series -. Playing in front of average attendances of ,, McGilligan was now an icon. Home for good, he was midfield in Derry’s Ulster winning team. The seeds for Sam were sown. *** The summer of  was his first time playing in the mecca of GAA. It was ‘a privilege’ but age wasn’t on their side. “We had an old team. Plunkett Murphy and Joe Irwin – boys like that. They were all good footballers but there was no youth coming in. “I quite honestly thought we’d never be back in an All-Ireland semi-final even. Holy Jesus, to get playing in Croke Park, this is unreal. “Ulster was very hard to win. It wasn’t like Munster, where it was down to two teams.” Following his All-Star and a trip to America, rubbing shoulders with the best Ireland had to offer, McGilligan began thinking. “They were no better than you, but they were in a better set-up – a better oiled machine,” he offered, referring to the players from other counties. “They weren’t superhumans, when you were playing with them, you were every bit as fast as them.” Back home, it was a lot dferent. “Derry was in turmoil. You were going to matches and counting to seeyou had enough men to play. We played Down at Drumsurn and we were down to the bare bones. “We hadn’t even a manager. Mickey Moran had to step in to take the team. There was  or  out at training.” Fr Sean Hegarty, a confidant of Eamonn Coleman, managed Armagh against Derry in  would act as an intermediary of sorts. “Wee Hegarty came in and I honestly think he steadied the ship. I didn’t know a lot about him but he was a gas man. He was the sort of man I would go to give my confessions to – he was a shrewd man.” With minor teams beginning to produce players, the recipe began to thicken. But like most of his career, McGilligan had to wait. Down and Donegal would feast at the top table first. “Tohill and these boys were coming in at the start of the s but by  they were starting to come of age.” Handing Down an  point hammering in the first round was the perfect tonic. “You start to believe in yourself but it could have gone pear-shaped. We rode our luck in a couple of games.” “Even the bad dayin Clones, it could’ve went either way. There was a ball that went down the field and I went like mad after it. Martin McHugh passed it and I got my hand to it and it came out again.” The small margins where games were won and lost. In the All-Ireland semi-final, Derry were in arrears against Dublin and McGilligan’s  doubts raised their head again. “It was the same auld story. It’s not going to be back again,” he recalled thinking. In the lead-up to the game, he had asked his fatherhe was going to the game. He wasn’t. It wasn’t a surprise. “My mother was dferent,” McGilligan outlined. “But he was never at a match in his le. He didn’t have an interest. He was a typical workaholic and farmer, but he said he’d go to the final.” Whatthey didn’t get there  His father’s answer was the perfect comeback. “He said ‘well,that’s your attitude, then don’t you go either’ – it was as quick as that,” McGilligan added. His son did show up alright. Few can forget the thunderous shoulder on Jack Sheedy. The two met later in the year, by chance, and the Dubliner told McGilligan he was still sore. That’s the brute strength he brought. The Dubs couldn’t move it and neither could Cork. So Gerard McGilligan would get a chance to see his son play. And on the biggest day of them all. “My wewent down,” Brian recalled. “Our young girlwas only a year and Brian Oacuteg was only born. She had more bother with the auld boy than the two weans.” Following the final whistle McGilligan still recalls heading towards the Hogan Stand, where there was a cordon of Gardai surrounding the steps. “I mind crawling on my hands and knees, in between somebody’s legs. I wasn’t fit to walk, I was beat black and had people jumping on me.” The celebration banquet in the Shelbourne Hotel was similar. It couldn’t cope. McGilligan, Tony Scullion and Kieran McKeever – with their partners – were among those unable to get a seat in the mainroom. “It was like something out of a Monty Python sketch - it was hilarious. There were no seats for us. It wasn’t big enough to hold thefor starters. I actually saw somebody move name pieces and sit on the Bishop’s seat.” Seated in dferent room, upstairs, they began to tuck into their soup, one of the RTE staff came upstairs. The Sunday Game was about to go on air but McGilligan was reluctant to go downstairs. He was ‘embarrassed’ as others were forced to give up their seat in the middle of the . Even back at the Airport Hotel, later that night, where Derry were staying, there was only a ‘wee hatch’ open to serve up to  people, including Henry Downey and a certain Sam Maguire. With the cup needing filled, McGilligan issued a ‘bit of advice’ to the night porter and eventually two shutters opened on the bar. It was Monday before the occasion began to seep fully into the mind. Now it was real. *** The Moy was packed and when Derry bus-driver Benny Vincent opened the door - in came Plunkett Donaghy. The previous season, he spilled Anthony Tohill’s ‘’ into the net in the league final to start the ball rolling on Derry’s odyssey. This was dferent. This was a tribute to the sons of Ulster bringing home the Sam. “You had the Garda escort coming out of Dublin and you were stopping in every town,” McGilligan recalls. “There were thousands of people waiting on us on a lorry in every town on the way up.” In Cookstown there was a Loyalist road block. Plan B was to ert via Coalisland. But McGilligan instructed Vincent to head on up the town – as far as they could go. There were thousands of Tyrone people wanting a glance at Sam. “It was unheard of for a team from the North. Down had done it before and it wasn’t new to them - it was new to Derry.” The homecoming seemed to go on forever. In every town, before they were greeted by the huge crowd in Maghera, outside Glen club, before the cup was taken to the four corners of the county. When it was McGilligan’s turn to have the cup, he paraded it around the homes of the Benedy. Back to the days when Liam Harry came rounding him up to make up the numbers. His career had now come full circle. He hosted a night in his house. It was packed, with cars strewn alongside the road. “There was a death up in the Benedy,” added McGilligan, remembering the night vividly. A stranger to the area saw the commotion and stopped off. “He said to somebody ‘where’s the remains at’ – he saw all the cars and thought it was the wake house. He laughed and away he went.” *** The glory days ended abruptly. With Ciaran McCabe’s winning goal for Down in , Derry’s world came crashing down. There was no back door and Derry’s All-Ireland dreams were in tatters. McGilligan laments the  years since meeting Sam. “Any other county would have got their act together. Too many boys partied, lived the high le and thought it was only matter of turning up. “We definitely should have won another one. The players were good enough, you can’t pinpoint any one thing. It was the perfect storm. There was a whole lot of things going on behind. You see where things have gone,” he continued. “We are still as far away from winning another one. We are starting from the bottom again – we are in ision four.” That aside, McGilligan is content on how his GAA career panned out. “It kept me on the straight and narrow. Everybody has their vices and the GAA was a vice for me. If it wasn’t football it was hurling.” Nulling the impact of Joe Beattie, punching home a county final winning goal and answering Kevin Heffernan’s call tofrom America. The important markers in the career of one of Derry’s famous sons. RELATED - Gerry McElhinney - the greatest showman. Click here...

Leo addressed the nation on Friday evening after his plans were approved by Cabinet. The measures were earlier discussed by the National Public Health Emergency Team. There has been a very slight lting of measures announced on March .Over s cocooning can exercise outdoors within km of their homes from May . The general population can take exercise within km of their homes instead of km from next Tuesday, May . The government have also included, in their road map for reopening society and business a plan for the phasedof sporting activities on the island. googletag.cmd.push The roll back on restrictions will be done over five phases. Phase one begins on May  and there are three weeks between each roll back.  In phase one, the government plan to open tennis courts, golf courses and sports pitches, as long as social distancing is still observed. A maximum of four people will be allowed to participate in an activity at the one time. Phase two will permit training, in small groups, but no matches. Phase three promises behind closed doors activities where arrangements are made to maintain social distance, while in Phase four, soccer and GAA canwith a limited number of spectators. This would hopefully mean, from a local perspective, that the Desmond and Limerick District soccer leagues could , while in GAA the football and hurling, club championships, could make a welcometo the playing pitches too. Phase four also allows for swimming pools to open. googletag.cmd.push Phase five, August , will allow gyms, contact sports such as boxing, wrestling and rugby to . There too will be restrictions on large sport gatherings, but it seems that inter county matches in the GAA could be back on the cards in August. It is vital to remember however, that should the virus resurface or one of the phases sees an increase in Covid- cases, there is the possibility that the government would roll back a phase and start from there once more. However, there does seem to be light at the end of the tunnel for sports fans and bodies at this time.

Leo addressed the nation on Friday evening after his plans were approved by Cabinet. The measures were earlier discussed by the National Public Health Emergency Team. There has been a very slight lting of measures announced on March .Over s cocooning can exercise outdoors within km of their homes from May . The general population can take exercise within km of their homes instead of km from next Tuesday, May . The government have also included, in their road map for reopening society and business a plan for the phasedof sporting activities on the island. googletag.cmd.push The roll back on restrictions will be done over five phases. Phase one begins on May  and there are three weeks between each roll back.  In phase one, the government plan to open tennis courts, golf courses and sports pitches, as long as social distancing is still observed. A maximum of four people will be allowed to participate in an activity at the one time. Phase two will permit training, in small groups, but no matches. Phase three promises behind closed doors activities where arrangements are made to maintain social distance, while in Phase four, soccer and GAA canwith a limited number of spectators. This would hopefully mean, from a local perspective, that the Desmond and Limerick District soccer leagues could , while in GAA the football and hurling, club championships, could make a welcometo the playing pitches too. Phase four also allows for swimming pools to open. googletag.cmd.push Phase five, August , will allow gyms, contact sports such as boxing, wrestling and rugby to . There too will be restrictions on large sport gatherings, but it seems that inter county matches in the GAA could be back on the cards in August. It is vital to remember however, that should the virus resurface or one of the phases sees an increase in Covid- cases, there is the possibility that the government would roll back a phase and start from there once more. However, there does seem to be light at the end of the tunnel for sports fans and bodies at this time.

The response to the classes has been brilliant and I have kept it on, even though I am teaching PE full-time in Assumption Grammar in Ballynahinch.ldquoObviously with COVID- I am off work now and with no GAA or fitness classes I have more time on my hands.ldquoI put out the idea on social media on Friday morning and then spent the weekend putting together the first class to upload Monday morning.ldquoI honestly didnrsquot know what to expect really. I was thinking maybeI managed to pull in a hundred people at pound each, pound would be a reasonable target.But I have really been overwhelmed by the response.Members of her usual weekly classes in Pilates for Paula responded immediately, but her school quickly weighed in behind the effort and her many acquaintances in GAA and camogie.Despite her organisation of the fundraiser, in her words being ldquoa bit last minute, her target was realised eight-fold and she presented a cheque for pound, last week.ldquoI couldnrsquot believe it really. When I saw Instagram stories of Sophie Colgan in New York taking part, Eiliacutes Niacute Chaiside [the Slaughtneil camog], who has been in New Zealand for the past year, signing up, and Sarah Donnelly, the Tyrone footballer in Australia, it just shows you that the people you meet through the GAA will always support each other.Paula last year captained Clonduff to the All-Ireland club title and she has played for Down and Ulster over many years, while her husband Darren is the Down football captain.ldquoThe GAA camogie community is absolutely fabulous. They rallied around my family after Christmas and provided a lot of comfort and again the response has been phenomenal.ldquoCOVID- has challenged the family once more. Clodaghrsquos parents, my brother Darren and his we Carol, live in Coleraine and it has been very dficult for us as a family to support them. What has happened over Easter week has given us all a huge lt and we are very thankful for all that support from our GAA family.ldquoI have got a lot of messages since the last class on Friday and everyone seems to have enjoyed them. A lot had never done exercise like that and now want me to provide more classes online and keep it going for as long as we are all prevented from going back to work.ldquoI think plenty of people are finding the lockdown very tough mentally and I got that back in the messages too, about how they felt a lot more positive after doing the exercise, a lot fresher and ready to face the day.She added: ldquoThe people who supported the fundraiser have helped themselves, helped Leukaemia  Lymphoma NI Research and really supported the Gribben family.You can still contribute to Leukaemia Lymphonania Research by searching for Carol and Darren Gribbenrsquos fundraiser in aid of Leukaemia  Lymphoma NI on Facebook or follow this link https:www.facebook donate  .prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 Delamont.jpg","title":"Delamont remains closed in lockdown  ","story":"DELAMONT Country Park outside Killyleagh is to remain closed to visitors.Newry, Mourne and Down Council has confirmed that the gates to the stunning park on the shores of Strangford Lough will not reopen, despite last weekrsquos decision by Stormont agriculture minister Edwin Poots to reopen Tollymore and Castlewellan forest parks.The decision not to allow visitors into Delamont was taken by the leaders of the local councilrsquos main parties during a meeting held via Skype last week and has been welcomed by local councillors Billy Walker and Dermot Curran.Cllr Walker said all the party leaders agreed that is it too soon to reopen Delamont, confirming that the closure decision will be reviewed next month.ldquoThere are real concerns that allowing the public to access the country park could lead to a major surge in visitors which is not what anyone wants at this particular time. The last thing we need is for family picnics and hundreds of other visitors arriving at a time when coronavirus remains a very real and present danger, continued the Rowallane councillor.Cllr Walker described the decision to reopen forest parks as ldquopremature and said Newry, Mourne and Down Council deserved praise for keeping all its country parks closed for the time being.He added: ldquoThe closure decision is being kept under review and I believe that there is still some way to go before council-owned parks will be open to the public.ldquoThere will be people upset that Delamont remains closed, but we all have to adhere to the public advice we have been given in relation to social distancing and, where possible, to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives.Cllr Curran said he supports the decision to keep Delamont closed and praised what he described as the local authorityrsquos ldquocourageous decision.He argued that the big danger with warmer weather and clearer evenings now here is that reopening the country park could lead to a major influx of visitors and that enforcing social distancing measures would be particularly dficult,not impossible.ldquoThere was perhaps a temptation to reopen Delamont given the decision to allow people to access Tollymore and Castlewellan forest parks, but the local council has stood firm, putting the safety of people front and centre and is to be applauded for doing so, said Cllr Curran.ldquoErring on the side of caution is the right thing to do at this time. It would be an awful situation to reopen the park and for someone to contract coronavirus as a result. The park will reopen at some stage, but not just now. Peoplersquos health and safety must come first.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokesman said despite the decision by Mr Poots to reopen parks managed by the Forest Service all those that the local authority is responsible for, including Delamont, will remain closed.Council officials say that the decision to close Delamont taken on March  remains in place for the time being, but will be reviewed as public health advice guidance develops.ldquoMembers decided that it was too soon to consider reopening parks at this time, said a council spokesman.In addition, he said it was felt that reopening local authority-owned country park would encourageresidents from outside the district to make a non-essential journey to these facilities for exercise, thus increasing the volume of traffic and congestion at these locations and increasing the risk of further spread of COVID- across the district.ldquoThe focus of the council at this time must be the safety of our citizens and implementing measures to reduce the spread of the virus, said the spokesman.ldquoThe council continues to advise our citizens that the single most important action they can take is to stay at home in order to protect the NHS and save lives..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 Doreen.jpg","title":"Doreen to step down after 20 years as leader at Leitrim playgroup  ","story":"A LEITRIM woman, who has been the driving force behind a local playgroup for almost  years, is stepping down.Doreen Shahmohammadi is a familiar face around the village, especially to young people as the leader of Leitrim Community Playgroup.Doreen, her Iranian husband, Reza, and twin sons, Michael and Colm, settled in Leitrim a few years before she began the playgroup in January . She soon experienced a strong sense of community and friendship that has kept them there ever since.She started the playgroup with the support of the local GAA club, Liatroim Fontenoys, which offered her use of their premises to begin with.ldquoIn the first year we went from having five children to  children, she said. ldquoWe had no funding in the first year, but the Fontenoys were very good to us by covering the cost of heating and telephone charges.ldquoBy the second year funding was made available by the Southern Education and Library Board for  pre-school places and it wasnrsquot long before we secured funding to build a purpose-built playgroup which sits within the boundary of the Fontenoys club.ldquoWithin a few years and thanks to additional funding enrolment rose to  places. Depending on the birth rate it has usually remains around the same number each year.Doreen loves to have children around her. In fact, Reza reminds her all the time that she is a magnet in attracting them wherever she goes.Doreen is a very proud mother. Her sons, now , graduated as doctors five years ago and both are working on the frontline during the COVID- pandemic. Colm is working in intensive care, while Michael works between cardiology and intensive care.ldquoOver the years, I have loved, cared for and educated every child that has come to the playgroup as though they were my own children, he says.ldquoI am going to miss them all very much, more than you can ever imagine. I hope Irsquom not to be a stranger to the playgroup after my retirement.Doreen says the current playgroup team, made up of deputy leader Michelle McCabe and temporary assistant, Danielle Clarke, have worked well together over the past few years. Other long term members of staff were Janet King, Tina Owens and Diane Baxter.ldquoThe playgroup has been my le and I have enjoyed welcoming hundreds of children to their pre-school year experience. It is a lovely learning environment to be part of, she continued.ldquoWe are blessed with the children and their families in the community who have entered our setting and I would like to take this opportunity to thank the staff and committees past and present, children, grandparents, childminders and, of course, the wider community who have supported me and who have been so generous over the years.ldquoMost of all, I would like to thank the trustees who have supported me for all these years and provided me with the opportunity to establish an excellent learning environment for pre-school children, not forgetting my sincere thanks to the Fontenoys for all their support and encouragement.She added: ldquoI wish my successor every success and I hope they will enjoy and appreciate every single minute they spend with the children as I have done..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 Life.jpg","title":"Ex Drumaness man praises Kiwis as country comes out of lockdown  ","story":"A FORMER Drumaness man who has been living in New Zealand for the past  years has this week revealed what le in lockdown has been like Down Under.Barry Brennanrsquos adopted homeland has been praised for its response to the coronavirus pandemic, with the country this week emerging from a strict five-week quarantine which included the strictest constraints paced on New Zealanders in modern history.The countryrsquos prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, hailed New Zealanders for their incredible work to ldquobreak the virusrsquos chain of transmission which has allowed the country to downgrade its highest alert level from four to three, with amendedrestrictions expected to be in place for around two more weeks.The move means that many shops have reopened while public gatherings of  people are now permissible for weddings and funerals, with schools also set to reopen. In addition, Kiwis can now fish, hunt, surf, swim and play golf.New Zealand has suffered only , confirmed coronavirus cases and  deaths after moving quickly to impose a lockdown last month, with the easing of quarantine measures paving the way for around , people toto work under a more relaxed regime.Barry mdash who specialises in home renovations and employs several people mdash has not ed to work yet, but is more than happy in the idyllic rural setting of Mangawhai in the North Island just five minutes from the beach, where he lives with his we, Sian, and children Sean, Danny and Liam.The New Zealand government is still asking citizens to stay at home and to practise social distancing, with Barry hoping that it wonrsquot be long before the country again enjoys some sense of normality.And he has the praised prime minister for her approach to COVID-, with Arden arguing that a drastic short-term action would benefit the countryrsquos economy in the long run.On Monday, it was confirmed that there is no widespread underlying community transmission in New Zealand, with Ms Arden warning that the country was not yet out of the woods.ldquoWhen you look at what happened where in the world in relation to coronavirus, the prime minister did a good job, said Barry, who headed to New Zealand with his friend Barry Armstrong in .ldquoI was a qualied carpenter and Barry, who lived just up the road from me, was a bricklayer who had a contact in New Zealand so we headed off on a -month visa to Auckland. Barry stayed for  months before heading home but I am still here, married with three boys.ldquoThe coronavirus has had a worldwide impact and while many people were wondering what would happen in New Zealand, I always had a feeling that the prime minister would go at the pandemic hard and fast and that is exactly what she did.Barry revealed that New Zealanders were told to prepare for lockdown on March  and that two days later a series of strict measures were introduced.ldquoClearly the prime minister had a look at what was happening in other parts of the world before the virus got a hold here and she moved to minimise its impact. I think that she has done an amazing job to be quite honest.ldquoFour and a half weeks after the lockdown measures were implemented, there was only one confirmed coronavirus case in New Zealand at the start of this week. Indeed, the government knows exactly where every case is in the country.Barry said anyone arriving in the country and is suspected of having the virus is quarantined and believes thatthere was ever to be another pandemic in the future, countries would do well to take a close look at what New Zealand did to halt its deadly spread.ldquoEverything really happened so fast here and we did not have that much time to think about what was going in, he continued.ldquoI played golf with the principal of the school my youngest boy attends and he said he did not think NewZealand would go into lockdown. Forty eight hours later we were told it was happening.Barry said the country rightly decided that it wasnrsquot taking any chances and locked everything down, apart from supermarkets, with strict social distancing rules in place.ldquoWe have gone from a level four alert to level three but I am still not back at work as there a lot of iables that I need to consider, explained the former Drumaness man. ldquoIn my line of work I would be close to homeowners so I will just wait until the restrictions ease a bit more.Barry relocated from Auckland to Mangawhai six years ago and home is now a three and a half acre plot where he built a shooting gallery and what he describes as a ldquobit of a golf course. He also looks after a few animals.With no immediateto work on the horizon, Barry is keeping busy mowing lawns and feeding his animals, with a little help from his sons.With his parents, Sean and Mary, still living at the family home at the Cumber Road in Drumaness, Barry says he is in regular contact with them. He said his dad is good with Whatsapp and regularly tells him that New Zealand lamb is cheaper in Ireland than down under.ldquoWe have lots of contact with my parents and are in touch once or twice a week. I also have an older brother, Seamus who lives in Auckland. We both played for Loughinisland GAC.

New customers were attracted to the town and quality goods and competitive prices have encouraged many toon a regular basis.The growing stature of the town as a shopping centre has been helped by the introduction of new shops, particularly in the Dromore Street area, and by the good car parking facilities on offer.Market Day every Thursday brings hundreds of people from the surrounding district flooding into the town ndash and with two Market Days cropping up in the new extended trade week this year, the Chamber is hopeful that shopping will hit a new peak in June.QUOILE ndash A concerted effort is being made by the Northern Ireland Tourist Board and Down District Council to make the -mile stretch of the Quoile River into a fishing paradise.Regarded as one of the best fishing waters in the province, the Quoile is hardly known nationally, and itrsquos the aim of the Tourist Board and the council to make it as popular as the Fermanagh Lakelands, the current number one fishing haven.The joint effort to put the Quoile on the fishing map is being spearheaded by Ian Heaps, the former inidual world champion angler and current member of the English international team, who has been carrying out a survey over the past ten days.And his report could influence the Tourist Board to pump more money into publicising the Quoile to world-wide anglers.Already Heaps has spent ten days fishing the Quoile and its ancillary waters ndash and his expert opinion is that itrsquos one of the best that Northern Ireland has to offer.KILLYLEAGH ndash The Vikings ed to invade Killyleagh this week ndash but this time it was a more peaceful visit.The invaders, instead of arriving by longship to pillage and plunder, came to look over youth provision in the area and they left totally impressed by the friendly reception they received.The unlikely invaders were a group of youth workers from Norway and Spain, who visited the area as part of a five-day study of youth work and facilities in the province.Local stops were at the Seaboard Sailing Centre in Killyleagh, Ardnabannon Outdoor Pursuits Centre in Castlewellan and Downpatrick Folk Club.Tuesday afternoon and night was spent in the area, with the first stop for the Norwegians being at the Seaboard centre.STRANGFORD ndash The recently formed Strangford Village Improvement Committee is to seek public support to have an order enforcing the one-way system in the village revoked.The committee discussed the system at their monthly meeting on Thursday and, after hearing of the failure of a meeting between the Department of Environment officials, traffic police and RUC representatives to have something done about it, they decided that the support of the public is needed.The committee chairman told members that the top level meeting had fallen on deaf ears and that nothing could be done about the situation.They had discussed the possibility of altering the system, the ious proposals which the committee had made as alternatives to it, and the fact that the majority of residents did not want the system.Unfortunately the Department rejected all the committeersquos proposals and insisted that the system, in its present form, would have to remain, said the chairman.The chairman had askedthe one-way system would not be made permanent until all attempts to accommodate the residentrsquos wishes had been made but the Department replied that the systemis already permanentand had been made so by Government order.

The online sales are set to continue as marts across the province begin to reopen.Cllr Lewis said the marts have a crucial role to play, allowing farmers to buy and sell livestock, at what is a traditionally a busy time of the year for them. Crucially, he said reopening marts will help with their respective incomes.He said there was ldquosignicant concern when the marts closed last month, with farmers expressing concern that they could find themselves overstocked with animals, particularly store cattle and ped calves.ldquoNews of the gradual reopening of local marts is an important development and will be widely welcomed across the agricultural sector at this time, said Cllr Lewis.The Slieve Croob councillor said DAERA was to be applauded for its decision, particularly given the key role farmers play in supplying the local food chain.ldquoIt is essential that in these uncertain times that farm production continues and that the local supply chain of quality food products can be available to the public, he continued.ldquoAt this time of year, many farmers are seeking to purchase stock for the grazing season and obviously others are selling their stock through the marts.

In many ways, itrsquos strange to think that by staying home I can save a le.My sister, Martina, loved le, but she was only  when she passed away in . Seasonal flu was the culprit which overwhelmed her body. COVID- is a frightening virus for the world to contend with. But it is especially frightening for people like me.Martina and I were born with spinal muscular atrophy , a genetic muscle wasting condition which robs people of the ability to walk, eat and breathe.I now live an active, productive le, thanks to many interventions that started in my childhood. I had a tube ed into my stomach to ensure that I could get the nutrients I could no longer eat as half of the muscles I use to swallow became paralysed. I also began using a non-invasive ventilator.COVID- has been on our radar since the beginning of January. I could do little but watch and wait. The plans would not be much dferent than my usual flu-time plans which ensure that I am in protective bubble, which allows my family to do everything it can to maintain an infection-free environment around me.Sure enough, almost  days ago, it was time to take action, with the Hollywood lockdown coming almost two weeks before it was implemented for everyone . And within a few days of the official lockdown beginning, I was also furloughed from work at a leading charity for people with conditions like mine.This has been one of the most emotionally and mentally dficult parts of the pandemic for me personally. Since I was  I have been working with and for this charity to improve lives. But within a few short days my le had drastically changed.Last September, I took eight flights in three weeks as I was selected for an Emerging Leaders programme by the US State Department for my work with disabled people and for a national conference for people with conditions like mine in London.Now, I have to stay within the bounds of my driveway. I can only go outside because my neighbours are all so far away. A small mercy.It quickly became obvious that getting food and other essential supplies was not going to be easy. Large supermarkets only started offering registration to extremely vulnerable customers a few weeks in to the lockdown.Before lockdown began few,any supermarkets offered a dedicated shopping time to extremely vulnerable customers, making getting food dficult during a time when it was flying off the shelves in panic buying.Crossgarrsquos SuperValu store got us through those first few weeks as it was able to deliver some essentials, while Gordons Pharmacy in Downpatrick has been delivering to us for some time now. But the pharmacyrsquos willingness to collect our preions has been a huge weight off our shoulders.I have now been able to register the family with Sainsburyrsquos for deliveries of other items we need to keep us ticking over, while Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos food delivery package service has been much more successful than those in other parts of the UK.The one that we have received included food that I could eat ndash something many of my friends in the rest of the UK are not so lucky with. The parcel is one small, yet very important part of the support our government is offering that it has got right, even though it has only been in place for us for three weeks.It took us several weeks to set up everything we needed, but I know that many others are still trying and are having to take drastic, le-endangering measures to keep it going.However, COVID- is not just a negative in the lives of disabled people.Virtual concerts, musicals on YouTube for all and even online quiz nights have become the new normal of socialising.Many jobs and educational institutions have moved staff to work from home and online, something that some disabled people were often refused when they asked for it. Even the community spirit and volunteering has left us feeling overwhelmed with offers of help.It is my hope that we can use this opportunity to see what our future can be.A more accepting and inclusive society, where disabled people can fully take part.

Unfortunately after all of the hard work of labour, I had to have a C-section and James Patrick was born at .pm on Tuesday. Ryan was allowed into the recovery room with me for two hours, but after that he didnrsquot see me or the baby until Thursday afternoon when we were allowed home.Prospective parents have been told that only one birth partner is currently allowed into the delivery ward, but onlythey are well and show no signs of coronavirus.Mrs Lawlor said: ldquoApart from the labour and the C-section, it was a positive experience. I think I was more anxious in the days coming up to the birth as I didnrsquot know what the restrictions would mean. In hindsight, it wasnrsquot that bad and it was probably worse for Ryan sitting at home. He rang his sister who has four children and asked when she thought he could do and she said clean the house.Baby James Patrick was only one day overdue, but Mrs Lawlor was delighted that he decided to make an appearance when he did. A clue to his birth weight may be due to his mother being ft  inches tall, while dad Ryanis ft  inches.While Mrs Lawlor did not have to wear a face mask during her labour, but the midwives who attended her afterwards were masked.She said: ldquoI suppose as this was an all-new experience for both Ryan and I we have nothing to compare it to.ldquoI remember waking up the next day, not that I slept that much in the night, and thought, lsquoOh no, I have a whole day by myself in here with this brand new babyrsquo. But the nurses and midwives are coming that often to do a iety of checks that the days went quite fast.ldquoHowever, I remember that I felt the second night in hospital was awfully long and I really struggled with dealing with James. Normally,you have a bit of help during the day and night, you can manage better to get a bit of sleep.ldquoThe strangest thing was seeing quite a few of the staff with masks and visors on. While they were all lovely, you lost a bit of the personal touch and connection with them because of the masks. Sometimesthey were maintaining social distancing and werenrsquot close to you, you couldnrsquot actually see who it was. The staff were all wonderful but you didnrsquot know what they looked like.As a sportswoman, who used to play for Loughinisland GACrsquos senior ladies and at county level, Mrs Lawlor is recovering well after the birth. Her husband is also well-known in local sporting circles as hersquos on the executive committee of Loughinisland GAC.They are becoming accustomed to the lsquonewrsquo normal at home of being first-time parents amid the lockdown.Mrs Lawlor said: ldquoWe have had visitors to the house looking through the window at the baby.

That canrsquot happen for very good reasons and I donrsquot know when that will change.

In a glittering playing career, the Ballykinlar man went on to win two more All-Ireland medals and established himself as one of the legends of the Gaelic football. Here, he selects his greatest Down team of all timeHIS name alone is enough to rekindle treasured memories of a time when Down football reigned supreme.Paddy lsquoMorsquo Doherty had the deadliest left foot in Ireland and he used it to maximum effect as Down swept all before them.Incredibly, itrsquos  years ago that Down took the sporting world by storm when they defeated Kerry to win the All-Ireland senior football title for the first time. It was also the first time that a team north of the border had won the Sam Maguire Cup.To reinforce their emergence as a new power in Gaelic football, Down retained their title the following year with Paddy as captain of the side which defeated Offaly and he was also a member of the Down team which won a third All-Ireland for the county in , Kerry again falling victim to the Red and Black machine in the final.As well as his three All-Ireland medals, Paddy won seven Ulster Championship, seven Railway Cup and three National League medals. He was the leading scorer in Ulster for eight seasons and in Ireland for three years.Now in his s, hersquos followed Downrsquos fluctuating fortunes ever since, relishing in theof the glory days in the early s, sharing in the disappointment of the barren times and casting a critical eye from the sidelines, though always with the optimistic outlook of the true fan.So what does he believe is the greatest Down team of all time Not surprisingly, given their accomplishments, hersquos largely selected his choice from his team-mates from the Sixties mdash though with typical modesty, he has not picked himself for the starting .ldquoYou have to remember that the Down team of s was the first to bring the Sam Maguire over the border, he says.ldquoThat was a really big achievement and we had beaten Kerry in the final. We had shown we were the best team in Ireland and we proved that again the following year in the final against Offaly after beating Kerry in the semi-final. We also beat Kerry in the  final, which meant that we had beaten them three times.ldquoKerry have always been the benchmark. If we had not beaten them, they would have won another three All-Irelands.Asked how his Down team would fare against present day sides ldquoItrsquos a dferent game now, what with the blanket defence and other things, but the Down teams of the s would have won in any era. Well, thatrsquos what I think, though Irsquom sure there are many people who would disagree. Eddie McKay Eddie won two All-Ireland medals with me in  and . He was a very good goalkeeper believe me, always safe, dependable and brave. He was an excellent shot stopper and made many excellent saves. I also played against him many times when Ballykinlar took on Dundrum. These were local parish derbies and everyone was trying to kill each other, but somehow Dundrum never managed to beat us. George Lavery George also won two All-Irelands in  and . He was the quiet man on the team, but there were few better man markers in the game and he would have been a star in any era. He had played a match of two for Antrim, but Maurice Hayes, who was secretary of the Down county board, persuaded him to sign for Down. He played as sweeper and was a good, tight marker. Leo Murphy Leo was a terric full back, tough and reliable. Not too many players could get past him and he could kick the ball a long distance. He also won two All-Irelands in  and . Pat Rice There was no one better than Pat Rice at catching a ball. His high fielding was magnicent and he was quick at clearing the ball. He gave away few chances and often kicked the ball out for Eddie McKay. He missed little and he wasnrsquot a dirty player at all. Dan McCartan One of only three Down players to win three All-Ireland senior medals along with Sean OrsquoNeill, Joe Lennon and myself, Dan is one of the all-time greats of Down football. He had outstanding ability, tackled hard and always looked for the quick clearance up to the front men. He could play anywhere as he showed when he moved to full back in the  final. Joe Lennon He was our captain in , though he did not play in the second after getting injured. He was a great captain and a terric leader. Joe placed a great emphasis on fitness and pioneered new coaching practices. He thought greatly about the game and was possibly ahead of his time. He was a very talented player. Tom OrsquoHare Tom played in the  team, but was good enough to get his place on any team. He was probably one of our best players that year. He was always steady and was great at delivering a ground ball. Jarlath Carey Jarlath won two All-Irelands in  and . He was a tireless worker, who was at home either in midfield or in attack. He was always forcing his way into the forward line and would wag his finger at me to go back into midfield to cover for him. I didnrsquot mind one bit, because he was good enough and I was fit enough to do what he asked. Colm McAlarney They called Colm lsquoThe Mighty Arklersquo after the famous racehorse because of his long strides up the field. Colm and Tom OrsquoHare were our two outstanding players in  and Colm was definitely one of the best midfielders in Ireland at that time, or any other time. Tony Hadden Tony won two All-Irelands in  and . He could fist the ball further than many players could kick it and he could also move into midfieldthings were going bad. He was tall and well built and could score a point as well as anyone. James McCartan A very strong player. Down would not have won anything without him because he took a lot of the abuse which would otherwise have been directed at me or Sean OrsquoNeill. He played a critical role in the  final against Offaly. We were two goals down in the first half and getting beaten. I crossed the ball to James who turned in mid air and put into the back of the net. Two more goals from Sean OrsquoNeill and Breen Morgan had us a goal up at half time, but it was his goal that turned things around. Sean OrsquoNeill You would have to say that Sean was the greatest Down footballer of them all. He was named in the GAA Team of the Century which says it all. We played well together, wherever I kicked the ball, Sean was there to get it. He had a wonderful sidestep and took a lot of abuse, but he never retaliated. He went on to become a successful manager and won the Sigerson Cup with Queenrsquos University. Mickey Linden Mickey was a flying machine and one of Downrsquos best ever forwards. He could blow defences away with his pace and score with either foot. He was also very versatile. You could play him anywhere and he would still be a threat. Perhaps his only failing was that he was too nice a player. He rarely made a foul. Won two All-Irelands in  and . Patsy OrsquoHagan Full forward and winner of two All-Irelands in  and . He could have played full forward, full back, or just about anywhere . He was that good. One of his best performances was Wembley Stadium during one of the Wembley Cup tournaments when he scored four goals against Galway. Breen Morgan They made them tough in Annaclone and for his size Breen was one of the hardest men on the field. He had broken his jaw before the  All-Ireland final, but went to the field without the protector which was made specially for him. He just threw it on to a chair. He was marked by Offalyrsquos Paddy McCormick, who was made of iron, but Breen was afraid of no one.Paddyrsquos substitutesDanny Kelly , Greg Blaney , Barry Breen , James Milligan , Ross Carr , Paddy OrsquoRourke , DJ Kane , Dan Gordon , Benny Coulter , Paddy Doherty ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 Ciara.jpg","title":"Portaferry athlete takes lockdown in her stride  ","story":"CIARA Mageeanrsquos Olympic ambitions may have been put on hold owing to coronavirus, but shersquos taking the lockdown in her stride mdash almost.The  year-old Portaferry runner, who is currently holed up in Manchester, says the current restrictions arenrsquot that far removed from her normal training regime.Even so, she says there are days when she does not want to run and she also misses her family and friends back at home.ldquoWersquore all struggling mdash therersquos days I donrsquot even want to go out and run now, and that the thing I have to do and the thingI always look forward to, she said.ldquoTherersquos days Irsquove cried and been like, lsquoWhat the hell is this rsquo Irsquove chatted to my team-mates about that and you justhave to find little methods ad mechanisms to try and help yourself.Last Thursday, Ciara was one of a number of leading sportsmen and women at the virtual launch of Sport NIrsquos Wellbeing Hub in response to the COVID- challengeThe hub provides instant access to helpful information, guidance and screening that is tailored specically to help care for wellbeing needs.It offers a range of innovative tools and resources, including guided self-assessment via lsquoChatbotrsquo, self-help programmes and digital intervention tools, a searchable five ways to wellbeingrsquo map and a wellbeing information library.Ciara said: ldquoOur mental health is so vital and right now is a challenging time for all of us.A full-time athlete and a member of Team New Balance, Ciara lives in Manchester in the same house with fellow athletes Jip Vastenburg and Adam Craig. Right now shersquos spending a lot more time inside the house than outside.ldquoThankfully my training hasnrsquot changed hugely, but wersquore in the house an awful lot more. The whole season has disappeared, which is very strange because wersquore training without any real focus.ldquoWersquore all watching the news and seeing whatrsquos happening the world over, and wersquore all far away from our families.ldquoLast week Jip lost her grandmother and she couldnrsquot get home for the funeral mdash she had to watch it over Skype.Ciara is worried about members of her own family. Her elder sister, Myra, is a registrar at a hospital in Belfast, her younger sister, Nuala, is a nursing student, younger brother Brendan has volunteered to work in the Nightingale hospital in London and her mother, Catherine, also works in the NHS, while an aunt is a pharmacist. She also misses her boyfriend, who she hasnrsquot seen in a month.Ciara, who won the m bronze medal at the  European Championships and bronze again at the European Indoor Championships last year, happens to be in the form of her le.She improved on her own Irish indoor m record in January and smashed her personal indoor best at m a month later.Training and events were geared towards the Tokyo Games this summer but the Olympics have been pushed back to  because of the coronavirus pandemic.ldquoIrsquom feeling in fantastic shape so itrsquos a little frustrating - we had the whole season planned out, she said.ldquoEven down to the training camps you were going to go on, down to the very day that I was going tointo the Olympic village and then the day that I would possibly leave the Olympic village.ldquoIt is quite tough because all of those plans are all scuppered, itrsquos all up in the air and we donrsquot know when wersquore going to be able to start racing.ldquoThe circuit doesnrsquot have a clue when theyrsquore going to be able to race - it depends on when countries allow more movement and, ultimately, does anybody know ldquoIrsquom not going to feel too sorry for myself because I know therersquos an awful lot of people out there that are in a much harder place than me.In a recent interview with RTE Ciara revealed something about how she is coping with the coronavirus restrictionsQ Whatrsquos the first thing you do in the morning A At the minute when I wake up Irsquove been giving my boyfriend a wee call to say good morning. Irsquom not quite sure when Irsquoll get to see him next as Irsquom in Manchester and he is in Dublin so itrsquos a nice way to start my day and always puts a smile on my face.Q Whatrsquos your favourite exercise A Oh I feel like I should say running, as I am an athlete, butI was to think of my favourite it would probably be a few things. I do miss playing a team sport so probably camogie, I absolutely loved dodge ball in school sothat was an option Irsquod pick that, and I do enjoy my gym workouts getting to lt weights.Q Is there one particular skill you practice every day A Running, every day! Running is a gross motor sport so fine skills arenrsquot really a part of my daily training, but I do work on dferent areas of my fitness every day. I have to work on things such as flexibility and fine muscle control every day to keep myself injury free. In the athlete house though we have been honing dferent skills while on lockdown, trying out dferent Tik Tok dances, press ups, and trying to get our eye in with the sling shot in the back garden!Q Netflix and chill or a nice evening jog A Both, usually we have an evening run, easy four miles... then we chill and watch a movie after dinner. We have had to mix training up a bit with the changes but in an ideal world we get both in.Q Name one book you want to read.A Irsquom making my way through a few Malcolm Gladwell books. I love coming away with new information and enjoy a book that challenges my thought process. Then when I need to flake out Irsquod pick something like A Man Called Ove. Soanyone could recommend books like this to me theyrsquod be on my ldquowant to read list.Q On a scale of  to , how good are your DIY skills A Ohhhh, Irsquom going to give myself an . -  here. My daddy is a joiner so I spent my le watching him make and fix things, and soon learned the names of tools and how to use them. I do know my limits though so I stay away from the plumbing... luckily in Portaferry my dad has a lot of friends who are alsotradesmen so they all help each other out.Q Have you a favourite pre-training meal to help you through a tough session A We usually train in the morning so I tend to eat an OTE DuoBar, the vanilla flavour in my favourite, and a cup of tea. When it come to racing in the evening, something easy to digest is usually what I go for... rice is always a winner.Q Name one movie you want to watch.A , I was planning on watching it in the cinema before the lockdown.Q Whatrsquos the best way to stave off boredom A Oh as a full-time athlete I feel Irsquove been preparing for lockdown for years. My le is basically train, eat, sleep. For me therersquos a few things I enjoy. I love chatting with my family, Irsquom usually on WhatsApp most of the day chatting or messaging and keeping in touch. I also love arts and crafts, Irsquoll be making postcards to post to my boyfriend and siblings to make them laugh, and currently my little cousin is teaching me the guitar via WhatsApp. She is a tough taskmaster, I have a lesson every Thursday and Monday and homework in between so that keeps me busy Q Have you any tips for training at home A Set yourself some goals that you can realistically achieve from home. We are allowed out for our daily exercise so you can get some cardio in outside, find a route that works for you and follow the guidelines. When it comes to working out inside, have fun. Find new alternatives, there are so many exercises we can do with body weight, or with stuff we have about the house so be creative and have a bit of craic. If you need any ideas check out social media, so many people are sharing home workouts. Give yourself a plan or schedule and try to stick to it. Being home means we can fall into the habit of sitting about and it can be hard to feel motivated. At the beginning of each week set out your plan for the week, what day, what time, and what exercise. Write it down and stick it somewhere you can see. Creating a routineduring these strange times means we can take back a little control.Q Name one documentary you want to see.A Anything with David Attenborough, I absolutely love animals and nature, and could listen to his voice all day.Q Have you discovered any new music or podcasts A My music taste is so ied but my wee sis and cousin Tara introduced me to Beoga and I absolutely love it. A lad from my hometown, Ryan McMullan also features in some of their songs, always a nice surprise hearing a weePortaferry accent as Irsquom listening.Q Is there one piece of housework you can no longer avoid A My own room! I actually enjoy housework, everywhere but my own bedroom. Irsquoll clean all day but canrsquot be bothered with my own mess!Q Favourite room of the house to spend time in A We are lucky that the Team NB Manchester athlete house is lovely and has lots of space so my favourite room ies depending in the time of day. In the morning my bedroom gets lovely light, it makes me smile sitting there chilling. Then when I want a bit of company the front room or kitchen is where we chill as a team and have the craic... andthe sun shines, which it does on the odd occasion over here, we have a lovely garden.Both Jip and Adam are enjoying learning how to puck about with my hurl..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 Railway.jpg","title":"Railway vandals condemned  ","story":"VANDALS have struck at the heritage steam railway in Downpatrick.The window of a railway carriage was smashed with a concrete block some time over the weekend.The damage was discovered by a volunteer at the Downpatrick and County Down Railway premises on Monday morning.Part of a concrete block was found inside the carriage along with evidence that the vandals had been smoking.

There is a transition period where you are not really the Archbishop of Armagh but you want to be as helpful as you can and you are also I suppose trying to work out what and how you are going to approach the task.The Archbishop-Elect explained the three facets to the roleHe said there was the appointment of Bishop of the Diocese of Armagh, which has a larger population with a great number of large towns in it than Clogher Diocese.In addition, there is the role of Primacy of All Ireland, considered lsquoFirst among equalsrsquo acknowledging there is another Primate in the southern province but to some degree to be an ambassador for the Church of Ireland.He added: ldquoThe third element is your place within the wider Anglican Communion which I have relatively little experience of. You become a member of the Primatersquos Meeting which is one of the instruments of communion within Anglicanism. There are a number of ways we hold ourselves together, the Lambeth Conference, the office of the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Anglican Consultative Council and more recently, the Primatersquos Meeting.So what type of church do you see under your leadership ldquoItrsquos dficult to speak for the church as the Church of Ireland General Synod is the body which has that authority. There is a saying that the Church of Ireland is synodically governed and episcopally led. What the Archbishop of Armagh can do is to speak to the Church and suggest can concern itself with. It sets a bit of a tone as well. Itrsquos about its spiritual le and its own governance and the need to acknowledge that like probably all institutions and all bodies some bits of it do well and some do not do well some bits are growing and some bits are shrinking some bitsvery well and some bitsnot so well and to maybe try to discover that the bits that do not do well could do a bit better, in terms of spiritual le and acknowledging there is a huge ersity within Anglicanism and to remember that thatrsquos all part of the Anglican heritage.ldquoThere are obviously particularly challenges at the moment, what the church says to society and what it does for the society in which it is placed. You cannot pretend it doesnrsquot live in a political context. Politics is not something that just happens in Parliament. Democracies are places where political discussion or dialogue are about what we can do together or decisions which are deeply embedded. There are institutions which are recognisable bodies in civil society such as the business community, trade unions, voluntary sector and churches are one of those. I think they have their particular things to say and its perfectly legitimate for them to say it.ldquoThe big imponderable at the moment is coronavirus and we have no idea how deeply that will affect the patterns of society. We could come out the other side of that challenge a changed society, with maybe small changes and maybe some very profound changes. Of course the other big external issue is Brexit which involves the relationships between the dferent regions within Ireland and the United Kingdom.ldquoI could be in both parts of that jurisdiction in one day praying for good governance for both of them and for their leaders, he said.In terms of reaching out to people in the Church of Ireland, the Archbishop-Elect recalled how a Northern Ireland Le and Times survey revealed around  per cent of people in Northern Ireland attend church at some point. He said the heyday for attending church was in the period from the late th Century to the period to the middle of the s. But he thinks current attendance is ldquoback to the old norm with fewer people committed to regular churchgoing.He rightly points out that churches are among the very few inter-generational bodies with people of dferent ages attending.The Archdeacon-Elect says people in very small rural parishes are committed to their churches in the sense that they are contributing to their community who feel it is being enriched with their presence. He said the church finds its place in the community.ldquoThe second challenge is what we are for ourselves as a group, as a faith community, how we build up the church, which canrsquot live in isolation but we have our particular family traditions - how we contribute to the ersity of Ireland, how we build up the church to be confident communities of faith and not hesitant or fearful or invisible communities of faith.He said for the Church of Ireland, there was tremendous heritage from Anglicanism.ldquoThe Church of Ireland has a particular way of doing things, liturgically. Liturgy is both the expression and source of our belief. Our vocation may be to hold together what on the face of it appear to be contradictory things is maybe one of our roles in religious and spiritual le. I have no ideait is the best way to be a Christian but it is our way and it seems to contribute something to the catholic church, the wider church.ldquoHarry McAdoo, a well-known Archbishop of Dublin and a great scholar, once said, lsquoIf I hadnrsquot been born an Anglican, I would have had to become one.rsquoThe Archbishop-Elect leaves Clogher Diocese after forging and maintaining good relations with other denominations.He said: ldquoI think the vast majority of committed Christian people see more in common with other Christian traditions than separating us. There is a very long history of ecumenism in the diocese of Armagh as well. There is a long association and friendship with Archbishop Eamon Martin and I hope we can continue to build relationships and friendships.The Archbishop-Elect trained for Church of Ireland ministry after a career in industry in which he held a senior role in Shorts and was for a time, Assistant Director of the CBI in Northern Ireland.ldquoThat probably give me some skills in organisation and about leadership. Irsquove been very lucky here. Irsquom not very fond of the word lsquoleaderrsquo in the ecclesiastical world but one of the things a leader does is to build a team around him. It is almost a contradiction in terms to be involved in a leadership role in Christianity, to do it on your own.ldquoThere are certain things as a bishop that end with you. There are plenty of lonely moments in that sense where you have to make decisions. But by and large business acclimatised me to working with all sorts of dferent people from all sorts of dferent backgrounds in dferent ways and to experience what every parishioner experiences, normal working le with those pressures.As Bishop of Clogher the new Archbishop-Elect held a number of positions nationally and internationally representing the Church.He was the Church of Ireland contact person to the Churches of the Porvoo Communion which represents the Scandanavian and Baltic Lutherans as well as the Spanish and Portuguese Anglicans and other Anglican churches and provinces from these islands making contact at senior level travelling with them.He has also held senior roles on the Irish Council of Churches, the national ecumenical instrument and also the Irish Inter-Church meeting, the latter which includes the Roman Catholic church.He said those bodies were important especially as ecumenism was becoming bland and it was important to keep going and keep talking.These inter-church bodies contribute to providing resources for churches around Brexit, homelessness, welfare reform and subjects churches would be expected to have a voice in.ldquoI enjoyed that hugely, I am coming to the end of that, six years in total two years as vice-President, two years as President and two years as outgoing Vice President. I will be involved again as a member of the Church Leadersrsquo Meeting.The Archbishop-Elect says of his time in Clogher Diocese ldquoItrsquos always been an aim of mine wherever I have worked to try to create a family atmosphere where there are degrees of mutual respect and degrees of mutual accountability. I remember saying that the diocese of Clogher is big enough to do thingswe all pull together in the same direction and small enough for everybody to be necessary for that to happen and to be accountable for what the contribution is.

These businesses and their industry representatives are to be congratulated on their can-do spirit, amid a deeply traumatic time for many private enterprises in the sector, which have staring into the abyss. \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Construction is a crucial part of any economy. Even in a society as small as Northern Ireland, at any one time tens of thousands of the hundreds of thousands buildings and other structures, including roads and bridges, need updating, or indeed replaced.There is an argument to be made that construction should never have stopped, because so much of it is outdoors and because this crisis began to emerge just at the time of year when the days are getting longer and the weather all the more suited to contractors making signicant progress on projects.But a slowto normality is better late than never. While builders tend not to be bunched in close proximity to each other, it is clear they often have to pass closely to one another on sites, so safe working is not without challenges.But the economy is at breaking point. It emerged yesterday that . million people, perhaps a quarter of the UK workforce, has been furloughed. This is entirely unsustainable.We should treat with suspicion, in some cases contempt, politicians whose only cry is for the government is to step forward with yet more case, thus hastening national financial ruin. It is much better to focus on figuring out how to help those enterprising folk who want to get back to achieving things, while protecting the well-being of their teams.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Irsquove grown up on the beach.ldquoI normally take landscape pictures because I love the water and some of the sunsets here are incredible, especially in the winter.Rochelle wrote her Instagram handle on the parcels, so that people who found them could send her a message.ldquoIt was just to make someone smile, and Irsquove had some lovely comments from people who got back to me on Instagram, she said.ldquoThey said they were going to put it up in their room and frame it.ldquoSome people were feeling a bit down and didnrsquot expect to find anything, so it cheered them up.ldquoMy job was done ndash the main purpose was to make people smile and it did - it made me smile too.ldquoI think itrsquos very important to say hello, especiallypeople are living by themselves orthey havenrsquot got their family around.ldquoWhen Irsquom normally walking the dog I say hello and have a chat, but itrsquos quite hard to do that now because everyone is quite wary.ldquoI donrsquot have to have that physical contact with someone to brighten up their day.ldquoArt is just a dferent  to communicate with. You knowsomeonersquos a bit shy and they donrsquot want to speak using words, they may want to draw a picture and open up that way instead.ldquoI think art can show feelings that words canrsquot quite express, so itrsquos a great idea to share that with the community.At a time of uncertainty and doubt, Rochelle ended with a message of hope and solidarity:ldquoI think as a community we could do so much more at this time, she saidldquoEveryone is concerned about how long it is going to last, but I am hopeful we can get past it, andwe all work together and remain positive we may come out of this in an even better situation than we was before.Rochelle would like to make clear that all parcels were fully sanitised.

Regenerate, based in Portadown, has been allocated £, in the latest round of IFI funding. A total of £, has been pledged to support six groups across Northern Ireland and continue outreach work with marginalised communities.Pictured: Participants of the Regener project with coordinator, Tony McAleer. : User The funding will help sustain engagement efforts across local communities, develop capacity and ensure support for all throughout the current health crisis and beyond.The package was announced at a recent Board meeting and will be distributed across the Fund’s three core programmes, which all work with marginalised communities who have not previously or have only partially participated in peace and reconciliation activity.The Peace Impact Programme operates in areas with high levels of socio economic and social deprivation with a particular emphasis on engaging with disaffected youths who are more vulnerable to paramilitary recruitment. The unique Personal Youth Development Programme targets the most at risk - year olds who come from a range of complex backgrounds. IFI Chairperson, Paddy Harte commented on the funding: “The journey towards a peaceful society takes many forms and this funding is essential to help boost community spirit and leadership at an extremely challenging time.Keith McCann from Regenerate said: “During the current crisis we are working hard to deliver for our town. We have a telephone helpline working with over  people each week providing conversation, support and signposting to services. We are also working on new video content and running zoom online sessions to help reduce fear and anxiety. Finally, we are delivering food hampers and around  hot meals every week to those who need it the most. “For us, community engagement and support from the IFI is more crucial than ever. People are watching news and social media more and this information can often create fear within the community. Our work is very important and this funding will ensure we continue to keep connecting on a personal level and building trust with people.”A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.
