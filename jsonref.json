But Democrats should be carefulHis victory claim was swiftly ridiculed, but I would strongly urge Democrats who mocked him to exercise less glee in their own celebrations.‘Tomorrow will be a new day in America,’ said House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi.But will it?In many ways these were indeed transformative elections.It’s great that record numbers of women and minorities were elected into the House, including two Muslim women, two Native American women, and the youngest ever woman to win a place in Congress, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.It’s also great to see the first openly gay governor elected.  In many ways these were indeed transformative elections. It was great to see the first openly gay governor elected, in Colorado, and a youngest ever woman to win a seat in CongressBut the reality of these results is that nothing much has changed to curb Trump’s actual power, and it’s quite feasible that losing the House may turn out to be the best thing that could happen to him.Here’s why: many Democrats are now openly salivating at the thought of launching a full-blown assault on Trump with endless investigations and subpoenas to try to destabilise his presidency.They want to go after him for everything from his tax returns to his cell phone use and connections with Russia, and now have far more powers to do so.But such a strategy would simply play into his hands.Trump loves a fight, and he particularly loves playing the victim of liberal efforts to demonize him.  Trump loves a fight, and he particularly loves playing the victim of liberal efforts to demonize him - and Democrats should avoid playing into his hands\u0027Sit down. You are very rude. You are FAKE NEWS\u0027: Trump...\u0027Mia Love gave me no love\u0027: Trump goes down hit list of...Share this articleIt doesn’t take a political genius to realise he would turn these attacks into a massive electoral asset, constantly rallying his base to help him defy this concerted effort to destroy him.Furthermore, if the Democrats actually try to impeach him, not only would it fail because they don’t have control of the Senate, but it would make Trump more popular - just as it did when Republicans in the House impeached Clinton.So the Democrats need to be smarter than just spending the next two years lobbing investigative bombs at Trump because they will only blow up in their faces.They also need to stop using celebrities as front line political weapons - because it simply doesn’t work.Pop superstar Taylor Swift, very ill advisedly in my opinion given her huge popularity in middle America, broke her long-time political silence to publicly endorse Democrat Phil Bredesen in the Tennessee Senate race – but he still lost.Oprah Winfrey, arguably America’s biggest celebrity, strongly campaigned for Georgia’s Democrat gubernatorial candidate Stacey Adams – but she also lost.  Democrats need to stop using celebrities. Taylor Swift broke her long-time political silence to publicly endorse Democrat Phil Bredesen in the Tennessee Senate race – but he still lost. Oprah Winfrey strongly campaigned for Georgia’s Democrat gubernatorial candidate Stacey Adams – but she also lostThis shouldn’t be surprising.Lest we forget, Hillary Clinton believed star power would help drive her to the White House, which is why she constantly appeared with the likes of Lady Gaga and Beyonce at her election rallies.The tactic backfired because many Americans resented seeing her waltzing around with privileged and elitist millionaire celebrities as they struggled to find work or feed their kids. Just as they resented being labelled a ‘basket of deplorables’ by Clinton for supporting Trump, who at least went down to see them and hear their problems.Liberal celebrities today raced to gloat about winning back the House on Twitter, but Twitter does not represent the majority of Americans, which is why those same liberal celebrities got such a seismic shock when Trump won in 2016 and why they haven’t stopped shrieking ever since.What they don’t seem to realise is that nobody cares what they have to say about politics. If they did, Hillary would be President.          Lest we forget, Hillary Clinton believed star power would help drive her to the White House, which is why she constantly appeared with the likes of Lady Gaga. But nobody cares what celebrities have to say about politics. If they did, Hillary would be PresidentSo my advice to the Democrats is to ditch the celebrities.And yes, of course I realise there is a humongous irony in saying this because Trump himself is himself a celebrity. In fact, he’s the biggest celebrity in the world.But Trump achieved his fame by being a ruthless, hardnosed businessman and that’s both how he won the presidency and how he is now running the country.His business experience makes him a very capable and dangerous competitor, communicator and campaigner.His star power from The Apprentice enables him to suck up TV oxygen like nobody else in political history.And for a guy in his 70s, he has incredible energy and stamina.So the Democrats are facing a quite unique opponent.To take him on, the party needs a winning new message and someone who can deliver it in the same clear, repetitive and hugely effective way that Trump delivers his.And I don’t see any sign of either of those things yet.Donald Trump won the presidency in 2016 by saying he was going to Make America Great Again.He’s pursued that goal in the most polarising, controversial, and often highly offensive manner imaginable.Some of his bull-in-a-china-store style has undeniably worked, especially his aggressive tax cuts and slashing of regulations that have sent the economy surging and been great for jobs.Some of it has been deeply unedifying, not least his dog whistle rhetoric about immigration.But whatever you think of Trump, these midterm election results prove that many tens of millions of Americans are buying into his mission and don’t think he’s doing too badly.If the Democrats are to have any hope of beating him in 2020, then they have got to come up with a better plan than screaming ‘Trump’s a monster’ or ‘Oprah and Taylor say don’t vote for Trump’.          Some of his bull-in-a-china-store style has undeniably worked, but I was pleased to see President Trump strike a more bi-partisan tone at his presser todayI was pleased to see President Trump strike a more bi-partisan tone at his presser today. He has a chance now to pivot to a more inclusive style of leadership and I hope he takes it.I also hope he and the media, especially my old employers at CNN, stop their mutually self-serving but increasingly embarrassing public feuding that is now turning their pressers like today into increasingly absurd WWE-style extravaganzas. But make no mistake: he won the midterms.If the Democrats can’t see that, or accept it, then Trump won’t just win again in 2020, he will drown them with his own brutal, uncompromising red tsunami. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/11/08/14/06609CF6000003E8-6364691-Republicans_have_predicted_a_crisis_for_the_royal_family_when_Ch-a-13_1541688942477.jpg","title":"Prince Charles says NOT meddling monarch extraordinary TV admission","story":"    In a major documentary to mark his 70th birthday next week, the heir to the throne tackles head-on the issue of his controversial lobbying          The documentary is a fascinating portrait of the king-in-waiting, featuring candid contributions from family including his sons William and Harry and wife, the Duchess of Cornwall          The prince happily shows the documentary crew an arboretum that he has planted for his eldest grandchild at Birkhall, his Scottish home, which he calls \u0027George\u0027s wood\u0027          So close: The Duchess of Cornwall gives Prince Charles a gentle punch as they walk their dog Beth at Birkhall  Charles (pictured in Ghana with Camilla) says he has to change when he becomes king but Lord Hain, a former cabinet member, says he shouldn\u0027t be \u0027viewless and silent\u0027.

But the idea somehow that I\u0027m going to go on exactly the same way, if I have to succeed, is complete nonsense because the two situations are completely different.\u0027However, the prince is unrepentant about his public campaigning over the past half century. He says archly: \u0027I always wonder what meddling is? I mean I always thought it was motivating.\u0027But I\u0027ve always been intrigued, if it\u0027s meddling to worry about the inner cities as I did 40 years ago and what was happening or not happening there – the conditions in which people were living. If that\u0027s meddling I\u0027m very proud of it.\u0027Documentary-maker John Bridcut admitted Prince Charles appeared to resent the word meddling when he asked him the question.He said today: \u0027He bridled a bit at the word meddling and said he prefers the word motivating\u0027.Mr Bridcut said Charles\u0027 wife Camilla says the \u0027burden\u0027 of being the next monarch \u0027does not weigh heavily on his shoulders because he has known all his life it is going to happen\u0027.He added: \u0027Actually he told me he it might be rather relieving to step back from that rather more front line role he\u0027s carried on as Prince of Wales\u0027. Former cabinet minister Lord Hain says \u0027I don\u0027t see why the future monarch should be expected to be completely viewless and silent on everything\u0027Lord Hain added: \u0027I\u0027ve never been a monarchist, but if you believe in a monarchy, then I don\u0027t see why the monarch currently or the future monarch should be expected to be completely view-less and silent on everything.\u0027Asked if he thought it was a shame that Charles has said he will not speak out on issues, Lord Hain said: \u0027No. I respect his point of view, just as I respected our dialogues when I was in government.\u0027But anti-monarchy campaigners Republic said: \u0027The royal PR machine are facing a crisis as Charles prepares to take the throne.\u0027The organisation added: \u0027Charles has routinely abused his position of power, privately lobbying cabinet ministers and influencing government policy with his own political agenda. \u0027King Charles is just around the corner and we should be having a wide-ranging national debate about our country\u0027s future, not a coronation by default.\u0027Three men found guilty of murdering South African student\u0027Horrible\u0027: South Norwood community appalled by Grenfell bonfireSurvivors of California music bar shooting seen hugging and cryingToddler left with HORRIFIC injuries after being bitten 15 timesMoment child killer Darren Vickers\u0027 reveals his true intentionsMoment Derek Potter confesses in a pub he had strangled his wifeNew documentary to give inside look at Prince Charles at 70Recording reveals moment the guns fell silent at the end of WW1Documentary shows how head shake gave away child killer Darren Vickers    Charles says: \u0027You can\u0027t be the same as the sovereign if you\u0027re the Prince of Wales or the heir.

It reveals that:Charles is such a workaholic that he often falls asleep at his desk at midnight with a memo stuck to his foreheadWhen the Duchess of Sussex found out her father would not be walking her down the aisle, Charles immediately volunteeredPrince William wishes his father could spend more time with grandchildren George, Charlotte and LouisAlthough born to be king, Charles does not think about his destiny muchWilliam insists he wants to be his \u0027own man\u0027 as Prince of Wales.Documentary-makers were  given unrivalled access to Charles for a year, watching him at close quarters both at work and in private.And although a sensitive subject with the prince, the issue of his life-long lobbying was difficult to ignore.Over the years, the prince has been accused of risking the monarch\u0027s constitutional impartiality by meddling in government policy.Tales of his so-called \u0027black spider memos\u0027, the regular missives written to ministers calling for action in his distinctive scrawled handwriting, have left many uneasy about his ability to be a neutral monarch.In the interview the prince confronts the issue directly, pointing out that as the longest-serving heir to the throne in British history – he inherited the role at the age of just four – it was his duty to find a way to live a productive public life.He compares his role to that of the 14th-century Black Prince, a predecessor as Prince of Wales and commander during the Hundred Years\u0027 War.Charles says: \u0027Each one of my predecessors had to find out how they would do it, a lot of them dropped dead or were killed before they got very far.\u0027I mean the Black Prince was the first one and he rushed about doing all the complicated bits and fighting battles while his father sat somewhere else. So you know he was busy winning his spurs, and in a sense that\u0027s still what has to happen.\u0027Charles says as a young man he was encouraged to \u0027get involved\u0027 by political leaders. \u0027I remember Jim Callaghan who was prime minister and he invited me to come and spend the whole day at No 10,\u0027 he recalled.\u0027I sat in on all his meetings, and the Cabinet meeting and his briefing before going to the House of Commons for Question Time, and then I was sent round all the different ministries to find out what went on.\u0027You have to make of it what you feel is right. There\u0027s nothing laid down – that\u0027s what makes it so interesting, challenging and of course complicated.\u0027When pushed by Mr Bridcut, who points out that people have openly expressed concern that he won\u0027t be able to resist getting involved, Charles explodes: \u0027I\u0027m not that stupid.\u0027He agrees that he could continue to use his \u0027convening\u0027 power – the ability to bring disparate people and groups together – but only \u0027with the agreement of ministers\u0027.Charles rarely gives interviews of a personal nature. The last one was to presenter Jonathan Dimbleby in 1994 when he admitted adultery.And he has never confronted the issue of how he intends to conduct himself as monarch before, believing it unseemly to refer to anything that involves the death of his mother.But it is understood the prince believes now is the time to lay to rest the suggestion that he will be anything other than constitutionally neutral.Charles\u0027s mention of his work in the inner cities is a reference to the highly successful Prince\u0027s Trust for disadvantaged youngsters.He also describes himself as a \u0027risk taker\u0027 when it comes to some of his public work, like Dumfries House, the Scottish stately home that he controversially saved after taking out a £20 million loan and has since turned into a thriving charity hub. The prince says: \u0027Having taken the risks, I believe in living dangerously.\u0027Prince, Son and Heir - Charles at 70 is on BBC One at 9pm tonight.Three men found guilty of murdering South African student\u0027Horrible\u0027: South Norwood community appalled by Grenfell bonfireSurvivors of California music bar shooting seen hugging and cryingToddler left with HORRIFIC injuries after being bitten 15 timesMoment child killer Darren Vickers\u0027 reveals his true intentionsMoment Derek Potter confesses in a pub he had strangled his wifeNew documentary to give inside look at Prince Charles at 70Recording reveals moment the guns fell silent at the end of WW1Documentary shows how head shake gave away child killer Darren Vickers    Beaming Prince Charles received an early birthday treat yesterday – a compliment from a supermodel.

(Pictured, father and son at the Invictus Games in 2014)HANDS-ON GRANDFATHERAsked whether his father has \u0027time to be a grandfather on top of everything else\u0027, William answers carefully.In recent years, Charles is said to have privately expressed his frustration that he doesn\u0027t get to see as much of his grandchildren as the Middleton family, a claim his aides have always furiously dismissed.But his elder son makes clear that he would like to have more \u0027family time\u0027 with his hard-working father.William says: \u0027It\u0027s something I\u0027m working more heavily on, put it that way. I think he does have time for it, but I would like him to have more time with the children.          In recent years, Charles is said to have privately expressed his frustration that he doesn\u0027t get to see as much of his grandchildren as the Middleton family, a claim his aides have always furiously dismissed\u0027Now he\u0027s reached his 70th year it\u0027s a perfect time to consolidate a little bit because, as most families would do, you are worried about having them around and making sure their health\u0027s OK – and he\u0027s the fittest man I know but equally I want him to be fit until he\u0027s 95.\u0027So having more time with him at home would be lovely, and being able to play around with the grandchildren. \u0027Because when he\u0027s there, he\u0027s brilliant. But we need him there as much as possible.\u0027Camilla adds: \u0027He will get down on his knees and crawl about with them for hours, you know making funny noises and laughing, and my grandchildren adore him, absolutely adore him. He reads Harry Potter and he can do all the different voices and I think children really appreciate that.\u0027 Aides say Charles could not be prouder to be a grandfather.The prince happily shows the documentary crew an arboretum that he has planted for his eldest grandchild at Birkhall, his Scottish home, which he calls \u0027George\u0027s wood\u0027.LITTER PICKERReferring to his passion for the environment and life-long campaign to highlight the perils of climate change, Harry reveals his father still can\u0027t help \u0027banging the drum\u0027 even when he sits down with his sons to dinner.He tells his brother: \u0027You know how frustrated he gets. But he\u0027s done an amazing job, and without telling us what he should be doing or the direction that we should go in, he\u0027s just let us learn from the nature of the job, learning from him, learning from Mummy.\u0027The programme reveals how Charles would take his sons litter picking when they were on holiday with him.He has also passed down some of his other quirkier traits.

You know it\u0027s dark\u0027.\u0027I go \u0027We only need one light, we don\u0027t need like six\u0027, and all of a sudden it becomes a habit and those small habit changes he\u0027s making, every single person can do. And I think that is one of the key lessons certainly that I felt that he taught us.\u0027William agrees, adding: \u0027I know I\u0027ve got serious OCD on light switches now which is terrible.\u0027He does life the way that he advocates. He did take to heart the criticism quite a lot when he was younger.\u0027247 WORKAHOLICIf there is one thing the prince\u0027s family is agreed on, it\u0027s their desire – not that he will ever listen – for him to slow down.Harry jokes: \u0027He does need to slow down, this is a man who has dinner ridiculously late at night.\u0027And then goes to his desk later that night and will fall asleep on his notes to the point of where he\u0027ll wake up with a piece of paper stuck to his face.\u0027William agrees, saying: \u0027He has amazing personal discipline. So, he has – and it\u0027s frustrated me in the past a lot – he has a routine.\u0027The only way to fit all this stuff in is things have to be compartmentalised. The man never stops.          If there is one thing the prince\u0027s family is agreed on, it\u0027s their desire – not that he will ever listen – for him to slow down\u0027I mean when we were kids there was bags and bags and bags of work that the office just sent to him. We could barely even get to his desk to say goodnight to him.\u0027The Duchess of Cornwall says she tried to encourage her husband to \u0027pace himself\u0027 but admits he is too driven to take any notice.She smiles ruefully: \u0027My father once said to me, \u0027As you get older, you\u0027ve got to do one thing and that is pace yourself\u0027. And I would love to tell him to pace himself, but I\u0027m afraid that\u0027s not going to happen.\u0027MAN OF DESTINYCharles neatly sums up the way his life has been mapped out before him, with astonishing matter of factness.He says: \u0027When my mama succeeded and became Queen when by grandfather died so young, aged 57, I ended up becoming heir to the throne at aged four.\u0027And yet his wife says it is a weight he bears lightly.Asked whether the crown is something he often thinks about, Camilla says: \u0027No, I don\u0027t. \u0027I think his destiny will come, he\u0027s always known it\u0027s going to come and I don\u0027t think it does weigh on his shoulders at all.\u0027When she is asked if it is something he talks about, the duchess replies: \u0027Not very much, no. It\u0027s just something that\u0027s going to happen.\u0027  The Queen and Prince Charles surrounded by guests on stage at the Royal Albert Hall in London during a star-studded concert to celebrate the Queen\u0027s 92nd birthday.

I would encourage him to remain optimistic because I think it can be very easy to become despondent and negative. \u0027But with hopefully his children and his grandchildren and hopefully more grandchildren to come, he can get energy from the family side and then carry on his leadership role.\u0027William adds: \u0027I\u0027m very pleased that he\u0027s made 70. You know if you ask him if the job\u0027s done, it\u0027s not.\u0027But more than anything I\u0027d like to see his passions and his interests and the things he\u0027s been campaigning for come to fruition completely for him. He hasn\u0027t even reached the point that his natural progression should do – i.e. being monarch. So, you know he\u0027s still got his job to do.\u0027      Do it like the Duchess of Sussex in a Goat dressStill available in blackMeghan Markle\u0026#39s Givenchy gown took the world\u0026#39s breath away when she walked down the aisle to meet her prince, and that Stella McCartney evening dress was just as beautiful.

He was 32 when he married for the first time, he romanced Mrs Camilla Parker Bowles more than 30 years before marrying her, and he has now waited until the eve of his 70th birthday before letting the world know what sort of king he will be.For many years, he has unburdened himself of his views on architecture, education, the environment, homeopathy and countless other subjects.He has shared his thoughts on faith, on duty and on his respect for tradition. But on kingship and the kind of monarch he sees himself as, he has largely been silent. In many ways, of course, it has been an entirely commendable position to adopt. Given the longevity of the Queen, to have done otherwise would have been not just discourteous to his mother, but potentially dangerous.However, the absence of any clear vision of what life under King Charles III will be like has led to a situation where his public interventions – notably those infamous \u0027black spider\u0027 memos to ministers – have seen him cast as a meddling monarch in waiting.Now, with one eye on the future and from the comfortable position of almost reaching his 70th – his birthday is next Wednesday – he has chosen to deal with these vital issues for the first time.Questioned in a TV documentary about those accusations and about his future role, his answers are both surprising and revealing.The film also sheds an intriguing light on his relationship with his sons William and Harry, and on his grandchildren. \u0027When he\u0027s there he\u0027s brilliant,\u0027 says William pointedly. \u0027But we need him there as much as possible.\u0027 What emerges from this 60-minute documentary is the most compelling – and intimate – picture of the Prince of Wales since the controversial Jonathan Dimbleby programme almost a quarter of a century ago.But while that film marked his anguish over his affair with Camilla, and hastened the final break-up of his marriage to Princess Diana, this one is likely to be remembered for him finally setting out how he will operate as king.Clearly irked by questions about his lobbying and the accusation of meddling, the prince says he is proud to have worried about inner cities and to have tackled other issues.Pressed about whether such campaigning will continue once he comes to the throne, he replies: \u0027I\u0027m not that stupid.\u0027Then, with one penetrating aside, he says: \u0027I think it\u0027s vital to remember there\u0027s only room for one sovereign at a time, not two. But the idea somehow that I\u0027m going to go on exactly the same way, if I have to succeed, is complete nonsense.\u0027Here, in a handful of words we get to the heart of Prince Charles. On the one hand he is explaining why he has said nothing about his future role. There is the deep respect and, yes, love, for his 92-year-old mother, and a refusal to take anything for granted. \u0027If I have to succeed\u0027 is a telling phrase in itself.But there is another message here, too. And this one is directed at Prince William, who will himself succeed to Prince of Wales when the time comes: who knows, it might even be a warning.Though even the most enthusiastic of William\u0027s supporters would admit that the 36-year-old heir in line is more likely to model himself on his inscrutable grandmother than on his outspoken father.Indeed, in a candid aside William, who has not always had an easy relationship with Charles, says: \u0027I want to be my own man and take my own style.\u0027As for the future, Charles is unequivocal. Without mentioning the word king, he says: \u0027Clearly I won\u0027t be able to do the same things I\u0027ve done as heir.\u0027He cites Shakespeare as illustration: \u0027You only have to look at Henry V or Henry IV Part I and 2 to see the change that can take place, because if you become the sovereign you play the role in the way that it is expected.\u0027Many will no doubt be reassured by such positivity from the prince, especially those alarmed that – on occasions – he does blunder into the political arena. The Queen, of course, has been nothing short of remarkable in observing the convention that royals do not express their views on any area of public life.What this film seems to suggest is that, as the moment of his elevation to the crown grows closer, he is taking these symbolic positions of the monarch more seriously and more thoughtfully.          Prince Charles never does things in haste. He was 32 when he married for the first time, he romanced Mrs Camilla Parker Bowles more than 30 years before marrying her, and he has now waited until the eve of his 70th birthday before letting the world know what sort of king he will beThe picture that also emerges is one of contentment. Only once, in a project which ned a year in the prince\u0027s life did I – a long-time observer of Charles\u0027s princely temperament – get a glimpse of the crotchety prince.It comes during a clip filmed a Birkhall, the prince\u0027s Scottish retreat which he inherited from the Queen Mother. In the gardens there he has planted an arboretum which he refers to as \u0027George\u0027s wood\u0027, because he began planting around the time of the birth of his first grandson.He is walking with Camilla in the gardens when she begins to reminisce about the prince\u0027s long-dead Jack Russell, Tigger. The dog was part of his life at the time his marriage to Diana was breaking up and, despite his second wife\u0027s endeavours, he clearly did not want to discuss the pet. All the same, the nervous tics, the fidgeting with cuffs and never knowing what to do with his hands, were largely absent from this warmest of portraits.The relationship with his sons, which has been troubled, seems to have much improved. They are generous in their praise of their father – especially Harry, who talks of the workaholic prince falling asleep at his desk.He mentions his gratitude to his father for walking Meghan down the aisle at his wedding in May. And in a nod to his American wife, not used to late dining, he suggests that in the future his father might eat dinner earlier in the evening.Camilla, of course, is ever present, saying on air the kind of supportive messages that have been such an integral part of their decades-long relationship.Significantly, she discloses that Charles does not fret about the future. Does his destiny weigh heavily on his shoulders, she is asked at one point? \u0027No,\u0027 she responds, \u0027his destiny will come, he\u0027s always known it\u0027s going to come. I don\u0027t think it does weigh on his shoulders at all.\u0027There is, naturally, no contribution from the Queen. But wouldn\u0027t it have been fascinating to have heard from Prince Philip?This was, in many ways, a clearing of the decks interview, not unlike the decision he took on another birthday a few years ago to correct some long-repeated misconceptions about him. He said it was untrue that he had seven boiled eggs presented to him for breakfast each day, and explained that Camilla still has her own home because she likes to spend time there with her children and grandchildren.This exercise is far more serious – and risky. Will his openness about how he will reign be believed? If he can succeed in persuading critics of that, then it will have been a gamble worth taking."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/11/07/22/05502C65000007D0-6364743-image-m-11_1541629248652.jpg","title":"Harry says proud Prince Charles stepped walk Meghan aisle","story":"Prince Harry says his father did not hesitate to step in after the Duchess of Sussex’s father pulled out of walking her down the aisle in May          Millions of viewers were left deeply moved as the prince turned to his father and said, ‘Thank you Pa’, as Charles completed the walk down St George’s Chapel at Windsor with Meghan on his arm          When it became clear that Meghan wouldn’t have her reclusive father to support her, Harry went to his‘For him that’s a fantastic opportunity to step up and be that support, and you know he’s our father so of course he’s going to be there for us.

We join him to see how friendly Brexit Britain really isRat-a-tat-tat! There’s someone at your door … but not someone you’re expecting. Rather, it’s a young Italian man and he’s asking a rather bizarre question: would you like to swap doormats with him?What would you do next? Invite him in for a cup of tea to hear more about his proposal? Or shoo him away and alert Neighbourhood Watch that there’s a weirdo in the area?It’s something Alex Urso has been finding out as part of a month-long artist’s residency in London. Intrigued by the UK’s current political climate, he wanted to know just how open-hearted the capital was and came up with The Welcome Project. He would go door-knocking around the city, armed with fresh new doormats, to see if residents would be happy to exchange their mats as a token of friendship. If the encounter went well, he would leave with somebody’s old doormat, which he could use as material for an artwork.“The plan is to make a mosaic out of all the doormats, one that represents Londoner’s willingness to be open,” says Urso, when I join him for a chilly afternoon’s door-knocking around Hammersmith. I soon get an idea of how time-consuming the project must have been. Not every home has a doormat to swap, and even when they do, most raps on the door are left unanswered. We rouse the odd barking dog, but there’s rarely sign of a person. One elderly lady opens her door, but is hard of hearing and can’t understand what Urso is offering, so we leave apologetically. Another woman comes to the porch, but won’t open it, suspicious of what Urso wants. As he explains his artistic project to her through the glass panels, she tells him that she’s actually on a phone call and hasn’t got time for it today.Still, Urso has had worse encounters. In Islington, a man started yelling at him – “Politics is crap! Europe is crap! England is crap!” – until he beat a retreat. “I wanted to speak with him about these feelings, but there was no way to calm him down,” Urso explains.Finally, we knock on a door that opens. It has a zig-zagged doormat outside that has particularly taken Urso’s fancy and the woman is willing to listen to his story. After hearing him out she says she would be happy to swap mats, but needs to speak to her husband first, as it was a present from his mother. Unfortunately, he’s away, and once again Urso leaves empty-handed, more than a little dejected. I start to wonder if anyone in London will give us a doormat today. But several knocks later we strike gold. Caroline is from France and, despite retaining an air of bemusement, is more than happy to chat to us about what it means to be welcoming in modern Britain: “I feel that everyone in this street is pretty open,” she says. The only thing she can’t understand is why anyone would want to swap a fresh new doormat (classic brown with “Welcome” written in black) for her well-trodden one.“Most people are suspicious at first. They think you must be selling something,” Urso tells me over coffee and a croissant in a cafe after our adventure. “But they are normally willing to speak to me, to tell me their stories. There’s only a small minority of people who are closed.”Of course, he’s aware that being willing to swap doormats is no concrete gauge of a welcoming attitude. But he says he didn’t measure openness solely by the doormat exchange, but rather in terms of dialogue. Only if an encounter was deemed to be hostile would he go as far as including this in his mosaic, with an upturned doormat to represent unwelcomeness in ugly black rubber. Alongside the 35 mats Urso has collected when we meet, there are seven black spots – not a bad ratio.Urso talks about the positive stories he’s had during his travels – like John from Barnet who was so concerned about the cold weather that he sent him on his way with a bottle of whisky to keep him warm. While not exactly scientific, Urso has gone to great lengths to absorb each part of London. Armed with a gigantic map, various highlighter pens and a notebook to record each response, he’s been knocking on doors in every direction, from the centre all the way out to the suburbs in zone six. And while not wanting to saddle his project with politics, he made sure to visit London’s leave-voting areas such as Havering and Barking and Dagenham, to see if there was a difference in response there. He says, if anything, the leave voters were more welcoming. “There may have been more disagreement but they were more open to dialogue,” he says. “Whereas in remain areas people could be more suspicious, especially when you encroach on their private property, perhaps because they have more? It explains a lot about the political trends these days.”Urso’s work is often about building bridges: the 31-year-old currently lives in Warsaw, where he is also heavily involved in curatorial projects that connect Polish and Italian artists. But after several weeks of meeting strangers in London, what does he feel he’s learned about them?“That there’s a lot of confusion around the politics,” he says, “but also that nearly everybody wants to be open. They just need a chance.”Indeed, there’s something quite heartwarming about seeing Caroline’s initial scepticism dissolve into a warm chat about embracing strangers. If nothing else, Urso’s project should make us all reappraise how we feel next time we hear an unfamiliar knock on the door."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1be3169a51ec3a0e03477cccf49bbb7d0ff0dd46/0_109_2778_1666/master/2778.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1662f24a9f84661a187379f71f70be4f","title":"rankin best photograph supermodel cow farm mask","story":"‘I didn’t think models were being treated as people. So we borrowed a farm, put some in masks – and shot them in a cow barn then a pigsty’ This was taken at a time when I was becoming a little jaded about fashion. It’s a commentary on the way I thought some models were treated, right in front of me. I felt they weren’t being treated like people. I had done another project, Breeding, about how models have an almost homogenous look, with everything equal and in particular proportions. So I suppose I was already interested in livestock as a theme.People always call me a fashion photographer, but really I’m a commercial portrait photographer. I’ve never felt I fully belonged in the fashion world, particularly the churning business side of it all. You hear these ridiculous things, like someone saying: “I have to fly this dress on Concorde!” Why would you ever have to fly a dress on Concorde?I had done a version of this already at Kentish Town City Farm in 1993, with the stylist Katie Grand. My studio is just down the road and I’ve got a bit of a soft spot for the farm. For this shot, though, we wanted to make it look very realistic so I ended up borrowing someone’s farm in Dorset. Well, I think the farm was in Dorset. I know it was absolutely miles away.I’m a massive fan of Monty Python and that sort of British comedy. I thought: “Why not do a really funny fashion shoot actually about cows and sheep?” Fashion can be so absurd: I just wanted to put a mirror up to it, do something ridiculous. I knew people would either really like it or be really annoyed by it.It was a fun shoot, but it was uncomfortable for the models. We used a cow barn, a pigsty, and a sheep field. This one is from the barn, where we also set up a white studio. I shot the cow with Polaroids, both sides, to make it look hyperrealistic. But I also used the Mamiya RZ67 I had back then. I do that sometimes: double up on cameras, just in case one approach doesn’t work. There was just something funny and silly about bringing a model on set, then putting hooves and a cow mask on them. It could be anyone under there. I can’t remember who made the jacket – probably someone really important who I’ve now forgotten.I’ve always loved animals. A few years ago, I became a vegetarian. I have three dogs and I take photographs for Battersea Dogs \u0026amp Cats Home. They’re beautiful to photograph. Every year, my wife and I do a dog calendar for the family – pastiching film posters, classic album covers, that kind of thing.I once did a full cat fashion shoot. We had all these outfits made for the cat, based on Prada and Chanel stuff. But the owner had been giving the animal so many treats, it had put on weight and couldn’t fit into any of the clothes. So there it was again, that need to tell a model they’ve put on weight.I don’t want to bite the hand that feeds me. I’m really seduced by fashion and I love the imagery. But I’m interested in humanity. And I see much more of it in that shot.• Unfashionable: 30 Years of Fashion Photography by Rankin is published by Rizzoli (£50).Training: Barnfield college, Luton (BTech), and the London College of Printing (BA, didn’t pass).High point: “Working with Katie Grand and Jefferson Hack, although at the time we wanted to kill each other.”Low point: “When that scene fell apart – it turned into squabbles about who was paying for what.”Top tip: “Listen to Tristan Harris’s interview on the Waking Up podcast with Sam Harris about technology addiction.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8d01e7d1ab416e3ca57087eeffc25f3a87970e8/0_0_4645_3434/master/4645.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1490dfa0dbea3ed5549c97df10c59407 1010w","title":"nudes maids and the eiffel tower classic french photography in pictures paris photo","story":"The French humanist movement of the 1930s changed photography for good.

Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week:Sometimes good books can be found in unusual places, as tommydog shows:I was up in the mountains fishing and on the cabin’s bookshelf was We Pointed Them North: Recollections of a Cow Puncher by EOC Abbott, aka Teddy Blue Abbott. It turned out to be a fun read and rather interesting. A friend, Helena Smith, basically wrote the book from Teddy’s dictation, poor grammar and all. He wanted to set the record straight in the late 1930s that while life on the post Civil War frontier was hard, it was also a lot of fun…It was a fun book, ideally suited to nights in a mountain cabin. In some of it you can see the source of countless western themes. Other aspects of life on the 19th century ranches are surprising (roller skating for example).Astonishing. Just in case you were wondering, here’s a definition of “cowpuncher”. (It isn’t someone who goes around thumping cows.)On the subject of frontiers, Dennis89 has been “thoroughly enjoying” The Worst Journey in the World by Apsley Cherry-Garrard:A monumental account of Scott’s tragic 1912 expedition to the South Pole. Since starting this book I feel that my concentration at work has waned... My thoughts keep ferrying me off to the wonder, beauty and isolation of Antarctica. I walk home from work eager to get back into that world of crevasses, comradeship, endeavour and altruism. Yes, there are the formidable details of the journeys undertaken and the conditions experienced but the real joy lies within the description of the human relationships that are formed in such a hostile and unforgiving environment.But humans aren’t always so noble. William Golding’s Lord Of The Flies has brought back memories for quickspace:Just read Lord of the Flies for the first time, finishing it yesterday with the horror of boyhood re-emerging 41 years later, the panic and cruelty boys inflict on each other. Having gone to an all boys school after flunking my 11+, the hierarchy and mob mentality felt familiar, though I don’t think anyone was brutally murdered by a mob or had their brains bashed out by a fuck-off rock. Oddly, the description of Simon’s corpse reminded me the description of Curly’s wife after her death in Of Mice ... At least in tone, curiously poetic and so sad I bawled my eyes out, which I’m glad happened now and not in my school days.The Portable Dorothy Parker, “a collection of her short stories, poems, reviews and personal correspondence” has impressed JohnHunt:Everything in the book is short, though the book itself runs to just over 600 pages … Like Runyon, Parker is very much of time and place and, again like Runyon, the time runs from the 1920s to the early 1950s and the place is New York and its environs. Parker knows her characters and she’s betting that you have a passing familiarity with them as well. Her stories are told from an unapologetically female perspective, often a woman’s internal dialogue. If you appreciate a good zinger at the end, if you need someone who’s quotes you will be able to recall at just the right moments, if you are looking for a good laugh or a way to consider the female perspective from her time period, Parker is your sure guide.Parker also wrote A Star Is Born if you’re wondering if she is still relevant today. You just can’t go wrong.Anna Burns’ Milkman has worked for chasm:I’m surprised by the reviews that described it as a difficult read, I thought it pretty accessible. I also thought it the best Booker winner for some years, original, thought-provoking, humane, and unputdownable.Meanwhile, jinxsboy51 recommends The Butchering Art: Joseph Lister’s Quest to Transform the Grisly World of Victorian Medicine by Lindsey Fitzharris:Very readable history of the transformation that occurred in medicine about the role of infection and sterilisation in making a big difference in surgery survival rates. NOT for the those with queasy stomachs.Finally, talking of stomachs, annegeraldine has been focussing on Thackeray’s Vanity Fair:The men have gone off to battle in Waterloo leaving Amelia a pitiful wreck and Becky planning her strategy should she be widowed. Joseph Sedley remains with the women: “At half-past two, an event occurred of daily importance to Mr Joseph -- the dinner-hour arrived. Warriors may fight and perish, but he must dine.”If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

But it is Yelli Diop’s.The Senegalese fisherman has had a very successful haul, and arrives back on Dakar’s shores with several boxes of fish in the hull. His brightly painted pirogue – a long, narrow canoe used by the fishermen here – is pulled up on the beach, a length of pipe wedged under it to keep it on the sand, and the orangey-pink fish unceremoniously dumped with dozens of its kin into a crate.Diop opens negotiations with a fish-seller, the sitting queen of her small square of beach, while robed Dakarois, tired fishermen, Chinese buyers, fishwives and children throng past.Like millions of its brethren that have passed through Dakar’s colourful Soumbedioune fish market before it, the dentex is probably destined for a plate of thiéboudienne, the national dish – caught, sorted, gutted and sold in the late afternoon by men and women working just as their great-great-grandparents did.But times are changing. Commercial overfishing to feed European and Asian appetites has emptied West Africa’s waters and destroyed the livelihoods of many artisanal fishing communities, including those in Senegal with its long Atlantic coastline.Now the fishmongers of Soumbedioune are moving. A new €2m fishing quay, funded by Morocco and sitting across the bay from the existing market, has been finished. It contains an ice factory, a cold room, a fish-processing area and rows of gleaming counters in the retail market. There are fishermen’s lockers, workshops and an office. It should be open by the time Senegal holds presidential elections in February.The changes are part of a wholesale reinvention of Dakar, which is changing at a rapid pace. Apartment blocks spring up in every vacant plot the city’s few remaining trees are cut down to make space for them. The stalls of vegetable sellers in the city’s old commune of Ngor were recently bulldozed for a car park. Houses are going up in the old airport, which was closed to commercial flights last year after a new one was built 60km outside the capital.Some of the fishing families think the closure of their lively if ramshackle market is a sign of the times, and a good thing.“It stinks here. It’s dirty, it’s hot, it’s disorganised. Over there it’s covered, and more hygienic,” says Khairou Mbang, who cleans fish for a living and is beginning to break into selling them, too.Mbang used to bring her baby daughter with her to the market, trying to shield her from the sun in the shade of heavy concrete slabs bearing the biggest fish. She hopes her children will have office jobs, or at least go into a less physically taxing profession than hers.“Life is hard. We don’t want our daughters to come here. I’d rather do anything else, but you can’t change, there’s no other work,” she says.As more shoppers arrive at Soumbedioune, the smell of sewage floats in the sea air most of Dakar’s drains are emptied, untreated, into the ocean. A man hacks up swordfish into large hunks, a cloud of flies ascending every time he throws a new piece on to the pile.Many fishmongers hope that the new market will attract well-to-do buyers who would not usually brave the crowds, smells and dirt of Soumbedioune. Adama Diallo, her broken plastic tabletop nestling between two colourfully painted pirogues, was not convinced.“I’ve never been, and I won’t go,” she says, rearranging a pile of pink-tinged mullet. “A ghost used to live over there.”She calls at prospective clients to buy her fish as they amble by, but with dozens of other sellers at Soumbedioune, business for Diallo is slow. Looking over at the low, maroon building behind its metal gate, she points out the obvious.“Not all of us will fit in there,” she says.“I’ve been here since I was born. My father was a fisherman – my father, and his father too. All fishermen. Let us stay,” she says.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23c0d745faef20f7d08a3a87c58427c680c4f945/0_235_8533_5121/master/8533.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=86de7d6a31838c81564ba0b982b18580","title":"christmas evangelical christians samaritans purse children muslim countries","story":"All over the country, Operation Christmas Child is up and running again. The scheme urges people to pack up a shoebox with toys, pens, notebooks and treats for a poor child. Schools often join in because children love doing it: there is something romantic and mysterious about sending a secret collection of gifts to an unknown child in a faraway land.Participating drop-off points include major companies, such as Caffè Nero, Shoe Zone, The Entertainer, Barratt Homes and some newspaper offices, such as Luton Today. The volunteer organisation Worcester Lions Club is packing shoeboxes inside Waitrose. Geoff Lewis of the club said: “It’s not known where the boxes will eventually end up at this time. But what is certain is that it will be with a child somewhere in the world that will not be receiving another Christmas present this year.” Maybe if people did know, they might hesitate.Wales Online reports that Glamorgan cricket team and the Cardiff Blues rugby club are also supporters of the scheme, the former reporting last year that they had helped to load “over 10,000 gift boxes on to vehicles leaving the south Wales depot for a destination in Albania”.Albania? That’s the clue – a mainly Muslim country, the kind of place where most of these shoeboxes are destined. The sort of countries that, indeed, as in the awful song, do not know it’s Christmastime at all.Many good-hearted packers of shoeboxes know little of the organisation behind this scheme. It’s run by Samaritan’s Purse, fundamentalist American evangelical Christian missionaries. After the boxes are dispatched, they are then delivered along with a missionary book of bible stories, The Greatest Gift, with “the 12 Bible lessons offered by many of the churches distributing shoeboxes,” according to the Samaritan’s Purse website. “157 million children in over 160 countries have experienced God’s love through the power of simple shoebox gifts from Operation Christmas Child.”A story from its website tells how a shoebox converted a Muslim family to Christianity: “Angella received an Operation Christmas Child shoebox filled with presents last year at this time. Since then she’s led her Muslim family to Christ.“Christmas is all about the unexpected: an angel appearing to shepherds, a virgin conceiving, God becoming man … Something unexpected and wonderful began among the Kulemba family of Malawi, a country in southern Africa. That day their 12-year-old daughter Angella received an Operation Christmas Child shoebox gift from the local church. Angella reads the gospel booklet to her family. All are now following Christ.”The man who runs the Samaritan’s Purse, which has a £16m annual income, is Rev Franklin Graham, son of Billy Graham and CEO of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association. He spoke at the inauguration of both George W Bush and Donald Trump. In an interview with Newsmax, Graham claimed that Obama had “allowed the Muslim Brotherhood to become part of the US government and influence administration decisions”.Strongly anti-gay and anti-same-sex marriage, Graham defended Russian president Vladimir Putin’s “gay propaganda” law, praising him for “protecting children from any homosexual agenda or propaganda”. He told the Washington Post that God had intervened to cause Trump’s election: “I could sense going across the country that God was going to do something this year. And I believe that at this election, God showed up.”On Facebook he wrote, “We are under attack by Muslims at home and abroad. We should stop all immigration of Muslims to the US until this threat with Islam has been settled. Every Muslim that comes into this country has the potential to be radicalised – and they do their killing to honour their religion and Muhammad.”Most people packing up shoeboxes don’t know they are used for anti-Muslim proselytising. Or that they are backing a pro-Trump, anti-gay message. Some may be from churches sharing that evangelical brand – but I would guess most parents and children haven’t a clue what they are supporting.Humanists UK, of which I am vice-president, has drafted a template letter that people can sign informing schools and others, urging them to reconsider their support, and offering alternative suggestions. Richy Thompson, Humanists UK’s director of public affairs and policy, says: “Those who donate to the scheme are well-intentioned and want to make an altruistic contribution, but donors in the UK should be aware of the nature of Operation Christmas Child’s activities and instead find a reputable and inclusive charity that has no ulterior motives and only has children’s best interests at heart.”No one wants to be the Grinch: filling shoeboxes is a feelgood act of generosity. But sending stacks of boxes with Christian missionary messages to Muslim countries is unlikely to ease interfaith tensions – nor is it an economical or ecological way to give: as ever, boring old money to good charities goes further. I note, also in the Luton News, one Lewsey residents’ association is calling for people to fill shoeboxes to be distributed by their local food bank – a far better idea than what one critic called “gift-wrapped Islamophobia”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4bc594e192fc1183d8d569a0c2aa9d47172d3526/0_227_2788_1673/master/2788.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ec4aff3204b4183a5a2ac42d5e4f7a48","title":"dominic raab britain island ignorance brexit secretary","story":"In July 2016, on the eve of his appointment as secretary of state for Brexit, David Davis predicted that the whole thing would be a doddle. Brussels would cater to Britain’s needs and the prime minister would simultaneously negotiate “a free trade area massively larger than the EU”. Within a year, Davis had changed his tune. It was complicated, he conceded. In June 2017, he told an audience of business leaders that the intricacies of the negotiations “make the Nasa moonshot look quite simple”. In July 2018, Davis resigned.He is not the only gung-ho Eurosceptic to meet a steep learning curve in government. His successor, Dominic Raab, is at a different stage on the journey, but the trajectory looks familiar. His speech to Tory conference this year had the swagger of the Brexit buccaneer who has yet to experience the pitch and roll of open water. “If the EU want a deal, they need to get serious,” he said. He did not specify what aspect of the continental position was, in his eminent opinion, unserious.Last night, at a tech industry event, Raab admitted that his grasp of the detail had been upgraded with some salient facts – such as the importance of the Channel to commerce with Europe. “I hadn’t quite understood the full extent of this,” he said. “But if you look at how we trade in goods, we are particularly reliant on the Dover-Calais crossing.”It is no longer surprising that people who were once confident that Britain had nothing to lose by leaving the EU neither understood what Brexit meant in practice, nor thought to ask. (That doesn’t make it any less dismal that the rest of us are expected to live with the consequences of their incuriosity.) It turns out that the states of being a Brexit ideologue and of being a responsible minister are not really compatible. Ardent leavers who join the cabinet are soon handed a menu of unpalatable choices. They turn queasy at the diet of sticky, granular detail. It wears them down until they are forced to soften their position, change the subject or quit.Boris Johnson, like Davis, chose the easy route: back to the comfort of moaning from the sidelines. Michael Gove discovered a crusading interest in the fate of plastic in the ocean that apparently excuses him from any duty to explain why promises made by the campaign he fronted will not be delivered. If Andrea Leadsom and Chris Grayling think Brexit has turned out as well as they once thought it would, they aren’t saying so. Liam Fox has had a jolly old time jetting around the world, meeting deputy trade ministers and being told that, yes, there is a free trade agreement to be signed with the UK just as soon as it has sorted out its future status with the EU (or in the case of the US, just as soon as it is prepared to surrender to every one of Donald Trump’s capricious demands). Fox is personally quite loyal to Theresa May, which is a rare thing in the cabinet. Plus, the ministerial car can shield the delicate ego from blows that might otherwise be inflicted by having a non-job.A remain-supporting former cabinet minister once told me of frustration in dealing with pro-leave ministers in the early months of the May government. When presented with technical Brexit-related issues in their departments, the true believers would cry foul, saying obstacles were being blown out of proportion, or that the real problem was a lack of will and the solution was more faith. Thus the ludicrous situation arose where the people most seriously engaged in trying to imagine a way forward – the prime minister and the chancellor – had both voted remain. David Davis was the exception, since his job allowed no ducking of difficult questions. He had to confront facts and, when he resisted, the facts won.Now Raab occupies Davis’s old seat, trying to bring Brexit back from its two-year journey to the moon. Re-entry into reality is proving tricky. The myths and the cocksure rhetoric are burning off on contact with the Earth’s atmosphere. It is possible the whole thing can be brought home in one piece, but also that it breaks apart completely, revealing the fundamental design flaw: this rocket was not designed with a safe landing in mind."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/187ad160658ce90fe9f9fbd288dbe1e3c67d96f9/0_0_2988_1793/master/2988.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aeb5d451db6c24efaad4b79bc88beb39","title":"law brexit theresa may attorney general","story":"When Geoffrey Cox joined the cabinet earlier this year to take on the role of attorney general, it was already perfectly clear where he stood on the biggest legal matter facing the government.In case anyone was in any doubt, Cox nailed his colours firmly to the Brexit mast in his barnstorming warm-up speech before Theresa May’s address to the Conservative party conference last month.He took the job, he told the Tory faithful, to help deliver on the referendum vote in 2016: “Because it will take a dogged, determined, single-minded clarity and firmness of purpose to translate that decision into reality.”Knowing where Cox stands personally is one thing. But as attorney general he has a constitutional role to play. And a rather conflicted one at that. The attorney general is a Conservative MP and a member of a Conservative government who is expected to give independent legal advice to that government. And now he is expected to give legal advice on one of the most politically vexed questions of the time.But what exactly is he supposed to be advising on? The compatibility of any deal on the Irish border with article 50? Whether a review mechanism can be unilateral? Whether the European court of justice should have any role to play on any aspect of the Irish border issue? And what happens if there is no deal on the future relationship by the end of transition in December 2020? And can the UK walk away from a legally binding orce agreement?And it’s also not clear whether Cox is quite the man you need in this case: his practice prior to taking up the post of attorney general was wide-ranging (and very successful). It included commercial law, human rights law and constitutional law – but not much on EU law.But paradoxically, everyone’s an expert on the EU now that the UK is leaving. So Cox will not be alone. And the fact is no one knows for sure the answers to any of these questions because no state has triggered article 50 before, and no new customs union has been created on the hoof for a country wishing to distance itself from its closest neighbours. So it is unlikely that his legal advice will be wrong, but it may well be hedged in with caveats and uncertainties. Which is why it may be useful to all sides. Which is why all sides are pressing to see it.This is not the first time an attorney general has been asked to give advice in a politically charged situation. Lord Goldsmith was in the hot seat when asked to give advice on the legality of military action in Iraq. If Cox is in need of bedtime reading, he could do worse than study the Chilcot inquiry’s report. That might take a while, as the inquiry devoted a whole chapter to the episode. As we know from the scale of the inquiry report, even one chapter is a lengthy piece of work. But for a quick summary of the whole legal process, try “far from satisfactory” as a quote.Goldsmith was clear in later evidence to a parliamentary committee that the dual role of minister and legal adviser has advantages, suggesting that advice provided by an attorney who is also a member of the government “tends to be more heeded by ministers because it comes from one of their colleagues”.From another perspective, though, might pressure to provide advice in a certain direction be all the harder to resist for a law officer who also sits around the cabinet table with the prime minister?Then there is a question always fundamental for a barrister: who is the client? When the prime minister asks for a legal opinion, is she asking for herself? Or under the convention of collective responsibility, should the advice properly be for the cabinet as a whole? Michael Gove, not a lawyer but a former justice secretary, clearly believes the latter to be the case.And should that advice be published? Surely the cabinet should benefit from confidential legal advice, to inform its decision-making, safe in the knowledge that it will not become public knowledge? However, leaving the EU is the most important issue facing the country since the second world war. There is a strong public interest to know what advice the prime minister is receiving and for that advice to be subject to scrutiny. And there’s a good chance the advice will be leaked anyway. So all the more reason for the government to manage its publication.• Catherine Barnard is senior fellow at The UK in a Changing Europe, and professor of EU law at Cambridge University"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/650e614ab92448484714d08c9a116884ccd563b5/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8eeba856eb73ec1c03dbaeb5eebb12b","title":"schools ban girls playing football","story":"Football is our national sport and yet some schools continue to offer it solely to boysImagine a school that ided its subjects by gender. A school that didn’t allow girls to study chemistry or algebra, and the only way to access those subjects was to pursue private tuition outside of school hours at their own expense. There would, rightly, be outrage.When it comes to PE lessons, however, it remains perfectly acceptable for a school to offer different sports to boys and girls. The rationale? Archaic and gendered ideas about physical activity: football and rugby are best suited to boys netball and dance are best for girls. At the same time that we have public health and sports governing bodies working to promote football and rugby to women and girls, we are turning a blind eye to a blatantly sexist and outdated practice in education that tells girls those very same sports are not for them.This week a BBC Sport article reported that a 13-year-old girl in Wales had complained to her teachers about not being allowed to play football as a PE option in school. The story prompted national coverage and surprise from many that this still occurs. It came as no surprise to me. It’s a complaint I’ve heard from parents, teachers and students many times before.Two weeks ago I hosted a panel for the Women in Sport conference on Generation Z and the barriers that young women face in accessing sport. One of the speakers was 16-year-old Caitlin Cunningham who told how she had to convince her school to allow girls to play football and rugby. She described how the girls’ changing room had a poster of a female netballer outside it – posed, unruffled and static – while the boys’ changing room had a poster of boys playing rugby and physically exerting themselves. The message, she said, was clear about the physical expectations of girls and boys in school PE lessons.This week, following the BBC article, I heard from parents on social media who also wanted to share their experiences: from those whose daughters were being segregated in PE from year 7, to a mother whose son was being teased for wanting to play netball.Frustratingly there doesn’t seem to be any comprehensive research into this issue. How widespread is this practice? And how has it continued under the 2010 Equality Act? Government advice for schools, published in May 2014, stipulates: “Schools need to make sure that pupils of one sex are not singled out for different and less favourable treatment from that given to other pupils.” There is even a section on single-sex sport: “while this exception might permit a mixed school to have a boys-only football team, the school would still have to allow girls equal opportunities to participate in comparable sporting activities”. The word “comparable” here is clearly problematic.When the former sports minister Tracey Crouch bravely slashed the starting age of the national sport strategy from 14 to five years old, we should have seen the end of gendered PE. After all, the idea that a sport is meant for any particular gender is ludicrous. While in the UK football is viewed as a man’s game, in the US it is deemed a woman’s game. And over time perceptions change too – 100 years ago figure skating was a men-only sport these days its biggest stars are female. And none of this is to suggest a devaluing of sports traditionally viewed as female – rather that all sports should be valued on a level playing field, free from gender bias.Gender-segregated sport is, of course, legal – although sports governing bodies increasingly champion mixed sport sessions, with the FA raising the age of mixed football to 18. And there are many valid arguments as to why both mixed and segregated sport are useful, at different ages, and in different contexts.I’m heartened by Game of Our Own, I think we need to see much more of it. The key to unlocking the FA’s 2020 participation goals for women and girls’ football surely lies here, with a ready-made audience, at every school in the country.If only we could get the government departments to push it through. Football is our national sport, so how is it possible that some schools continue to offer it solely to boys? All sports on the school timetable should be available to all children. It’s mind-boggling that in 2018 we even have to spell this out.• Anna Kessel is a sports writer for the  and Observer"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d328d64afcfb6e4192631bc8f7f8678500fd54ae/0_131_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aead8efb3097b91a5f00e07c6e0afd3d","title":"ive run out of money at university what can i do","story":"Most students experience financial hardship – following these steps can help you get back on trackPrioritise costs. First, list everything you need to pay for over the next few months, from rent and bills to bus fares, laundry costs and your TV licence. The more detail, the better.Next, reorder the list by importance. Essential items should be at the top, along with looming bills or those with penalties for late payment.Now isn’t the time to stop spending altogether – letting financial commitments slide could make the situation worse. Instead, aim to pay priority costs with any money you have or expect to come into, then cut back spending on items further down the list.Predict the problems. The trouble with running out of cash is that it has consequences, and it’s better to know upfront what they are. It could mean no ready-made lunches for a while, or cutting back on transport costs. This is an opportunity to find free alternatives, spot ways to save cash, or mentally prepare to go without.Some course or home expenses are harder to paper over. The next step will help figure out how to tackle them.Talk to the right people. There are people out there who can help you cope. Get in touch as soon as possible. Ask your uni’s student money advisor about budgeting, hardship funds or specialist support (ie debt or housing). The welfare office or your GP can advise if money worries affect your diet, sleep or mental health. Keep your course tutor in the loop, too. Talking can help relieve stress: try Samaritans or, if available, a campus listening service. If it’s an option, ask family about financial advice and support.Find extra income. If you don’t have a plan for spending it, extra cash won’t be the magic bullet you expect. Doing the steps above first will help you see the bigger picture, and can lead you to appropriate funding, including:If you have a job, extra shifts may help. Now’s also the time to identify saleable skills or freelancing opportunities, as well as any unloved clothes, books and gadgets you could shift for cash.Borrow wisely. You may need to borrow money to get by, but always try to take the best option for your finances and wellbeing. Family or university loans are safer, so investigate them first.Credit cards have their benefits, but also more potential for extra costs. If you’re not on top of your finances, get advice before using them, especially before taking commercial or payday loans.However you borrow, compare the total cost with interest, along with charges or consequences for late repayment. Plan how you’ll repay the money asap, and consider how that will affect your other finances.Stay social. For many students, being skint is an isolating experience: you can’t afford to socialise, and think no one will understand what you’re going through. For that very reason, it’s important to spend time with others. Find free events, societies and meet-ups, volunteer for a cause or charity, or make the most of free hobbies and sports. Or don’t plan anything at all – just hang out.It can wait until you’re back on your feet, but review why you ran out of cash, what helped you cope, and what you’ll do differently next time.

It was in a film she directed, Mabel’s Strange Predicament (1914), that Chaplin first wore the “tramp” outfit, although that is not included here.The shorts are Mabel’s Blunder (1914), in which Mabel misreads her fiance’s apparent dalliance with another woman Mabel’s Dramatic Career (1913), with Sennett, in which she heads off to Hollywood after her cruel fiance rejects her, and he suffers the poetic justice of seeing her triumphantly up on the silver screen in a Keystone production – surely one of the earliest meta-cinema moments His Trysting Places (1914), directed by and starring Chaplin with Mabel as his wife and Should Men Walk Home? (1927), in which she plays a cheeky chancer who teams up with a professional burglar.It’s a fascinating archival collection. Normand allows the scene to be stolen from her by the hyperactive Chaplin in His Trysting Places but always shines in her artless, madcap way. That charm is especially on display in the bizarre crime caper Should Men Walk Home?, in which Mabel’s co-star is induced to stop for her as a hitchhiker and get involved in her shenanigans. She and her conspirator steal a precious brooch from a safe during a swanky party, lose track of it in the melee and the object is finally taken by a tiny toddler in a nappy who had been asleep upstairs. The films are great historical documents of early cinema."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53e982b1b50be000397b2d3d2d2c857cc17d350b/0_1551_3744_2246/master/3744.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3dfa71001ee03a51941757ee433ebfc4","title":"edible fragrance comes with the questions who why and how","story":"You spray it on to your drink to make it taste of something else – but while it should be wonderful, it is just confusedThe food world has a habit of trying to fix things that aren’t broken, often for the sake of experimentation. Most of these breakages are fine. A deconstructed dessert can taste great. A croissant bastardised with a doughnut shouldn’t work but absolutely does.Then there’s alcohol. A good drink is rarely broken. A refreshing pint cannot be bettered, nor can a well-mixed vodka tonic. So, an edible fragrance that you spray on to your drink to make it taste like something else comes with all sorts of questions: mainly who, why and how?The first question is easy to answer. This fragrance is made by a company called Smith \u0026amp Sinclair (which also makes very good alcoholic sweets) and comes in three flavoursscents – the one I try is pear and vanilla – fashioned from a combination of natural flavourings, vodka and calvados. It comes in a perfume bottle and box complete with tasteful, minimal lettering and a saucy tagline, “Lick your scent”, written in capital letters. It costs £20, and absolutely smells like a perfume. No perfume I would choose to wear – pear and vanilla are dull enough, but combined create a cloying blandness – but a perfume nonetheless. If I was in any doubt over this, last Sunday I sprayed my wrists in the morning, went for a walk and returned still smelling like a car freshener. So, in one sense, success all round.You can spray it on to your skin and lick it off, but its true calling is as a “vapour to be spritzed on to a cocktail, like a garnish”. You can spritz multiple times. With each sip, if you want, as if you had badly rolled a cigarette and needed to light it each time you wanted a drag. Gin and tonic in hand, I spray and watch the mist hover above the drink like a sad ghost, before it settles on to the liquid. There’s no film, no stickiness, just a suggestion of flavour – sweet with a hint of tartness – that disappears as quickly as it arrives.An edible scent should be wonderful. Smell is animal and basic and the right scent can conjure memories faster than conscious thought. Sadly, the edible fragrance is confused. Neither a food nor a drink, it masquerades as both containing alcohol, it is incapable of getting you remotely giddy. It’s a riddle and after a week of spraying it on to everything – wrists, wine, sparkling water, G\u0026ampT, tea – I am none the wiser."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb8c3d7293ac955c7a336ce9b74483c62b4b564e/139_22_1464_878/master/1464.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=40e40469e4f9f20d7df0fd3deefe79d6","title":"the fiver jose mourinho manchester united","story":"Sign up now! Sign up now! Sign up now? Sign up now!“Interesting. Very interesting! Look at his face! Just look at his face!” It may have been a completely different era and set of circumstances, but you could have dubbed that famous Barry Davies commentary of that Franny Lee goal over footage of a triumphant José Mourinho strutting on to the pitch in Turin and it could scarcely have sounded more appropriate. On he marched, cupping a hand to one ear, all the better to goad the capacity Juventus crowd who had been insulting him and his family all night, only to be silenced at the last by Manchester United’s late, late Big Cup winner. Turning to all four corners of the ground, the weird, hitherto unseen, self-satisfied smirk that adorned the Manchester United manager’s face seemed to summon the combined spirits of Popeye the sailor, Albert Steptoe, Jon Voight in Anaconda and the banjo-playing hillbilly from Deliverance. The Fiver genuinely can’t ever remember seeing José this happy before. This is the kind of José with whom The Fiver can get on board.Of course, that José is not for everyone. Despite boasting a lengthy rap-sheet that includes gouging Tito Vilanova’s eye, prompting the pile-on that forced respected referee Anders Frisk to retire and helping Eva Carneiro out of her job at Chelsea, among other highlights, José’s comparatively mild and harmless taunting of the Juve crowd seems to have got assorted commentators clutching their pearls and reaching for the smelling-salts. Criticised by such shrinking violets as Leonardo Bonucci and Paulo Dybala at the time, Mourinho has since been accused of “tainting” and “overshadowing” United’s triumph with his “meltdown” by assorted British tabloids hell-bent on doing passable impersonations of swooning Victorian ladies.“I was insulted for 90 minutes,” tooted Mourinho, who was in uncharacteristically chipper form following United’s best result in Europe – and possibly anywhere – since the end of the Ferg era. “I do my work and nothing more. At the end I didn’t insult anyone, I just did the gesture that I wanted to hear them more. I wouldn’t do it again. But I came here as a professional that does his work and people insulted my family, this is why I reacted this way. I don’t want to think about it.” The United boss has more important things to think about, specifically a forthcoming Sunday visit to the Etihad to face Manchester City. While they haven’t denied apparently well documented claims of financial shenanigans and foul play published this week in Der Spiegel, the English champions have said “the attempt to damage the club’s reputation is organised and clear”. On the evidence of Wednesday’s spirited performance in the belly of the Juve beast, The Fiver suspects United’s attempt to damage it further on Sunday could be better organised and even more clear.Join Niall McVeigh from 5pm GMT for hot MBM coverage of Austria 1-2 England in their women’s international, before John Brewin is on hand for Bate Borisov 1-3 Chelsea at 5.55pm, Paul Doyle helms Arsenal 2-1 Sporting and Nick Ames guides you through the Queen’s Celtic 1-2 Leipzig.October 2007: “This is my last job.

But nowhere near as much as Manchester CityFor Manchester United, some of the season’s opening chapters have been bleak. Despite a morale-boosting win against Juventus on Wednesday, in the Premier League the Red Devils find themselves nine points off leaders Manchester City, who they face on Sunday in the 177th edition of the Manchester derby.But as bad as the first three months have been for United, José Mourinho’s men will enter the Etihad Stadium having actually exceeded expectations so far – at least by one measure.According to expected points — the metric that calculates how many points a team should have earned from each game — United have collected one more point than expected from their first 11 league matches. Expected points are calculated through expected goals, another advanced metric that’s made its way around the game in recent years, and has been the centre of much contentious debate over its use.Expected goals — or xG — assigns a quantitative value to every shot on goal, based on the quality of the assist, angle of the shot and distance to the goal. Every shot’s xG in a game is totalled and compared against the opponent’s xG, and an “expected winner” is then established and the expected points distributed. This explainer from Opta should help.Expected goals isn’t for everyone, and since its recent emergence into the mainstream, Sky Sports’ Jeff Stelling has been just one of the statistic’s notable critics. It does have its uses, though. For one, it provides a snapshot of how well a team has played and, perhaps more importantly, it sheds light on why a team has over- or underachieved. As it pertains to United, their goal difference is three worse than expected goals says it should be.Mourinho’s defence is worse. Gleave said that United are surrendering almost two goal attempts per game more than last season, and should have conceded nine fewer goals than they have.The club’s board announced that up to £100m could be available in the January transfer window, which Mourinho has already indicated that a centre-back and goalscoring forward are at the top of his shopping list. City meanwhile have conceded just four goals in their 11 league games.Last month, the  looked at how well the “Special One” has spent £360m during his time at Old Trafford, and the record is mixed. Eric Bailly has featured in just five league games so far this time around, and has yet to be involved in a clean sheet. Victor Lindelöf, another £30m centre-back signing, has been in and out of the starting XI since his arrival, though he’s performed well thus far this season.Whether it’s more disposable money or the manager that’s behind their superiority, City appear to have spent their money far more wisely, including £105m on defenders John Stones and Aymeric Laporte. City have also been far more prolific in front of goal, knocking in 33 so far, including four by Guardiola’s latest signing, Riyad Mahrez.

Karen Carney and Mel Lawley have been drafted in after Fran Kirby and Keira Walsh pulled out with injuries.Goalkeepers: Mary Earps (Wolfsburg), Ellie Roebuck (Man City), Carly Telford (Chelsea).Defenders: Hannah Blundell (Chelsea), Millie Bright (Chelsea), Lucy Bronze (Lyon), Gabby George (Everton), Alex Greenwood (Man Utd), Steph Houghton (Man City), Abbie McManus (Man City), Leah Williamson (Arsenal).Midfielders: Isobel Christiansen (Lyon), Karen Carney (Chelsea), Jordan Nobbs (Arsenal), Jill Scott (Man City), Lucy Staniforth (Birmingham), Georgia Stanway (Man City), Melissa Lawley (Man City).Forwards: Rachel Daly (Houston Dash), Toni Duggan (Barcelona), Beth Mead (Arsenal), Nikita Parris (Man City), Chioma Ubogagu (Brisbane Roar, loan from Orlando Pride).Remember that long, hot summer about a hundred years ago, when It was Coming Home? Well, I know that was then – but it could be again. England’s women’s side will go to France next year hoping to at least match the men’s efforts in Russia – and their own in Canada, back in 2015. Phil Neville’s side are ranked third in the world, and should be bona fide contenders – although momentum is proving tricky to muster, with an impressive win over Brazil cancelled out by a draw with an underpowered Australia side in their last pair of friendlies. They take on Sweden in a sellout at Rotherham on Sunday, but first up, it’s a trip to Vienna to face Austria. Today’s hosts aren’t World Cup bound, but they were a penalty shootout away from the Euro ‘17 final, ultimately joining England as losing semi-finalists.Barcelona forward Toni Duggan will captain the team for the first time today, in the absence of Steph Houghton, whose 100th cap will wait until Sunday.

We want qualify and we want to win our group. In this game there is the possibility to qualify…Jorginho will play because Cesc Fabregas had a fever, he wasn’t available. Hazard, he has only played a few minutes. Willian has played four matches in a row. (More Loftus-Cheek goals?) I hope so. I cannot ask a midfielder to score every match. It is difficult. The way we were for Bate: this piece from 2012 remembers when they used to be real banana skin for the big boys.And they beat mighty Roma in 2015.If this competition is Ruben Loftus-Cheek’s route to recovery, then he did himself some good last time out. That won him 60 minutes of play against Burnley the following weekend, though he still began the game on the bench. He started against Frank Lampard’s Derby County the following week but last week rode pine. Sarri is a tough taskmaster and Loftus-Cheek has that tendency to sit back and admire his own handiwork rather than chase down the opposition. Both José Mourinho and Antonio Conte thought in similar terms. Eden Hazard is back in the starting line-up, good news for Chelsea after he played 26 minutes plus change against Crystal Palace at the weekend as he recovers from his back injury.There are no easy games in European football, especially European football games played in Eastern Europe, as Liverpool found out. That Bate team selection in full.So that team selection means Zappacosta, Christensen, Cahill and Emerson make up a defence of strangers to this season’s Premier League and Loftus-Cheek gets a chance to impress the manager who seems most unimpressed with him. He will be playing alongside Ross Barkley, who Sarri does seem to like very much and whose digging in for hard work shows a way forward for RLC. It has to be said that Sarri has chosen a strong forward line, while Álvaro Morata, at last in the goals, gets a rest. This will, it has to be admitted a night for CTRL C and CTRL C, and that’s almost as true for Chelsea as it is for BATE, such is the Marie Celeste this competition has become for certain players. Chelsea have made reasonably easy progress under the Thursday night lights with Maurizio Sarri able to experiment and still pull off three fairly easy victories and maximum points. Get a win tonight in Minsk and the likes of Davide Zappacosta and Ruben Loftus-Cheek will have a reason for being beyond Christmas the Italian has made one subs appearance in the Premier League while RLC has only three. Even more startling, Gary Cahill has just one subs’ appearance in the Premier League. With two, poor old Cesc Fàbregas has made three Europa League appearances to two in the Premier League. Defender Emerson Palmieri has meanwhile not featured in the Premier League at all and neither has Andreas Christensen, the one-time cure to that curse of John Terry being the last youth player to actually make it at Stamford Bridge. Barring the odd cameo from the likes of Eden Hazard, Willian, N’Golo Kante and Pedro, Sarri, while showing his belief in a small pocket of players and showing off his ruthlessness is treating the Europa League like a good old-fashioned reserves league. The Central League they used to call it, colloquially known as “the stiffs” among football men. Perhaps that might be the future function of the Europa League if the big, bad European Super League comes in, a place to play “whatever happened to?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d549ef91eff65cc29550c204121aadb6db9f7b84/0_284_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b15dd961a385daf81b3caa0831e340e","title":"studying your dreams bradley cooper swears by it would trying it unleash my creativity","story":"What is ‘dream study’, the new trend sweeping the creative world? I attended a class to find out The wildly popular new film A Star Is Born, a tragic musical love story starring Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper, has revived interest in a somewhat obscure field: dream analysis.Cooper, who also directed the film, said in a recent New York Times interview that he used his subconscious to make rituals for his character. Cooper and Lady Gaga worked with acting coach Elizabeth Kemp, Cooper’s mentor, who taught him the technique and to whom the film is dedicated, before her death last year.While not exactly a mainstream practice, dream study goes back at least 3,000 years and has a devoted following today. I was curious, so I decided to give it a go.Humans have an estimated three to five dreams a night, with Rapid Eye Movement (REM), or dreaming sleep, most commonly falling towards the end of the night. “Dream work” has roots in the techniques of the famed theater actor and director Konstantin Stanislavski and the theories of psychologist Carl Jung, Kim Gillingham, a teacher of the technique, told me.Dream work is not just for actors, Gillingham said. Having coached film-makers, directors, novelists, dancers and scientists in how to use dreams to find greater authenticity in their work, Gillingham says she has seen dreams’ transformative potential for people across the professional spectrum.“For one thing, if we have an unresolved trauma or something from childhood, or a pattern that’s inhibiting us, or a pattern that’s drawing us again and again to addictive behaviour, self-loathing behaviour, an old tape running in your head, the dreams will serve up the reality of that for us to work with,” the 55-year-old, who has been in the field since discovering it in her 20s, told me a few days before the workshop.She also believes that dreams present solutions. “Psychologically, physically, emotionally, I believe wholeheartedly in the comprehensive healing package of what the dream brings for everyone – for the plumber, saint, all of us, have this genius guiding material coming through in our dreams in the night.”Despite having never done anything like it before, I was fairly relaxed about going to Gillingham’s class – until being asked to sign a waiver accepting responsibility for “the risks to my person and psyche”. Although I’m usually a pretty vivid dreamer, I found the pressure of recording my dreams made remembering them more difficult than normal. But after listening to the trippiest music my boyfriend’s record collection had to offer and avoiding technology before bed, I managed to muster one at the last minute. I scrawled the dream down in as much detail as possible, then hopped on the subway and headed to the class.Going from the noisy rush of the Manhattan streets to the hushed, almost reverent, anticipation of the softly lit dream studio felt like entering a secret society. People, mainly actors (including some pretty famous ones that I’m not allowed to name), were taping sketches – private images from their unconscious – on to the wall and quietly making notes in their dream journals. At the front was an “altar” decorated with flowers and candles.Nervously, I took out my notepad, containing some recent dreams and a naive felt-tip pen attempt at drawing last night’s (it involved a chest of drawers, a laptop and, inexplicably, the number 53). I took a seat on the only vacant yoga mat, near the front. Gillingham, who was leading the five-hour dream workshop, gave a short introduction, then we each lit a candle. She rang a horror movie-esque bell that made me jump, marking the start of our journey into the unconscious.The class was ided into two parts. The first was spent largely with our eyes closed, working inidually under Gillingham’s instruction, mentally revisiting the scene of our dream and going to a childhood memory. The second was more like an acting class and revolved around a practical group exercise.The purpose of the session was to “practice the weaving of inner work and creative work”. Gillingham taught techniques such as “whisper speaking” – quietly uttering thoughts that might be too private or unacceptable to say out loud into cupped hands – and strengthening the “container” (being internally strong enough for the unconscious to come through). She often instructed us to move the position of the tongue and open our mouths to relax the jaw.Although mentally challenging and emotionally exhausting – at one point it felt so intense that I was nauseous and, like others in the room, I was a couple of times moved to tears – I found the first half most immediately enlightening. The group exercise, where we had to follow our impulses and spontaneously move and make sounds around the room while being mirrored and observed, was in retrospect fascinating but in the moment it felt agonisingly difficult to entirely let go of all inhibitions. There was also an arts and crafts section where we made art with our non-dominant hand and ate snacks.Do these kinds of exercises actually work? I put the question to Emily Cass McDonnell, a New York-based actor and longtime student of dream work who attended the session. Before she started working with Gillingham seven years ago she hadn’t spent much time dwelling on her dreams. But now McDonnell is a firm convert. She regularly records and explores her dreams, which she said had proved insightful.“It deepened everything, both my life and my work,” she explained. “There’s a sort of all-knowing or just deeper-knowing benevolent inner resource that you have and it has the language of your dreams. Coming into a relationship with that is for me just really fun and endless.”McDonnell said her dream work was crucial to her approach to her role last year in Annie Baker’s highly praised off-Broadway play The Antipodes, in which her character regularly peeled and ate a hardboiled egg. Like she would if she had dreamed about an egg, she explored its symbolism and its connotations to give the moment on stage a sense of deeply rooted purpose that became like a “secret ritual”. While she “did not make any big deal out of it”, it became a special moment that people commented on. “It had a richness that had something to it that other people picked up on when it was secret to me and it’s still secret.”Although she is visibly passionate about the power of dreams, it is also deeply personal dream work helped her deal with grief after the death of her partner. After workshopping a spider dream with Gillingham, the initially frightening spider became a positive symbol to her. “Really it felt like having an electric shock,” she said. “It was like coming back into life and that made a lot of sense for where I was with my grief.”If dreams are so important to day-to-day life, then why don’t people pay more attention to them? Dr Rubin Naiman, a psychologist and sleep and dream specialist at the University of Arizona’s Center for Integrative Medicine, believes western society simply does not value sleep as highly as being awake. He calls the problem “wakecentrism”.Naiman has worked with numerous artists and musicians – including a “world-renowned rock’n’roll group” he cannot name. As well as creativity, dreaming is an essential component of good mental health, he said. It serves as an antidepressant and an anti-inflammatory and is good for memory. “We have a nighttime therapist in our head if we dream well.”But he warned of the dangers of using technology to try to manipulate dreams by “dream hacking” – a recent interest in monitoring brain waves in order to interrupt sleep to impose lucid dreaming. He called “the notion that we can invade the dream world and do with it what we want” a prime example of “wakecentrism”.“Watch your dreams tonight,” Gillingham reminded us at the end of her class. She said our unconsciousnesses would want to respond to the work we’d done in the workshop. I couldn’t help but feel a little sceptical. Stepping back into the mayhem of the city, I felt drained and raw.But the following morning I awoke to find my emotions settled. And, true to promise, I had received a definite – if not immediately decipherable – overnight reply: the chest of drawers was back, this time containing a rabbit."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69894b78d30d917f42bab6a2642c81adabeee829/0_264_5968_3581/master/5968.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=949e2c98413a6505ddb3b94d63423ac7","title":"imagine dragons origins review rock pop cliches and cod profundities this is gonna be huge","story":"The most streamed rock band in the world may want us to believe they are angry philosophers, but the reality doesn’t change a gilt-edged mainstream formulaIf you like mind-bending statistics, then Imagine Dragons are very much the band for you. Their EDM-infused 2012 saga of apocalyptic dread, Radioactive, is the longest-running single in the history of the Billboard charts: 87 weeks on the Top 100. They are the most-streamed rock band in the world, with 37.5m monthly listeners on Spotify: stitch that, Coldplay, with your paltry 27.5m. Their debut album, Night Visions, spent five years on the US charts, the kind of success that enabled people to call its follow-up, Smoke \u0026amp Mirrors, “commercially underwhelming” because it only sold 1m copies in the US. Normal service was resumed with 2017’s Evolve, enticingly described by the band’s lead singer Dan Reynolds, in true caution-to-the-wind, motormouthed style, as “a more palatable album for this generation and this time period”. It spawned the singles Believer and Thunder, collectively streamed 1.6bn times.They have achieved all this while maintaining an almost enviable degree of anonymity. Theirs is not a success founded on a striking image, ineffable charisma or brain-searing visual branding. Nevertheless, the scale of their commercial triumphs has clearly left its mark, not least in the degree of portent with which they now describe their work. There’s none of your “more palatable album for this time period” in regard to Evolve’s successor, Origins. “When we create, we create with no boundaries, no rules,” Reynolds said in explanation of its contents. “We find it thrilling to make music that feels different and new to us.”Listeners suitably primed for a boundary-breaking shift from the hook-laden, electronic pop-rock that has so far fuelled Imagine Dragons’ oeuvre should perhaps note that the band’s first stop on its journey to new ground was to assemble a collection of producers and co-songwriters noted for their work with avant-garde mavericks including Sam Smith, Cheryl Tweedy, Selena Gomez and fearsome electro-acoustic auteur Ellie Goulding. Notice is thus served that talk of creation without rules and music of a thrilling newness might amount to gilding the lily a bit.And so it proves. The song Digital unexpectedly makes use of a drum’n’bass breakbeat, but for the most part, Origins’ contents arrive thickly spread with chart cliches: reverb-heavy xx-inspired guitars, the kind of high-pitched vocal echoes found on Justin Bieber’s Sorry, a bit of thumpy Mumford-ish folk on West Coast, a track that deals in taut 80s movie soundtrack pop-rock. The songs are well crafted – the title track in particular has a wonderfully turned chorus – but the band’s work frequently sounds weirdly interchangeable with other artists who occupy the Top 40. You can easily imagine Cool Out being performed by DNCE or Maroon 5, or Stuck being given a gruff-voiced makeover by George Ezra.What inidual character it has comes from an occasional desire to graft on well-worn stadium rock tropes: the pained intensity of Reynolds’ vocals, the rhythm of Machine that mimics the thump-thump-crash of Queen’s We Will Rock You, the yearning, U2-ish breakdown that appears midway through Zero. The lyrics deal in windy generalities – “Why can’t you just be my brother? Why do we have to kill one another?” – or stuff that fancies itself as profound but doesn’t make any sense: “I want a new world without the order  I want to resurrect and live a little shorter.”Occasionally, the lyrics delve into what Bullet in a Gun – a melding of electronic rhythm track and Kings of Leon impersonation – refers to as “the Devil’s deal” of fame, a curious topic for a band who appear to have ascended to the upper echelons of commercial success with the minimum of angst. “To make a name, you pay the price,” cries Reynolds, sounding positively wracked. “How many artists fear the light? Feel the pain?” He then starts shouting “SELL OUT! SELL OUT!”, something that is hard to listen to without thinking: keep your hair on, mate, you weren’t exactly Napalm Death to start off with.Perhaps it all hints at a gulf between how Imagine Dragons see themselves – fearless sonic explorers and sociopolitical philosophers straining at the very confines of commerciality – and what they are: a band who’ve hit on a winning formula, where mainstream pop music is larded with just enough references to classic rock to lure in not just lovers of the Top 40, but the kind of people who normally sniff at mainstream pop. If they really are troubled by their success or how they’re perceived, their dark night of the soul looks set to continue apace: cliches, cod profundities and all, Origins sounds like another vast hit.Mighty Mouse: The SpiritFantastic bootleg house re-edit of Patti Labelle’s The Spirit’s in It, now apparently legally cleared and released by Glitterbox as a party-starting anthem in its own right."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2350c419d64c714384be5559c5d22607a430daae/144_338_4714_2829/master/4714.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2497709f3e66c716ada85b95743c3b00","title":"stormzy oxford university turned down my scholarship offer","story":"Grime artist says institution ‘did not want to get involved’ in funding offer for black studentsStormzy has accused Oxford University of rejecting his offer to fund two scholarships for black British students, a proposal that was instead taken up by Cambridge University.The grime artist was speaking at the Barbican in London, where he was launching his book Rise Up: The #Merky Story So Far.“We tried Oxford but they didn’t want to get involved,” Stormzy said.An Oxford University spokesperson acknowledged that Stormzy had been in contact but said that at the time it was unclear what the proposal was. The university would welcome the chance to work with him, the spokesperson added.Explaining why he wanted to launch the scholarship at the book launch, Stormzy said he wanted to find the “genius and incredible minds” within the “badly behaved kids”.“That is something I take personal pride in. I am always very inspired by that genius and … people who are smarter than me.

Is it time street musicians turned to contactless card readers?It is a crisp, blustery, autumn afternoon on the South Bank in London. Charlotte Campbell stands with her back to the river playing an acoustic guitar and singing Leonard Cohen’s song Hallelujah, a buskers’ favourite. “Now I’ve heard there was a secret chord, That David played, and it pleased the Lord, But you don’t really care for music, do you?”People stop, watch a while, film Campbell on their phones, or mouth along. “It goes like this: The fourth, the fifth, The minor fall and the major lift, The baffled king composing Hallelujah …” Some drop coins into her guitar case, or send their kids to do so. Pound coins, silver ones, or just a few coppers.Although, in the half hour that I am watching and listening – to covers of Fleetwood Mac, Christina Perri, Ed Sheeran, the Beatles, plus some of Campbell’s own material, including a song with the line: “I don’t need your coins, no, just your ear” – no one does tap their card, until I do. It doesn’t help that the sign has blown over. She gets more taps when she busks at train stations, she says. The project to enable buskers to accept contactless payments, still in its infancy, was launched by the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, and Campbell was one of a select few performers to be given a contactless card reader (by the Swedish financial technology company iZettle). But only a tiny proportion of her earnings comes that way. (Buskers, like everyone else, I learn, are reluctant to ulge exactly what they earn, but Campbell makes enough to live and pay rent in London.) For a while, she had been thinking about how the move towards a cashless society would affect her career, and noticed that more people were saying they didn’t have any cash on them. Her music is on iTunes and Spotify, and she has a website where you can donate by various means.Is contactless in the spirit of busking, I wonder? “There is a romantic thing about dropping a coin into a hat. That’s what people think they’re going to miss,” Campbell says. “But if people don’t have cash any more, that’s never going to be something people will get to do ever again. There’s only two options here – we either don’t have buskers or we drop a coin into a hat in a different way. We have to romanticise the tap on the screens somehow.” And she laughs.Campbell has not yet managed to romanticise the tap, or work it successfully into her hat line. (A hat line is a busker’s end-of-set patter, designed to extract maximum cash from audience. “If you could just take £1 or £2 out of your wallet and give me the rest,” is an old favourite.) When Campbell says: “Also, I have a card reader,” she sounds almost apologetic.Michael Hennessy, a New Yorker now living and busking in Bath, has also noticed that his hats have been down recently. Over the phone, he tells me he puts this down to multiple factors: global uncertainty, Brexit, Trump, Bath and North East Somerset council’s unhelpful parking restrictions that are putting off the tour operators, and, yes, the fact that people don’t have money in their pockets any more.Hennessy also has a card reader, although, so far, it has been more effective at generating comedy than income. People point at it and laugh. To which he now responds: “You know you wanna!” or “Come closer and I’ll empty your bank account.”Sherika Sherard busks on the South Bank and in Bath. She was a bit embarrassed about her card reader at first. “But then I thought, actually, I believe in what I do, and my talents, it’s OK,” she says. “When you think of yourself as a musician and you have music to showcase, it makes sense.”She makes little jokes about having to keep up with technology, people laugh. She has even had people give their cards to their kids to come up for a beep. “People see that you’re taking yourself seriously. It shows that you mean business.”Dr Paul Simpson is about the nearest there is to a professor of busking. He is a professor of human geography at the University of Plymouth, but he has done lots of research into street performance, as well as busking himself. And he is sceptical about contactless busking. “Throughout history, there have been attempts to legislate, regulate and organise, restrict,” he says. But part of a busker’s value “is the informality, the novelty, the excitement, the potential for unpredictability that they can bring to urban life”. Visa debit doesn’t quite capture this mercurial spirit.Simpson, who used to busk in Glasgow, says the sound of a coin hitting a pile of change helped get him through. “If it was a chilly day on Buchanan Street, drizzle in the air, you’d been there for hours, the sight of the coins inside your case gave you a sense of how you were doing, it was a material manifestation of appreciation. Because people don’t tend to clap or stop, it was the equivalent of a round of applause at the end of a song.” He wonders if the beep of a card machine would feel quite the same.Plus, he has issues with the fixed rate – tap to give £1 (£2 for Hennessy in Bath, no wonder they are laughing!). Busking, says Simpson, is a “democratic sort of performance, anyone can see it, there’s no standard charge if you choose to donate, you donate what you want to”.But for Nick Broad it is adapt or get a job. “There’s no middle ground where you cannot take cashless payments and still earn in a cashless society,” he says. Broad, with his partner Liliana Maz, runs the Busking Project, a non-profit organisation that exists “to promote, celebrate and defend buskers with tech, advocacy, research and opportunities.” Interviewed by Broad for a film, street performers in various countries told him their hats were getting smaller, and some attributed this to a move towards cashless. That was in 2011, since when Broad and Maz have developed various systems to try to make it easier for buskers to take payment via card, Paypal, Apple Pay and Google Pay, via a tip-me button on online performer profiles.Now they are trialling a new tap-to-tip system, where you tap your phone against something – a process that should take no more than a couple of seconds. Broad’s not saying too much about it, as it hasn’t been shown to work yet.One thing he and Simpson do agree on is the importance of buskers. Simpson says they can make uninspiring places more engaging, threatening places more hospitable, and can bring people together and make them smile. Broad talks about their place in the music industry, in which live venues are being closed down, and all the money goes to a tiny percentage of artists while everyone else picks over the crumbs. “Street performance, in my opinion, may be the only viable way of making a living as an independent artist,” he says. It is not unheard of for buskers to get spotted and signed. Benjamin Clementine, from Edmonton in north London, was disovered while playing on the Paris , and went on to be shortlisted for the 2015 Mercury music prize. BB King, Tracy Chapman and KT Tunstall are among others who started playing on the streets.I need to talk to more buskers outside London and Bath, with their mayor-friendly schemes, lotteries for prized slots, rules and licences. So, I head to Glasgow.Busking is big in Glasgow, big in its contribution to the atmosphere of the city centre, big in the number of people doing it. If you walk along the eastern half of Sauchiehall Street, then all the way down Buchanan Street, then left on to the pedestrianised part of Argyle Street, you will be accompanied – unless it’s chucking it down – by music. Pink Floyd’s Wish You Were Here fades out and in comes a piper, perhaps, Bob Marley’s Redemption Song or the sound of Oasis being murdered on a beaten-up guitar. It would be surprising if you made the journey without hearing Hallelujah.David Burns admits that Hallelujah is in his repertoire I hear him do Blur’s Coffee and TV, and a song by Marshall Chipped, his own indie band. Softly spoken, but with a big, deep singing voice, Burns has been busking in Glasgow for 15 years. When he began, there were just a handful of them, now it has reached saturation point. Today, his usual spot outside Costa was already gone – at 9am on a Thursday in November – so he is further down the street by the Co-op.He still makes enough to pay the bills, he says. It gets him out of the house, he only sings the songs he wants to sing and no one takes a cut. “Busking is the purest form of this,” he says. “It’s taking your music directly to people. You’re out here on the streets and if somebody likes you they’ll throw a coin in, if they don’t they’ll walk on past.”Burns has thought about people carrying less cash around – he is guilty of it himself – but thinks it will be more of an issue further down the line. In the meantime, he is keeping an eye on it. He doesn’t rule out having a contactless card reader one day.I speak to Andy Bargh, who has only been busking for five years. He thinks a card reader would look arrogant, almost as there is an expectation. He reckons that if a busker were photographed with one in Glasgow and it went on social media, they would be torn apart.In Buchanan Street, Malachy has bagged the prime spot outside TGI Fridays. As he did yesterday. He gets here early and sets his equipment out (although, as he won’t play for several hours, not everyone appreciates that). Malachy is from Western Australia, and has busked all over. Glasgow’s a fantastic place to do it, he says. “People have time for it here, they will listen and appreciate original music.”He plays what he describes as “long-hair wanker music”. Malachy isn’t a fan of Hallelujah. “If you walk up and down here, you’ll here Hallelujah about eight million fucking times.” Malachy says he will probably get a card reader next year. I wonder how that will go down with Glasgow’s other buskers. Malachy has busked in the US, where it is already far more common for buskers to take payments by card or phone. In China, it is not just buskers but beggars, too, who are now accepting digital payments.Here is another familiar tune – Champagne Supernova – played by Connor Stewart on the sitar. Stewart, a bouncer by night, is from the Govan area of Glasgow, but spent four or five years in Varanasi, India, learning the sitar. Indian classical music is his passion, and he plays it on the street as well as his sitar versions of Oasis and the Stone Roses. He hasn’t been doing it long enough to notice any change in hats or cash-carrying habits, but he seems to be doing OK today. And doing something different. I think the music is more important than the money for Connor: he is on a higher plane.Round the corner to Argyle Street, past Bobby Hamilton, “the Bowie and Bolan Busker Bloke”, is segueing seamlessly from The Man Who Sold The World to Hot Love. And here is Hallelujah, again, being sung by Nikki Foster. Foster, originally from County Durham, came to Glasgow to do a master’s in music at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland. She is a classically trained opera singer, but the operatic voice began to grate, she says. “I felt I wasn’t being my true self, like I was doing it just because I knew people would like it rather than because I wanted to.”Now she sings whatever the hell she wants to sing – Moon River from Breakfast at Tiffany’s, I Dreamed a Dream from Les Mis, Leonard Cohen’s Hallelujah. And it’s not a cry that you hear at night, It’s not somebody who’s seen the light, It’s a cold and it’s a broken Hallelujah.Singing on the street has taught Foster a lot. “I feel busking has really helped to reveal who I am,” she says. “I just let go of the bullshit in my mind.”She doesn’t do badly from it. If the people of Glasgow aren’t carrying much cash around any more, then most of it seems to be going into Foster’s hat. No one told her about not revealing earnings. It’s really good, she says. “You obviously get your off-days, like sometimes if I’m not feeling that good. The lowest I’d ever make is £20 an hour, if I’ve got a cold or something and I don’t want to be here, I’m forcing myself. But, generally, when I’m in the flow, it’s about 50 quid an hour.” Cash only. Hallelujah indeed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9d1f5de418b79f849961c5284b08c3080c72230/0_0_2212_3000/master/2212.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=e203b70347bcb2425a1566d66476fc11 1320w","title":"the making of an opioid epidemic","story":"When high doses of painkillers led to widespread addiction, it was called one of the biggest mistakes in modern medicine. But this was no accident. By  Chris McGrealJane Ballantyne was, at one time, a true believer. The British-born doctor, who trained as an anaesthetist on the NHS before her appointment to head the pain department at Harvard and its associated hospital, drank up the promise of opioid painkillers – drugs such as morphine and methadone – in the late 1990s. Ballantyne listened to the evangelists among her colleagues who painted the drugs as magic bullets against the scourge of chronic pain blighting millions of American lives. Doctors such as Russell Portenoy at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York saw how effective morphine was in easing the pain of dying cancer patients thanks to the hospice movement that came out of the UK in the 1970s.Why, the new thinking went, could the same opioids not be made to work for people grappling with the physical and mental toll of debilitating pain from arthritis, wrecked knees and bodies worn out by physically demanding jobs? As Portenoy saw it, opiates were effective painkillers through most of recorded history and it was only outdated fears about addiction that prevented the drugs still playing that role.Opioids were languishing from the legacy of an earlier epidemic that prompted President Theodore Roosevelt to appoint the US’s first opium commissioner, Dr Hamilton Wright, in 1908. Portenoy wanted to liberate them from this taint. Wright described Americans as “the greatest drug fiends in the world”, and opium and morphine as a “national curse”. After that the medical profession treated opioid pain relief with what Portenoy and his colleagues regarded as unwarranted fear, stigmatising a valuable medicine.Portenoy toured the country, describing opioids as a gift from nature and promoting access to narcotics as a moral argument. Being pain-free was a human right, he said. In 1993, he told the New York Times of a “growing literature showing that these drugs can be used for a long time, with few side-effects, and that addiction and abuse are not a problem”.Long after the epidemic took hold, and the death toll rose into the hundreds of thousands in the US, Portenoy admitted that there was little basis for this claim and that he had been more interested in changing attitudes to opioids among doctors than in scientific rigour.“In essence, this was education to destigmatise and because the primary goal was to destigmatise, we often left evidence behind,” he admitted years later as the scale of the epidemic unfolded.Likewise, Haddox’s theory of pseudo-addiction was based on the study of a single cancer patient. At the time, though, the new thinking was a liberation for primary care doctors frustrated at the limited help they could offer patients begging to get a few hours’ sleep. Ballantyne was as enthusiastic as anyone and began teaching the gospel of pain relief at Harvard, and embracing opioids to treat her patients.“Our message was a message of hope,” she said. “We were teaching that we shouldn’t withhold opiates from people suffering from chronic pain and that the risks of addiction were pretty low because that was the teaching we’d received.”But then Ballantyne began to see signs in her patients that experience wasn’t matching theory. Doctors were told they could repeatedly ratchet up the dosage of narcotics and switch to a new and powerful drug, OxyContin, without endangering the patient, because the pain, in effect, cancelled out the risk of addiction. To her dismay, Ballantyne saw that many of her patients were not better off when taking the drugs and were showing signs of dependence.Among those patients on high doses over months and years, Ballantyne heard from one after another that the more drugs they took, the worse their pain became. But if they tried to stop or cut back on the pills, their pain also worsened. They were trapped.“You had never seen people in such agony as these people on high doses of opiates,” she told me. “And we thought it’s not just because of the underlying pain it’s to do with the medication.”As Ballantyne listened to relatives of her patients talk about how much the drugs had changed their loved ones, her misgivings grew. Husbands spoke of wives as if a part of them were lost. Mothers complained that children had become sullen and distant, their judgment gone, their personality warped, their character altered. None of this should have been happening. Pain relief was supposed to free the patients, not imprison them. It was all very far from the promise of a magic bullet.As the evidence that opioids were not delivering as promised piled up, the Harvard specialist began to record her findings. By then, though, there were other powerful forces with a big financial stake in the wider prescribing of painkilling drugs. Pharmaceutical companies are not slow to spot an opportunity and the push for wider prescribing of opioids had not gone unnoticed by the drug-makers, including the manufacturer of OxyContin, Purdue Pharma, which rapidly came to play a central role in the epidemic.As the influence of the opioid evangelists grew, and restraints on prescribing loosened, the pharmaceutical industry moved to the fore with a push to make opioids the default treatment for pain, and to take advantage of the huge profits to be made from mass prescribing of a drug that was cheap to produce.The American Pain Society, a body partially funded by pharmaceutical companies, was pushing the concept of pain as the “fifth vital sign”, alongside other measures of health such as heart rate and blood pressure. “Vital signs are taken seriously,” said its president, James Campbell, in a 1996 speech to the society. “If pain were assessed with the same zeal as other vital signs are, it would have a much better chance of being treated properly. We need to train doctors and nurses to treat pain as a vital sign.” The APS wanted the practice of checking pain as a vital sign as a matter of routine adopted in American hospitals. The key was to win over the Joint Commission for Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations, which certifies about 20,000 hospitals and clinics in the US. Its stamp of approval is the gateway for medical facilities to tap into the huge pot of federal money paying for healthcare for older, disabled and poor people. Hospitals are careful not to get on the wrong side of the joint commission’s “best practices” or to fail its regular performance reviews.In response to what it called “the national outcry about the widespread problem of under-treatment” – an outcry in good part generated by drug manufacturers – the commission issued new standards for pain care in 2001. Hospital administrators picked over the document to ensure they understood exactly what was required.Every patient was to be asked about their pain levels, no matter what the reason they were seeing a doctor. Hospitals adopted a system of colour-coded smiley faces, to represent a rising scale of pain from 0-10. The commission ruled that anybody identifying as a five – a yellow neutral face described as “very distressing” – or above was to be was to be referred for a pain consultation.The commission told hospitals they would be expected to meet the new standards for pain management at their next accreditation survey. Purdue Pharma was ready. The company offered to distribute materials to educate doctors in pain management for free. This amounted to exclusive rights to indoctrinate medical staff. A training video asserted that there is “no evidence that addiction is a significant issue when persons are given opioids for pain control”, and claimed that some clinicians had “inaccurate and exaggerated concerns about addiction, tolerance and risk of death”. Neither claim was true.Some doctors questioned the value of patient self-assessment, but the commission’s regulations soon came to be viewed as a rigid standard. In time, pain as the fifth vital sign worked its way into hospital culture. New generations of nurses, steeped in the opioid orthodoxy, sometimes came to see pain as more important than other health indicators.Dr Roger Chou, a pain specialist at Oregon Health and Science University who has made long-term studies of the effectiveness of opioid painkillers and helped shape the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s policy on the epidemic, said the focus on pain caused patients to give it greater weight than made sense.“When you start asking people: ‘How much pain are you having?’ every time they come into the hospital, then people start thinking: ‘Well, maybe I shouldn’t be having this little ache I’ve been having. Maybe there’s something wrong.’ You’re medicalising what’s a normal part of life,” he said.One consequence was that people with relatively minor pain were increasingly directed toward medicinal treatment while consideration of safer or more effective alternatives, such as physiotherapy, were marginalised. Another, said Chou, was the increased expectation that pain can be eliminated. Chasing the lowest score on the pain chart often came at the expense of quality of life as opioid doses increased. “It’s better to have a little bit of pain and be functional than to have no pain and be completely unfunctional,” said Chou.Health insurance companies piled yet more pressure on doctors to follow the path of least resistance. This meant cutting consultation times and payments for more costly forms of pain treatment in favour of the direct approach: drugs.The joint commission needed a way to judge whether its 2001 edict on pain was being adhered to and latched on to patient satisfaction surveys. It took a determined doctor to resist the pressure to prescribe. Physicians could spend half an hour pressing a person to take more responsibility for their own health – eat better, exercise more, drink less, find ways to deal with stress – only to watch an unhappy patient make their views known on the satisfaction survey and face a dressing down from hospital management. Or they could quickly do what the patient came in for: give them a pill and get full marks.In Detroit, Dr Charles Lucas’s three decades of experience as a surgeon told him it was possible to do what was easy and sign the prescription, or to do what was hard. Lucas grew up in the city and had been instrumental in establishing Detroit’s publicly owned hospital as the highest-level trauma centre in Michigan and one of the first top-tier centres in the country.Emergency departments became beacons for the opioid dependent, who quickly learned to game the system to get drugs on top of their prescriptions. They turned up feigning pain, knowing harassed medical staff under pressure of time and the commission’s standards were likely to prescribe narcotics and move on without too many questions. “Some of the old-time nurses, they have that jaundiced look in their eye and say ‘So-and-so’s complaining of pain’. You can tell by the look in their eye that they don’t think it’s justified that they get any more medicine,” said Lucas. “The younger nurses, they say we have to treat this pain – because they’ve been indoctrinated – they’ve got to get rid of the pain. God forbid you don’t get rid of the pain. That would be like a mortal sin.”But there was a price for resisting the pressure to prescribe ever higher doses of pain relief.Lucas was knocked back in surprise, and then infuriated, to be summoned to appear before his hospital’s ethics committee after a nurse reported him for failing to provide adequate pain treatment.The surgeon’s longstanding patients included Gail Purton, the wife of a well-known Michigan radio personality. Lucas operated on Purton a few times, and she was back for surgery after her ovarian cancer spread. “It was a big operation. Cut off all sorts of cancer.” The next day, a nurse asked Purton if she was in pain. Purton said she was. The nurse reported Lucas for failing to properly address a patient’s pain. “I got reported because I wasn’t giving her enough pain medicine. She had a big cut from here to here,” Lucas said, running his finger across the front of his shirt and scoffing at the idea that she could be pain-free after an operation like that.The surgeon responded with a five-page letter to the ethics committee chairman, whom he happened to have trained, challenging the questioning of his professional judgment. Purton wrote her own letter, praising Lucas’s care and saying that she never expected not to have pain after a major operation.The case was dropped, but it was not an isolated incident. Lucas has worked closely with another surgeon, Anna Ledgerwood, since 1972. She too was hauled before the ethics committee on more than one occasion, on the same charge. It cleared Ledgerwood, but Lucas said more junior surgeons buckled to the pressure to administer opioids just to stay out of trouble.Lucas regarded the new pain orthodoxy as a growing tyranny. He also thought it was killing patients. He began to collect his own data.As the joint commission was pushing out its new standards for pain treatment in the early 2000s, the industry was driving a parallel effort to influence the prescribing habits of doctors in small clinics and private practices across the country. Many were still hesitant to prescribe narcotics, in part because of fear of legal liability for overdose or addiction.The American Pain Society and Haddox, who was by then working for Purdue Pharma, were instrumental in writing a policy document reassuring doctors they would not face disciplinary action for prescribing narcotics, even in large quantities. The industry latched on to the Federation of State Medical Boards because of its influence over the health policy of inidual US states which regulate how doctors practise medicine.In 2001, Purdue Pharma funded the distribution of new pain treatment guidelines drawn up by the FSMB that sounded many of the same themes as the standards written by the joint commission.The document picked up on Haddox’s pseudo-addiction theory. “Physicians should recognise that tolerance and physical dependence are normal consequences of sustained use of opioid analgesics and are not synonymous with addiction,” it said.The FSMB pressed state medical boards to adopt the guidelines and to reassure doctors that adhering to them would diminish the likelihood of disciplinary action.Over the following decade, the FSMB took close to $2m (£1.52m) from the drug industry, which mostly went to promote the guidelines and to finance a book, Responsible Opioid Prescribing, written with the oversight and advice of a clutch of doctors who were strong advocates of wider use of prescription narcotics. The book was sold to state medical boards and health departments for distribution to physicians, clinics and hospitals. The drug industry paid for the publication but the FSMB kept the $270,000 profits from sales.Within a few years, the model guidelines were adopted in full or in part by 35 states, and the floodgates were open to mass prescribing of what Drug Enforcement Administration agents came to call “heroin in a pill”. Opioids were soon the default treatment even for relatively minor pain. Dentists gave them to teenagers after pulling their wisdom teeth. Not just one or two days’ worth of pills, but a fortnight or a month’s worth, which, if they did not draw the intended recipient in, frequently sat in the medicine cabinet waiting to be discovered by someone else in the family. The lack of caution in prescribing left an impression among the users that the drugs were harmless, and some people shared them with others as easily as they might an aspirin. Prescribing escalated year on year. So did profits. OxyContin sales passed $1bn a year in 2000. Three years later they were twice that. Other opioid makers were pulling in huge profits too.By the time the FSMB guidelines were landing in doctors’ inboxes in the early 2000s, Ballantyne had reached her own conclusions about the impact of escalating opioid prescribing. In 2003, she co-authored an article in the New England Journal of Medicine highlighting the dearth of comprehensive trials and saying that two important questions remained unanswered even as mass prescribing of opioids took off. Do they work long term? Are higher doses safe to take year after year? The drug industry and opioid evangelists said yes, but where was the evidence for it?Ballantyne wrote that there was evidence that putting some patients on serial prescriptions of strong opioids has the opposite of the intended effect. High doses not only build up a tolerance to the drug, but cause increased sensitivity to pain. The drugs were defeating themselves.Her assessment seemed to warn that if there was an epidemic of pain, it was partly driven by the cure. On top of that, there was evidence that the drugs were toxic. Then came the conclusion that stuck a dagger into the heart of the campaign for wider opioid prescribing. “Whereas it was previously thought that unlimited dose escalation was at least safe, evidence now suggests that prolonged, high-dose opioid therapy may be neither safe nor effective,” she wrote.From her research, Ballantyne concluded that OxyContin supercharged what was already widespread dependence on weaker opioid pills by drawing a new group of people into the category at risk of addiction and death. The danger was compounded by OxyContin’s failure to live up to its promise of holding pain at bay for 12 hours. For some patients, it wore off after eight, causing them to take three pills a day instead of two, greatly increasing their overall dose of narcotic and with it the risk of addiction.Ballantyne thought the article would at least cause her profession and the drug industry to take stock of the impact of mass prescribing. By the time the article appeared, the documented death toll from prescription opioids was running at around 8,000 a year.“When the 2003 New England journal article came out, I thought it was going to make the medical community sit up and say: ‘Wow. These drugs that we’ve been thinking are helping people are not. We have a real problem.’ But the medical community didn’t at all say: ‘Wow,’” Ballantyne said with half a laugh, 15 years later.“People in my field who had been, like me, taught we have to do this – people who’d been lobbying to try and increase opiate use, like the palliative care physicians – said: ‘What are you doing? We worked so hard to get to this point, and now you’re going to turn it all around. They become so rattled when you suggest you shouldn’t give the opiates – it’s partly people in the pain field and especially people in pharma – because it’s big business.”Lucas and Ledgerwood had their own study on the impact of opioids in the works. They came to believe the tyranny of the colour-coded smiley faces was costing lives. Years of surgery have given Lucas a healthy respect for pain as a tool for recovery. To suppress it was dangerous. But as large doses of opioids became the norm, the surgeon noted an increasing number of incidents of patients struggling to breathe after routine operations and being moved to intensive care.“In each case, administration of sedation led to a change in vital signs or a deterioration in the respiratory status requiring some type of intervention which, in turn, led to a cascade of events resulting in death,” the paper said. Those were only the deaths in which there was little doubt opioids were responsible, and the real toll was almost certainly higher. “Overmedication with sedativesnarcotics … clearly contributed to deaths,” the study concluded.“I’m convinced that because of the pressures brought to bear by the joint commission, we are killing people,” Lucas told me. The study said the medical staff lived in fear of the joint commission standards which created “great psychological pressure on caregivers” to use narcotics.In a damning critique, the paper said that the commission’s reliance on pain scales to guide treatment had created an “excessive emphasis on undermedication at the same time ignoring overmedication”. The obsession with ensuring people were not in pain came at the expense of ignoring the dangers of giving large amounts of opioids to people recovering from surgery or serious injury. The drugs may kill the pain but they also risked killing the patient.The two doctors made no secret of who they blamed for “this preventable cause of death and disability”. “It’s about money. Money has influence, and it influenced the joint commission,” said Lucas.The surgeon presented the paper to a meeting of the Central Surgical Association and saw it published by the Journal of the American College of Surgeons under the headline “Kindness Kills: The Negative Impact of Pain as the Fifth Vital Sign.”Afterwards, Lucas got a stream of letters and emails from doctors who recognised the problem. But, unlike Ballantyne, he wasn’t surprised when the policy remained the same. “Did I expect a change? No. It is too ingrained into the medical profession. It’s become financial just like the drug industry is financial. It’s nothing to do with right or wrong. It’s about how the money flows,” he said. “When you write a paper you want there to be unemotional data out there. You want that unemotional data to be analysed and interpreted in one way or the other, but you don’t expect the Renaissance.”In 2012, nine years after Ballantyne’s cautioning against the mass prescribing of opioids as a quick fix for pain was published in the New England Journal of Medicine, a renowned British pain specialist, Cathy Stannard, called the doctor’s paper “a distant warning bell”, challenging the opening of the floodgates to strong opioids.Ballantyne continued to collect data and publish ever more detailed insights into the impact of painkillers. A less rapacious drug industry might have paused in its headlong charge to sell opioids, and less blinkered and compliant regulators might have determined that this was the moment to weigh the claims made in favour of permitting such widespread prescribing.Instead the pharmaceutical companies took the warnings as a challenge to their business interests. Through the 2000s, industry poured money into a political strategy to keep the drugs flowing. It funded front groups and studies to claim that there was indeed an epidemic – but it was of untreated pain. The millions coping with chronic pain were the real victims, the industry said, not the “abusers” hooked on opioids they often bought on the black market or obtained from crooked doctors. That one frequently became the other was conveniently overlooked.Pharma’s lobbyists worked to persuade Congress and the regulators that to curb opioid prescribing would be to punish the real victims because of the sins of the “abusers”, and it worked. As a result, the devastation ran unchecked for another decade and more. By 2010, doctors in the US were writing more than 200m opioid prescriptions a year. As the prescribing rose, so did the death toll. Last year, more than 72,000 Americans died of drug overdoses, the vast majority from opioids, nearly 10 times the number at the time Ballantyne published her warning.The head of the FDA at the time OxyContin was approved for distribution two decades ago, Dr David Kessler, later described the opioid crisis as an “epidemic we failed to foresee”. “It has proved to be one of the biggest mistakes in modern medicine,” he said.This is an edited extract from American Overdose by Chris McGreal, published by  Faber on 15 November (£12.99), and published by PublicAffairs Books in the US on 13 November.

That would prompt a renegotiation, he said, implying that a revised deal would then get approved by MPs. (See 9.03am.)Rupert Harrison, who was chief of staff to George Osborne in the Treasury, also thinks that getting the Brexit deal through the Commons will end up being a two-state process.(Reminder - this is what happened when congress voted down the bailout.)But Davis was implying that, in the event of the first deal being voted down, the EU would compromise. Harrison seems to be implying that it will be MPs who will buckle once the reality of what they have done becomes apparent.Women MPs from around the globe have pledged to form an international sisterhood and support each other’s fight for gender equality.In the year marking 100 years since some women got the vote the UK has hosted the first ever meeting of women MPs from every parliament in the world.At the gathering of 120 women from 86 countries at the houses of parliament in London, Penny Mordaunt, the international development secretary and minister for women, praised the “powerful strong courageous women” who had gathered, saying they had been motivated “by love, of our nations, your children and humanity” - thanking one politician for bringing her baby into the house of commons.She said the challenges faced by women MPs included balancing work with motherhood, the daily battle to be taken seriously, sexual harassment and intimidation, adding that female parliamentarians had to show “restraint and resolve ... when constantly being patronised, the fight to be heard and to keep going when you are frightened.”Calling on the spirit of the suffragettes, and echoing their rallying cry, Mordaunt suggested the international group could share a “giant sisterhood whatsapp group”, adding: The margin of success is in this room. Because courage calls to courage everywhere, because without women’s rights there are no human rights.She paid tribute to the suffragettes, but also to parliamentarians who had lost their lives while serving the public, such as Jo Cox.Welcoming the politicians at Downing street last night the prime minister, Theresa May, said there were more female members of parliaments and legislative assemblies around the world than ever.More women in elected office means a greater voice speaking out on issues that affect women. It means a greater focus on preventing gender-based violence, on girls’ education, on childcare and on women’s health ... But the benefits are also felt more widely. After all, if half the population is systematically excluded from politics then you’re also excluding half the talent.Mother of the House Harriet Harman, who has been an MP for 36 years , said that all the MPs present shared the goal of being equal with men in parliament and being able to deliver equality for women. She said:In this week’s Spectator James Forsyth has a good article (paywall) with a bit more detail about how Theresa May’s proposed plan for the Irish backstop might work. He says:At the same time, the ‘level playing field’ regulatory demands that the UK-wide backstop entails will severely curtail the freedom of the government to act. When the cabinet sees all these requirements written down, some might balk — especially because it’s so unclear how the UK would free itself. Resignations might follow. As one cabinet member says: ‘This is my own red line. At a push, I’ve accepted we obey EU regulation on product standards. But if we also have to obey their rules on how our companies are run, then it would be capitulation. Hers, but not mine.’Crunch time is fast approaching. If the UK and the EU do sign a Brexit deal, there’ll be a transition period that runs to December 2020. But it is now highly unlikely that this will provide enough time to agree a trade deal or to sort out future customs arrangements. I understand from those who have seen its latest iteration that the political declaration, which will set out the plan for the future relationship between the UK and the EU, contains a series of options. This means that the most important decisions have yet to be taken, let alone worked up in detail or negotiated on. The result is that it is almost certain that in December 2020 either the transition will need to be extended or the backstop invoked.The UK would then find itself in an arrangement that it would struggle to leave. One of those who has carefully examined the legal implications of this tells me that the backstop will be entrenched in UK law, as the European Communities Act of 1972 was. On top of this, the backstop will create an open-ended international legal obligation for the UK. This would mean that the UK couldn’t simply renounce the backstop or give notice to quit. Rather, it would have to hope that the proposed ‘joint review mechanism’ would allow the UK to leave it. To put it another way, this would be like the UK having to go to arbitration before invoking article 50. The UK would not have the sovereign right to simply quit the backstop.According to Sam Coates in the Times today (paywall), Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, is particularly worried about the level playing field proposals. Coates says:Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, is understood to have told Mrs May he was concerned that this “would mean a single market through the backdoor”. There are worries that in the event a backstop Britain would have to adhere to the working time directive, which bars staff from working more than a 48-hour week unless they opt out. This would mean obeying parts of the “social chapter”, long the target of Conservative Eurosceptics.And Jacob Rees-Mogg, the chair of the European Research Group, which represents Tory MPs pushing for a harder Brexit, told the Sun that the “joint review mechanism” is particularly unacceptable to his colleagues. He said:It is completely absurd. Brexit means we can already leave the customs union when we want to, why should we give that up? It is a breach of faith with the electorate to stay in it under the authority of a third party.We are already seeing evidence that this arbitration mechanism is building our numbers. One colleague who is wavering about what to do has approached me in the last 24 hours to say he will vote with us if Mrs May goes ahead with this.Opposition parties and anti-Brexit groups have been lining up to criticise Dominic Raab, the Brexit secretary, today for what he said about the Dover-Calais crossing. (See 9.25am.) Labour put out this statement from the shadow Brexit minister Jenny Chapman.How are we meant to trust this government to deliver a good deal for the country when we have a Brexit secretary who doesn’t even understand the very basics of Brexit?The SNP put out this statement from MSP Stewart Stevenson.This is a stunning admission that shows just how clueless the Tories are about their Brexit plans. A Tory Brexit could have a catastrophic impact on trade with the continent and leave supermarket shelves empty. And that scenario could also mean Scottish exports, such as seafood, stuck in lorry parks at Dover rather than reaching their export markets in a timely manner. And the anti-Brexit group Best for Britain put out this statement from Labour MP Jo Stevens. We finally have an admission of what we’ve known all along - that the Brexiteers hadn’t really thought through any of the impacts of leaving the EU. These comments are shocking.This is from the Times’ Sam Coates.A document leaked to news organisations on Tuesday purporting to show government plans for a PR offensive to sell Theresa May’s Brexit deal suggested the Cabinet Office would prepare an explainer showing what the outcome would mean for the public “comparing it to no deal, but not to our current deal”. Today Dominic Grieve, the Conservative pro-European and former attorney general, has written to the cabinet secretary, Sir Mark Sedwill, saying any explainer of this kind should also compare the deal to the status quo. In his own letter, which has been produced in collaboration with People’s Vote, the campaign for a second referendum, he says:It is of the utmost importance that parliament and the public can compare any arrangement the prime minister agrees, against the benefits of European Union membership and make clear the impact that the deal proposed would have on every single area of the economy, public services, finances, security and opportunity. Indeed the minister in charge of Brexit has previously stated that the deal Britain will secure will have the ‘exact same benefits’ we currently enjoy.My colleague Graeme Wearden has more on this on his business live blog.Scotland’s highest court has refused the UK government leave to appeal its referral of a case to the European court of justice that seeks to establish whether the UK can unilaterally stop Brexit, my colleague Libby Brooks reports. This paves the way for the case to be heard in Luxembourg later this month.Here is the article from Austria’s Standard about the Brexit deal flagged up earlier. And here, thanks to the wonders of Google Translate, are some of the key points it is making.European agriculture commissioner Phil Hogan told RTE that unless Britain produced its proposals for the Irish border within the “next few days” a November deal was unlikely. He said:I would say if I was a betting person we would have a December council to discuss the final outcome and hopefully we can do a deal.The December European council is scheduled for Thursday 13 December and Friday 14.He insisted Britain could not backslide on the backstop it agreed to in December last year and the EU “wait for proposals from the UK about how they can adapt their position to accommodate the agreement they have already made in relation to the backstop.”These are from the ’s Gordon Rayner.At FMQs this lunchtime Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, referred to a report released today by the Fraser of Allander Institute which found that the NHS would soon account for half of Scottish government spending.While Sturgeon was using it to press home the message of government investment, the FAI report warned of a knock-on squeeze on funding for other services, calling for “an urgent debate on future priorities” and suggesting options including sweeping council tax reforms and the controversial possibility of introducing student tuition fees.Late yesterday afternoon, a clear majority of MSPs voted in favour of a second referendum on Brexit, following a Lib Dem amendment to a Holyrood debate on Brexit which urged members to support the campaign for a People’s Vote.SNP, Green and Lib Dem members supported the call, along with two Labour MSPs, while the rest of the Labour group abstained, in the symbolic vote which was nevertheless the first time the Holyrood Parliament has put its views on a second Brexit vote on record.“Simplify, then exaggerate,” is a standard piece of advice for journalists (coined by a former editor of the Economist). In normal circumstances it is good advice too, but perhaps it’s not so wise when applied to matters pertaining to national identity, and particularly to those affecting the people of Northern Ireland, who, as Theresa May is discovering, don’t take these things lightly.So, with that in mind, I’ll correct what I said at 11.09am, and apologise to readers who complained about it below the line. “We” are not an island. If “we” means the UK, then obviously Northern Ireland is included. And even if you just look at the smaller entity, Great Britain, then “island” does not apply either. What about the Isle of Wight, Orkney, and Shetland, for startersIn fact, according to ukcoastguide, there are at least 1,000 islands making up the UK, and perhaps as many as 5,000. It has a list of some of the main ones here. According to a contributor to a  Notes and queries column, there are around 4,400 islands in the British Isles, or 6,100 at high tide, of which around 210 are inhabited.This topic relates to a broader question about whether people live in England, Great Britain, the United Kingdom - something which is confusing not just to foreigners, but to people who live here too. If you are interested in this topic, you should read The Isles, a history of this archipelago by Norman Davies. He chose that title specifically because he considered others unsatisfactory, and his book includes a lengthy introduction about how people studying this country’s history have often been uncertain as to what they are actually referring to. Here’s an excerpt.One of Davies’ arguments is that the UK state has been less permanent than people think. He told Channel 4 News:All political entities fall apart sooner or later. It’s just a question of when. The United Kingdom began to break up in 1922 when the Irish Free State was formed. English people have forgotten that.The pillars of Britishness are all crumbling or have already crumbled, so the United Kingdom is living on borrowed time. My view is a bit fatalistic: what will happen will happen.At some point after Brexit there may be a need for another edition.UPDATE: This is quite useful on the subject too.The European commission has tweeted this. Perhaps they’re trying to make a point?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc487dfc4b1ae6d27ad443170aeeb18aef77255c/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2f290d31985bfdbef8b318e14816d589","title":"tell us has your company adopted a living wage policy","story":"We want to hear from readers working for companies paying Living Wage Foundation rates as an increase is announcedStaff of some 4,700 employers who have adopted a voluntary living wage policy are in line for an inflation-beating pay rise.The foundation’s figures are £1.17 higher an hour than the national living wage imposed by the government for workers over the age of 25.

But now his lens is trained on Britain, the fifth richest country in the world, and he listened as Hunter explained an absurdity of the government’s much-criticised universal credit welfare programme.Users have to go online to keep their financial lifeline open, but computers need electricity – and with universal credit leaving a £465 monthly budget to stretch the three people in Michael’s family (about £5 each a day), they can barely afford it with the meter ticking.“I have to be quick doing my universal credit because I am that scared of losing the electric,” he said. Alston mentally logged the situation, ahead of a report ruling on whether Britain is meeting its international obligations not to increase inequality. But it was not just the computer that was too expensive to power.“I am hungry sometimes,” Michael said. “I’m scared to eat sometimes in case we run out of food.”“Universal credit has punched us in the face,” said his mother, Denise, 57. “Before much longer people will turn to crime. People will smash the windows to get what they want. This is going to cause riots.”The Hunters’ story was just one of a long list of stark insights into life in poverty delivered by the people of Newcastle to Alston during his trip to uncover what austerity is doing to the people of the UK and “to investigate government efforts to eradicate poverty”.Last year his no-holds-barred UN report into the impact of Trump-era policies on the US brought a stinging reaction from the White House. The odds are that Alston will say the UK is far from doing enough to meet its obligations. In 1976 the UK ratified the UN covenant on economic, social and cultural rights agreeing that policy changes in times of economic crisis must not be discriminatory, must mitigate, not increase, inequalities and that disadvantaged people must not be disproportionately affected.But it is the inidual stories that stand out. At Citizens Advice in the city centre Alston met Sharon Morton, who hasn’t had hot water or heating for a year and washes her body using a technique to minimise spending on boiled water.“I wash in what I call a birdbath – a little hot water in a basin and have a spruce down,” she said. “To keep warm I wrap up in layers and layers. I never thought I would be 48 and in this position.”Tracey Whitenstall, a mother of three, said that because of a 10-week delay in getting UC payments, she couldn’t afford her son’s bus fare and lunch money and so didn’t send him to school for several weeks as he was preparing for his GSCEs. As a result his grades slipped.“It was the worst, him missing out on education,” she said, tears welling in her eyes.There was Thushara Chandrasiri, who has a disabled right hand and was told by a disability benefits assessor that he could now work and was refusing him benefits.“What I found disgusting was that when I said I had the condition a long time, they said you should be used to it by now,” he said. “Because I am right handed they said ‘you’ve got a left hand, use it’.”They regaled Alston with stories about the frustration of dealing with the UC system, how messages they post on online journals take days to be answered. They explained how an anonymous figure, known only as “the decision maker” was often cited in correspondence, but they never knew who this was.Alston is not ready to draw conclusions, but his concern was clear. Outside the food bank, which featured in Ken Loach’s austerity feature film I, Daniel Blake, he said: “When you have rates of maybe a third of children living in poverty and you have a food bank clientele at a place like this that is growing and growing and growing, you have issues here. Is the situation in the UK as good as it could be?”The Labour leader of the city council, Nick Forbes, also briefed Alston on his anger at cuts and then told the  of the “pain and misery” of universal credit.In Newcastle, UC has caused a spike in demand for short-term help to pay rent and electricity, the council claims. The council’s emergency housing payments budget – £100,000 in 2012 – is expected to hit £1m this year. The number of people needing emergency money for power is running at a rate 30 times higher than in 2016, before the rollout of UC began in earnest.In response to Alston’s visit the Department for Work and Pensions said the UK government was “committed to upholding the rule of law and rules-based international systems” and insisted that on an absolute measure of poverty a million fewer people and children were living in hardship compared with 2010.At the day drew to a close, Alston drove out to North Shields and spoke to residents at the Meadow Well estate, scene of riots in 1991 driven in part by poverty. Things had got better since then, but are getting worse again now, he heard.Some people have to work five zero-hours jobs to make ends meet, said Phil McGrath, chief executive of the Cedarwood Trust community centre. The trust is encouraging residents to engage in local and national politics to have their voice heard. It is paying off with some people who have never voted turning out at the last general election, he said.Mike Burgess, who runs the Phoenix Detached Youth Project, told Alston how 18 publicly funded youth workers in the area in 2011 had dwindled to zero today. He described how a young man he worked with was in hospital for months after having a kidney removed. The jobcentre said he had to get back to work or face being sanctioned (losing benefits). He went to work in pain, but his employer realised and said he was not fit.“There’s no safety net for my lad or people with mental health problems,” he said.And that is the hidden cost facing many at the sharpest end of austerity in Newcastle.“In the last two or three weeks we have seen a massive increase in numbers of people with mental health issues and people with breakdown,” said McGrath, blaming benefit sanctions and a lack of social and mental health workers to catch people. “People are just being ground down.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7170ef61f786024edc88c73a866ec4e0b06f602/0_215_3872_2323/master/3872.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=64e7d879c9465b9b498edc698f831359","title":"rental homes advertised excluding benefits claimants no dss","story":"Shelter says landlords insisting ‘no DSS’ causes misery and is likely to be unlawfulAt least one in 10 rental properties in England could be being unlawfully advertised by explicitly discriminating against people on housing benefit, housing charities have said.Analysis of around 86,000 letting agents’ adverts on the property website Zoopla by the homeless charity Shelter and the National Housing Federation (a trade association for social housing providers) in England found 8,710 posts that ruled out tenants on housing benefit.Thousands of lettings agents and landlords who reject housing benefit claimants could be in breach of equality laws after a single mother won compensation for sex discrimination from a lettings agency that refused to consider her as a tenant, in a landmark case in February.Michelle Hunte, 36, who experienced discrimination after she and her family were made homeless in 2016, said: “I couldn’t find anywhere to live, so ended up in a horrible B\u0026ampB with only a single bed for myself, my husband and our one-year-old child, who is disabled. There was no space for a cot, it was dirty and there were no cooking facilities. There was nowhere for my other children to sleep, so they had to stay with different family and friends.“Eventually, I found this home through Shepherd’s Bush Housing Association, who were the only landlords who would accept someone on benefits. They really supported me and gave me a long tenancy. I’ve never missed a rent payment before and I’ve looked after every home I’ve lived in really well. What am I supposed to do? This kind of discrimination has to stop.”Polly Neate, the chief executive of Shelter England, said: “It’s staggering to see this discrimination laid out in black and white – and brazenly enforced by letting agents, landlords and online property websites. ‘No DSS’ is outdated, offensive and causing misery for thousands.“Not only is ‘No DSS’ grossly unfair, it is likely to be unlawful because it overwhelmingly affects women and disabled people. That’s why we need the lettings industry to stop blaming each other, accept its role in this shocking practice and clean up its act.”Kate Henderson, the chief executive of the NHF, which represents social landlords to around 6 million people, said: “Many housing associations were created in the 50s and 60s in reaction to discrimination and racism from private landlords who wouldn’t house migrants, and said ‘No Irish, No Blacks, No Dogs.’ Today’s discrimination is hardly any different and we refuse to turn a blind eye.”A spokesman for Zoopla said: “Zoopla supports the recommendations of the National Landlords Association and the Residents Landlords Association, which have advocated that landlords do not impose blanket bans against tenants on benefits.“Zoopla is aware of a small number of rental listings on its websites that fit into this category and Zoopla will write to all of its member agents to recommend that they follow the NLA and RLA guidance.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/850e14c3bdb787ca80e60fa18fddd7373054f17c/0_285_5016_3011/master/5016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=84eadc29cf0957e77247c60b0ed2d453","title":"chris ashton to start for england against all blacks as tuilagi misses out","story":"Chris Ashton will make his first England start since 2014 against the All Blacks on Saturday but there is no place in the squad for Manu Tuilagi.Eddie Jones has made three changes to the side that beat South Africa last weekend with Ashton getting the nod on the right wing as Jack Nowell drops to the bench.As reported in the  on Wednesday, Sam Underhill comes in at openside flanker for Tom Curry while Ben Moon has been selected ahead of his Exeter team-mate Alec Hepburn at loosehead prop. Courtney Lawes has been deemed fit enough for a place among the replacements meaning no place for Zach Mercer despite an eye-catching debut off the bench last weekend.“Tom Curry unfortunately is unavailable for the rest of the Quilter Internationals,” said Jones. “Sam Underhill we know is a very good player, he played for us in the Six Nations and the Argentina tour so we are looking forward to him making an impact around the ruck.”“We have a really good bench,” he said. “The finishers did well last week and again they will be vital on Saturday against New Zealand in the last 20 minutes which we know has a very significant impact on the result of the Test match.”Ashton impressed in a 15-minute cameo off the bench against the Springboks but he has started only one match this season for Sale after picking up a seven-week suspension during pre-season. His international try-scoring record speaks for itself however, having scored 19 times in 40 Tests.Tuilagi’s omission is a surprise after England confirmed earlier this week that he had recovered form the minor groin injury which denied him a place on the bench against South Africa. Jones however, has opted to stick with the centre partnership of Ben Te’o and Henry Slade and with Nowell joined by George Ford among the replacements there is no place for Tuilagi.However, Jones clarified that his absence was a matter of caution. “Manu is just not quite right,” he said. “He’s nearly there and we feel like he’ll be of enormous value to us in the future. Rather than take any risks with him we’re being quite conservative in his management.“He’s at 99.9999 per cent but he’s just not quite right so we’re going to see if we get him 100 cent right. It would be nice if that’s for Japan. We’ll worry about that next week.”Moon makes his first start after coming on for Hepburn at half-time last weekend to win his debut but Kyle Sinckler keeps his place at tighthead despite competition from Harry Williams. Dylan Hartley is again on co-captain duties with the fly-half Owen Farrell – who is one point short of 700 for England – while Maro Itoje and George Kruis continue in the second row.Brad Shields has been named at blindside flanker to face his New Zealand compatriots while last week’s man of the match Mark Wilson continues at No8. Ben Youngs is again at scrum-half while Jonny May is on the left wing and Elliot Daly stays at fullback despite his struggles under the high ball against the Springboks.Jones added: “The expectation for Saturday is no different to any other Test match. We want to be at our best, better than we were in the previous Test match and we want to play with pride and passion which ignites the fans.“Every England side I’ve coached prepares well and the players want to be at their best.. At the moment we have a very young squad, particularly in the forwards and I’ve enjoyed how much they’ve worked together because the collective will of the forwards is so important.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2051c6fc8bc96b089d709e04d4777eb0da1de2de/0_327_5736_3441/master/5736.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6bf03719b6bddb92db5998579601a07a","title":"england women rugby usa preview loughborough lightning katy daley mclean","story":"The Loughborough Lightning fly-half will line up for England at Allianz Park on Friday in a sport unrecognisable from 11 years agoFor Katy Daley-Mclean the wheel really has turned the full circle. Eleven years ago England’s fly-half made her first international appearance against Scotland in St Albans, coming off the bench where she had been sitting with another woman player about to make her debut, Sarah Hunter, her friend since they both met as aspiring 14-year-old rugby league players at Gateshead Thunder.On Friday night Daley-McLean will be the first England player on the pitch at Allianz Park, where she will join the exclusive club of women who have won 100 caps for the Red Roses. Hunter, the England squad captain who will be on the bench again, has already beaten her teammate to 100 caps, a club that includes Rochelle Clark, Amy Garnett and Tamara Taylor.The world of women’s rugby is unrecognisable from the day Daley-McLean and Hunter made their international bows. In 2007 the game was at the Old Albanians ground that is the weekday base for Saracens’ men. England play the USA in the first of a series of games that includes meetings with Canada and Ireland, at the ground where the English champions host their matches – in front of a live Sky TV audience.“I remember that first cap. I was on the bench with Sarah and when I finally got on the field we scored a try in the corner. I was now fly-half and kicker and my first act in international rugby was to try and convert a kick from the touchline. I remember thinking that I must at least get the ball off the ground and not make a fool of myself. Luckily I hit it sweetly and it actually sailed through the posts. I can’t tell you how relieved I was.“The women’s game has changed massively. There were a couple of hundred maybe watching that day and most of them were friends and family. In those days you would rock up for a game on a Friday night, play the game on Saturday and depart on a Sunday, not knowing if and when you would get together again.”Daley-Mclean received an MBE after leading England to victory in the 2014 World Cup in France. At 32 the former primary school teacher, who has scored 462 more points since that touchline conversion in a 60‑0 win, has no plans to stop playing. England are handing out professional contracts to 15-a-side players next year and Daly-Mclean and her Loughborough Lightning clubmate Hunter will be somewhere near the head of the queue.“These games are another chance for us to put up our hands for those contracts and I still want to be in the mix,” she says. “I’m still really enjoying the game. It’s pretty cool to have 100 caps. I just hope it’ll go better than my 50th cap. We played New Zealand at Esher and I had a bad day at the office, really dreadful. I got caught up in the emotion of the occasion and didn’t to the basics right.“I’ll go out against the Americans and try to do a job. They’re a physical side, we’ve got some new caps and we’ll be taking nothing for granted.”England’s head coach, Simon Middleton, is full of admiration for his No 10. “Katy is one of the greatest women’s players ever. She has everything. She’s a natural leader and an inspiration,” he said. Middleton has named a new centre pairing in Tatyana Heard and Carys Williams. The Saracens loosehead prop Ellena Perry and Firwood Waterloo No 8 Sarah Beckett are the other new caps. England are led by Harlequins lock Abbie Scott.The Americans, moreover, know they will be in for a long night. They were beaten 67-6 by New Zealand in Chicago last weekend and it is difficult not to see this new-look England side celebrating Daley-Mclean’s century with a handsome victory. “The USA will be hardened and wiser for last weekend. We expect a tough game,” Middleton added."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a553d5e17a69ef26288fc5c7ffac93dc4db743b/0_90_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2593ef660db6a9669a262f9bab13a314","title":"keaton jennings panicking stressing england second test century cricket sri lanka","story":"• Opener scores unbeaten 146 in second innings at Galle• ‘At 6.30am I’d be reading about my technical deficiencies’There is an engaging, fresh-faced candour about Keaton Jennings which gives a hint why the men that matter were eager to keep him in that dressing room when the runs stubbornly refused to come. He was a borderline choice for this tour and not absolutely certain to play in this match. But with England’s batting done here he has scored 192 runs and only been dismissed once. The faith has been repaid.Jennings spoke about a rush of feelings as he clipped the single that took him to his second Test century – “a mixture of elation, relief and happiness” – quite a contrast to some of the emotions of the last 18 months when he has struggled to deliver as an England opening batsman. “There were times when I was waking up in the middle of the night and panicking and stressing,” he admitted. “And over coffee at 6.30 am I might then find myself reading about my technical deficiencies. I would not be human if I said these things did not affect me.”His performance in Galle takes him out of the spotlight the pressure may not seem so intense now. For the first time in a while he can be guaranteed a place in England’s next Test match. But his experiences over the past two years, when he has seen Alastair Cook, no less, fretting about his form, let alone himself, adds a note of caution. “It would be stupid to say that over the next year or so I won’t be under that pressure again.”In his Test career he has excelled against spin and Jennings, who hails from Johannesburg, which is hardly a haven of spin bowling, offered an explanation of how this part of his game has improved. “I went with the Lions to Dubai in 2016 and Andy Flower and Graham Thorpe helped me develop my method.”He reverse sweeps far more than most batsmen and that has the old-timers gasping. “That shot is one of my strengths. It gets me out of jail sometimes,” he said. “On day one, when the wicket was tackier, I decided that reverse sweeping was often less of a risk than playing with a straight bat.”In this department, at least, he overshadows his mighty predecessor, Cook, whom he has studied so eagerly over the last two years. Jennings reverse sweeps far better than Cook has ever done. And in Galle he showed the sort of resolution and concentration that fortified Cook’s career, a comparison that will make this smiling cricketer very happy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec8c27dbb6f16e779031a8af74db069941992872/0_861_6054_3633/master/6054.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8d1d8c50ff6a8afbcf6f8bac728c09f","title":"bristol old vic launches ambitious new heritage experience","story":"Institution is claimed as oldest continuously working theatre in the English-speaking worldOne of the world’s most historic theatres – Bristol Old Vic – has launched an ambitious new heritage project intended to both explain its astonishing 252-year history and entice in people who may not think theatre is relevant for them.The “heritage experience” ranges from corridors crammed with images of old theatre playbills and posters to a vibrant, typically quirky animation from local studio Aardman that tells the story of the theatre. The film will be projected on to a newly exposed higgledy-piggledy stone facade as a sort of cartoon prelude to each evening performance.In addition, visitors will be able to get an idea of what the theatre was like throughout the ages via an “augmented reality app” available via iPads and smartphones while those who prefer their history to involve cramped, dusty spaces will be delighted at the prospect of a tour of the attic, which features the original 18th-century “thunder run” – a contraption involving wooden chutes and balls that mimics the sound of a storm.At the heart of the redevelopment is a desire to make what is claimed to be the oldest continuously working theatre in the English-speaking world more accessible and tempt people in at all times of the day, not just for performances.Tom Morris, the theatre’s artistic director, said: “We have an extraordinary piece of history that is still in working order. It is as if Stephenson’s Rocket was operating a passenger service into Manchester. The challenge was how to share it.“However radical, forward-looking and accessible our programme is, there is still in some places a preconception that theatre is a backwards-looking art form and nobody in their right mind would go there to have fun. We’re working to confront that.”The heritage project is the final stage of a multimillion-pound reinvention and redevelopment. A rebuild of the auditorium that was completed in 2012 included moving the stage so far forward actors feel as if they are within touching distance of almost the whole audience.Since then the theatre has unveiled a sparkling glass foyer that finally makes the building feel part of King Street (in its early days it was hidden behind two houses and may have been accessible only through a hidden passage because theatre was considered dangerous and seditious). It has also tried to insure itself against cuts by launching a new conference and banqueting business.Morris said he hoped the heritage offer would show people that theatre could and should still be relevant to all, as well as getting in more people through the front doors. “It’s important that we use our subsidy to make sure there is a genuine welcome for everyone in the city and region whatever their background,” he said.There are certainly delights. A mural tells the stories of some of those who have been associated with the theatre and its environs, from bear-baiters to the Romantic poets and even Paul McCartney, who may have got the name Rigby for the Beatles song Eleanor Rigby from a nearby shop as he waited for Jane Asher to come out of the theatre.Another work of art celebrates actors with close links to Bristol Old Vic such as Peter O’Toole, while a grim element of the theatre’s past – merchants who bankrolled the theatre in 1766 to some extent built their wealth on the slave trade – is also addressed.Perusal of the posters and bills provides hours of fun. One from 1827 reveals delights including a “Canary Concert” and an act by Mr Usher the clown that involves the “astonishing deception of swallowing his own head”.But some things do not change. A poster from 1844 advertises a performance of A Christmas Carol “sanctioned by Charles Dickens esq”. This Christmas’s show at the theatre? A new version of Dickens’ festive classic."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1385ef043701872c9097e576c611a71aa739a46/0_117_3500_2102/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b4cbdd5eed23d7db550f608244c0567c","title":"samsung unveils foldable phone as it tries to regain edge on apple","story":"The Korean company pins hopes on the pocket-sized device that gives users a tablet-sized screenSamsung has unveiled its much-anticipated foldable phone and urged Android developers to start writing apps for the new device.The South Korean tech company needs to perfect the foldable phone to reverse steep declines in profit for its mobile ision and restore some of the cachet its brand has lost to Apple.

Folded in two it appeared to resemble a thick phone, but Samsung did not give media or developers a chance to touch or see the device up close.Dave Burke, vice president of engineering for Google’s Android software platform, told a conference in California that Samsung planned to introduce a new Android-based device early next year. “We expect to see foldable products from several Android manufacturers,” he said. Google’s head of Android UX, Glen Murphy, was also on stage with Samsung and said Google would work with the developer community to bring more features to the phone.Samsung said it would be ready for mass production in the coming months. Joshua Clark, a developer who was at the conference, said Samsung needed to sell the technology to its competitors for the product to be widely adopted. “I really think it only takes two companies, and then all of the sudden it will catch on,” said Clark. “And the fact that Google was on stage, that says a lot. For developers to be able to integrate it with all their apps, that gives me a lot of confidence.” Bob ODonnell, an analyst with Technalysis Research, said that while the bendable screen provided a wow factor, shoppers may not like the thickness of the folded phone or its price tag. “They’ll have to prove that it’s more than just a gimmick,” said O’Donnell. “But it’s smart to open it up to developers early to do different types of experiences.” Samsung is among a handful of developers working on foldable phones. Huawei has said it is planning to launch a 5G smartphone with a foldable screen in mid-2019. Samsung and Huawei, however, have been beaten to the market by Royole, a Chinese display making start-up, which last week unveiled a foldable Android phone with a bigger screen, priced from around $1,300. Royole said it would start filling orders in late December."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/027774668281b0d4310ac7f1e2b4602a9b55295a/0_138_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7ad565ca06cdfd36df2aefd07aa2c1df","title":"send a tip on independent tour guides for a chance to win a 200 hotel voucher","story":"Tells us about engaging, amusing and knowledgeable tour guides the world over whose services you have enjoyedA good guide or local contact can make a crucial difference to your enjoyment of a trip, bringing a destination to life with their passion, storytelling and wit.

If it is not allowed it would constitute an obstruction of justice and that would, in fact, be an impeachable offense. My hope is that Trump is smart enough to understand that.”The culmination of the 2018 midterms marked the unofficial beginning of what is expected to be a long and crowded race for the White House in 2020. Sanders would join a field that could realistically number in the dozens.Sanders said he is “talking to a lot of people and doing a lot of analysis” about what candidate was best suited to win in the battleground states that Hillary Clinton lost.Among his possible opponents, should he run, are the former vice-president Joe Biden, Sanders’ fellow senators Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris and Cory Booker, as well as a handful of governors, mayors and business executives. That’s not counting rising Democratic stars who narrowly lost races on Tuesday – Andrew Gillum in Florida, where he fell short in his bid to become Governor, and Beto O’Rourke in Texas, who came close to ousting the conservative torchbearer Ted Cruz with a spirited campaign that garnered attention across the nation and even internationally.“The question we have to ask ourselves,” Sanders said, “is which of the candidates out there is going to win in Michigan, in Ohio, in Pennsylvania, in Wisconsin, in Florida. That is the challenge.”Republicans won governorships in Florida and Ohio, two battleground states crucial to presidential victories. But Democrats unseated Scott Walker, the governor of Wisconsin, captured the governor’s mansion in Michigan, and held on to the governorship in Pennsylvania, three states that sealed Trump’s victory in 2016.For a Democratic party ided over how to build a winning coalition, and which candidate can best take on Trump, the midterm elections offered few conclusive answers. And for progressives, like Sanders, who had hoped the midterm elections would prove that Democrats can run unapologetically liberal campaigns and win in battleground districts and states, the night provided little evidence.Sanders argued that O’Rourke and Gillum, who ran as progressives and came within percentage points of winning statewide contests in parts of the country that supported Trump in 2016, offered a blueprint for Democrats on how to win in conservative states.Their campaigns generated a “level of excitement that I know has not been seen in Florida or in Texas in a very long time”. He said their candidacies, though ultimately unsuccessful, were a sign that progressives were winning the contest of ideas within the Democratic party on economic policy.As for when Sanders will announce his decision on running for president, the senator said he wanted to give the American people some time to “take a deep breath” before plunging back into another election cycle.“I want the strongest candidate that we can have so that we can beat Trump – that is the most important,” he said. “There are some very good people out there who have indicated they are thinking about running. I certainly don’t think I am the only one.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e1da16257c3c54ff117927baded6a0ec5231dde6/0_0_4493_2696/master/4493.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1bf47a5cd7ee6066efd2c2983971b12a","title":"democrats republicans senate majority minority rule","story":"Senate electoral process means although Democrats received more overall votes for the Senate than Republicans, that does not translate to more seats The 2018 midterm elections brought significant gains for Democrats, who retook the House of Representatives and snatched several governorships from the grip of Republicans.But some were left questioning why Democrats suffered a series of setbacks that prevented the party from picking up even more seats and, perhaps most consequentially, left the US Senate in Republican hands.Among the most eye-catching was a statistic showing Democrats led Republicans by more than 12 million votes in Senate races, and yet still suffered losses on the night and failed to win a majority of seats in the chamber.Constitutional experts said the discrepancy between votes cast and seats won was the result of misplaced ire that ignored the Senate electoral process.Because each state gets two senators, irrespective of population, states such as Wyoming have as many seats as California, despite the latter having more than 60 times the population. The smaller states also tend to be the more rural, and rural areas traditionally favor Republicans.This year, because Democrats were defending more seats, including California, they received more overall votes for the Senate than Republicans, but that does not translate to more seats.However, some expressed frustration with a system they suggest gives an advantage to conservative-leaning states.The real concerns for Democrats, they said, could be found in a combination of gerrymandering and voter suppression tactics that might have prevented them from winning an even larger majority in the House and some key statewide elections.“The rise of minority rule in America is now unmistakable,” said Laurence Tribe, a constitutional law professor at Harvard University.According to the latest data, Democrats won the House popular vote by about seven percentage points in Tuesday night’s midterms.They picked up 29 Republican-held seats in the House, while losing two of their own incumbents, resulting in a net gain of 27 seats. Republicans meanwhile won a larger majority in the Senate, picking up at least two seats as a handful of vulnerable Democrats faced defeat.The mixed result undermined Democratic hopes of a blue wave in an election billed as a referendum on Donald Trump and his presidency. In the 2010 midterms, by contrast, Republicans stormed into control of the House with a haul of 63 seats.But the latter was the result of partisan gerrymandering, which saw Republican-controlled state legislatures redraw congressional districts to favor the party in what conservative architects dubbed as Redmap, short for the Redistricting Majority Project.It was for this very reason that Tuesday night’s governor’s contests were deemed by Democrats as equally, if not more, important. With the next redrawing of district lines set to take place in 2020, it was regarded as vital for Democrats to win back seats in state legislatures across the country.Democrats made gains in some must-win states, including Michigan, but fell short in other battlegrounds, such as Florida and Ohio. David Daley, author of a 2016 book about how Republicans built a firewall against Democrats through redistricting, said he was not sure Democrats had done enough on Tuesday “to ensure that they have a reasonable voice in the process”.Elsewhere, progressives lamented the results in the Senate, where some commentators were quick to note that Democrats led the overall tally by double-digit percentage points. The most recent figures had Republicans holding 51 seats and Democrats with just 46, with a handful of races still too close to call.But the 2018 Senate map was unfavorable for Democrats going into the midterms – the party was defending 26 seats compared with Republicans’ nine – and the outcome had more to do with which states were up for grabs.Each of America’s 50 states elects two senators, regardless of population, and only a third of the country’s Senate seats are voted on each election cycle.What that means is that California, which has a population of just under 40 million, holds the same representation in the Senate as Wyoming, which at roughly 579,000 is the least populous state in the country.“That’s a radically undemocratic principle, and it gives rise to what we see,” said David Golove, a professor at the New York University School of Law, “which is that the minority populations are going to have a disproportionate impact in the United States. That tends to mean conservatives have a disproportionate influence over the Senate.”Because the Senate map changes every two years, experts said, it was also difficult to tabulate what a national vote might look like. Since more Democratic seats were up for re-election in 2018, some argued, it was not unexpected that the party secured more votes.“The Senate is inherently anti-majoritarian,” said Erwin Chemerinsky, the dean of Berkeley Law at the University of California. “So it is not about the total vote, but votes in each state.”Any notion of change would require a constitutional amendment, he added, which is unlikely to occur in the foreseeable future.Arguably more tangible than the historic construct of America’s electoral process was the role voter suppression might have played in some big Democratic losses.In North Dakota, voter ID rules pushed by Republicans and upheld by the supreme court may have barred thousands of Native Americans from voting in Tuesday’s general election. The restrictions required that voters show their current residential address in order to vote. But many Native Americans who live on reservations do not have street names and instead use PO boxes.In 2012, the state’s incumbent Democrat, Senator Heidi Heitkamp, was elected in part due to the support of Native American voters. She lost on Tuesday to her Republican challenger, Kevin Cramer, although the margin was large enough to suggest voter suppression tactics alone did not cost Heitkamp the race.The closely watched governor’s race in Georgia, however, told a more contentious story, as the Democrat Stacey Abrams vied to become the first black woman elected governor in US history. Abrams was running against the Republican Brian Kemp, who as Georgia’s sitting secretary of state remained at the helm of the office tasked with overseeing its elections.Leading up to the election, Kemp’s office put at least 53,000 voter registrations on hold – the majority of which applied to black voters – citing Georgia’s so-called “exact match” law. The restrictions could have prevented thousands of eligible voters from casting ballots due to minor discrepancies with other identification documents that included missing hyphens, middle initials or accent marks in a name.Abrams, who narrowly trailed Kemp as returns poured in on Tuesday, refused to concede.“We are going to make sure that every vote is counted, every single vote,” she said. “In a civilized nation, the machinery of democracy should work for everyone, everywhere.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2273ddae4a3faef73c5643da1ebee5d90d604e38/0_45_4252_2552/master/4252.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=739928c0efcec1ac4ef4478a65c9061e","title":"centre right candidates contend for top eu job to replace juncker","story":"European People’s party backs German MEP to lead European commission after JunckerEurope’s largest political group, the centre-right European People’s party, has chosen the long-serving German MEP Manfred Weber as its candidate to lead the European commission – one of the top jobs in the EU.A soft-spoken Bavarian who has spent most of his career in politics, Weber leads the EPP in the European parliament, but is little known in his home country. He once described European values as “inspired by our Christian roots”, and ran a campaign stressing his love for his home village.He defeated Alexander Stubb, a multilingual former Finnish prime minister who attended the London School of Economics.Weber’s strong victory puts him in pole position to succeed the current commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, if the EPP wins the largest number of MEPs in European elections in May.The parliament’s second-largest political bloc, the Socialists and Democrats, this week chose the current European commission vice-president, Frans Timmermans, as its lead candidate for the job.The EPP vote came amid tension within the group over how to manage Hungary’s increasingly authoritarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, who has caused alarm with charged nationalist rhetoric and laws targeted at NGOs.Challenged on Orbán, Weber promised that as commission president, he would propose “binding rule-of-law legislation” in order to tackle backsliding on fundamental democratic values in any EU member state.He did not spell out how his plan would work, or whether it would be stronger than the existing lengthy process known as article seven, which relies on peer pressure by other EU members.The EU has opened a rule of law investigation into Poland and Hungary, but so far, results are not clear. “On the concrete details of the rule of law mechanism, give us a chance to work on this,” Weber said, while insisting the EPP would not compromise on its values.Following his victory, Weber recalled that he voted to launch an EU sanctions procedure against Hungary. “The EPP doesn’t need any kind of lesson from anybody,” he said, pointing to concerns over corruption in Romania’s socialist government.The German MEP could soon be tested again, as the EPP is said to have received membership applications from Poland’s nationalist Law and Justice party, as well as the rightwing populist League in Italy. Asked whether such parties could join to bolster EPP numbers, Weber said as group leader he had managed to keep “the right extremists” out of powerful jobs in the European parliament.“I draw a very clear red line to the real Nazis inside the European parliament unfortunately, they are there,” he said, adding that the EPP had even voted for a communist to become one of the parliament’s 14 vice-presidents, “because we think they have to be included, but we never vote for any kind of right extremists”.Stubb argued Orbán should leave the EPP if he does not sign up to a European statement of values agreed upon by EPP delegates on Wednesday.The guidance states that the bloc’s money should not be spent in countries “where fundamental EU values and the rule of law are not respected”, or where there is no cooperation with investigations by the EU’s anti-fraud office – an implicit reference to Orbán, who has been accused of treating the EU like a cash register.The EPP hierarchy opposes throwing Orbán out, fearing that could boost the nationalist right. “In every family there is an enfant terrible,” said Joseph Daul, the EPP president. “But as I am a Christian Democrat, I prefer keeping my enfant terrible inside the family and to try to talk to him, to reason with him.”The European council president, Donald Tusk, who is disliked by anti-EU populists in his native Poland, offered a veiled rebuke to Orbán. Standing on the podium metres away from him, Tusk said: “If you don’t like the free press and NGOs, if you tolerate xenophobia, homophobia, nationalism and antisemitism, you are not a Christian Democrat.”In his speech, Orbán was uncompromising on what he saw as failed policies. “We have to take the responsibility for not being able to keep the British in and the migrants out,” he said.Weber will also face questions about whether the candidate of the largest political group should automatically take charge of the commission, once the election results are clear.That argument has been rejected by national governments. “It is bullshit,” said one senior European source, arguing there was nothing undemocratic about democratically elected governments choosing people to run the EU’s institutions.In 2014, government leaders had little choice. Luuk van Middelaar, who was a senior adviser to the European council president at the time, recalled: “They felt cornered. They didn’t like the system, but they had to swallow the nomination of Juncker. Even the Bild newspaper was writing that the EU would look like a banana republic if it didn’t nominate Juncker.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1474ab10a5107db2b2c81083b0699fb22f89c455/532_140_2758_1657/master/2758.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=08b9f0281391ae108d056fe5e28e503a","title":"moscow names square after kim philby british double agent","story":"Square near spy agency HQ takes name of MI6 officer who defected to Russia in 1963Moscow has named a square after Kim Philby, the British double agent who defected to the Soviet Union in 1963, near the headquarters of Russia’s foreign intelligence service.The move comes as relations between the UK and Russia are at lows not seen since the cold war over the poisoning of the former double agent Sergei Skripal, allegedly by Russian spies.Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, ordered that an intersection in a south-west district be renamed Kim Philby Square, according to a decree posted on a local government website.A city hall spokeswoman said she could not immediately comment on the decision, while local residents expressed surprise on social networks, saying Philby had nothing to do with the neighbourhood.Philby, who died in Moscow in 1988, was perhaps the best-known member of the Cambridge Five spy ring, a group of British establishment figures who were recruited to work for the Soviets.Philby, a senior MI6 officer, was exposed after passing information to Moscow over three decades.After his defection Philby lived in central Moscow, far from the windswept square in a relatively new part of the city that is almost exclusively made up of residential towers.The intersection is however close to the sprawling campus of the SVR, or foreign intelligence service.The agency has maintained Philby’s legacy, with a page on its website dedicated to him and the intelligence he provided during the second world war.The SVR director, Sergei Naryshkin, spoke at an event last year to mark the unveiling of a portrait of the spy at a gallery in Moscow.At the event, intelligence veterans suggested a street should be named after the defector because he enjoyed walking around the city.But several residents of Yasenevo district said on a neighbourhood Facebook group they had no idea who he was and wondered whether Moscow had run out of names of Russian writers to use.“They should have named the ramp leading to their campus after him instead,” wrote Katerina Reatsea, referring to the intelligence agency."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42b9d651e26fa898ca2706a5fa91b4407230f559/0_0_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e9c1aa51c6d7e83833e6236698bdeae7","title":"the kindertransport children 80 years on when i was 14 my mother appeared out of nowhere","story":"Ruth Barnett and her brother were helped by the Quakers to get to the UK from Berlin. But, four years after the war, she was forced to return to Germany by her motherRuth Barnett, 83, was born in 1935, in a Germany that was already descending into Nazi tyranny. Her Jewish father was a judge who had been deprived of his post and frogmarched out of his court by the SS in 1933 her non-Jewish mother ran a cinema-advertising business in Berlin. “We had a brilliant future in front of us until the Nazis came to power,” she says.Barnett’s father was in hiding for much of the next six years. But the fact that he was blacklisted and his life was in danger may have helped his two children – Ruth had a brother, Martin, who was three years older than her – get on the list for a Kindertransport to the UK in February 1939. Though only four years old at the time, she recalls the journey from Berlin. “I thought it was a holiday trip,” she says. Her mother, who had a short-term visa, accompanied the two children, left them with a foster family in England and then disappeared. “Neither my brother nor I remember her saying goodbye,” says Barnett.Ruth and Martin stayed together throughout the war – “which is why we were able to survive psychologically”, she says. Her arrival in the UK had been sponsored by the Quakers, who kept an eye on her throughout the war, moving her from the first foster mother, who was cruel and beat Ruth for wetting the bed. She ended up on a farm in Sussex, where she stayed after the war ended. “Four years later, when I was 14,” she recalls, “my mother appeared out of nowhere, a total stranger. I didn’t recognise her she didn’t speak any English I didn’t speak any German. I was told she had come to take me to Germany I refused to go.”Her brother went to Cambridge University to study physics, but Barnett was eventually forced to return to Germany. Her father had survived the war by escaping to Shanghai, and was now back working as a judge in Mainz in post-Nazi West Germany. He pursued legal means to reclaim his daughter, though she only stayed a year before returning to the UK, marrying, working as a teacher and then retraining as a psychotherapist.Only when she was in her 50s did she learn the full story of the Kindertransport. “I was gobsmacked to learn there were 10,000 of us,” she says. “I realised I had got my confidence back by then with a stable marriage, three teenagers and a career in teaching, and I was ready to face the past. Until then, I just avoided anything to do with the past.”She says many of the survivors of the Holocaust “never reached a stage of being ready to process what had happened to them, which meant that the transmission of trauma went across to their children”. Her own mother, she says, had been deeply traumatised by the war and refused to talk about it. “If you make that taboo, you can only have a superficial relationship,” says Barnett.Barnett has written a play, What Price for Justice?, about her family’s story, and says it has modern-day relevance. “It needs to be recognised what happens to a family that is split up in war because it’s happening now all over the world. Donald Trump is making it worse: separating those children and sending the parents back is unconscionable.”Remembering the Kindertransport: 80 Years On is at the Jewish Museum, 129-131 Albert Street, London NW1 from 8 November to 10 FebruaryTomorrow: Bea Green: ‘‘I was bowled over that these non-Jewish people were nice to us.’"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7018a0461160febceebbefd4cda29ee606700caf/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=83e05852954b3b4a01f2f4da54f8b80b","title":"worlds female mps gather in london and pledge to form giant sisterhood","story":"A hundred years since first women voted in UK, parliament hosts meeting of female MPs from around the worldFemale MPs from around the globe have pledged to form an international sisterhood and to support each other’s fight for gender equality.In the year marking 100 years since the first women got the vote, the UK has hosted the first-ever meeting of female MPs from every parliament in the world.At the gathering of 120 women from 86 countries at the Houses of Parliament in London, Penny Mordaunt, the international development secretary and minister for women, praised the “powerful, strong, courageous women” who had gathered, saying they had been motivated by love “of our nations, your children and humanity” – thanking one politician for bringing her baby into the House of Commons.She said the challenges faced by female MPs included balancing work with motherhood, the daily battle to be taken seriously, sexual harassment and intimidation, adding that female parliamentarians had to show “restraint and resolve ... when constantly being patronised, the fight to be heard and to keep going when you are frightened”.Calling on the spirit of the suffragettes, and echoing their rallying cry, Mordaunt suggested the international group could share a “giant sisterhood WhatsApp group”, adding: “The margin of success is in this room. Because courage calls to courage everywhere, because without women’s rights there are no human rights.”She paid tribute to the suffragettes, but also to parliamentarians who had lost their lives while serving the public, such as Jo Cox.Welcoming the politicians at Downing Street, Theresa May said there were more female members of parliaments and legislative assemblies around the world than ever before.Mother of the House, Harriet Harman, who has been an MP for 36 years, said that all the MPs present shared the goal of being equal with men in parliament and being able to deliver equality for women."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3684184.1541167032!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"no more buck passing or dithering dublin needs a new boss","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIllustration: Fuchsia MacAreeThere’s a classic trope in horror films where the protagonist sets aside the norms of rational behaviour and goes down into an unlit cellar, or gets into a car with an obviously unhinged stranger, while the audience can see the terrible event about to unfold and are willing the victim to retreat.It’s a feeling that will be familiar to any long-time observer of Dublin local authority proceedings. Impending disaster is painfully apparent and yet, time and again, councillors willingly and wilfully hurl themselves lemming-like over cliffs to lose their limited powers in the ravine at the bottom.In 2001, councillors – all councillors not just Dublin ones – lost their powers over waste collection and disposal, following their failure to ratify plans for waste disposal facilities, or any form of waste charging. As a result this power was transferred to council management, hugely unpopular bin charges were introduced, and the Poolbeg incinerator, which all parties opposed, was built.More recently, the failure to agree a route for the Liffey cycle path, which had been six years in the planning, resulted in the scheme being removed from the control of Dublin City Council and handed over to the National Transport Authority.In this case it wasn’t just the councillors (who couldn’t agree traffic ersions past their constituents’ houses) who were to blame, but also council officials, who produced endless iterations of the scheme, one of which saw double-decker buses rerouted through an existing apartment block.The most recent, and one of the most damning failures or officialdom to get to grips with decision making, is the College Green plaza refusal farce. The council tip-toed around the issue for a decade, tinkering with selective traffic restrictions, musing over fountains and statuary, but never really grasping the problem, which required getting buy-in from Dublin Bus before the project went to An Bord Pleanála for approval – a step which itself should have been taken years before.Surely there’s a better way of getting things done in the city. Could this dithering, bottling, buck-passing and procrastination be solved by Dublin having a directly elected mayor?“The central power, the most important point, of having a directly elected mayor, is that they have a ‘bully pulpit’,” Dr Deiric Ó Broin, DIT academic and co-author of the upcoming book Mayoral Governance in Dublin, argues.“The elected role gives them the authority to argue for more investment in the city, for keeping a more appropriate share of the money generated in Dublin. And they have to deliver their job is on the line. If they don’t deliver they may not be re-elected. That concentrates minds.”However, the concept of a mayor is one thing, the reality of the role and its functions is quite another, Ó Broin says.“The big issue is what powers the mayor would have and where would they come from. There is no point if the mayor is just a lord mayor, as in they have significant ceremonial but minor functional role, but who lasts for a five-year term.”Dublin city chief executive Owen Keegan agrees. “If it is to be successful the directly elected mayor has to have real powers, but he or she can only have real powers where the powers are taken from somewhere else. This notion that there’s some unallocated power that you can give to the mayor has no basis in reality – all power is already allocated.”And there isn’t much power within the hands of the council to give to a new mayor, Keegan says. “Since local government is weak here, the power and functions would have to come from central government, and that is a real issue because if there’s a directly elected mayor who is responsible for energy, and communications and transport in Dublin it doesn’t leave very much for the central Government to do.”Another vexing issue is what physical area would be governed by the mayor. “Culturally and politically we are obsessed with counties and county boundaries. I could see an argument for a city-only directly elected mayor and that gets away from that problem, but I don’t see how a city-based mayor could have responsibility for transport in Dublin, which crosses local authority boundaries,” Ó Broin says.This issue of boundaries played a large part in the collapse of the last mayoral plan. In 2013, then minister for the environment Phil Hogan decided, despite there being no legal requirement, that the councillors in all four Dublin local authorities would have to be in favour before Dubliners would get a chance to vote in a plebiscite on whether or not to have a mayor.The following year Dublin City, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, and South Dublin voted overwhelmingly in favour of the proposal but it was vetoed by Fingal, whose councillors felt they would be the poor country cousins, largely ignored by a city-focused mayor who would only be after their airport.As Gerry McGuire, a Labour councillor at the time, said there would be “no chance of getting a pothole fixed in rural Fingal”.Hogan showing great fortitude in keeping a straight face said he was “disappointed” as he was “the greatest proponent of devolution probably in the history of the State”.Last year the Government revived the mayoral proposal, making provision for a plebiscite this year, but it has recently kicked the can down the road, and kicked it out of the capital, determining that regional cities would vote at next year’s local elections on whether to have a mayor, but in Dublin it would first be referred to a citizens’ assembly for the capital.It seems like another unnecessary hurdle given that a similar forum spent five months formulating proposals for the mayor’s role in 2013, and, at that time surveys showed public support for a Dublin mayor was up to 80 per cent.Even if Dublin does get a mayor, what the Government appears to be proposing is a toothless role, either a mayor with the same powers as the current lord mayor, except elected, or an “executive mayor” who would take on some of the functions of the council chief executive.A plebiscite to decide whether there should be a mayor is unnecessary, Lacey says. “If the Government is serious about making progress let them legislate for it now. There is no need for a plebiscite. Successive governments never sought permission as they systematically dismantled local government in the past, so let them just repair it.”However, Lacey does not believe it’s necessary that the mayor would be all-powerful from the outset. “Calling for the full range of powers to be set out in advance is misguided. This is a position and a role that needs to be established and then given space to evolve.”But he says he can see particular areas where a mayor could make achievements straight away which might seem minor, but would be significant.“A mayor could initially have responsibility for natural resources. For example there isn’t much point in Dublin City Council cleaning the river Dodder in Donnybrook, if it’s not being cleaned first in Tallaght. Or sports capital grants – it makes no sense for a civil servant sitting in an office in Kerry to decide what local sports organisation in Dublin gets a grant.”Then, he suggests, other powers could be added such as waste and traffic policy, which should be “brought back under control of the council anyway”, he said.Ó Broin cites the system in Copenhagen as one where the mayor having control of these services works well. “The mayor has responsibility for education, welfare, labour services, welfare, climate change and a range of municipal services – Denmark, and Scandinavian countries in general, have very good, empowered local government.”Further afield, Boston and Toronto are recognised as good examples of mayor-led cities, he says. While our nearest neighbours have had some successful mayors, in some British cities, including Stoke-on-Trent, they have scrapped the office.The London model, Lacey believes, is not the system that should be copied in Dublin. “I don’t think the London model is a good one, with an all powerful mayor and a fairly toothless assembly. I’d like to a see a mayor working in partnership with a much smaller council – 24 or even 18 councillors. We should reduce the four councils to a manageable size, and give them more responsibility.”Keegan thinks the London model has worked well, particularly in relation to the mayor’s transport and policing supervisory functions, but he is with Lacey on the reducing in numbers of councillors from the current 63 in the city.“I am impressed by cities that have a small number of full-time councillors. In many cases they have executive functions. I think these councils, with a large number of councillors, make everything very difficult. Dublin City Council is too large. We are twinned with San Jose, where there’s a mayor, and I think they have eight or nine council members.”Keegan, however, remains unconvinced of the merits of having a mayor in Dublin. “I am a little bit concerned that the next ‘big idea’ is the directly elected mayor, and we’ll all lorry into that with great enthusiasm, but I have seen very little convincing analysis as to why this is such a good idea.“It’s been presented as a panacea to everything that’s wrong in Dublin, that will automatically be made right the day after we have a directly elected mayor.”Dublin doesn’t get credit for its success he says. “I don’t accept the notion that Dublin is a basket case. On many parameters Dublin is a very successful city. A good litmus test is the multinationals. They come here because they can attract people to live here. Of course it has problems with transport, and housing but these are problems of success. There was no housing affordability problem when we were in the depths of recession.”The “mad rush” towards the directly elected mayor idea reminds him of the “mad rush” to set up Irish Water. “Water supply was and is a major challenge but there was a notion that if you set up a separate utility everything would be hunky dory, but its implementation left a lot to be desired.”If the implementation of the mayor is poor, Dublin could find itself losing more than it gains, Keegan says.“There are strong arguments for a directly elected mayor, and I’m not saying there isn’t scope for improvement in the city’s governance, but there is a danger if we rush into this it won’t achieve any of its objectives, we’ll lose the things that work, and we’ll be worse off.”Each of the proposals in this Capital Ideas series has been put to a group of three experts for an initial “back of an envelope” evaluation. They are: Frances Ruane, former director of the Economic and Social Research Institute Caroline Spillane, director general of Engineers Ireland and Cliff Taylor, economics columnist with The .Caroline Spillane I have reservations about this plan, particularly due to the size of Dublin relative to the country as a whole. One person would have responsibility for 40 per cent of our population. The powers of this office would need to be carefully defined.The proposed mayor would be in a position of power for only five years, which could lead to short-term thinking.Cliff Taylor This proposal has surfaced in various forms over the years and fits into a common theme that restructuring institutions or posts can fix problems. This could be a good idea, but the job spec, powers and budget are key. The benefit depends on how it is structured – and who is elected, of course.It is a useful proposal but to work it requires a new vision for local government, something talked about for years and years but never delivered.Frances Ruane Cities with elected mayors seem to work well. However, in Ireland, this would have to be set up as part of a rebalancing of central and local government, if it is to work. If the city itself does not have decision-making power, then adding a mayor will not solve the problem.Meanwhile, Dublin City Council should work on its governance and adopt an integrated problem-solving planning approach. This must involve all four authorities working together. That would involve no serious resource costs.How can we improve Dublin city\u0026rsquos infrastructure, services and daily life?

Savour that moment because this may well be the very last time this particular ritual will ever happen.If all goes according to a plan laid out by the European Commission, the last-ever mandatory clock change in the European Union will take place in 2019. Member states must notify the commission by April of next year on whether they want to opt for permanent summer or permanent winter time. Whether all 27 states are prepared to go along, however, is not yet clear.This weekend, the Department of Justice (which has responsibility for everything to do with timekeeping) is announcing plans for its public consultation here on the proposal.A recent European Commission online public consultation across the EU found 84 per cent of citizens were in favour of ending the changing of clocks in spring and autumn.The commission trumpeted the fact that it had got 4.6 million responses, the highest number ever received in an exercise of this sort, and that 84 per cent of those backed the change to a single year-round time.Less loudly advertised was the fact that engagement varied significantly from country to country three million of those responses came from Germany, representing almost 4 per cent of that country’s population. In contrast, less than 0.25 per cent of Irish people bothered to respond.The question now is whether inidual member states will agree to proceed along the lines advocated by the commission, which has stated a preference for summer time to be applied universally. There is potential for chaos, with a patchwork of time zones emerging across continental Europe.Initial polling, for example, suggests people in the Netherlands and Denmark would prefer permanent winter time, while Germans want summer time.“We are not proposing that the whole EU either switches to summer or winter time,” said transport commissioner Violeta Bulc at a press conference last month. “All we are proposing is that we do it together.”But clock-switching on the Dutch-German border is hardly the desired outcome.An intriguing twist from the Irish perspective is whether the UK, at a moment of heightened political tension, will view this as a symbolic opportunity to flaunt its newly acquired independence.Brexiteers’ enthusiasm for such a stance may be dimmed when they realise it would mean Britain sharing a time zone with Brussels and Berlin for almost half the year.But understandably, media coverage here so far has focused on the prospect of travellers from Dundalk to Newry having to adjust their watches – or of people nipping across from Lifford to Strabane in search of an extra hour’s drinking time.For geographical and historical reasons, Ireland and the UK have been on the same clock since Dublin Time was abolished in the wake of the Rising in 1916.We moved in lockstep with the UK when it experimented with year-round summer time in the late 1960s, and any recent proposals for change, such as one mooted in a Private Members’ Bill rejected by then minister for justice Alan Shatter in 2013, have been contingent on decisions made at Westminster and, more recently, in Brussels.So what would the changes mean? If Ireland opts for year-round daylight-saving\u0026nbsptime, then dawn won’t break in the west of Ireland until almost 10am in mid-December. However, if “winter time” is maintained throughout the year, sunrise in Dublin will occur well before 4am in June, and the stretch in the evenings will be a lot less grand, with sunset happening before 9pm even in midsummer.Those are the extremes, but where permanent summer time offers real gains is in the “shoulder months” of November, February and March, when the majority of people will have much more daylight at the end of their school or working day without too much negative impact in the mornings.There has been a broad attempt across the world in recent decades to do away with annual time-shifts, based on data about their negative health effects and on a more general sense that an additional hour of daylight in the evening is more valuable than one in the morning.Meanwhile, the main rationale for the current system – reduced electricity usage – has been rendered less important by the introduction in recent years of energy-efficient electric lighting. Lifestyles have also changed enormously since the current system’s introduction a century ago, and even since the last experimental change 50 years ago.Flexible working time, increased leisure opportunities and longer retail opening hours all have an effect on how we spend our day.The main impediment to change, it seems, is institutional. In the US, legislators in California and other states are also pushing for year-round daylight-saving\u0026nbsptime, but they need to persuade the federal government before they can proceed. As in the EU, American legislation allows each state to decide its time zone but forbids inidual states from choosing when or if to change their seasonal clocks. Whether the gridlocked US political system can respond remains to be seen.Here, the Department of Justice’s public consultation asks three questions. Do you want to stop changing the clocks twice a year? If the clock changes stop, do you want to remain on summer time or winter time? Is staying on the same time as the UK more important than your choice of summertimewintertime?“It is very important that as many citizens as possible respond to this consultation and express their views so that the Government may take account of public opinion when considering this proposal by the EU,” says Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan, clearly implying that the Government will take account of public opinion without being bound by it.Ultimately the success or failure of the proposal may come to be seen as a test of the EU’s ability to act quickly and decisively on a simple issue which will have an almost immediate effect upon people’s lives. The process so far has been startlingly fast, but the national consultations may be a different matter, depending perhaps on the views of the people who get up early in the morning."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3691051.1541692594!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"raab s admission he had not realised dover to calais importance criticised","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Britain’s Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union (Brexit Minister) Dominic Raab arrives a cabinet meeting in central London. Photograph: Facundo ArrizabalagaEPABritain’s Brexit secretary Dominic Raab has been criticised for admitting he had not realised the importance of the Dover to Calais crossing to UK trade.Alastair Campbell, former spokesman for Labour prime minister Tony Blair described it as “mindblowing”.The remarks made at an event on Brexit and the tech industry on Wednesday were reported by Jack Blanchard of Politico.According to Politico, Mr Raab told the event that customers would have less choice in shops unless the frictionless border was maintained and he had not realised how important the crossing was. “I hadn’t quite understood the full extent of this, but if you look at the UK and look at how we trade in goods, we are particularly reliant on the Dover-Calais crossing. “And that is one of the reasons why we have wanted to make sure we have a specific and very proximate relationship with the EU, to ensure frictionless trade at the border ... I don’t think it is a question so much of the risk of major shortages, but I think probably the average consumer might not be aware of the full extent to which the choice of goods that we have in the stores are dependent on one or two very specific trade routes.The British government fears that in the event of a no-deal Brexit, new customs controls in France could create a bottleneck on the Dover-Calais route.In recent weeks the British cabinet was told that plans are being drawn up to charter ships to bring in emergency supplies of food and medicines if there is no deal on Brexit and warned that the Dover-Calais route could become blocked by new customs controls on the French side.Scientist Professor Brian Cox said: “How could it possibly come as a suprise to Dominic Raab that our most important trade gateway is that which is closest geographically to our most important market?”. Will Straw, formerly executivre director of the Britain Stronger in Europe, campaign tweeted “ Hi @DominicRaab - would it not have been better if you’d done your homework before backing Leave?”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Kildare church \u0026lsquocrammed\u0026rsquo for farewell to David BolandSon who received land worth \u0026euro100,000 successfully challenges ision of assets in willIrish College of General Practitioners finds 35 per cent of family doctors say they will carry out terminationsMark Bissett has 60 previous convictions including manslaughter and assaultBrexit secretary said he had not quite understood the full extent of reliance on crossingPlan to utilise more community facilities will help ensure faster throughput says CUH chiefFormer Fine Gael councillor from Waterford was jailed for four years in 2012Court told garda wrongly accused in commentary on video of kicking minor in headFood Safety Authority of Ireland issues eight orders against businesses in OctoberEuropean People\u0026rsquos Party backs Manfred Weber to become EU commission presidentWhy were these journalists arrested?

Ireland has long argued that the number of visas allocated to Irish citizens does not reflect the strong historic links between Ireland and the US. More than 35 million Americans claim Irish heritage.Under a Bill that has been brought to the House of Representatives, Ireland would be allocated the portion of E3 visas not taken up by Australian citizens. Australia is currently the only country with the coveted E3 scheme, and is allocated 10,500 each year. The E3 is a two-year renewable visa which allows Australian citizens and their spouses to live and work in the United States. Australia negotiated the visa programme in 2005 as part of the US-Australia trade agreement. Applicants must have a job in the United States to quality and have certain academic or other qualifying credentials. But the E3 is significantly easier and less costly to obtain that the tradition H1B visa. The Government’s special envoy to the US, John Deasy, is confident that the proposal has bipartisan support, though it still needs to be endorsed by both the House and the Senate. This is not the first time Ireland has sought inclusion in the E3 scheme a similar proposal was put forward in 2015 but ultimately failed to get adequate congressional support. One key difference this time, according to officials, is the involvement of House Speaker Paul Ryan. Ireland is also offering a reciprocal arrangement to America which will see the Department of Justice ease the requirements for Americans who want to retire in Ireland. It is thought that the best chance Ireland has of securing a deal is in the coming weeks during the so-called “lame-duck” session of Congress when the outgoing members of the House and Senate continue to sit before the new members take their seats in January. One outstanding question is the status of the undocumented Irish already living in the US. While in the first instance the E3 visa scheme is likely to apply to future flows of Irish people, sources have indicated that discussions are also under way about accommodating undocumented Irish citizens who may qualify. Whatever the shape of the new Congress, the next few weeks appears to offer the best chance for Ireland to secure a breakthrough and make real progress on immigration reform.The news from Washington comes as the Irish Government on Tuesday approved a series of measures to deepen and enhance Irish-US relations, specifically inviting more American politicians to visit Ireland.While the Taoiseach and Ministers have made 169 visits to the US since 2012, visits by American politicians are rarer, and the Government will seek to invite more US mayors, members of Congress and national politicians to Ireland in the coming years.Approving a review of US-Ireland relations brought to Cabinet by Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney, the Government decided that there should be “aggressive engagement” with Irish-American politicians in the new Congress.The review also calls for more Irish diplomatic staff on the ground in the US, as well as the opening of a new consulate in Los Angeles.Share your stories and opinions with other readers, and receive the best Abroad content every week by email"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3688287.1541512786!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"why are so many adults having braces put on their teeth","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBraces no longer a familiar aspect of adolescence as dentists and orthodontists see the adult’s mouth as just as malleable as the child’sIn an article on an 18th-century tooth-puller, historian Colin Jones claimed that “the list of Great Dates in Dentistry is largely unknown, I wager, outside the serried ranks of the dental profession”. In subsequent work, Jones demonstrated the important relationship between beauty standards and the development of dentistry in 18th-century Paris. One of the great dates in dentistry seems of continued importance for the pursuit of the beautiful smile: when were braces for straightening teeth invented?I started thinking about dental braces because it seems to me that they started appearing everywhere on adults. A friend celebrated her new job by shelling out her hard earned wages on a set. Two neighbours’ smiles suddenly included a flash of steel. A student informed me that he was foregoing a summer holiday to pay for braces. Irish adults have been gripped by enthusiasm for that iconic American beauty ideal: the perfect smile of even, straight, white teeth. I had considered myself lucky to escape braces because in the United States more than 60 per cent of teens have them. But now I examined my rather buckled lower teeth and wondered.French practitioners led the field, including in the development of techniques to adjust perceived oral imperfections such as the use of metal strips in the mouth to realign teeth in upper and lower jaws. French dental pioneer Pierre Fauchard described such a system of teeth correction as early as 1723. Probably the first book to propose something that sounds like modern braces is the 1829 text, A System of Dental Surgery by American dentist Samuel Sheldon Fitch. Most of Fitch’s advice concerning the treatment of “irregular teeth” involved standard extractions or filing edges. These procedures could be used on adults. However, he also explained that an instrument made of gold, ivory, and silk thread could be fixed into the mouth to help rotate teeth into proper alignment. The silk thread ligature, which pulled teeth into place, would have to be replaced every few days as “the tooth will soon be perceived to move”. These luxurious early braces were only effective on children younger than 13 or 14 because after this age “the teeth are so fixed that they cannot be moved without much difficulty”.As Alyssa Picard has shown for the US and Melissa Micu and Catherine Carstairs have shown for Canada, the expansion of orthodontics was rapid in North America after the second World War. It was also directly related to wealth with practices more common in profitable urban areas. Parents were encouraged to have their children treated in order to avoid the social stigma and insecurity that might arise from imperfect smiles.In 1962 Mary Stanley, an American nurse and advocate of adult cosmetic dental treatment, found herself “wishing my smile was more attractive”. She wrote in the American Journal of Nursing to reassure others that “adult teeth can be straightened”. Adjusting adult teeth with braces was a relatively new practice but one set to spread. Dentists and orthodontists began to see the adult’s mouth as just as malleable as the child’s. In the past 20 years the number of American adults choosing to have their teeth straightened has doubled many opting for the new “Invisalign” system rather than traditional metal braces. Formerly a painful part of adolescence, braces are now being embraced by adults.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward.

He was exposed in 1963 after passing information to Moscow over three decades.After his defection Philby lived in central Moscow, far from the windswept intersection in a relatively new part of the city that is almost exclusively made up of residential towers.The square is however close to the sprawling campus of the SVR, Russia\u0027s Foreign Intelligence Service.The agency has maintained Philby\u0027s legacy, with a page on its website dedicated to him and the intelligence he provided during World War II.SVR director Sergei Naryshkin last year spoke at an event to mark the unveiling of a portrait of Philby at a gallery in Moscow.Intelligence veterans suggested at that event that a street should be named after the defector because he enjoyed walking around the city.But several residents of Yasenevo district said on a neighbourhood Facebook group they had no idea who he was and wondered if Moscow had run out of names of Russian writers to use.Joe Sugg\u0026#39s Strictly Diary: \u0026#39Shirley’s hugs are lovely, but I’m ready for a 10\u0026#39Brexit latest: Ministers play down imminent deal as reports suggest it could be done on MondayPrince Andrew says a royal yacht Britannia can be a \u0026#39tool in the bag\u0026#39 to help British businessesIdlib peace deal under threat, warns head of White HelmetsTrump expects Kim summit early next year as he plays down Pompeo\u0026#39s abruptly cancelled meetingsPrince Harry visits Westminster Abbey Field of RemembranceKnife attack by \u0026#39motorcycle gang\u0026#39 ends with six men in hospitalHow increasing the number of toilets can reduce violence against womenComment: A gold star to Jeremy Hunt for speaking French - but why are our MPs so bad at languages?\u0026#39God don butter my bread\u0026#39: Prince Charles speaks Pidgin in NigeriaAre we fit to fight a global war?Russia investigation timeline: Robert Mueller and the probe into the Trump campaign\u0026#39s alleged collusionUS midterm results and maps: Find out how each state voted and what losing the House means for Donald TrumpComment: Eating red meat makes people happy.

The UK’s projected performance in 2020 is the weakest of the 28\u0026nbspnations currently in the bloc.\u0026nbspThe UK forecasts are worse than\u0026nbspthose made by the UK’s Office for Budget Responsibility, which in last week’s Budget projected growth in 2019 of 1.6 per cent, followed by 1.4 per cent in 2020Bottom of the growth leagueThe commission also stressed that even its downbeat outlook was based on a “benign” scenario of UK trade with the rest of the European Union continuing uninterrupted.“The risks to the 2019 and 2020 baseline forecast are large, and predominantly to the downside”, the commission said.The commission said consumer confidence surveys suggested weak spending by households, adding Brexit uncertainty was likely to keep business investment “subdued”. It expects net trade to continue to drag on UK growth and sees the UK unemployment rate rising to 4.7 per cent by 2020, up from 4 per cent today.The commission projected the eurozone’s growth to slow too over the coming years.\u0026nbspGrowth in the single currency area hit 2.7 per cent in 2017, the highest since 2006.\u0026nbspThe Brussels-based commission expects GDP growth in 2018 to slow to 2.1 per cent, followed by 1.9 per cent in 2019 and 1.7 per cent in 2020. It blamed rising global uncertainty, Donald Trump’s trade wars and higher international oil prices.“Uncertainty and risks, both external and internal, are on the rise and start to take a toll on the pace of economic activity. We need to stay vigilant and work harder to reinforce the resilience of our economies,” said Valdis Dombrovskis, commission vice-president for the euro, said.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Burberry chief executive Marco Gobbetti said the company’s strong first half performance was due to the “exceptional” customer response to chief creative officer Riccardo Tisci’s debut collection, Kingdom.The group reported profit of £173m for the 26 weeks to 29 September, beating expectations of £169m.

However, the group also advised: “While the early signs are encouraging, transitioning the product offer, evolving our distribution, changing wider consumer perception and seeing this translate into positive business performance will take time.” Naeem Aslam at Think Markets said Burberry had proven that “hiring the right person for the right job matters a lot”. “Designer Ricardo is the hope for the company and his collection has received exceptional response despite the fact that most products won\u0027t reach stores until February. The company styled ad campaign resonated with its lovers. This was something which the firm was lacking,” he added. “What Burberry has realised that it needs to create FOMO among its customers and have more limited lines is the way forward. Communication and delivering a product which the users like is the key to the fashion industry because the competition is as fierce as it can be.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

For the commission’s forecasts for the UK are not, in fact, wildly different from others.The commission sees UK growth in 2019 of a paltry 1.2 per cent. The most recent average forecast from a range of UK forecasters – UK banks and economic consultancies – is growth of 1.4 per cent.That would leave us with faster projected growth than Italy – but still below every other EU economy.It’s true that the Office for Budget Responsibility in last week’s Budget projected growth of 1.6 per cent next year. But this was mainly due to the boost to demand from the Chancellor’s extra spending on the health services and his income tax cuts. The OBR expects growth to fall back in 2020 to 1.4 per cent.The idea that the commission has produced some ridiculously pessimistic outlier forecasts for the UK doesn’t stand up to scrutiny.The commission thinks growth in the eurozone and the EU will slow down too in 2019, but not to the extent that it will in the UK.There’s another vital piece of context. The commission’s forecasts – like those of the OBR – are based on the presumption of a smooth Brexit next year, where we secure a Withdrawal Agreement and remain in the single market and customs union until the end of 2020.The weakness in almost all forecasts essentially reflects assumptions that the UK economy is slowing due to weakening household demand, feeble business investment and lacklustre exports.That may, or may not, be borne out.But in a sense it’s a red herring when thinking about the economics of Brexit.severe economic shock in the event of a no-deal Brexit and long-term damage to our potential growth rate as a result of a Brexit in which we leave the single market and customs union.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The government is making plans to sell its Brexit deal to MPs. And much (rather mean) hilarity has ensued.Yet behind the silliness, the ham-fistedness, and the plain bad spelling, there’s a serious point. The Government needs to sell its deal to the public and – first and foremost – to MPs. And it is counting on the fact of having got a deal in the first place to help swing the mood.The context and mood will shift once a deal is reached. For one thing, the optics will change. Dominic Raab and Michel Barnier, for so long adversaries, will appear on a stage together trumpeting their joint achievement. The European Council will welcome Mrs May, doubtless praise her dogged approach to the negotiations, and welcome a deal that works for everyone.What Dominic Raab needs to do to avoid Brexit disasterReturning home, the PM might even be moved to make a statement before addressing MPs, stressing that she has achieved the best possible outcome in the face of significant adversity. And she may well repeat the canard that parliament faces a stark choice between what she has negotiated and no deal at all.And meanwhile, behind the scenes, there will be apparently more objective indicators of approval.the pound bounced against both the euro and the dollar in the wake of a story last week that some kind of minimal deal had been done on financial services? Logically, one would expect a far more marked reaction to a real deal being signed. Pessimism has been baked into the markets for months, so there is every chance that they will deliver Philip Hammond’s famous deal idend.And as the stock market reacts, a half-competent government would attempt to corral businesses into supporting its deal. The government’s comms grid suggests “lining up 25 top business voices including Carolyn Fairburn”. At this point, many firms have abandoned hope of a business-friendly Brexit, pressing instead for the maximum amount of certainty as soon as possible. A withdrawal deal encompassing a (potentially extendable) transition of twenty-one months would provide a degree of that.Meanwhile, the Treasury will release its long-awaited forecasts on the economic implications of Brexit. None of them, as we know, will be pretty. But expect the deal done to stack up well against most, at least, of the alternatives. In particular, expect the comparison with the damage that a Canada-style deal would do to be underlined in red.It is of course ultimately up to MPs to decide the fate of the deal. Yet, as John Curtice has argued, much will also depend on how it is sold to the public. Recently polling by Survation, showed the largest group of people (34 per cent) didn’t know whether they’d support the deal while 33 per cent\u0026nbspsaid they’d reject it and 26 per cent\u0026nbspwould accept it. This confirms Curtice’s view that there’ll be a lot to play for once the deal is done.\u0026nbspStronger polling support would make it harder for MPs to justify opposing it, particularly if all they can offer in its place is chaos and uncertainty. Hence the programmed speaking tour which would see the PM visit a number of parts of the UK to promote her Brexit plan.Now obviously all this may not be enough to secure the parliamentary majority that the Prime Minister needs. We simply do not know how MPs are going to act, and for many nor do they. That being said, the post-deal world will look very different to the pre-deal one. And in that sense at least, it might help Mrs May get what she has secured over the line.Anand Menon is director and Matt Bevington a policy researcher at\u0026nbspThe UK in a Changing Europe\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Sainsbury’s comfortably exceeded that with a rise of 20 per cent (several one off nasties mucked up the headline pre tax number so we’ll focus on that one).\u0026nbspSainsbury’s boss warns Brexit may push up costsThe beat was largely down to Coupe \u0026amp Co realising the savings they promised to generate from the Argos deal earlier than expected.\u0026nbspBut Sainsbury’s sales line showed that it isn\u0027t just through savings that the grocer\u0026nbspis making what looked to some (including me) like a questionable acquisition when it was announced pay off.\u0026nbspLike for like - excluding\u0026nbspcontributions from new openings - they increased by just 0.6 per cent. However, overall\u0026nbspretail sales (excluding fuel) grew\u0026nbspby 1.2 per cent. Sainsbury’s has been opening up a lot of new Argos outlets in its stores, which helps to explain the difference between the two.These are proving to be a handy addition to the supermarkets, which often have excess space that needs filling. People seem to quite like the idea of picking up gifts when they pick up the weekly shop, so you’d think that would bode well for the Christmas period too.\u0026nbspPutting Sainsbury’s together with Asda is a much bigger challenge, but this should at least give investors some grounds for optimism once the Competition \u0026amp Markets Authority has decided how many stores the two will have to offload to get the thing through.\u0026nbspThe\u0026nbspresults, however, weren\u0027t all good.That 0.6 per cent like for like sales growth is torpid indeed. It includes the balmy second quarter, when most of the grocers did well out of the hot summer but Sainsbury’s managed only 1 per cent growth. It does not include October, which numbers from Morrisons and the British Retail Consortium show was a very soft month.Created with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

The truth is that ministers have dithered and delayed for far too long. We now need urgent action.”Nuclear waste could be buried underneath national parks, say MPsSue Ferns, senior deputy general secretary of Prospect union, called the decision “devastating”.“Government has ultimate responsibility for ensuring a secure and stable supply of energy throughout the UK,” she said.“The truth is that ministers have dithered and delayed for far too long. We now need urgent action.“Our analysis shows that if the Government were to take a 50 per cent\u0026nbspstake then there would be a net benefit to the public purse, so there really is no excuse not to.”Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey said Labour supports Moorside as they see nuclear as a key part of the UK’s energy mix, but said the government should have stepped in to support it.A Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy spokesman said Toshiba’s withdrawal was “entirely a commercial decision”.“Nuclear has an important role to play as part of the UK’s erse energy mix as we transition to a low-carbon economy, but in each case projects must provide value for money for consumers and taxpayers,” they said.“This government remains committed to new nuclear through the Industrial Strategy Nuclear Sector Deal as well as consenting the first new nuclear power station in a generation at\u0026nbspHinkley Point C.”Critics of nuclear power said the government should see the new circumstances\u0026nbspas an opportunity to move away from nuclear to cheaper technologies such as wind and solar power.“Shifting away from expensive, complicated technology towards cheaper and easier-to-build renewables gives the UK the opportunity to build an electricity system that will keep bills for homes and businesses down for years to come,” said Dr Jonathan Marshall, head of analysis at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit.“Cancelling Moorside does leave a gap in the UK’s decarbonisation plans, but one that is more likely to be filled with the technologies of the future rather than the past.”Additional reporting by PA.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Burberry chief executive Marco Gobbetti said the company’s strong first half performance was due to the “exceptional” customer response to chief creative officer Riccardo Tisci’s debut collection, Kingdom.The group reported profit of £173m for the 26 weeks to 29 September, beating expectations of £169m. Meet the stars of Riccardo Tisci’s first festive campaign for BurberryA new era for Burberry as Riccardo Tisci takes the reinsBurberry is the most sustainable luxury brand, according to reportRiccardo Tisci’s first Burberry collection will be sold on InstagramMeanwhile, the company said it is set to make cost savings of £100m this year, having delivered savings of £80m so far. “We made good progress in the half as we began to transform and reposition Burberry, while maintaining our focus on financial and operational discipline,” the company said in a statement to the London Stock Exchange. However, the group also advised: “While the early signs are encouraging, transitioning the product offer, evolving our distribution, changing wider consumer perception and seeing this translate into positive business performance will take time.” Naeem Aslam at Think Markets said Burberry had proven that “hiring the right person for the right job matters a lot”. “Designer Ricardo is the hope for the company and his collection has received exceptional response despite the fact that most products won\u0027t reach stores until February. The company styled ad campaign resonated with its lovers. This was something which the firm was lacking,” he added. “What Burberry has realised that it needs to create FOMO among its customers and have more limited lines is the way forward. Communication and delivering a product which the users like is the key to the fashion industry because the competition is as fierce as it can be.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The power struggle he finds himself in is further complicated by the coming dry season, which poses new threats from forest fires and dwindling resources.Subsequent instalments\u0026nbspfollow Emperor penguins in Atka Bay in Antarctica, lions on the plains of the Masa Mara reserve in Kenya, painted wolves in the Mana\u0026nbspPools National Park in Zimbabwe and tigers in India’s Bandhavgarh National Park.The 309-day jungle shoot involved the film crew following the chimps on foot, often as far as 15 miles in\u0026nbsp40C\u0026nbspheat, while an 11-month stay on the ice shelf of the world’s southernmost continent brought temperatures of -30 and required regular breaks to scrape ice from goggles and camera lenses.\u0026nbsp“The physical demands were huge, but the rewards immense,” producer Rosie Thomas told\u0026nbspThe Radio Times.The team managed to capture rare footage of penguins huddling over their eggs and tiger cubs at play and hope their work will highlight underappreciated aspects of their subjects’s behaviour: from the vital role lionesses play within their pride to the resilience of Africa’s wild dogs.Created with Sketch.Blue Planet II – in pictures  Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A broadclub cuttlefish (Sepia latimanus) in Indonesia.

This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the yearWe\u0027re excited to add an entirely new way for users to get their first crypto... By growing the Blockchain community, we can help more people own and control their financial future.Cryptocurrency market \u0027to explode\u0027, says expert on bitcoin\u0027s birthdayAs part of the giveaway, or \u0027airdrop\u0027, Blockchain is partnering with organisations to help build up the crypto community, including Code.org and the Stanford d.school\u0027s emerging tech initiative.It is hoped these partnerships will help drive user adoption by increasing the availability and usability of Stellar in both developing and developed countries.By working with Blockchain to increase the availability and active use of lumens on the network, leveraging their almost 30 million wallets, we will increase the network\u0027s utility by many orders of magnitude, said Jed McCaleb, co-founder of Stellar Development Foundation.The price of Stellar has largely mirrored that of bitcoin, having experienced massive growth in late 2017 before seeing significant losses in 2018. In recent months, its price has been relatively stable and is currently trading at around $0.26 (£0.20), however Stellar\u0027s current transaction volume is less than 2 per cent of bitcoin\u0027s.Speaking at the Web Summit conference in Lisbon on Tuesday, 6 November, Blockchain CEO Peter Smith explained his vision for spreading awareness and usage of cryptocurrency.We\u0027re doing this because we want you to truly\u0026nbspunderstand crypto, he told the audience.\u0026nbspAnd the only way to truly understand it is to use it.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But it then turned to the foldable phone, dimming the lights and giving a short demonstration of how it might work.Samsung has been teasing the development of the foldable phone for more than five years. It is far from the only company to be doing so, and its announcement looked to be overshadowed somewhat when another smaller firm called Royole announced that it would be releasing a foldable handset of its own.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Incredible.Oxford University said:\u0026nbsp“We admire\u0026nbspStormzy\u0027s\u0026nbspcommitment to inspire and support black students to succeed in higher education.”We have not received or turned down any offer or proposal to fund undergraduate scholarships at Oxford.“We have contacted to\u0026nbspStormzy\u0027s\u0026nbsprepresentatives today to clarify we would welcome the opportunity to work together on inspiring students from African-Caribbean heritage to study at Oxford.”The Stormzy Scholarship will pay the tuition fees of two students, something the rapper announced on A-level results day at his old school in south London.The\u0026nbspscheme will also provide a maintenance grant for a four-year undergraduate course for two students this year and another two in 2019.Stormzy reveals he was kicked out of schoolStormzy on his piano lesson with Paul McCartney: \u0027It was incredible\u0027Stormzy has launched a Cambridge scholarship for black students“We\u0027re a minority, the playing ground isn\u0027t level for us and it\u0027s vital that all potential students are given the same opportunity.His plans come after Cambridge University was criticised for failing to admit any black pupils from 2012 to 2016 – and just 58 in 2017.Stormzy\u0027s own book\u0026nbspRise Up,\u0026nbspabout the story of his life and success so far, is out now.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

She resigned days later, admitting she had “inadvertently misled”\u0026nbspMPs.Home Office in ‘state of disaster management’ amid surge in U-turnsHow journalists can end up dictating Home Office policyMan blocked from seeing baby after Home Office loses passportA second contradiction came when the Home Office announced that more than 60 people may had been wrongfully deported or removed from the UK – countering previous claims that there was “no evidence” any iniduals had been deported.The embarrassment deepened further when the department revealed more than 83\u0026nbspWindrush\u0026nbspcitizens could have been wrongfully\u0026nbspdeported from the UK.And\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbsphas now revealed that more than 60 nationalities have contacted the Home Office with concerns that they have been affected.Another humiliating U-turn came last month, when the department admitted that people have been wrongly denied UK status after refusing to provide DNA evidence, despite previously claiming the practice existed on an “entirely voluntary basis”.Sajid\u0026nbspJavid\u0026nbspsaid the government had illegally demanded DNA evidence in family visa cases, with at least seven people denied the right to stay in Britain because they refused to provide samples to prove family ties.This steady stream of ministerial errors has been punctuated by numerous dramatic U-turns on inidual immigration cases, prompted only once the stories are reported in the media.Prominent cases have included that of a US resident who was blocked from coming to the UK to see her seriously ill daughter because the Home Office was “not satisfied” her intentions were genuine. Within 12 hours of publication, the department reversed the decision and granted her a visa.The decision to prevent six-year-old, UK-born Mohamed\u0026nbspBangoura\u0026nbspfrom returning home to his mother following a holiday was also reversed, as was the case of\u0026nbspHafizzulah\u0026nbspHusseinkhel, a 27-year-old Afghan man who was threatened with deportation despite having served in the British army.These slip ups are occurring at a growing rate, with each having wide-ranging implications for the iniduals caught up in the hostile environment machine. But there is little doubt that the issues have been bubbling under the surface for some years now.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Windrush generation: threat of deportation from UK Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The ex-troopship \u0027Empire Windrush\u0027 arriving at Tilbury Docks from Jamaica, with 482 Jamaicans on board, emigrating to Britain.Jamaican immigrants being welcomed by RAF officials from the Colonial Office after the ex-troopship \u0027Empire Windrush\u0027 landed them at Tilbury.

There is simply no excuse – either for Labour as a whole, or for inidual Labour MPs – not to oppose this agenda and give the people a final say.”Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 65Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Red smoke from a canister hangs in the air as around 100,000 demonstrators march through London during a People\u0027s Vote anti-brexit demonstration savings banners and placardsMayor of London Sadiq Khan takes part in the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.MP Chuka Umunna (left) and MP Vince Cable (right) as MP Anna Soubry (centre) addresses Anti-Brexit campaigners at a rally after the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.

Some automatically become law unless MPs or peers object, while others must be actively approved by the Commons and Lords.\u0026nbspMany of the Brexit-related SIs\u0026nbspcover crucial issues\u0026nbspsuch as the regulation of medicines, nuclear materials and aviation, meaning failure to agree them in time could have major consequences.

against time to get the changes through parliament, amid fears of the legal uncertainty that would follow if issues currently dictated by EU law are not transferred into British law by exit day.Andrea Leadsom, leader of the Commons, said\u0026nbspgovernment departments have been told to put non-urgent\u0026nbsplegislation on hold in an attempt to ensure\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspand peers have time to pass the necessary changes needed to enact\u0026nbspBrexit.In a letter to\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspon the Commons European Statutory Instruments Committee, she said: “As you know, the government has stated there will be between 800-1,000 Brexit-related SIs laid ... ahead of exit day to ensure a functioning statute book, and as I’ve said the final volume will be closer towards the lower end of

prioritise only the essential non-Brexit secondary legislation to be laid before parliament.“This will ensure that parliament focuses on the critical SIs we need between now and exit day.”Under the proposed timetable put forward by Ms Leadsom, up to 200 legal changes will be placed before parliament in November alone, of which almost 100 will need to be voted on.Up to 150 will be introduced in

The system has to protect the most vulnerable.”Her concerns were echoed by Iain\u0026nbspDuncan Smith, the architect of universal credit, who said he would be\u0026nbsp“very happy” if the freeze were scrapped.Influential backbencher Heidi Allen, who led a revolt over\u0026nbspuniversal credit ahead of the Budget, said: “The benefit freeze has gone on for too long it does not make logical or moral sense to say that everybody else’s cost of living is increasing but people on benefits — often in work — that their cost of living isn\u0027t increasing.You can’t give with one hand on work allowances and take with the other on the benefits freeze.Public sector pay has increased, wages are going up but the people who are left behind are those with the least financial resilience”.Several influential Tory committee chairs have also raised concerns about the deprivation caused by ongoing austerity measures, including Dr Sarah Wollaston, who leads the Health Committee, and Tom Tughendhat, who heads up the Foreign Affairs Committee.Frank Field, the independent chairman of the\u0026nbspwork and pensions committee, said that the benefit freeze\u0026nbsp“has acted as a recruiting sergeant for money lenders and particularly food banks which have grown in a parallel with the Victorian workhouses that provided food for the poor and destitute.”A government spokesman said: “Tackling poverty is one of our fundamental goals and with this government’s changes there are now one million fewer people living in absolute poverty compared with 2010, including 300,000 fewer children.“We know the best route out of poverty is through work, and universal credit is supporting people into work faster and helping them stay in work longer.Last week we announced that 2.4 million households would be £630 better off a year as a result of raising the work allowance.“Since 2010 we’ve seen 1,000 people move into work each and every day and the increase to the national living wage has given the lowest earners a significant pay rise.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

A new voter later in the year, however, returned an independentist majority to power.The struggle between the pro-independence groups in Catalonia and the Spanish government fighting to keep the country together continues.Mr Fraser suggested Scotland\u0027s budget deficit could further trigger a rejection for European Union membership from member states for the independent nation.He continued: It is questionable whether an independent Scotland would meet the criteria for EU membership. An independent Scotland would carry a budget deficit in excess of 9 percent of the GDP, which is well above the EU average.Brexit news: Mr Fraser argued EU member states will not want to take a risk with Scotland\u0027s deficit (Image: \u0026bullYOUTUBEThe Wellbeing Academy)Much worse than Greece has been. Whether the other European countries would want a new member that has such serious budget deficit is an open question.The Scottish MSP also argued an independent Scotland would lose the benefits of the opt-outs the United Kingdom enjoyed ahead of Brexit, resulting in the probable membership of the eurozone.Mr Fraser added: An independent Scotland joining the EU would have to sing up to all the requirements of full-single market membership for which the UK had secured opt-outs, for example on the budget rebate, on the Schengen agreement and, most crucially, on membership of the euro.I don\u0026rsquot think the path of an independent Scotland into the heart of the EU would be by any means an easy one. In August, the SNP\u0026rsquos Michael Russell insisted a second Scottish independence referendum will take place and that EU leaders will accept the nation as an independent state.In August, the SNP\u0026rsquos Michael Russell insisted a second Scottish independence referendum will take place and that EU leaders will accept the nation as an independent state.Referring to a second Scottish independence referendum, Mr Russell added: \u0026ldquoThe choice will come - we just have to see how we get there.I don\u0026rsquot accept the premise that there won\u0026rsquot be a Section 30 order, I think that is something which is still a possibility. The outcome will have to be a choice that the people of Scotland will have to make between Brexit and another future. There\u0026rsquos no other future but independence in those circumstances.\u0026ldquoWhen we get to the stage that it\u0026rsquos Brexit or independence, people will have to be asked that question.

Robbie was meant to be Simon Cowell, but looked a lot more like Big Bob Joylove from Harry Enfield And Chums, and Cowell himself was swathed in bandages ashe’d fled the Cedars-Sinai clinic halfway through a facelt.However much the outfits managed expectations, though, nothing could quite prepare you for the contestants, who seem to spend at least as much time preparing their sob stories as their singing.Scarlett Lee should’ve had the head start on everyone here, of course, after her brother’s home was incinerated and she “burnt her eye” in a salvage attempt.But Danny Tetley, who can dissolve into a sobbing wreck at the mere mention of bereavement, is the one giving a lesson to everyone, especially -year-old Giovanni Spano,he thinks we’re going to buy his “chubby teenager” torment for a second.No matter how much they spin and sob, though, nothing can quite take the edge off the singing, where this week’s race to the bottom was won by United Vibe’s version of Bleeding Love. “You cut me open and I keep bleeding.” My ears keep bleeding.The great thing about this lot, though, was that everyone thought the real problem was their name and kept insisting “You need to change it”, to something more viewer-friendly, like The Tinnitus , Tone-Def, The Backstreet Abortions, Hamas, anything but United Vibe.That problem went away, obviously, when they were eliminated on Sunday.However, the only thing anyone will remember about last weekend’s X Factor is the technical gremlin that struck,  minutes into Saturday’s pre-record, and made Danny and Anthony Russell sound like they were singing through a Dalek filter.Personally, I didn’t think it harmed their performances one little bit, yet after two hours of wailing and sobbing, up popped the message: “Tonight’s vote is cancelled.”It’s the last thing the show needed, clearly, as it’s already holed below the waterline and everything’s now going down with the ship.Everything except perhaps the unsinkable ego of Robbie Williams, who was still busy assuring Scarlett Lee, “In five years’ time, we’ll be on the same Christmas show together”, where Robbie will be working as a stage-hand called “Esteban” on Feliz Navidad Paraguay.“We’ll have a cuddle,” and then Robbie will whisper in Scarlett’s ear “You don’t know me. We never met.”On ITV last Wednesday they padlocked and chained professional bone brain Joey Essex to the floor of a chamber and flooded it with , litres of water.Then ruined everything by getting a magician involved and letting him escape.A right old waste of time called Ben Hanlin Live And Deadly: Drowned.A one-off special filmed at “a top-secret location” that was too scary to name but, according to the end credits, was actually Fort Borstal in Kent, where, as far as I can tell, absolutely no one’s been murdered, least of all the  haunting souls ITV kept banging on about.Still, you expect this nonsense on Halloween. What I hadn’t bargained on was that Joey wouldn’t be the dimmest person on set.That honour went to host Vick Hope, off Strictly, who distinguished herself early on by asking magician Ben: “What is a lock pick ”“It’s a pick that picks locks,” dumbo.She also tried introducing Diags, off Towie, as the show’s resident doctor, Ed Hope, and had a way of killing the mystery and tension that was quite hypnotic: “They’ll have to pick locks like their lives depend on it . . . ’cos they do . . . well, they kind of do.”If there’s one thing I’ll take from this show, though, it’s Vick’s final health and safety disclaimer.“It goes without saying,” she said, “don’t lock your head in a box of water, don’t handcuff yourself and don’t throw yourself in a lake.”Although, rule out none of the aboveLive And Deadly: Drowned comes back this time next year.Martin Keown: “Gambling is a gamble.”Dion Dublin: “Neil Lennon’s no shrieking violet.”And Alan McInally: “An hour gone and Manchester United haven’t been anywhere near the pitch.”.In these tearful, snowflake-ridden times, the most important and le-affirming television of the week was Wednesday’s The One Show.Other guests were present but, like every single viewer, they will have been transfixed by the remarkable Doddie Weir, the former Scotland rugby lock, in the shortbread tin suit, who was diagnosed with motor neurone disease two years ago.Very calmly he explained exactly how this was in the process of killing him, before, with the classic understatement of a man from the Scottish Borders – an area not big on over-sharing – Doddie said: “It’s not the best disease to happen.”There were none of the tears we’ve all come to expect in these situations, though, or any sense of self pity, because big Doddie is too busy pushing back, organising his charity events and doing the most important thing of all in these or any other circumstances.Grabbing le by the throat and getting on with the simple joy of living. mynamedoddie.Sophie: “Popeye.”Bradley Walsh: “Witches are most often depicted flying on what object ”Keisha: “UFOs.”Tipping Point: “Found on boxes of cognac, the letters XO stand for Extra what ”Tracey: “Alcohol.”And Bradley Walsh: “What rock ’n’ roll star drove a truck for Crown Electric before he was famous ”Catherine: “Rock Hudson.”AND INTERRUPTION OF THE WEEK...Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “Fixodent is an adhesive used to keep in place...”BZZZZZZ.

According to new polling by YouGov, only three per cent of us think we aren’t handing the taxman enough — and just  per cent that most people pay too little.It’s hardly surprising. For most, the biggest thing they want politicians to tackle in their own lives is the cost of living. The more the taxman takes, the harder it gets to cope.Yet when you talk to ordinary people about tax, you find out that it is not a financial issue. It’s a moral one.They’re not greedy. Or selfish. They know the NHS needs money. And the police.But they also know thatthe state takes too much of what you earn, you’re not going to bother earning it in the first place.So they think that you should always workyou can — but that it should always pay to work. Andthe Government is taking more than half, you’re working for them, not for you.That’s why our think tank, the Centre for Policy Studies, is urging ministers to embrace two vital principles, outlined in our latest report.First, you shouldn’t have to pay tax before you’ve earned the bare minimum. One of the best things the Conservatives have done — inspired by our think tank — was to raise the amount you can earn before you pay income tax. At the most recent Budget, Philip Hammond hiked it to £, a year — from just £, back in .But there’s a sting in the tail. People aren’t paying income tax — but they’re still paying National Insurance, which is income tax by another name. We estimate that .million people have been “taken out of tax” — but are actually still paying it.And there’s another problem — at least for the politicians. Raising the personal allowance has kept take-home pay above water since the financial crisis.But just nine per cent of those we and YouGov surveyed knew it had gone up by that much, and  per cent said they hadn’t noticed it in their pay packet.That may be why just  per cent told us the Tories were the party of low taxes.That’s why we suggest a new universal basic income, a new right, for every worker, that the first £, a month will be free of both income tax and National Insurance. That’s a £ tax cut, which takes those .million people out of tax completely. And it should be front-and-centre on every pay packet.The next idea is just as important. It is that the taxman should let you keep at least p of every extra £ you earn — a work guarantee.At the moment, our tax system is riddled with points where you suddenly face a great big spike in what you pay.For the rich, it happens when your salary hits £,, and your tax rate soars to  per cent as that personal allowance is clawed back.But the biggest victims are those trying to come off welfare into work. In some cases, they only get to keep p in every extra £. So it’s no wonder they’re tempted to give up.This happens because even as the tax system gives, the benefits system tries to claw it back. That’s why we’re asking the Government to cut the rate at which Universal Credit is withdrawn to p in the £, to ensure it always pays you to climb the income ladder.Of course, this kind of thing costs money. We don’t want to copy Labour and go back to borrowing billions that we can’t afford. Or to scrimp on the NHS.But given the Government is spending more than £BILLION a year, there’s certainly room for some savings.For example, we currently spend £billion a year trying to encourage people to chip into a pension — yet have the lowest savings rate since records began. And that cash is spent woefully inefficiently — because the relief is based on your original tax bill, the top one per cent get as much help as the bottom  per cent, even though they need much less incentive to save.Replacing the current pension with an ISA-style system, where you got an up-front bonus for saving, would be simpler and more effective — and save us billions that we could use to help people right now.Andthe Government doesn’t like that idea, we’ve got plenty more.A forthcoming report of ours identies a dozen ideas for saving public money, adding up to £billion a year — from pegging Whitehall’s admin costs to the private sector, to eliminating wasteful and economically distorting subsidies, to reducing duplication in local government.Eventhe Government thinks it can’t find the money now, it needs to put making work pay at the heart of its future decisions. Not least because it is wildly popular.The universal working income is backed by  per cent to nine per cent. The work guarantee by  per cent to  per cent. These aren’t Tory ideas, they’re backed overwhelmingly by voters across the board.Perhaps that’s because these ideas embody what we all know to be true. Everyone who can work, should work. But people will only workit pays them to do so.The job for the politicians is to make damn sure it does.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

One female onlookershrieks, “Help me! Help me!” as the others laugh, while someone  boasts: “I made the burning people.”It’s not just that it’s shockingly distasteful, it’s the sheer callousness of it that renders one almost speechless with disbelief.Then there’s the group of lads in their late teens who thought it funny to spit at Janice Morris as she sat alone on a park bench, before later pelting her with flour and eggs.When police — who class her as vulnerable and with mental health issues — visited her Suffolk home later that day, they found her still covered in flour and with “smudged mascara down her face”.One of the gang — -year-old Cohan Semple — saw fit to take a photo of the attack and posted it on Snapchat.One recipient reposted it to Facebook, it went viral and, quite rightly, prompted widespread revulsion and a police investigation.All five have pleaded guilty to using threatening behaviour which caused harassment, alarm or distress and await sentencing.Meanwhile, it seems “dozens” of the Remembrance Day “Silent Silhouette” statues placed all over the country have been defaced or smashed up by mindless vandals. In Devon alone, one statue was snapped in half, another five vandalised and one stolen.Oh how we wish that,caught in the act, their punishment could be a few weeks on the frontline of a war zone. But don’t hold your breath.Instead, let’s focus on the good in society that, thankfully, still forms the majority. The thousands who expressed their abject disgust at the breathtakingly inhumane bonfire stunt, the horried locals in Bury St Edmunds who helped police locate Miss Morris and bring her tormentors to justice, and the noble volunteers who, seeing the damage to the Silent Silhouette statues, stepped in to repair them in time for this weekend’s Remembrance Sunday.Volunteers such as a group of teenagers in Axminster, Devon, who took a vandalised “Tommy” in to their school workshop and repaired him.Placing him back at the scene afterwards, they laid a wreath and declared: “We are here today to show you that we, as young people, do care.“We care about the sacrices made by the brave men and women who fought for our country.”So let’s take comfort that the true measure of British society lies in their actions and not those of a few morons.“Dry Martini service trolley”, anyone  Nope, me neither.As for the hand-stitched couture Valentino gown, the site describes it as “a dress that defies adjectives”.Oh, I don’t know. “Bloody expensive” comes to mind.MODEL and self-publicist extraordinaire Emily Ratajkowski has published this photo with the caption: “Laundry day.”Cripes. Let’s hope she hits the delicates setting for that T-shirt, as there ain’t too much scope for further shrinkage.Oh dear. Will you tell her or shall I A “CHILD” refugee is under investigation by the Home Office after his fellow pupils at an Ipswich school posted a pic online with the caption: “How’s there a -year-old man in our maths class ”Their suspicions were aroused after finding a Facebook profile in the same name with photos of a man swigging beer while sporting a thick moustache and chest hair. A simple check that took just a few seconds and should have been made by the authorities before they placed him at the school.It seems wily teenagers aren’t anything like as daft as their supposed superiors.The nation clearly needs to get out more.WHILE his estranged we Lisa Armstrong was in court for the initial hearing of their orce, Ant McPartlin was strolling in a park with new love Anne-Marie Corbett and Labrador Hurley.In photos, the canoodling couple appear to be on their own, but in yesterday’s Sun it was reported that, at one stage, “an aide handed Ant a poo bag”. In the interests of clarity, one should perhaps point out the bag was for the dog, not Ant himself. But I digress.The aide’s role reminds me of the old joke about the circus worker whose job it was to clean up prolic amounts of elephant dung.When asked whether he’d ever considered another line of work, he replied: “What – and give up showbiz ”THIS photo of Tom Cruise reprising his role as Maverick for the Top Gun sequel suggests he hasn’t aged at all in the intervening -plus years.Or perhaps it’s simply the wonderfully flattering gravitational pull of a high-speed motorbike.YOU know you’re famous when your No fan is Adele.When she appeared on James Corden’s Carpool karaoke, she was word-perfect on the Spice Girls single Wannabe and said she dreamed of being Ginger Spice.And yesterday, when four of the ladiesannounced a reunion tour, the delightfully down-to-earth Ms Adkins posted a photo of herself, pictured, aged about seven, in front of her bedroom wall papered in their posters and with the caption: “I am ready.”For Adele’s now thirty-something generation, you can’t overestimate the effect of the Spice Girls when they burst on to the pop scene in  with Wannabe.Yes, the “girl power” mantra was a bit cheesy but the point is that for a while they defined the zeitgeist of social change for girls who saw these feisty, opinionated young women having fun primarily on their own terms – and aspired to do the same.They’ve all had their trials and tribulations in the ensuing years . . . but haven’t we all Most of all, the Spice Girls are a mirror of the enduring power of female friendship, with all its twists, turns, complexities, bickering, sniping Mel B and Victoria – who, by the way, are currently speaking and, ultimately, longevity.Welcome back ladies. We’ve missed you.BARONESS Warsi has criticised hit TV series Bodyguard for its “stereotypical” portrayal of Muslim women.“Either she’s downtrodden and needs to be saved or she’s a terrorist and we need to be saved from her,” she says.“In Bodyguard, we think she’s one and she turns out to be the other.”It seems writer Jed Mercurio – criticised by others for being too politically correct – just can’t win.Perhaps he should go back to the drawing board and follow the stereotypes of just about every other crime drama, where the killer always turns out to be a white, middle-aged man.Perhaps they should send a copy to the current crop of largely incompetent candidates on The Apprentice.LOVE Island winners Jack and Dani have moved in together and are reportedly arguing over the smallest things.In other words, the honeymoon period is over and the pair have now moved into the more realistic phase of what is commonly referred to as the long-term relationship.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Buttheres No Deal, then things could get tricky.Ministers are still working on getting a crucial agreement signed soon, but they could have to implement emergency plans in just days time. What should you know about getting ready for your holidays As part of plans to get ready for No Deal, it was recommended that Brits with less than a year left on their passport get theirs renewed sooner rather than later.Ministers said British people will need to have a passport which is valid for at least six monthsthey want to visit the EU.After we quit the EU our passports will be a navy blue colour, not the current burgundy red.Gloomy Phil Hammond got the nation panicking when he said that under No Deal, planes could be grounded between Britain and the EU. Its a warning thats been repeated by countless politicians since, including the EUs Jean Claude Juncker.Britain would no longer be in the EUs single aviation market, and flights to other countries with which the EU has a deal would also be affected.New agreements can be negotiated, but they could take a while.Airlines are confident that flights will continue to take off regardless - EasyJet and British Airways have said an agreement will be put in place, but Ryanair has been a little more cautious and has begun warning passengers on tickets that it cant be guaranteed.Trains will still run after Brexit, of course. But there are no guarantees that Eurotunnel wont have any disruption next year.As part of a raft of No Deal notices last month, the Government said that companies such as Eurostar, which only holds a UK licence, could be affected unless inidual agreements are struck with the countries it goes to.It advises taking out insurance for Eurostar tickets that cover any Brexit disruption.Under No Deal, UK driving licences would no longer be valid in the EU so holidaymakers would need to buy an international driving permit, available at the Post Office for £..The Government said: You may be turned away at the border or face other enforcement action, for example fines,you don’t have the correct IDP.And you could need a Green card  too - a translation of your car insurance policy - which you can get from the Post Office.But providing ministers secure the -month transition period as planned, this should stay the same.Holidaymakers are delaying booking their ferry crossings for next summer because of Brexit fears, Brittany Ferries said earlier this week, with bookings down  per cent.Dover to Calais and other ferry routes could be impactedchecks have to be made at borders in the event of a No Deal Brexit.But there are unlikely to be any extra delays for tourists, as Brits already get their passports checked en route anyway.No changes should be needed for anyone booking a package deal - unless your booking is with an EU-based firm and made outside the UK, in which case you may not be protected.There was a drop in the pound after Britain voted to leave the EU, meaning Brits will have to stump up more money to get their euros when going abroad on the continent.Buttheres a Brexit deal signed in the next few weeks, the pounds value could increase and make next years a bit cheaper again. A No Deal could see it drop again, pushing up prices.Brits will be able to continue to enjoy free healthcare when travelling in Europe after Brexit, it was confirmed last year.As part of the Withdrawal Agreement, officials have negotiated to use the European Health Insurance Cardacross EU’s  remaining member states – not just the country they’re living in.Pet owners should speak to a vet as soon as possiblethey want to take their animals to Europe after Brexit, Britains top vet warned earlier this week.Brits will need to pay up to £ for the right to take pets on holidaywe leave the EU with No Deal.If we do get a deal in the next few weeks it should be able to continue as normal.Most UK networks say they have no plans to bring back roaming charges after we leave the EU.The bloc scrapped them last year, but there have been fears it could cost more to call and use the internet abroad in future.Ministers have said that any increases again would be limited.Brits could be forced to apply for US-style waivers after Brexit to go on their hols, Theresa May has admitted.Unveiling plans last month to pre-screen EU tourists as part of her new post-Brexit immigration policy, the Prime Minister conceded the arrangements were likely to have to be “reciprocal”.The US currently charges  for every ‘ESTA’ waiver form – raising the prospects Brits will be forced to shell out each time they want to fly to the Costa del Sol.The EU are set to decide within weeks whether the Brits will need a visa in the event of No Deal."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT0004444085961.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"brexit deal draft agreement ministers theresa may","story":"Ministers have been invited to read the draft agreement in the Cabinet Office.A special Cabinet meeting is then likely to take place tomorrow or Monday so ministers can sign off on the text.But the current version doesnt include the crucial Irish backstop needed to avoid a hard border.That means further talks could be needed with Brussels before the final deal is complete.Ministers met in No yesterday to discuss the details of the deal Theresa May wants to strike with the EU.Today they were told they could read the finalised text, without the backstop.They will then meet again within the next few days to give the PM authorisation to finalise the deal.But a senior Government source told The Sun the agreement isnt ready yet because Britain and the EU havent struck a deal on the backstop.Both sides have agreed there needs to be a mechanism to keep the Irish border open regardless of the outcome of future trade talks.That is likely to see Britain stay in the EU customs union until a permanent solution is found.The UK wants the right to withdraw from the backstop at any time. But Brussels has insisted it must be binding for as long as there is no other way of avoiding a hard border.The two sides are now working on a compromise review mechanism which could end the arrangement in the future.David Cameron today backed Mrs May, telling Sky News: I fully support what shes doing and want to let her get on with the job."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000447553597.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"tinder lover 69 who identifies as a 49 year old takes legal action to change his age so he can date younger users","story":"Emile Ratelband, , arguestransgender people are allowed to change sex, he should be allowed to change his birth date as docs say he has the body of a younger man.The entrepreneur and self-help guru is even suing his local authority after they refused the amend his age on official documents.Mr Ratelbands case has now gone to a court in the city of Arnhmen in the eastern Dutch provice of Gelderland.He was born on th March , but says he feels at least  years younger and wants to change his birth date to th March .Mr Ratelband said: I have done a check-up and what does it show  My biological age is  years.When Im , I am limited.

That’s not in the national interest.“Time is running out there are still dficulties in the negotiations here, but more so around the Cabinet table.“What I’d say to the PM is negotiate in the national interest not negotiate something you think will just get through your Cabinet.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney said that eventhe UK Cabinet agrees exit plans in the coming days, the rest of the Euwropean Union must also back them. Senior ministers were invited to review the text of the withdrawal agreement that has so far been secured in negotiations with Brussels. The cabinet is poised to meet as soon as a deal is ready to be signed off. But Mr Coveney told the Irish Canada Business Association conference in Dublin: I would urge caution that an imminent breakthrough is not necessarily to be taken for granted, not by a long shot. Repeatedly people seem to make the same mistake over and over again, assuming thatthe British Cabinet agrees something, well, then thats it then, everything is agreed.  This is a negotiation and needs to be an agreement of course between the British Government, but also with the European Union and the  countries that are represented by Michel Barnier and his negotiating team. So while of course we want progress to be made and we want it to be made as quickly as possible because time is moving on, I would urge caution that people dont get carried away on the back of rumour in the coming days. Theresa May last month told MPs that % of the deal had been agreed, although the key sticking point of the backstop to prevent a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland remained unresolved. The Prime Ministers plan would see the whole UK effectively agree to remain in the customs union to help avoid a hard border with Ireland as a backstopno other arrangement can be found. Brexiteer MPs, including Environment Secretary Michael Gove, have called on Mrs May to release full legal advice setting out how the arrangement could be ended to avoid it becoming a permanent settlement. Former Brexit secretary David Davis said the full government legal advice on Brexit must be published and insisted how the UK could exit from the customs union must be pinned down before MPs and peers vote on the deal.  Leaving without an agreement would mean some hiccups in the first year, but the UK would have all the rights and controls over our own destiny, he added. Conservative Dominic Grieve has written to Cabinet Secretary Sir Mark Sedwill calling for government documents explaining any final withdrawal agreement to the public to include a full comparison with the status quo as well as with a no deal scenario. The former attorney general, who backs the Peoples Vote campaign for a fresh referendum, said: It is of course entirely right that the Cabinet Office seeks to explain the full implications of any deal to the British public. However, it is of concern that the Cabinet Office seems to be under instruction to keep from the public and from Parliament any ability to make a comparison between the deal and the arrangements we already have inside the European Union. It is of the utmost importance that Parliament and the public can compare any arrangement the Prime Minister agrees, against the benefits of European Union membership and make clear the impact that the deal proposed would have on every single area of the economy, public services, finances, security and opportunity. Michel Barnier, the EUs chief Brexit negotiator, meanwhile, has warned of the need to fight against forces seeking to demolish the European project, saying: There is now a Farage in every country. Speaking to a conference of the centre-right European Peoples Partyin Finland, Mr Barnier said: The European project is fragile, it is under threat, it is perishable and at the same time it is vital.

On the first occasion, Mr Nazir woke his daughter, , son, , and parents, both in their s, to tell the officers they had come to no harm following  accusations of abuse, according to the Manchester Evening News. Gazi, who allegedly made the hoax calls, is accused of an offence of swatting - making  reports to the emergency services in an attempt to bring out a SWAT team. A week after the first search, armed police visited Mr Nazirs property a second time a week later. The raids, and other visits by unarmed officers, followed a series of hoax calls, according to Greater Manchester Police.  Mr Nazir, who runs a promotions company, says he faced a series of  online allegations that he abused his children. He said he first became worried when a business contact in America revealed herself to be a woman - she had previously claimed to be a man - and suggested it would be ‘fun’ to put cameras in the room to secretly record the young acts working with his firm. When Mr Nazir told her he wanted nothing more to do with the deal, she is said to have vowed to destroy him and call him a paedophile online. He said: “She started putting messages up on social media that I’m a paedophile and my associates are paedophiles and that my colleagues are all part of a grooming group.” Other victims began to come forward following an initial story about the case in the Manchester Evening News. A DJ, Rizwan Mahmood, also known as Rzi Riz, found police had smashed down the front door of his home in Manchester on September  after a  report that a child was being killed inside the property. Bollywood entrepreneur Sangeetha Singh, , from Manchester, and her dancer daughters Aashan and Sonalia Kaur, both , also say they were victims of abuse.  Her daughters faced outrageous claims they were prostitutes while Sangeetha, who has suffered a miscarriage in the past, was phoned by a troll who posed as her unborn baby and said: Why mommy, why you kill me  Armed police also raided the Derby home of music promoter Gee Hussain, , following a bogus report he had raped a child. A Greater Manchester Police spokesman said: “Officers from Oldham have been investigating a number of hoax calls over the past  months that are believed to have been made by one inidual from the USA. “On five of those occasions, police immediately responded as a grade one call, after receiving information that lives were in danger. “On each occasion, it was veried there were no concerns for people’s safety and measures have now been put in place to authenticate each call made to police. “We are working with the authorities in the USA and exploring all opportunities to resolve this issue. “Both parties involved have been previously spoken to and advised not to communicate with each other. “Hoax calls take up a lot of vital resources and prevent us from dealing with genuine emergencies where our response could be a matter of le and death.” "},{"url":null,"title":"dad three caught looking child","story":"NewsDad-of-three caught looking at child abuse images says paedophiles CAN changeThe sex offender, in his s, from Liverpool, did not believe that he was harming anyone by looking at the picturesShareByPaddy Shennan:,  NOV NewsTh anonymous sex offender got a conviction for looking at illegal images on the internet \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA father-of-three who was caught viewing indecent images of children didnt think he was doing anything that bad before he was rehabilitated. Since then the sex offender has spent time in prison, was orced by his we and can now only see his own children on supervised visits. The man, who is in his s and from Liverpool, spoke to the Liverpool ECHO about his rehabilitation on a special programme to prevent sex crimes.The scheme, run by the Mersey Care NHS mental health trust, is staffed by psychologists with years of experience working with adults who have committed sexual offences. This is his story in his own words...I was referred to Mersey Care after I got out of prison. I got a conviction for looking at illegal images on the internet. When I was offending I didn’t really think that I was doing anything that bad. I was looking at pictures but I didn’t think I was actually harming anyone. They were just pictures. I didn’t realise what the consequences would be. Even after prison I thought I would come out and get back to normal but I was told I couldn’t see my children – only once a month in a social services centre supervised by someone .  They are really confused about why they can’t just do normal things with me any more and they get very upset about not seeing me, especially on big days like birthdays and Father’s Day. It’s awful knowing that I caused that for them and I can’t change it. My we orced me and has been really badly affected too. She had to put up with comments in the street, people ignoring her, hassle at the school. She also had to go through an assessment with social services as they thought she might not be able to take care of the children properly. She felt so hurt by the whole situation. I have moved to a dferent area where people don’t know me but I still get scared walking down the street in case someone recognises me. I don’t know what they’d do. Now, after coming to this service I see things very dferently. They were real children in those pictures and by looking for those images I was creating the market for them to be made. I learned that every child in those pictures has been abused and that what you see on the surface isn’t necessarily what’s going on behind the scenes. They might be smiling for the camera, but why  What are the consequences for those children  To have their pictures out there for the rest of their lives, not knowing who’s looking at them. Coming here has also helped me to understand why I offended. What led me to do it really.  It was a way of escaping reality for me as I was going through some dficulties at the time and I didn’t really think about the consequences for anyone, let alone myself. But there are other ways of dealing with stress. Why did I choose to look at illegal images  The therapy helped me to put things together and learn about the deeper psychological issues. I was sexually abused by a family friend when I was little. I don’t want to use that as an excuse there’s no excuse, but it affected the way I developed and some of the sexual feelings that I had. I was confused about lots of things but I admit that I was sexually aroused by the pictures. I’ve addressed these issues now, the therapy helped me to re-process my own abuse and to change how it affected me. I will always have to be wary and keep myself safe. I don’t want to offend again in any way. I understand the damage it does to victims, what it’s done to my family. Even though I didn’t touch those children in the images, somebody did so that I could look at them, and that sickens me now. I never want to go back there again. If the psychologists here that helped me can work with people before they offend they might be able to stop things going so far for other families. If this prevention service had been there a few years ago and I had had help with my feelings back then maybe I wouldn’t have gone on to look at illegal images.

According to royal insiders, the couple have already got a game plan to make sure the child isnt raised in a spoiled way. The strategy allegedly, involves using public transport and doing household chores. Speaking to US Weekly, royal correspondent Omid Scobie said Harry and Meghan will be changing the royal parenting rules, and have set a game plan for how they want to raise their children.Meghan will take her kids on a subway. They’ll have chores, and jobs one day. They wont be spoiled.

Mum-of-four Sharon Spink insisted feeding daughter Charlotte Spink until earlier this year was completely normal and has cemented a lelong bond between them. She said despite doing it for almost a decade she is happy the schoolgirl made her own decision to stop two months ago. Actor mum Sharon, who supports natural term weaning, claims Charlotte is healthy and rarely gets ill thanks to the beneficial properties of mummy milk. And despite facing a backlash from critics who have accused her of child abuse, Sharon, , wants to break down the stigma around breastfeeding older children - believing there are many mums out there doing it. Sharon, from Sherburn-in-Elmet, North Yorkshire, said: When I came to have Charlotte, I had decided on natural term weaning. Its nice for the child to be in control of when they want to wean, rather than forcing the issue. She naturally self-weaned earlier this year. It was a gradual process and her choice. She was feeding about once a monthshe wasnt feeling great or was feeling a bit run down, and was going longer and longer without feeding.  Now she hasnt done it for about two months. She told me she would stop when she was  which will be in April next year but it seems to have come to a natural end earlier, although I would have allowed her to continue for as long as wants to. As shes been reducing anyway I dont feel sad about it. If she would have stopped suddenly I think I would have missed it, but its just nice that its come to a natural end. Its how I envisaged it would end. It was her choice and was done in a very gradual way. We havent had a discussion about her not doing it anymore. I just hope when shes older shell remember that feeling of comfort and security it gave her rather than it being about feeding. We have such a close bond and Im convinced its because of breastfeeding her for so long. It cemented our bond and I dont think that will change now its stopped. I think were closer because of doing it. I havent had any pangs since she stopped and she still comes for a cuddle. With Charlotte it about was the security. Children find a lot of comfort in the breast, and the older they get the more it becomes about comfort rather than nutrition. Sharon claims Charlotte is very healthy and rarely gets ill due to breast milks boost to the immune system. The World Health Organization recommends exclusive breastfeeding up to six months with continued breastfeeding along with complementary foods up to two years of age or beyond.  Sharon said she was determined to breastfeed Charlotte after struggling to do it with her other three children Kim, , Sarah, , and Isabel, . Sharon, who last year qualied as a breast feeding counsellor, said: I breastfed my first two children for a couple of weeks and my daughter Isabel for about six months but I ran into problems and felt like there was a lack of support. When Isabel was four months old she lost weight and I had to supplement that with formula. I was determined to make it work for Charlotte. My initial goal was to get past the six months mark then it became  months then two years which is the WHO minimum recommendation. After that it was seeing how far she wanted to go. There were times when I wanted to give up especially in the early days of feeding but you think Im doing this for my child. This is what she wants and Ill carry on because I know its helping her. By four and a half Charlotte was sleeping through the night but shed still come into the bed and have a feed. Sometimes I wouldnt even realise and Id ask her the next day whether she came in in the night to feed. Sharon said at the age of five Charlotte was feeding three times a day but this has been gradually reducing over the last four years until she was doing it about once a month. She said she used to feed Charlotte in public places including the hairdressers, supermarket and church but now just does it at home. Sharon said: She stopped feeding in public when she was about four or five.  Charlotte doesnt talk about it at school. Its not something that would come up in conversation with schoolmates. The reaction I get from within the breastfeeding community is one of support. There were a lot of positive comments. Obviously there have been the negatives - usually from typical keyboard warriors who post their opinion. I have been called every name under the sun. Ive been told its child abuse, Ive been called a paedophile and told its wrong and that Im a freak. The first time it upset me because I wasnt used to it but now its water off a ducks back. Charlotte knows its not true and people I care about know its not true. I explain to her that they are people who do not know her or us or our situation. Our family and friends are very supportive. Im sure its more common that people think but mums are too scared to talk about it and are scared of the backlash from people that dont understand that its normal. I just want to let other mums out there who are wondering should I or should I not  that this is normal and this is what children do. If they feed for as long as they want to they will naturally wean. In a lot of countries its perfectly normal to breastfeed older children and they will do it for a lot longer than we do in the west. Shes not had an ear infection, cough or cold for a long time but its hard to say what the long term health benefits will be as I cant turn back the clock and see how it would be had she stopped earlier. When compared to my other three children I would say she is healthier and doesnt get as many coughs, colds and tummy aches.  Shes got all her adult teeth. Id read when they get all their adult teeth they lose the ability to latch on but it seems to be fine. For quite a while she fed on the left side and every so often shed try the other side and say it tastes dferent. I cant express milk anymore, but I still was able to produce it when she fed. Sharon said Charlottes dad, CAD manager Paul Spink, , is understanding. But she admitted her choice to breastfeed Charlotte may have caused a bit of jealousy with her older sister Isabel. She said: He just lets us get on with it although he doesnt really have a choice. Isabel is laid back about it. I think when she was younger it caused problems with jealousy with Charlotte getting more of mummys time. We made a point of Charlotte having a feed for half an hour at bedtime then I would sit with Isabel for half an hour. There has been the odd time when Isabel said can I have a go  I wouldnt know how to do it and she would pretend to feed. I hope that this has helped Charlotte decideshe wants to breastfeed when shes older. Former jewellery maker Sharon said she feels proud about what her body has achieved. Sharon said: It feels empowering doing something like this. All four of my children were born by c-section and I felt like my body had failed. I hated feeling like that but it was true. Ive grown up and learned so much more now. I look back and Ive got four healthy children who had they not been born by c-section would not be here today. With breastfeeding when it doesnt happen you feel like your body is not working properly. I tried to breastfeed three children and failed and that made me more determined. I feel like my body is doing what its supposed to be doing. Its what breasts are for. We have to support mums. Its about choice.

He was taken on the back of a pick-up to an ambulance waiting on the edge of the forest, as it was unable to get closer due to the rough terrain. According to a rural worker, who helped in the hunt, Maicon escaped the wreckage and found his way to a river then collapsed upon reaching it. He was unable to drink any of it because he was too weak to swallow. Local farmer, Leonisio Lemos, told Globo TV: “Loads of people were looking for him. We made a lot of noise, shouting and calling to make sure he could hear we were trying to find him and stopping to listen to checkhe was answering back. “Finally, one of the rescuers heard a faint voice calling for help. The person said ‘please help me, I’m here’. His voice was very weak. Everyone ran to the location where the sound came from. “It was a very emotional moment when he saw us and he kept repeating ‘now I’m saved, now I’m saved.”  Speaking to his family, the pilot said he was lucky to be alive. He said he was burned after the plane exploded when it hit the ground, but he did not give more details about what may have caused the accident. He reportedly said he used a GPS satellite navigation device to find the stream. By Wednesday he was too weary to continue walking and decided to lie down on the banks of the river, which is where he was found. The aviation accident was witnessed from a distance by two farmhands who saw the aircraft losing power and disappearing into the forest. It took them about an hour and a half to cut through the jungle to get to the wreckage. When they reached the crash site, they found the yellow aircraft, a Neiva EMB-, on fire and debris scattered across a wide area but no sign of the pilot. The aircraft cabin was still intact and the door open, which indicated that Mr Esteves had left the scene. When no blood traces were found on the wreck, family and friends clung to the hope he would be rescued alive following the forced landing. His pocket kne was located six feet away from the plane, along with some paper identied as being his.  Broken tree branches suggested the stranded man was trying to find his way out of the woods. At the time his brother Diego said: “We’ve searched the area but we cannot find him. We think he is probably disorientated and lost, but we believe we will find him alive. The bushes are ladened with plenty of fruit to eat.” The pilot’s girlfriend Rebecca Frietas, who is pregnant with their first child, described him as a ‘guy who cannot stand still’. He ‘would be looking for help and trying to get out of the woods’, she said. But as the days wore on rescuers became increasingly worried that time was running out and his injuries could leave him vulnerable to potential attacks from jaguars that inhabit the area. A group of volunteers covered a , metre wide radius in terrain described as extremely dficult to reach and trekked through challenging conditions that hampered the quest to find the missing airman. The experienced pilot, who has been flying for more than five years, took off from Porto Nacional in the state of Tocantins for Alta Floresta, a  hour flight, to carry out crop dusting on farms. He planned two stopovers to refuel but crashed in dense jungle miles away from his final destination. He said he was determined to survive despite the odds being against him. And his resilience paid off. He is expected to stay in hospital for at least a week.

Devish Aasi even bathes with the cobras and spends time rubbing in massage oil into their skin. The schoolboy began his bizarre friendship four years ago, much to the shock of his parents Raghunath and Muniya, , who are concerned the boy could be bitten. His dad, from Pathada Village in central India, said: We have tried everything to keep him away from the snakes. We have explained that snakes are not meant to be friends. It is dangerous but he doesnt listen to us. He added: Four years ago Devesh woke up from a dream about snakes, we didnt think much of it but in the morning he ran into the jungle and ed with two snakes.  When we came back we were shocked to see him playing with the reptiles. He had the snakes all over him but they did not bite him. Since that day, he often wakes up telling about the dream. He catches the snakes from the jungle, keeps them with him for a few days and then puts them back. His parents think he is friends with around  dferent snakes.  Villager Yogendra Pratap Singh Bundela said: We have seen him playing with the snakes for four years. It doesnt surprise us anymore. We know the snakes dont harm him. But the other children are scared of these snakes. They dont play with him or go near to Devesh when he is surrounded by his friends. But we dont mind them playing with him when he is in school. Another villager added: We initially thought that the boy is going to get killed, but he is happily playing with the reptiles and it has now become a common thing for us as we see him play with the snakes every day.” "},{"url":null,"title":"dundee boss faces jim wait over frontman options after kallman injury","story":"Dundee manager Jim McIntyre faces a wait over who he can select to lead his line at Motherwell.In all three of his matches in charge, Jim has gone with Finnish international Benjamin Kallman up top.However, the Dens gaffer will have to wait and seethe -year-old recovers from the head knock which forced him off against Celtic on Wednesday.Going up for a header – the Dark Blues’ closest attempt at goal – shortly before half-time, Kallman took a blow to the head and was taken straight up the tunnel by physio Gerry Docherty.The Finn is still being assessed and it’s unclear whether he’ll be fit enough to start at Fir Park today.That’s likely to mean a start for Tunisian Sofien Moussa after he replaced Kallman before half-time on Wednesday.The -year-old targetman started the Dark Blues’ boss first match in charge at Livingston but missed the following defeat to Hearts with an Achilles problem.Centre-back Ryan Inniss is also fit after being replaced by Andy Boyle at half-time against Celtic.

The clean sheet was very important.“Against Dunfermline we did the same and we want to keep working at it.“Among the whole squad, the feeling is very good and you could see that on Saturday.“William was on the bench and Freddie Frans got an injury in the warm-up but we played well together and that shows every player is concentrated and we have one objective.”And Bouhenna was delighted they achieved that one objective – three points – by bouncing back from what he saw as a “bad result” in their previous home game, a - draw with Inverness.He said: “We are very happy, we played very well on Saturday.“For me, the clean sheet in the game was very important – it’s very important for the whole team.“We came back strong after our previous result at home which was, I think, a bad result against Inverness.“On Saturday it was very important to take the three points and play well.“We did that and everybody is happy – we have to keep going, keep working hard because we have a very dficult game on Saturday.“We controlled the game against Queen of the South, especially in the first half.“I can’t think of a shot they had on target which was good but we have to keep our concentration which is not easy.“We have to work hard on the pitch to keep the ball because that isn’t easy either.“I think we played a very good game, everybody was running and gave their maximum.”With Ross County four points ahead in second place and Ayr United a further three points in front at the top with a home match against Queen of the South to come this weekend, Bouhenna says the trip to Dingwall this weekend is the biggest game of the campaign so far.“The Ross County game is very important, the most important since the start of the season because we have to win this game to get nearer to them and make up some points.“This is the best form we’ve been in since the start of the season and it’s very important for the confidence of the players.“Everybody wants to keep this going and to keep winning.“That is very important for uswe want to stay at the top of the league and to go up next year to the Premiership.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/11/5be2bdd87dff3.jpg ","title":"he had mcdonalds bag full of needles","story":"A young woman said she was left shaken after finding a man passed out and surrounded by drug paraphernalia in a city centre car park.Rebecca Stewart, , was ing to her car on Monday when she discovered the man slumped over in the third floor of the stairwell of Bell Street car park.The call centre worker from Stobswell said she was scared of waking the man in case he was “unpredictable”.She said: “I wasn’t expecting to see anyone and my first thought was to seethey were OK.“I saw a broken spoon with brown stuff in it, a lighter and he had a McDonald’s bag full of needles and tinfoil.

That points dference can be further reduced to five when Derek McInnes’ side host Hibs tomorrow evening.Victory over the sixth-placed outfit would also vault the Reds back into the top six.Silence the critics  No. Because their pops are like water off a duck’s back to the club captain.He said: “People will always want to write you off and whatever  but we know what we are capable of.“We know what we want to do as a squad, so things like that don’t bother us.”Aberdeen booked a fourth final under manager Derek McInnes and will now bid to emulate the  League Cup heroics next month.Shinnie insists the Dons’ chances in the semi being written off did not fire him up.Leading his home city club to another final and keeping alive the chance of lting a first trophy as Aberdeen skipper was all the motivation the -year-old needed.“A cup semi-final should always fire you up no matter what,” he said. “That is my opinion on it.“I would be fired up for a semi-final no matter who it was against.“Some people might use itmore than others would but the main focus on that game was getting through.”Buoyed by a summer spending spree in excess of £ million and an -game unbeaten streak in the Europa League, Steven Gerrard’s Gers were billed as favourites at Hampden.It was a situation Shinnie, who lted the Scottish Cup with Inverness Caley Thistle in , was used to before his switch to the Dons that year.Shinnie said: “Personally I have dealt with it the whole time I was at Inverness when we were always the massive underdogs. I came to Aberdeen and it is not so much like that here.“Before the semi we said that this could be a real kickstarter for the season and a win could get that bit of momentum going.“We had sort of been stop start with good games followed by bad games. It was important for us as a team, a squad and a club to get to another cup final.“We always pride ourselves on trying to do that and giving ourselves a chance of trying to win silverware.”That momentum has come with two straight wins in the Premiership having overcome Hamiltonand Kilmarnock.Victory over in-form Killie was a slog with the Reds’ goals coming despite only two shots at target. Although a poor performance, particularly in the first half where a long-ball game obliterated any chance of fluidity, Aberdeen secured another win.Shinnie reckons an injury crisis, where eight were ruled out at one time, is a mitigating factor in inconsistent early league form.Now that players have ed competition for places is also back.Shinnie, who has been selected for the Scotland squad to face Albania and Israel in the UEFA Nations League, said: “We have a lot of boys coming back from injury. There always is that competition for places, even with young boys coming through.“Connor McLennan came in for the St Mirren game recently and then played very well.“We have boys like Bruce Anderson coming through.“It is what the squad needs as competition for places is always good.

Recruitment in the First World War only required those enlisting to provide an age, not a date of birth. vw, px\"  A slight lad, standing at ft in with an expanded chest of . inches, Angus’s true age was soon discovered and he was discharged  days later.Undeterred, the following month he signed up to the th Gordon Highlanders on May .His deception was slightly more successful and he lasted for  days until September   before being sent home.His third and final attempt to enlist as an underage soldier was on May   when he joined the rd Gordon Highlanders, this time giving his age as  years and  days. Angus’s true age –  years and eight months – was discovered  days later and he was discharged for a “misstatement as to age on enlistment”.Ken, who lives in Beverley, Yorkshire, but is extensively researching the military history of his Aberdonian ancestors, said: “It is well documented that many young men and boys under the age of  enlisted and fought during this conflict, and it is surprising that Angus was caught out on three occasions. I can only assume that his father or mother informed the regiments of Angus’s age knowing of the real horrors of war from experiences of my great-grandfather Alexander, who was at that time serving in France.”Angus finally reached the minimum recruitment age of  and successfully enlisted with the nd Training Reserve Battalion Gordon Highlanders on October  . He was in training until he was posted to the st Division Gordon Highlanders and, on May  , he joined the  th Gordons as Private McLeod.Upon finally making it to France on May  with  other men, he was sent straight to the front near Bailleul where he went on to see action in several battles. Using original war diaries, which were kept by the battalion during the conflict, Ken has been able to piece together his great-uncle’s movements, including an encounter with his father on the battlefield.The fascinating research shows a more domesticated side to le at the front. Angus and his fellow recruits rested and cleaned up, attended church services and undertook training in operating Lewis Guns, before a march to Bray to see a rle range demonstration and musketry practice.On May  the new recruits relieved the th Battalion Gordons from the front line, taking up their positions in Bow Trench and Tired Alley at Bailleul in north-east France near the Belgian border.Days later they experienced their first shelling and, in the months that followed, the diary shows a mixture of warfare and le behind the lines as the battalion moved around, along with a daily weather report.There was even some light relief on September  when the th Battalion Gordons played the Royal Berkshire Regiment at football – winning -.In a twist of fate, Ken’s research shows Angus met his beloved father just two days before he died while his company moved towards Avesnes-le-Sec from Bourloin.Ken said: “It was during this movement that Angus and his father met up together. This could have been a chance meeting or possibly Alexander, who at this time was a Sergeant with the Royal Scots Fusiliers Labour Corps, may have also been advancing in support of ious Battalions.“This meeting was to be the last time that Alexander saw his son, and this memory must have remained with him for the rest of his le and been hard to live with.”“C” Company headquarters were set up near a mill at Avesnes-le-Sec with Angus and his comrades taking up positions in a support line in a north-westernly direction of the village. The area offered minimal cover and on the morning of October , artillery bombed an area ahead of the frontline hoping to reach woods and a railway. Met with machine gun fire, the battalion was forced to retire, however the enemy fire was so severe the retreat wasn’t complete until noon. The Gordons and Seaforths both suffered heavy fire with Angus being one of several killed.At just  years old, he was buried where he fell and is remembered at the cemetery at Avesnes-le-Sec with the epitaph chosen by his parents: “Gave All His Le”.Ken is appealing to anyone in the north-east who may have a photo of his great-uncle Angus McLeod to get in touch to help him complete his research.

Breaking the km course record was another key stage in my career. I had a great battle with some top runners there and it gave me the confidence I could race well on the roads rather than just on the mountains.“For me Balmoral is such a brilliant event because there’s a race for every age and ability and the courses run through some of the best scenery in Scotland.“It has the feel of a really big race with thousands of runners and supporters at times, but some sections of the course through the forest are quiet and it’s a nice contrast.“I’d recommend this event to anyone who hasn’t been before as it’s a classic event and a great day out for all the family.”"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 34","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowWe head Loch Caolisport for this week#s reader#s photograph.It was taken by Delores Firth of Ormsary from her garden looking down towards Loch Caolisport and Ellary.Delores said: #The cloud formations were my real focus when I took this picture.#Send your favourite photographs to the Argyllshire Advertiser for publication.

Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 37","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Sir,It is always a delight when a letter awakens a landowner.James F Lithgow#s insult about ‘blow-ins’ is a typical trait. I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

The practice will also offer treatments currently not available on the NHS which will widen the range of available treatments such as white fillings in back teeth. All of this will provide an improved dental service by increasing patient access and choice.#We would also like to reassure patients that Scottish Government regulations ensure that the dentist in the new practice will be obliged to provide  per cent of the dental treatment under the NHS, so any private work would be limited.#"},{"url":null,"title":"inverarays scott between the sticks for scotland","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowInveraray Shinty Club#s young goalkeeper Scott MacLachlan will represent Scotland in an under- international versus Ireland.Scotland manager Alan MacRae has selected his team to play the Irish in a shinty hurling cross-codes match on Saturday November , and Scott MacLachlan will feature between the sticks.Other Argyll players in the squad are Oban Camanachd#s Daniel Sloss and Ross MacMillan of Oban Celtic # both of whom will feature from the bench.Scotland will be captained by Blair Morrison from Caberfeidh.The annual Marine Harvest under- shinty hurling international will take place at the GAA’s National Games Development Centre at Abbotstown, Dublin with a pm throw in.The game will be refereed by Archie Ritchie."},{"url":null,"title":"life beyond mojo stephen skinn","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowFollowing the recent outstanding MOJO festival of original music in Ardfern, the Argyllshire Advertiser takes a look at what the leading musical lights of Argyll are up to following their rockin# display at MOJOStephen Skinn from Loch Awe village first joined the live music world in  with some of his own songs performed in the Corran Halls, Oban, to a large and enthusiastic audience.He has continued writing and recording to produce his first album #Living Off Dreams#, influenced by artists including The Faces, Oasis and Bruce Springsteen.The album encompasses music styles from folk, pop to alternative rock where Stephen#s cool, inviting vocals always leave you feeling upbeat.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13549120.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS134733004.jpg","title":"ayrs station hotel cannot afford","story":"NewsAyrs Station Hotel cannot afford more delay, says MSP Brian WhittleOfficials have been urged to make a quick decision on the future of the Station Hotel, with some trains now running south of the town againShareByStuart Wilson:,  NOV NewsStation Hotel \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA decision on the future of Ayr’s Station Hotel must not be kicked down the road, insists an MSP. Brian Whittle says officials must act with more urgency than ever following the resumption of services south of the town. The surprise call to send trains back on the route to Stranraer was made by ScotRail bosses on Thursday. Their decision followed a morning test run on the track beneath the crumbling hotel. But South of Scotland member, Mr Whittle, warned: “Just because the trains are running again, no-one should feel we can put off making a decision about the Station Hotel’s future. “A general unwillingness by South Ayrshire Council and others to think about the future of the building were what got us into this mess and I’m not prepared to see action put off again. “The Station Hotel can’t be allowed to sit abandoned for a minute more than is necessary to make the decision. “People who rely on the railway can’t afford any more dithering and delay.”  Work to stabilise the B-Listed structure continues this week with a scaffolding being erected. One source close to the works said: “The roof is a big problem and is nowhere near being tackled yet. “It remains to be seen what the structural engineers will want to do but saving it is a very big job.” Limited services are now running to Stranraer for the first time since council chiefs threw up an exclusion zone in August. Buses will continue to operate for the services that haven’t been reintroduced, and for services between Ayr and Girvan. The existing timetable for services between Ayr and Glasgow Central remains in place. Alex Hynes, ScotRail Alliance managing director, said: “We know it has been a challenging time for our customers, so we are pleased to be able to restore some services between Ayr and Stranraer. “We are working flat out with South Ayrshire Council and our task force partners to get all services to and from Ayr back to normal as soon as possible.” Bill Reeve, chair of Ayr Station Task Force, added: “Theof rail passenger services between Stranraer and Ayr is a welcome step towards resolving this issue. “While we remain mindful there is still work to be done to restore the complete service it is good that hard work by both South Ayrshire Council and the ScotRail Alliance has now made this first step possible. “The Task Force partners continue to work together to ensure we can bring back a full timetable as quickly as possible and we thank businesses, commuters and the local community for their continued patience while we do.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnScotrailSouth Ayrshire CouncilGirvanAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13548879.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS166431538.jpg","title":"beith juniors president says club","story":"NewsBeith Juniors president says club are ready for Scottish Cup day with Ayr UnitedThe Mighty president, John Boal, says Ayrs large travelling support will be given a warm welcome at Bellsdale Park.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  NOV NewsBeith president John Boal\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBosses at Beith Juniors today insisted they are ready and able to host Ayr United in the Scottish Cup.

The midfielder, who famously twice scored FOUR goals in games in his first season after being signed by Ally MacLeod, died last week aged . Former team-mate Jim McSherry said Graham was one of the best players he ever shared a dressing room with. McSherry, now an Ayr publican, said: “Johnny, who had long hair like one of the Beatles, was one of my heroes when I was starting out as a player. “When I joined the club in , Johnny and his we were so welcoming to me.

Lover Man - a sultry nocturne followed made famous by pianist and composer Ram Ramirez.Then it was time for another of Dicks own compositions on the bass clarinet.In Blues for Jimmy the scene was set in the deep South of America from around  with the deep tones of the bass clarinet echoing the African American blues.A tongue in cheek Stranger on the Shore came next complete with seagulls. Acker Bilk originally composed it as a lullaby for his daughter before being tempted commercially to change its name.My personal highlight of the evening was Lady be Good by George Gershwin - Anne on piano and Dick on clarinet played with verve and swing.Body and Soul by Green and made famous by Colman Hawkins was just that! Jumpinrsquo at the Woodside by Count Basie did indeed jump!The final treat of the evening was Henry Mancinirsquos Pink Panther.Dick wondered whether there was any need for him to work again after composing this particular piece.Next months concert is on Sunday, November  at . pm.

She is originally from another European country but has made Haddington her home, with her husband and two wonderful children.Her explorations of nearby woods led her to discover an unusual grave amongst the trees. It is a grave of a horse, buried in the th century. It was this grave she had offered to show me. To get there we had a beautul walk along a secluded section of the banks of the Tyne. It was the trees I noticed first, of course, which were dotted along the banks of the river.Autumn was just then beginning to brush the trees with its colour, and it was one of those evenings when the setting sun seemed to take its time, bathing the land in bright streaks of orange light. Along the way, Marije paused and said: ldquoThis is my tree.It was a beech tree of signicant age, its branches arching over the Tyne, asfishing. She showed me her sitting place, underneath its embracing canopy. Here the roots curved to make a natural seat. Her older son spoke of seeing kingfishers, and sure enough, this was a perfect place to absorb the majesty of the Tyne as it flowed towards Haddington. Another beech of similar age grew close by. Their branches entwined, making it look like they were sisters holding hands.But I sensed then there was more to Marijersquos connection to this place, although I then had no idea just how powerful her story was.When we finally got to our destination in the woods further upriver, the light was too weak to penetrate the trees. The old grave of the horse was shrouded in darkness.Yet with the help of mobile torches we could view it, and for sure the grave was interesting and worth a story in its own right. I vowed to find out more about its background as we headed back to Marijersquos house in the dying embers of a sunset.When we reached her house we were treated to wonderful hospitality. It was then that Marije told her story of the beech tree.Not long ago she had been diagnosed with cancer. She faced the possibility of being taken by this cruel disease. Numbness and disbelief at first overcame her, then there was the realisation that le might be very short and she would have to leave her two young children.She walked to the beech tree soon after her diagnosis and sat cradled by its roots. Despite having family and friends whose love and support was invaluable, Marije explained it can also be a desperately lonely feeling. ldquoWe all know we canrsquot live forever, she told me, ldquobut to face the reality of my end at such a young age and with children was unbearable.ldquoI went on that walk to the tree in the most dire situation, she told me. ldquoI felt a connection as I sat under the tree, I really felt her old wisdom and energy.Her love for her young children is what gave her strength in the worst of times. The tree seemed to symbolise this powerful bond, its roots deeply holding it safe.ldquoPeople talk about mother nature, Marije said, ldquoand I understand why. When my hair fell out, I lsquogave it backrsquo to nature, underneath the beech. I know it makes me sound weird, but it really helped me.It is not weird, of course. Trees are full of wisdom, not in the sense of actual words but in the spiritual sense. Beech is said to be the matriarch of the wood, sometimes called the mother of the forest. It is a good listener. Our best ideas and inner reflections can come when we sit under the embrace of an old tree even science tells us this now.Sadly not everyone wins the fight against cancer, but thankfully Marije recovered after treatment. The experience has left her treasuring every single day and taking no sunrise for granted. And she is thankful to her beech tree, which was her companion and confidant in those times of emotional agony. It remains for her a place of contemplation and peace, where she can give thanks and absorb the joy of being alive.ldquoI cherish every day now in ways I didnrsquot before, she told me. ldquoI think it is important to allow our kids to feel the connection with nature. That means being in nature, and respecting it. After all, we are all part of it.This was the real story of that walk on that day a story of incredible bravery, pain, love and determination by a young mum I now have the privilege to call a friend."},{"url":null,"title":"labour-ties-bring-meeting-to-a-halt","story":"Prestonpans businessman Ferhan Ashiq had applied to increase the size of an alcohol display ndashand for a name change ndash at one of his stores.But Councillor Jim Goodfellowimmediately recused himself from the application because of his friendship with Mr Ashiq, who is a member of East Lothian Labour Party.After a short adjournment, Councillor Fiona Dugdale , convenor, also declared an interest.Remaining Labour councillor John McMillan, however, said he did not believe his relationship with Mr Ashiq, who has shops in Musselburgh and Prestonpans, could have an impact on his ability to make a decision, while Conservative councillor Jane Henderson said she did not know him.The boardrsquos legal adviser described the situation as ldquounusual but said the board was no longer quorate and Mr Ashiqrsquos application would have to be continued to the next licensing board for a decision.But a bemused Mr Ashiq noted: ldquoWhen it comes to the next meeting I will know most of the board members there.Legal adviser Carlo Grilli advised Mr Ashiq to send his father, whose name was on the application, and an agent instead.The application was to change the name of Mr Ashiqrsquos Prestonpans store on Redburn Road from Day-Today to Day Todayand increase the alcohol display from . square metres to . square metres."},{"url":null,"title":"rare-bottle-of-whisky-to-be-auctioned-for-combat-stress-charity","story":"It is one of only , matured in an American bourbon barrel for eight years, with a cask strength of  per cent alcohol.The auction is part of a fundraiser for Combat Stress, the veteransrsquo mental health charity, and is being organised by the music group the Flying Aspidistras ahead of their concert of remembrance, Now the Guns are Silent, at Gosford House on Sunday.The occasion will be a reflection on the harsh reality of war and the suffering felt beyond the battlefield.Kilchoman distillery on Islay has bottled this special single cask to coincide with the centenary of the end of the First World War.More poignantly, it is also to commemorate the sinking of two troopships, the SS Tuscania and the HMS Otranto, with the loss of nearly  men, in the waters around Islay in .Ailsa Fortune, the events organiser, said: \"The war affected every community in Scotland, from Islay to East Lothian.\"The end of any war leaves many broken lives.

network was a ldquodirect result of cuts to local authority funding by the Scottish Government.He said: ldquoThe condition of roads is a problem across Scotland. This is a direct result of the Scottish Government slashing council funding over this period, with East Lothian Council having suffered cuts of around pound million in the last five years.ldquoEast Lothian Council has done its utmost to protect the budget.ldquoThe Scottish Government needs to recognise the impact its cuts are having and give local authorities the funding they need to protect services, including road maintenance.The county is currently covered by km of roads, ranging from class A routes to unclassied lanes.And an Annual Status and Options Report, produced on behalf of East Lothian Council, has revealed that  per cent are currently in need of repair.The report, which looks at the impact of future funding on network maintenance in the long term, warns that the current level of investment of pound.million a year will mean that more than  per cent of the roads will be in a state of disrepair in  yearsrsquo time.And it reveals that, as an asset, East Lothian Councilrsquos carriageways depreciate in value by poundmillion every year.It also found that nearly km of rural public roads in the county were in poor condition and needed immediate investigation and possible treatment.The report said: ldquoThe level of investment on public roads in East Lothian has not been sufficient to limit the decline in the overall condition of the network.It revealed that additional investment of pound.million over the next  years could signicantlyimprove the state of the roads, with fewer than  per cent likely to need repairs by the end of the decade.Peter Forsyth, asset manager for East Lothian Council, said that the recommendation for operating the carriageways following the report was to continue with the current level of investment.In a report to the councilrsquos policy and performance review committee, he said the costs of corrective treatments, in particular carriageway reconstruction, were ldquoprohibitive and a preventative treatment approach should ldquomitigate the need to invest signicantly.But he warned: ldquoShort-term under-investment could result in major long-term expenditure necessary to recty major defects which could have been addressed earlier.Councillor Jane Henderson , leader of the opposition, said: ldquoOur road infrastructure assets are vital and dficult decisions will need to be made.ldquoWithout investment now the amount of money needed in the future will be a greater problem the old expression of lsquoa stitch in time saves ninersquo was never so apt.ldquoThe decision on how much to spend on roads now will inevitably mean choices.

There may be a glut in the global market for Michelinrsquos small car tyres, and diesel and petrol cars are being phased out. But we are not going to see the end of transportation, which is the basis of civilisation itself. Whatever you look at ndash electric, hydrogen, compressed air ndash the vehicles of the future are going to need tyres.And increasingly they are likely to require small, high-quality tyres, with low rolling resistance, of the kind Michelin was supposed to specialise in making in Dundee. The current vogue for ever-larger cars, with bigger wheels, which we are told has killed demand for the plantrsquos tyres, cannot last. Heavy diesel SUVs will be so expensive to run in five or ten yearsrsquo time that no one in their right minds will buy them. It is anyway one of the daftest fashions of modern times.But surely, making car tyres is a noxious chemical process that pollutes the environment and leaves a massive carbon footprint  Well, not in Dundee it doesnrsquot, where much of Michelinrsquos power comes from two wind turbines. Sixty-one million pounds ndash much of it public money ndash has been spent on making this plant one of the most advanced and least polluting on the planet. The more you look at the closure of Michelin Dundee, the less it seems to make sense. This is not some rust belt relic.The Michelin plant used to provide secure employment for nearly , workers, and many more in the companies that depended on their wages. It contributed at least pound million to the local economy ndash four times the best estimate of the VArsquos impact. These were secure, well-paid jobs, not disposable seasonal tourist work. You can well understand the anger of the workforce here, which has worked closely with the French firm since it came here in .Indeed, one of the reasons Michelinrsquos closure came as such as surprise is that it has been, in many ways, a model of modern, constructive industrial relations and rarely in the news ndash unlike plants like Timex, which closed after a bitter strike in . The Michelin union leaders are talking about ldquobetrayal by the company, not least because the news was leaked to the press before the workforce got to hear of it, and before Christmas too. Why, they ask, has this happened only three years after the Dundee plant was reconfigured precisely so that it could make a larger range of bigger tyres Well, the biggest and most obvious change is Brexit. That has been the black swan event that no one in large-scale manufacturing in the UK considered a possibility until . And only very recently has the prospect of a no-deal Brexit become a reality. This is a French firm, after all, and you might expect it to be worried about the prospect of .m tyres having special export certicates and tarfs when they cross new borders to the European single market.However, the company insists that its decision to close Dundee has nothing to do with Britainrsquos decision to leave the European Union. There is no particular reason to disbelieve it. Indeed, it might well have suited the pro-European French President, Emanuel Macron, to declare that Brexit is such a disaster on wheels that even tyre manufacturers are fleeing the UK.So, wersquore left with the firmrsquos main claim that cheap tyres from Asia are being dumped here, and making even modern car tyre manufacturing uneconomic. That has nothing directly to do with Brexit, but it does relate to it. It underlines the kind of economic environment into which Britain is headed, post-Brexit. Increasingly, workers in the UK will be competing with workers in developing countries where wages are often nugatory.The ldquoGlobal Britain project is all about thrusting Britain into this low-cost, low-regulation market, a kind of Hong Kong of Europe, where we produce cheap goods to flood the EU. At least thatrsquos the theory of the Tory Brexiters. A more likely scenario is cheap goods, like tyres, flooding into Britain destroying what is left of our manufacturing base. Britain may be a post-industrial economy, but that doesnrsquot mean that making things is unimportant. Brexit is isolating the UK from EU supply chains and hastening deindustrialisation.Should the Scottish Government intervene  Well, its powers are extremely limited, not least by EU regulations on supporting loss-making industries. A lot of public money, around poundm, has already gone into the plant. It doesnrsquot seem plausible that it could be nationalised, because it is an integral part of a global company, the second-largest tyre manufacturer on the planet, and would lack the global retail networks to sell the tyres evenit could make them cheaply enough.Some might suspect that Michelin had known all along that its plant was doomed and was just using what public money it could access to run the plant down while extracting what profits it could. But that would be ungenerous. Michelin has a reputation for being a relatively responsible company, and anyway it invested a great deal of its own cash in the Dundee plant. Unfortunately, it was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.But these are not jobs that Britain can lose with equanimity. The intellectual capital being built in Dundeersquos universities and the games sector GTA may provide twice as many jobs as Michelin, according to TIGA, which represents the digital publishing and video games industry. But these jobs can go as fast as they arrive. Scotland needs an industrial policy that doesnrsquot depend on the vagaries of the market. And the sudden collapse of the UK tyre industry is a signal reminder of what le would be like outside the European Union."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9002159.jpg?type=article-full","title":"us-midterms-record-number-of-women-heading-to-congress-as-democrats-win-back-house","story":"Voters are on track to send at least  women to the house, surpassing the previous record of .According to data compiled by The Associated Press,  women ran for the house as major-party candidates this year.Read more:Democrats take House but Trumps grip on Senate tightensAmong the new representatives headed to the house is Jenner Wexton, a Virginia state senator who defeated incumbent Barbara Comstock in one of the most closely-watched races across the country.And Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the former Bernie Sanders organiser who won a shock primary victory over a senior house Democrat, will also head to congress.Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez The election day gains by women capped a midterm election which has been defined by the energy of women, both on the political left and right.Female candidates not only ran for office at an unprecedented rate, with several defeating white, male incumbents during their party primaries, they mobilised on the grassroots level, and played larger roles as donors than in previous election cycles.In victory speeches across the country, women acknowledged it has been a ground-breaking year.Ayanna Pressley, who became the first black woman elected to US congress from Massachusetts, said: \"I am so honoured to share both the ballot and the stage with the many visionary, bold women who have raised their hand to run for public office.\"Now, listen, I know for a fact none of us ran to make history - we ran to make change.

Some leaders like Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban have already demonstrated a willingness to roll back democratic norms and quash political opposition in order to entrench their authority.Further afield itrsquos much the same story.

Jim therefore tried to find historical accuracy as far as possible by researching contemporary documents and manuscripts that held vital evidence.\"There are certain liberties you can take, like for example the drumming used by the armies preparing for battle and that is often for dramatic effect.\"The film is billed as a \"true David versus Goliath story\" of how the great th-century \"outlaw king\" Robert the Bruce used cunning and bravery to defeat the larger and better-equipped occupying English army.At the films debut during the Toronto Film Festival last year there were a few raised eyebrows when American actor Chris Pine, who plays Bruce, appeared full-frontal naked in one scene.Directed by Oscar-nominated film-maker David Mackenzie the epic was shot in ious Scottish locations throughout  and Jim spent six months working on the diegetic soundtrack.Jim said: \"I had a meeting with David Mackenzie just a few weeks before the shoot and none of this particular aspect was planned.

We all love it.\"Gill Arrowsmith and Shirley Sinclair both thought the painting was \"fantastic\" while Annemarie Simpson thought that a similar venture in Wick would help tackle the \"towns eyesore\" buildings.While on that subject, one dissenting voice condemned the piece and said there was a \"masterpiece eyesore now in Wilson Street thanks to Caithness Horizons\".Beauty is, of course, in the eye of the beholder.The mural depicts a portrait of Thursos renowned botanist and geologist Robert Dick surrounded by a kaleidoscopic representation of the CHMAG facade and the scientists specimen collection.The bold use of line and colour based on modern urban graffiti cannot fail to be noticed just like the mural on nearby Tollemache House but is sited in a much less conspicuous space ndash the gallerys car park.CHMAGs curator Merran Gunn, who was instrumental in commissioning Delaye to create the work, said the artist had also spray painted a wall within the building as part of a show running called Graffito.His earlier piece has an explosive anime style figure punching out of the wall toward the viewer.\"Marcs work is bold and vibrant, electric colours jostle for dominance, and the new outside mural is no exception with tangerine skies set behind the historic Thurso of Robert Dick,\" said Gunn.Thursos illustrious scientist had his herbarium collection feature in an earlier work by the artist Joanne Carr which in turn is featured within Delayes mural ndash a clear case of one artist paying homage to another.\"Graffiti and street art is more relevant than ever whether it be in the art world ndash with the recent record sale of Banksys girl with a balloon ndash or here in the Highlands where graffiti has made its way onto the syllabus at Farr High School through art teacher Tracy Wilkinson,\" she said.After garnering great positive feedback from the current show Merran decided to \"have a moment of spontaneity\" and raised funds through a crowdfunding website and the Dounreay Communities Fund to commission Marc Delaye to breath some le into a fairly drab corner of the town.Tracy Dodson, commercial manager of CHMAG, said that the gallery was \"breaking boundaries\" with Graffito.\"It questions what actually constitutes art and what gets shown in a gallery. Graffito is an exhibition that celebrates artwork that is available to everyone.\"Traditionally graffiti has been seen as anti-social, fringe or even as criminal vandalism, but with an emphasis on social inclusion, we are celebrating street, pop, comic and zine work as mainstream art for hanging in our gallery.\"Tracy unabashedly declares that Graffito is \"aimed at young people and the young at heart, as a way of inviting new and future audiences to a museum and gallery experience\".\"This is a multicoloured on-the-wall exhibition devoted to all manner of graphic mark-making and breaking the boundaries of what art is all about,\" she said. \"We have also hosted street painting and comic workshops, guided gallery tours, and collaborating with our local schools and council.\"Marc Delaye is an established community projects artist with Freshpaint.org which is based on the Black Isle.\"Murals are as alive now as ever before and an excellent way to introduce art to internal and external spaces, giving iniduals and communities something that they can be proud of and enjoy each and every day,\" said Marc.The murals can be privately commissioned and can be an \"ideal means of advertising products, services, messages and campaigns\".Other exhibitors at Graffito include Andy Strachan, of Comic Creations Studios Dundee, David Robertson of Fred Egg Comics and Zu Dominak, all of whom work at the University of Dundee within the Masters degrees in Comics and Graphic Novels ndash the only course of its kind in the UK.Other exhibitors include Victor Nobis and his series Fallen Giants ndash a fantasy dream space where cities like Edinburgh rise and twist through the torso of neon lit giant figures.Graffito finishes on Saturday with a day of childrens workshops, guided tours and a colouring competition.Thursday  Nov  : PM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"November ,  at : amLonghope Leboat Museum Trust has received a £, donation from Scottish Sea Farms, which when combined with numerous donations from the Orkney community and beyond, has resulted in the total raised smash through the initial £, fundraising target originally set by the trust.

The project is supported by Orkney Islands Council’s Arts Development team.It will run on a loop eight times from pm each evening between now and Remembrance Day on November .At around .pm each night it will come to a rest on the final image — a tree, made up of the names of Orcadians who died in WWI, in a field of poppies.Glasgow-based specialists Playdead were engaged to create the film and pupils from Glaitness Primary and Kirkwall Grammar schools were involved in the creation of the work.Kevin McCrae, creative director and founder of Playdead, said: “After speaking to local people and school children about what they’d like to see and seeing what we could draw on from archives as well, we thought it would be good to develop a series of sequences which looked at the war and its impacts in Orkney from a range of angles.“Spectators will see snippets of what soldiers would have experienced, but also there are scenes which explore how farmers and school children would have been affected, as well as a look at what propaganda people here would have seen, and images from after the war of how the end of the conflict was celebrated and how it was commemorated.“There are some big technical challenges associated with projecting onto a surface like the St Magnus Cathedral. It’s such an iconic building in the heart of Kirkwall and we wanted to do justice to it # so we have done a lot of work to take into account the uneven surfaces and to choose a colour palette that would really work with the beautul red stone.The Great War: An Orkney Memorial Experience will run for the final time between pm and pm on Remembrance Day,  November.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Will the Chief Secretary work with the Secretary of State for Business to develop that proposal and work with the Business Department and the developers to see the fruition of what could be a very important part of the Government’s industrial strategy.”Responding to Mr Carmichael, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, the Rt. Hon. Liz Truss MP, said: “As part of the spending review we will be looking at the most efficient way we can achieve our carbon targets, and I am working closely with the Department of Business Energy and Industrial Strategy to do.”Commenting after the exchange, Mr Carmichael added: “The Minister’s response will do little to assure the industry that they are a priority for the Government. There was nothing in the Budget for this industry, and the Government have been working closely across departments for some time now. It is disappointing that little progress appears to be being made.“Wave and tidal power generation and new and innovative forms of producing green energy. The ambition of the industry however has not been matched by the policy framework, which continues to prevent this sector from reaching the point where it becomes commercially viable.“Renewable energy generation, particularly wave and tidal stream power are areas at which the Northern Isles is at the very forefront, and the creation of these Innovative Power Purchase Agreements would make great strides towards helping these innovative industries continue to flourish. The Minister should stop dragging her feet and start delivering for the industry.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

She said: \"Our children are subject to appalling conditions. Only today my daughter had to sit in her classroom with her coat and hat on as it was so cold. A classroom that incorporates the staff toilet and staff room. To avoid the staff room, children are having to go in and out of the classroom via outdoors.\"Dingwall and Seaforth ward councillor Angela MacLean invited childrenrsquos minister Maree Todd and the arearsquos MSP, Kate Forbes, to support a push for funding for a replacement. Ms MacLean said: \"I think the staff do a fantastic job and it is incumbent on us to try and get a solution and all work together. Having it on the capital programme with a reduced capital budget has been dficult but everyone who has seen it knows it is badly needing replaced. Whether it be Scottish Government or Highland Council we all have to work together. Given the children that go to St Clementrsquos, it does make it more urgent because they are our most vulnerable young people.\"Mrs Todd, a Ross-shire-based Highlands and Islands MSP, declared the school not fit for purpose when she visited this year.She said shersquod be \"more than happy\" to meet local councillors but added: \"As a member of the ruling administration, Ms MacLean will know that St Clementrsquos had not previously been prioritised by Highland Council in their capital spending plans.\"Since my visit to St Clementrsquos this year Highland Council has now prioritised it.

We have a whole plan of engagement throughout the year that will do that, starting later this week.\"And at the same time to listen to the public and to hear the views of what the council is doing really well, what everyone believes the council could be doing better in terms of delivering services and the important part of that is that we go across the Highlands to hear those views.\"The first thing is about listening to people, the second most important thing is about going back and saying to people lsquoyou said and we willrsquo or lsquowe are not able to becausersquo.\"The councilis due tostart a \"public budget engagement process\" tomorrow, designed to help the local authority make decisions to balance its books.\"It is really important that we listen throughout the month of November,\" Mrs Manson said. \"Then we will go back and give feedback on what the suggestions are.\"Mrs Manson was upbeat about the local authorityrsquos financial woes that have seen it stumble from one unpopular cutback to another over several months amid a flurry of resignation threats from within the administration.\"I am quite positive about our budget situation here in the Highlands ndash I think we are in a fair place,\" she said. \"There are places where we will be able to make efficiencies and our officer team and our members are working on that all the time, day-in, day-out behind the scenes.\"However, Mrs Manson did accept that \"there are some challenging areas in there, such as what our priorities for resource and for spend are, and I think it is very important to take a transparent approach so that when we do take decisions in February [when the council budget is decided] we can actually evidence it comes after listening to people.\"One of the answers to those challenges, according to the chief executive, is to rely on the \"many talented staff who believe in the values of public service and that we are here to make a dference\" and to capitalise on an upsurge in community involvement.\"I genuinely believe that many, many people that I have been speaking to over the last few months in dferent parts of the Highlands have really good ideas,\" she said. \"They see where the council can become more efficient.\"But equally so, I think that people can be more understanding of the challenges that we face.\"The local authority has made pound. million of savings since  and raised council tax by three per cent in each of the last two years.Budget leader Alister Mackinnon said: \"We have to do more with less money and our costs are rising for things like fuel, pay and cost of living.\"We are working with services to produce comprehensive information on our current spending profiles, to identy where there are opportunities for efficiencies and any commercial opportunities. Our focus will be on directing our resources to those areas which will give us the best outcomes and deliver value for money.\"Depute budget leader Matthew Reiss said: \"It will not be easy to find more savings on top of those we have already made. Income generation, commercialisation and efficiencies become even more vital in this context in order to protect essential services and we do not have the luxury of the signicant reserves we once had to give us any room for manoeuvre.\"It is undoubtedly the case that there will be very hard decisions to make and we will begin a process of engagement to help us make the right decisions and do the best we can.\"Thursday  Nov  : PMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Yesterday’s vote on a motion giving ‘unequivocal’ backing to the second referendum on Brexit was one of those which may yet have a long term impact. The nascent campaign for another referendum has been running almost since it was announced that Britain had voted to leave the European Union. However, recently, the slick branding of a ‘People’s Vote’ and a huge march in London means that the movement for a second vote is being taken seriously for the first time. The motion passed with the support of the SNP, Lib Dems, and Greens, while the Conservative Party opposed it. All but two of the Labour Party MSPs abstained. Impact In terms of the obvious impact, a vote in the devolved parliament is, of course, unlikely to make any immediate changes to the Brexit process. In both Brussels and London, negotiators are determined to reach a final deal on the UK’s terms of departure ahead of a potential emergency summit in mid-December. : Kenny MacAskill: It’s game on for IndyrefHowever, the fact the Scottish Parliament presented a genuine cross-party effort on the ‘People’s Vote’, is sure to be a factor as the countdown to a deal continues in earnest. Theresa May has stuck to her twin mantras that ‘Brexit means Brexit’ and that any second vote would be a betrayal of British voters. Holyrood’s vote, along with the hundreds of thousands who marched demanding a People’s Vote last month, is important momentum for those seeking to halt or delay Brexit. It might not be enough to stop Britain’s departure in its tracks, but it could embolden MPs to vote down a final deal that is struck by Theresa May,one is at all. Nicola Sturgeon’s JourneyNicola Sturgeon hasn’t always backed a second referendum on Brexit – in fact, it was a potential second referendum on Scottish independence that the First Minister was keen to pursue. There was precious little effort from the SNP leader in the  months after the June  vote on a People’s Vote, or a vote on the final deal. Instead, the First Minister said even as the dust settled on June , after the Brexit referendum, that a second constitutional vote in Scotland was likely. : Facebook removes pro-independence websiteAfter the SNP suffered signicant losses in the snap general election of  against parties running on an anti-independence , it was clear a change of tact was required. In October of , Ms Sturgeon said that the prospect of a second Brexit referendum could become ‘irresistible’talks on a deal stalled. Just over a year on, the First Minister has gone from that somewhat tepid response to arguably the most senior politician backing a second referendum. The ‘I’ WordMs Sturgeon’s conversion to the People’s Vote causedoesn’t mean that she has abandoned independence. The First Minister may have put her plans on ‘pause’ after the aforementioned setback in last year’s election, but backing a ‘People’s Vote’ and backing independence are not mutually exclusive. Her opponents in Holyrood, with the exception of the Green Party, are still firmly anti-independence, however, and even those who back a second vote on Brexit are unlikely to feel the same way about a re-run of the  referendum. Yesterday’s vote might not move the dial in terms of independence , but it could harden resolve among Unionists to ensure that the SNP doesn’t use Brexit to boost the independence cause. In Ms Sturgeon’s own party, there remain those who believe that backing a second Brexit referendum support is the wrong option, and internal SNP stre can only damage the independence cause. Yesterday’s vote may not feel momentous, but we could yet come to look back on it as a potential turning point in Scotland’s relationship with the EU, and the Union.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4823773.1541244373!/image/image.jpg","title":"jo brand interview the comedian on bake off an extra slice born lippy and bringing nativity the musical to scotland","story":"With a guide to le, Bake Off and a role in a musical, Jo Brand tackles le one gag at a timeJo Brand looks like butter wouldn’t melt. In a bright apricot top and carefully made up, she’s surrounded by our favourite foodies as she presents another serving of The Great British Bake Off: An Extra Slice, the spin off from the ratings busting TV show. She couldn’t be more rehabilitated from the days of her vilication as the man-hating, acerbic lesbian stand-up she never actually was, to the favourite aunty now welcomed into the nation’s sitting rooms to serve up their feelgood comfort food TV. “I think I’m seen as a bit more fluffy now,” says the -year-old in her pleasantly dry laconic drawl. “A lot of the press thought when I got married, ‘oh she can’t be a man hating lesbian after all’”, she says, sounding asshe’s scuffing the toes of her Docs on the ground as she drags herself all the way to double home economics. As for the sartorial makeover, Brand is happy to ditch her matching black T-shirt and leggings for pastels on TV because “they make me. No, they don’t, but my thing is to fight bigger battles. I wouldn’t select colour for myself butsomeone  does, I’ll wear it. And they do your make-up too,” she says, sounding pleased, as she loves a bit of lippy, and an aubergine tint in her hair. Because despite the rebranding, Brand has retained her ability to subvert expectations, as well as her feminist or left-wing principles, along with her talent for devastating one-liners. She’s been making us laugh for  years, since Channel ’s late night comedy show Saturday Live in the late s, after she’d already made her name as the heckle-proof deadpan ‘Sea Monster’ on London’s comedy circuit. Her own shows Jo Brand’s Big Splash and Jo Brand Through The Cakehole followed and she became a regular list on Have I Got News For You, QI, Would I Lie To You and Countdown. Moving into writing, she penned and starred in NHS comedy Getting On, for which she won a Bafta to add to her four British Comedy Awards and most recently, social services satire Damned. Her several books include an autobiography and novels, one of which she adapted into this year’s film The More You Ignore Me, starring Sheridan Smith. And there’s her latest book, the amusingly useful le guide, Born Lippy: How to Do Female. All of which amounts to the sort of career that leads to you being called ‘national treasure’, so how does she feel about that  “It’s not my favourite thing because it limits your behaviour. I don’t hate it, it’s quite funny, but I would reserve judgement because I don’t want to behave like a national treasure for the rest of my le. I might want to do things that don’t fit into that category…”Such as… back in the Extra Slice studio it’s dessert week and Jo is revisiting the contestant’s chocolate spheres. The trick is to pour hot chocolate sauce over and watch it melt daintily, but an impatient Brand speeds things along with a tenderising mallet, inadvertently also smashing the white china plate underneath. “Sorry,” she says, unconvincingly, as the guests and studio audience cheer her on. This national treasure still has an irreverent bite.Brand loves presenting Bake Off: An Extra Slice despite admitting thatwe shouted ‘Show Us Your Bakes!’ at her, she’d come up with... “not much – a very plain sponge or a rhubarb crumble. The problem I have is making it look nice and Bake Off is as much about art as baking.” Did she take the hosting gig for the comic potential of soggy bottoms, cracks and buns then “To be honest, I did it because they asked me, and I love its happy audience, funny  and – unintentionally terrying sometimes – audience baking. And I liked the format. It’s a bit like Have I Got News For You, presenting, with a  of funny people and an audience.“I’m doing another HIGNFY soon, hosting this time, and it’s like promotion, being a grown up,” she says.The  show allowed Brand to demonstrate her more reasonable than raging approach to feminism when she calmly reprimanded a dismissive Ian Hislop and the all-male  for downplaying sexual harassment in the House of Commons, by saying, “For women,you’re constantly being harassed, that builds up and wears you down.”“I really like Ian a lot and have known him for years and I was really surprised, but I felt I had to say something. Because it’s a creeping thing, a collective set of experiences that wear you down. It’s not a one off touching your bum, or ‘you look gorgeous’, it builds up.” As the mother of teenage daughters, Maisie and Eliza, Brand is used to being uncool, but for once they were impressed. “They loved it because I was trending on Twitter for three months. And I’m pleased it got the attention it did. My instinct was to speak quietly because it’s such a cliché about feminists, that they’re just a load of shouty women with no sense of humour.” At which point it seems apposite to insert one of the jokes from Born Lippy: How many Feminists Does it Take to Change a Lightbulb Do it yourself, you lazy bastard.Things have changed for women in comedy too, for the better according to Brand as attitudes have moved on. “For a long time male comedy was described as being lots of dferent styles – Eddie Izzard did surreal, others did puns – and women were just ‘women doing comedy’, but these days women are allowed to have all kinds of dferent personalities and styles.” Away from the telly, Brand is back on stage and heading for Edinburgh, with Birmingham Repertory Theatre’s Nativity! The Musical. Thanks to Maisie and Eliza, she has been to her share of nativity plays and is a big fan of the Nativity! films. “What you do is totally focus on what your child is playing, eventhey’re a rock or sheep, and for my money, the more mistakes the better.“I’m playing a newspaper critic who starts off cynical and is swept away with the show because the kids are so great.” Being self-deprecating, Brand is downplaying her own starring role in a school nativity, when she played not ‘Bethlehem’, as she’s claimed, but Mary. “Well, I remember virtually nothing about it, apart from wearing a white head thing and a blue dress. It was the s and traditional – no space ships – they didn’t give Mary an awful lot to say. Mary doesn’t say a word in the Bible, it’s all Joseph. And she was very pregnant, wasn’t she, so she’d probably just have said ‘My God I’m tired.’”Born in South London in July  to an engineer and social worker, with an older and younger brother, Josephine Grace Brand grew up in Kent then moved schools at , hated it and started to skive, smoke and drink. In Born Lippy she doesn’t hold back describing her headstrong teen years with stories of the time her dad punched her heroin addict boyfriend, or when he threw all her clothes on a bonfire after he and her mother caught underage Brand coming out of Emmanuelle, stoned, accompanying seven men, the incident that prompted her leaving the family home. Moving in with her posh heroin addict boyfriend, she went on the pill and put on four stone, becoming the spiky haired, thick-skinned ‘Sea Monster’, an alternative comedian who faced down the hecklers with her deadpan drawl. Ask Brandshe regrets leaving home as a teenager, she demurs.“No… I would say I probably did the right thing actually because I don’t think things would have been any better at home and to some extent, my leaving added to the weight that made my father get some help. I needed to get out just because we were in one of those awful relationships where you can’t work it out and be calm.” While honing her comedy she trained as a psychiatric nurse and worked at an emergency department where knives, guns and abuse were a reality and made the clubs look tame. “When you’re a stand-up comedian and people are off their heads, you get a lot of abuse. But the manic phase of bipolar disorder is way more eloquent than the average drunk bellowing ‘f*** off you fat cow’”. Brand’s ten years working as a psychiatric nurse provided her with background for her sitcoms satirising le at the sharp end of the caring professions and she acknowledges that her father’s struggle with depression may have influenced her original choice of career.Set in a geriatric ward the BBC Four series Getting On, which she co-wrote and co-starred in three series of, was directed by Peter Capaldi and did for the NHS what The Thick Of It did for politics, as well as winning her a Bafta in  for Best TV Comedy Performance. Meanwhile Damned, the second series of which screened this year on Channel  is set in a social services office, and stars Brand, and her friends Alan Davies and co-writer Morwenna Banks.“They say write about what you know then you don’t have to spend a lot of time researching to make it relevant. That’s why I haven’t done any dramas about scaffolding. I stick to stuff I do know about, mental health, nursing, social work, and not many people are doing stuff about that. I have experienced a lot of le. My favourite comedy is the kind where you see that, where people have had proper jobs before they came into it. It adds something.” Mental illnessis also dealt with in The More You Ignore Me, a novel she turned into a film, set in s rural England. Starring Sheridan Smith as Gina, a schizophrenic mum who is hospitalised after becoming obsessed with a local weatherman, it also features Mark Addy, Sheila Hancock, Ricky Tomlinson and Brand herself.“The central thing is how unglamorous it is to be ill like that, and its impact on the family. In the s it was something that was kept private, shameful. My dad suffered depression from his teenage years and didn’t seek help until his mid-fties. It’s unrecognisable now in comparison, and the power of the person seeking help has risen exponentially. “A few of my friends who are psychiatric nurses saw it and they’re hard-bitten cynical people, so to make them cry and laugh too, I was satisfied. I couldn’t believe I had the power to move people with something I’d written.” Her latest book Born Lippy: How to Do Female is moving too, as well as funny, and most of all useful. A collection of all the things Brand wishes she’d known, things she’s learnt, and things she hopes for the future, among the chapters are, How to Manage a Bully, Your Family And How To Survive It, Having Fun, Not Having Fun, How Not to Fall in Love, Feminism, a Rebranding and Staying Sane.There’s also handy practical advice for you to try. Can’t get on with your toxic family  Lower your expectations. People making you unhappy  Ultimately, you can walk away. Nervous at parties  Try some ice-breakers: “What’s the most violent incident you’ve ever witnessed ” Or “What’s the worst lie you’ve ever told ” Find yourself confronted with a flasher  Shout “That looks like a penis only smaller,” and for women faced with that old favourite: “You obviously hate men,” try “No I don’t, it’s just you”, while “You need a good shag”, can be dispensed with “I’ll look where then.”Hitchhiking alone at night, falling in love with a heroin addict or smashing up an abusive driver’s windscreen when you have PMT  Read Brand’s own experience and it might put you off. Although she’s conflicted about that last one. “I’m not advocating violence,” she says, “butyou do suffer from PMT be aware you might go there one day. I used to control it  per cent of the time, and when I didn’t, I tried to appreciate it. And it was always towards things, never people, and that’s not quite so bad.“The book is all stuff that was familiar to me, that happened to me or was interesting to me. Hence the lack of a chapter on motor mechanics. I wrote it for my daughters in a way.“If you’re a comedian rule number one is ‘be funny’. There are serious bits but a lot of it is tongue in cheek. I don’t like to give advice and I think the best way is to tell people stories about what went wrong for you and say,you can avoid doing that you’ll be better off.” Brand is keen to write more novels – “so I don’t have to get dressed” – but hasn’t lost her love of stand-up. The problem is being away too much from the South London home she shares with husband of  years, Bernie Bourke, a psychiatric nurse, her daughters and cats Louis and Dotty. Script-writing and TV work suit her at the moment, but she’s never been one for five or ten year plans. “As things come up I think do I want to do it or not ” she says.And she decided she did want to do the Edinburgh and London legs of the Nativity! The Musical tour as she “likes Scotland”. Speaking of which, Brand was one of the  celebrities who signed an open letter in theto the people of Scotland urging them to stay in the UK in . Does she still think that, in the light of the Brexit vote “Well, I think so, just because I like Scotland,” she says. “But to be honest, I don’t blame you for wanting to leave because I wouldI was in Scotland. You have policies that are good on health, such as free care for the elderly, and it’s more caring. “As for Brexit, I would support another referendum because I think we are much better suited being in Europe than on our own, but it looks asaround half of the people are delighted by Brexit, and that’s quite a dficult thing to live with. “A bit of me thinks ‘you’ve made your bed, see what happens when you haven’t got enough people for the health service, doctors, teachers…’ Let’s see what happens. I think we are in the last chance saloon andwe do leave, I’m not sure how it’s going to be,” she says, sounding resigned. Butanyone should be tempted to say to her, “Cheer up love, it may never happen!” I refer you to one of her handy general purpose put-downs, “Keep talking and it will.”@JanetChristieJo Brand will appear in Nativity!

But at the risk of taking myself far more seriously than anyone  appears to, it feels appropriate to point out that this is my last column for The Scotsman.After a decade of covering Holyrood and politics more generally for this venerable newspaper and its sister paper Scotland on Sunday, it is time to move on to pastures new. So, for me at leastit feels like a time for reflection. These days  years at the same place of work is a reasonably long stretch. Indeed, another two years can be added to that total when a period as health correspondent – a very good fit for someone as clean living as me – for Scotland on Sunday around the millennium is added to the ledger of le.All told, one quarter of my le – so far – has been spent working for Scotsman publications, a statistic that is of no interest to anyone except me.Nevertheless it has been a great privilege to work for such august titles and with such talented colleagues, especially during a period that has included this newspaper’s th anniversary and some pivotal moments in the political history of Scotland and the UK.When it comes to the latter, it is dficult to look past the way that two referenda – one on Scottish independence in  and the  vote on European withdrawal – have dominated politics to the exclusion of almost everything .This has provided plenty of drama, excitement even, to write about. But by their nature, those two votes have also thrown up constitutional discussions of interminable tedium.And more worryingly, in my view, they have stoked the politics of ision. The binary nature of debates on Scottish independence and Brexit has often created an unpleasant environment where abuse has flourished and where people of opposing political views have treated each other with a lack of respect.: Tributes as Margo Macdonald MSP dies aged That has been the striking characteristic of how modern politics has often been conducted over the last few years. Of course, the hurly burly of political le will always throw up disagreements. People are entitled to exchange firmly held views. And it is true that when conducted in a respectful manner, robust arguments are the best way to back up those views and cajole others.But resorting to tribal factions of “them” and “us” at all costs can prove a destructive way to conduct public le. Therefore the nastier moments during the big votes on the future of Scotland and the UK still loom large in the memory of the last few years.However, fortunately, there have been a great many other moments where more uplting sentiments have been expressed by well-known figures in public le.There is a poignant irony that one of the most memorable of these moments occurred on one of the saddest days at Holyrood.The occasion was the memorial service for Margo MacDonald, a politician who held passionate views in favour of Scottish independence but was universally admired across the parties for the way she conducted herself and her politics. Those of us privileged enough to be present at the service at the Scottish Parliament’s old home on the Mound are unlikely to forget the powerful eulogy given by her husband Jim Sillars, a man with his own strong views in favour of Scottish independence and Brexit.: Obituary: Margo MacDonald, independent MSPDelivered just a few months before the independence vote of September  , it was a very personal tribute to a we, mother and grandmother. It also addressed the isions which are the inevitable consequences of the sort of hard-fought political campaign that Scotland was engaged in at the time.“Up until her last two days, we discussed the ision within this nation, and what it will do with the sovereignty it holds in those  hours between am and pm, on the th September,” Mr Sillars said. “At one minute past pm, it must bring those isions to an end and, whatever the result, seek a unity of purpose. So, in my final remarks I bring a message from Margo for all engaged in this campaign. There will be harsh statements on both sides. The debate will be fierce. There will be verbal wounds inflicted. Butwe conduct ourselves in the run-up to th September the Margo MacDonald way, the isions will be much easier to heal. The Margo MacDonald way is to recognise that you are dealing with opponents, not enemies, not with ogres but people, with whom you can disagree but must do so without malice – and where the exercise of mutual respect is a civilised corrective to uncivilised abuse, which can so easily mutate into an intense and irreversible corrosive dislike.“Margo wasn’t a Saint. She was human. If she could refuse to sunder friendships with people who fundamentally opposed her on the issue upon which she spent her le, then so can we all. If she could debate without venom, so can we all. If she could respect the right of the other side to their opinions, so can we all. That’s what she wanted me to say.”At a time when there is so much uncertainty and ision over Brexit and a second Scottish independence referendum is the subject of intense discussion, it is instructive to hark back to Margo’s memorial service. In these fevered times, her widower’s words seemmore relevant than ever and I hope it is not too pretentious to suggest we would all do well to observe the Margo MacDonald way.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4813809.1541617956!/image/image.jpg","title":"scotland can solve poverty if it chooses to do so neil cowan","story":"The arrival in Scotland today of Philip Alston, the United Nations# Special Rapporteur on Extreme Poverty and Human Rights, could not be timelier. Visiting as part of his inquiry into poverty in the UK, he comes at a point when, for the first time in decades, poverty is on the increase in Scotland and more and more people struggle to get by.Today also marks one year since – in a moment of rare political unanimity – every MSP from every party in the Scottish Parliament voted to pass the Child Poverty Act. The Act underlined the cross-party view that in a society which believes in justice and compassion, it is simply not right that one million people, including one in four children, are living in the grip of poverty, and set ambitious child poverty reduction targets to be met by . There is no escaping the fact that UK Government decisions will make meeting these targets more challenging. The benefits freeze is trapping people in poverty. The two-child limit is unjust and removing support from families who need it most. The sanctions regime is harmful in every way possible. And Universal Credit –implemented in its current form – will pull more people into poverty.: Almost half of inner Glasgow children living in povertyBut we can recognise the challenges faced whilst also recognising the power we have to overcome them. In the year since the Act was passed, progress has already been made. The Scottish Government has committed to introducing a new income supplement for families on low incomes, and the Scottish social security system – with dignity, fairness and respect at its heart – has been created.This progress acts as proof there are decisions we can take in Scotland that can and will help to loosen the grip of poverty on people’s lives. The Scottish Parliament was re-convened to fulfil that very role to enable Scotland to choose dferent policies and pursue a dferent path. In truth, for people on low incomes it matters not which government provides the support that unlocks them from poverty but just that this support is provided.: One million Scots now living in poverty as austerity bitesSo the anniversary of the Act offers us the opportunity to look forward and set out what other choices we can take to tackle poverty in Scotland. That’s why today the Poverty Alliance has published Loosening the Grip: An Agenda for Action, outlining some of the decisions we can make in the years ahead to ensure that everyone in Scotland has a decent standard of living. We can lt tens of thousands of children out of poverty by topping up child benefit. We can continue to increase the value of the benefits that have been devolved so that they meet the Minimum Income Standard, which is the income level that members of the public think is necessary for enabling a decent standard of living. We can reduce food insecurity by investing in the Scottish Welfare Fund and supporting local services. And we can reduce costs for low-income families by expanding concessionary travel for people on low incomes, continuing to invest in childcare entitlements, and taking more radical action to reduce fuel poverty.These are decisions that can prevent people from having to choose between heating their home and paying their rent, that can free people from restrictions our economy places on them, and give people control over their own lives. These decisions, and many others, are within our gt in Scotland. If we are to meet the targets set one year ago and finally solve poverty in Scotland, then we must take them.Neil Cowan is policy and parliamentary officer at Poverty Alliance©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4826600.1541694800!/image/image.jpg","title":"scottish labour critical over lack of support for debt recovery policy","story":"Scottish Labour has accused the government of being #cruel# by failing to support his party#s bid to shorten the time councils and government can chase people for debt.Party leader Richard Leonard said governmental bodies and local authorities currently have up to  years before they begin pursing someone for money owed.His party wants to cut this to five years but the First Minister said such a move would hurt debtors.: Richard Leonard: This is how we can fix Scotland’s broken economySpeaking at First Minister’s Questions, Mr Leonard said: “We think it is unfair that a person can be chased for a debt  years after it was incurred, that they had no knowledge of and when no previous action has been taken.”He gave an example of a parent who stopped receiving child tax credits almost  years ago who was recently given a bill for almost £,.He said Citizens’ Advice Scotland, Money Advice Scotland and debt charity Step Change are among those backing Labour’s proposal.He added: “The system as it stands is not only unnecessary, it is cruel.”He said his party would put forward their proposal to change the law in a stage three debate on the Prescription Bill at Holyrood later on Thursday and questioned why SNP MSPs are not planning to back it.Nicola Sturgeon said her party were not supporting Labour’s proposal as advice from local authority organisation Cosla indicated it would “hurt debtors the most”, since it could lead to higher repayment instalments which could cause greater hardship to those who owe.She said she hoped all organisations would “act sensibly” regarding the type of cases Mr Leonard had raised but said the Bill is “not the place” to legislate for shortening the timeframe as no dedicated public consultation has been held.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.The project, costing around £ million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in .

It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep itfor the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.I also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last  years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.Some parents and staff have had a look through the new building at dferent stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed. I like many other parents and carers look forward to the day its complete and our daughters and sons can enjoy the help and encouragement from staff to live their lives to the best of their ability..."},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"Marc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August. It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le.

LoLThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.Based on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"whalsays new research arrives in lerwick for first time ","story":"The Research leaves Symbister with bunting flying as she heads for Lerwick on Saturday.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested. In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests. Hopefully he can make an eye-catching debut to match his name.: : : : : : : :Family, friends, work colleagues and a good number of former footballers gathered on Friday to say farewell to Alastair Johnston from Cunningsburgh.When I first met him in the early s he was still an excellent player. He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

A lot of visitor experiences are going to be marred.\"Adam Gough, CairnGorm Mountain representative, who had told of the need for the slopes aimed at beginners and intermediates, was clearly stunned by the rejection.Asked immediately after the decisionan appeal was likely, he said that a statement would be issued later.CNPA head planner Gavin Miles had stressed from the outset the application had to be determined on planning issues ndash landscaping impacts in particular ndash and not on its commercial merits, which had generated much argument.He said the business case was a matter for Natural Retreats.Mr Miles told the committee the articial slope would not extend the ski area in any signicant way but the footprint of obvious development would increase.He commented: \"Initially the team were very concerned about the landscaping but as more information was given to us by the applicants it was considered that in the long term planting would mitigate against that. There would be an impact in the short term of the dry ski slope.\"Whether it will ever be an attraction in its own right and generate signicant income, who knows, but that is not a consideration of the planning process.\"In effect it is a ersication of business in this area and therefore acceptable andit was to strengthen the stability of CairnGorm Mountain then thats a good thing.\"He said there were some hefty planning conditions attached to control the development.CairnGorm Mountains representative said some  per cent of total visits to the resort were in just three winter months of the year.Mr Gough had told the committee Natural Retreats had explored several options in depth to remove the reliance on winter income including mountain biking and zip-wiring but this plan was the most viable at this time.He said it was imperative the attraction can provide year-round employment in order to retain its best staff. This site was the most sheltered for the ski slope and close to other facilities without impacting on other slopes, he said. It could also be used for tubing and other activities.Mr Gough acknowledged the clamour for better ski uplt at CairnGorm which has been overtaken as Scotlands most popular ski resort.He said: \"We would like nothing more than to be able to upgrade ski infrastructure to improve the snowsports experience for everyone but this has to be a long term process built on solid commercial foundations.\"He said the slope could be in operation for  per cent of the year outwith winter and ice would not be a problem as it was easy practice to break it up.ABA secretary Alan Brattey said history showed articial slopes at Scottish resorts including the Lecht, Glenshee and Glencoe had not worked.He also said a bright green Snowflex slope would stand out like a sore thumb and no consideration had been given by the operator to an alternative by market leader, Neveplast, which could be camouflaged.He said that of just over  votes on Facebook on the application,  per cent were against it.Tessa Jones, of the Badenoch and Strathspey Conservation Group, asked the committee: \"What are you going to say to the world about this peatland destruction \"Committee member Dave Fallows moved the application be refused and he was seconded by Carolyn Caddick.He said he appreciated the efforts to mitigate against the ski slope but said: \"It cant possibly soften in the long term the impact that this makes on the area.\"Mrs Caddick said: \"We are going to see it for miles and miles around.\"Peter Argyle had moved in favour of the application saying he had faith in the planning officers conditions but was not supported.Mr Brattey said after the vote: \"This was very much the right decision and wed like to congratulate the planning committee for deciding to reject this planning application against the advice of their planning officials.\"We very much hope that common sense will now prevail and that the plans for the Ptarmigan Building will be dropped.\"We are left to wonder just exactly why HIE allowed their tenant to take such a madcap plan all the way to the CNPAs planning committee who were very decisive in their rejection of it.\"He said HIE should ert the pound million to new uplt. \"The hill business requires to be funicular proofed as soon as possible,\" said Mr Brattey.Thursday  Nov  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118063.jpg","title":"Green light for Dalwhinnie quarry work","story":"Gavin MusgroveA quarry operator has said that measures are in place to allay concerns that their excavation plans could lead to a surge in speeding lorries in a Badenoch village.Leithshas been given the green light by the Cairngorms National Park Authorityrsquos planning committee to recommence operations at the site at Carn Dhomhnuill Bhain on the doorstep of Dalwhinnie.The company has said that it is not contingent on winning a contract to supply aggregate to the dualling of the A but that the produce will be used for housebuilding and other local construction projects.The firm was granted temporary permission for  yearsatthe CNPArsquoslatest planning committee meeting at Boat of Garten Community Hall.Production will be stepped up dramatically at the quarry around one mile north of Dalwhinnie by the A.It was previously in operation up to .But now Leiths has permission to extend the site from two to  hectares.

Importantly that means that visitors will be travelling through the Sleat peninsula, where communities have worked long and hard to build up a viable industry.“In the midst of the important debates about ferries and not least the importance of the MV Coruisk to the Armadale-Mallaig crossing, it’s important to celebrate the huge contribution that RET has made to the island economies.”If CalMac#s league tables of ferry route usage tell us anything, it is that moving the MV #Coruisk# from its purpose-built harbours on the busiest crossing in the north-west remains inexplicable.If the two tables of passengers and coaches highlight anything , it is that CalMac badly needs its two new ferries from the Clyde to be delivered according to their revised schedule and not experience a third delay.It is a mild surprise, as Kate Forbes MSP says, to discover that more people sail between Mallaig and Armadale in Skye than between Stornoway and Ullapool and that more coaches cross the Sound of Sleat than make any other journey on CalMac#s itinerary.It is good news not only for Sleat but for the whole of the island. It is good news which is tempered by the fact that this busy, bustling route is now served only by whatever ships CalMac can spare, when the tide permits them, while its purpose-built vessel, the MV #Coruisk#, which can dock at Armadale in all tidal conditions, is ploughing between Mull and Oban  nautical miles away.If CalMac had the ships, Mallaig Armadale would be dependable and therefore even busier, Mull would have a vessel of its own and almost everybody would be happy.CalMac do not have the ships in large part because two new deep-sea vessels which were commissioned in  from Ferguson Marine Engineering at Port Glasgow show no sign of turning up for duty.One of them is due to operate on CalMac#s busiest passenger route between Ardrossan and Arran. The other is to work between Uig, Tarbert and Lochmaddy, which last year carried almost , people.The delivery date for those two ships has been put back twice. On each occasion, the £ million contract to Ferguson Marine — which is the property of one of the Scottish Government#s friends, advisors and allies, the billionaire tax exile Jim McColl — was topped up by a multi-million-pound handout from the public purse.If all was on schedule at least one of those ships would now be in service, and CalMac would have substantially more leeway in manoeuvring its fleet from one part of the west coast to another. They might even be able to keep the #Coruisk# on the Sound of Sleat.They are very far from on schedule. The new Ardrossan Arran ferry is now supposed to be delivered next summer, and the new Uig Tarbert Lochmaddy ship in spring .Will they be delivered  Or will we experience a third delay, which would certainly plunge CalMac into even greater chaos as its ageing fleet breaks down or requires routine maintenance somewhere in the Baltic Those are important questions. As we reported last week, the chief executive of Outer Hebrides Tourism, Rob MacKinnon, has criticised the Scottish Government for a lack of any #tangible action# to address the islands# ferry problems.The Scottish transport ministry, said Mr MacKinnon, must #pursue all feasible options to increase ferry capacity in both the long and the short term for the benefit of both visitors and islanders#.As we report this week, Labour#s Western Isles# candidate Alison MacCorquodale has added her voice to the many demanding to know the precise terms of the private finance initiative deal which has bound the Scottish Government into using just one ferry for all passengers and freight between Ullapool and Stornoway, with unacceptable consequences.Ullapool Stornoway may not yet carry as many tourists as Mallaig Armadale. But it is the definition of a leline service, with , passengers last year, many of whom found themselves unable to squeeze onto an overbooked #Loch Seaforth#.We should be told how and why one of our biggest and most important ferries came to be owned by Lloyds Bank.We should be toldJim McColl is going to deliver two badly-needed ships at the third time of asking.It is not enough to say, as does transport minister Michael Matheson, that building CalMac#s ferries is #providing vital support to our shipbuilding industry#The way things are going, building and rebuilding CalMac#s ferries will keep Scottish shipbuilding alive well into the next decade. Their higher purpose, and Mr Matheson#s job is to provide vital support to the Hebridean ferry service.

This motion was agreed. earlier this week, the chair of the EDI committee, Councillor Allan Henderson said that the council was putting pressure on the Scottish Government to have the route classed as a trunk road. However, during Thursday’s meeting Councillor Cockburn was quick to dismiss the likelihood of this happening: “Who in their right mind would take  miles of the worst road in the Highlands” He said. “After six and a half years we still only have two options… and the delays and the consequences for the wider community have been absolutely shocking.”The SNP member for Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh also went on to question the tendering process behind the work at the bypass, saying: “Was it necessary to shut the road during the day  I believe there was a tender on the table that would have allowed the road to open during the day.”He went on to argue that the council needed to release money straight away to enable design work on the replacement options for the current bypass to begin, adding that it was a matter of urgency due to the risks identied in the  annual sloping report which detailed four very high-risk rock slopes at the Stromeferry bypass.In response to Councillor Cockburn, the council’s head of infrastructure Colin Howell said that the council did receive an alternative tender from a contractor who said they could carry out the required works at night, however, Mr Howell said the cost was signicant and due to concerns about these plans it was decided it would be wise for some of the work to be undertaken during the day.Mr Howell said that while there were ongoing issues with rockfalls and managing slopes, he believed that the council had done a good job. He went on to add that the council were prioritising the high-risk slopes and currently working on the cost and details in relation to stabilising those areas which would be delivered at the next EDI committee meeting. He added that there were “three optimum solutions” in respect to replacement options and said that the committee had “decided to leave those three on the table# and seek dialogue with Scottish Government for funding. He said: “The administration is looking for feedback, we are working on slopes with high risks and will come back to the next EDI with the costing.”Councillor Derek MacLeod described the current situation as “one episode in a long, long history of problems with the route#, and in contrast to his fellow ward member, Councillor Cockburn, he argued that the route should be “trunked between Auchtertyre and Garve” as he believed it to be strategic in linking the ferry points of Uig and UllapoolCouncil Leader Margaret Davidson told the committee that she would be meeting with the Transport Secretary Michael Matheson and would report back “what options have been put on the table.” Councillor Davidson said that the council were “acutely aware of what’s needed” and were working towards a long-term sustainable option for Stromeferry. She also thanked the public for their cooperation during the works and the council staff for their efforts."},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27480  ","story":" Mícheál Mac Donncha by Eva Ó Cathaoir. Published by LilliputPress, Dublin. Price hardback €. Like Fenianism itself, this book hadmodest beginnings but grew to cover all of Ireland, a good part ofthe globe and half a century. Eva Ó Cathaoir began a study ofFenians in Tipperary which has evolved into one of the mostcomprehensive and important scholarly works on the Irish RepublicanBrotherhood yet published. If the film ‘Black ’ is a storyof revenge set during the Great Hunger, the phenomenon of Fenianismarose to a great extent as a political response to that colossalcrime against the Irish people by the landlord system and the Britishregime. But there was far more involved than simple vengeance.Fenianism was a democratic movement, consciously in the tradition ofthe United Irish leaders of the s, and rejecting privilege andclass distinction. In  the IRB staged the funeral of TerenceBellew McManus and brought many thousands of people onto the streets.The working-class character of the movement was clear from thisdemonstration and the author quotes the following from the haughtysnobs of the ‘KilkennyModerator’, lamenting the absence of the‘great and the good’ from the procession:“When we look back to the O’Connellgatherings or even the Young Ireland ‘Confederation’ assemblies,and remember the array of names, of borough magistrates, professionalmen and traders, accustomed to put forward as representing Kilkennyon such occasions, we cannot but view in the most ludicrous light,this miserable farce of an ‘imposing demonstration.’” The recent visit of the Pope reviveddebate among Irish republicans about the role of the Roman CatholicChurch in Irish politics. This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.Students of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women. The book covers all aspects ofFenianism and a great part of its value is in its first Appendix‘Biographies of Munster and Kilkenny Fenians’ which providesbrief profiles of , rank and file Fenians. I have never beforeseen any ‘Roll of Honour’ of the IRB but this is now providedwith a list of ‘Fenian Casualties -’ while the book closes,appropriately, with a list of Fenian monuments in Ireland andManchester. This is a beautully produced book anda credit to the publishers Lilliput Press and of course to theauthor.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27481  ","story":"• Mícheál Mac Donncha and Robert Ballagh Mícheál Mac Donnchaby Robert Ballagh published by Head of Zeus. back in the late s. For anartist of his stature this was courageous, dependent as he was, tosome extent, on commissions from people who, to say the least, wouldnot be subscribers to our paper. But this was an artist who went hisown way in art and who acted as a citizen with a conscience in anIreland where State-imposed censorship distorted not only politicaldebate but also national self-image. For Robert Ballaghcreative work and active citizenship have gone hand in hand all hisle. This is depicted in his double self-portrait ‘Upstairs No.’,one of the many illustrations of his work in this superbly writtenand beautully presented book. It is not a standard autobiographywith chapters set out in chronological order beginning with genealogyand ending with this week’s news. As you would expect from Ballagh,he takes a dferent approach, starting towards the later years andcircling through his days in no particular order before coming backto the present. More than that, he weaves narrative, anecdote andreflection together seamlessly and conversationally showing a skillwith words akin to his skill with brushes. He has a story to tell ofa very ied le, from his unusual family background to his time asa showband guitar player, through his unorthodox beginning as apainter and his development as an artist and an activist. Withfrankness and clarity he tells us how he learned and matured as anartist and his brief commentaries on many of his works areilluminating both of how they were made and the concepts behind them.It makes the reader want to look again and more intensely at thepictures. The Prologue isessentially a dedication to Robert’s late we Betty, his lelonginspiration, mentor and most important critic. The first chaptertells the harrowing story of how Betty, in her serious illness, wasdisgracefully let down by a healthcare system which basically allowedher to die through neglect, as was admitted in legal proceedings. Butthis does not cast a shadow over the book, as her positive presenceis felt throughout, and is celebrated by the author. These days I rarely getthat urge immediately to re-read a book when I reach the end, but Idid with this one. Thankfully the chapters are so well defined thatthey can be read as stand-alone essays or stories. Take just twoexamples: ‘Who Fears to Speak ofEaster Week’ recounts the tremendous people’s commemoration ofthe  Centenary in which Robert played a central part, aculmination of his activism which has included campaigning againstapartheid, for the Birmingham Six, for artists’ rights, with theIrish National Congress opening border roads, in solidarity withPalestine and as an enthusiastic participant in Féile an Pobail inWest Belfast from its commencement.‘Dining at McDonald’s’is a brilliant critique of the dominant and stultying modernistideology and practise in art and an appeal for an opening up. Ballaghattacks “the notion that the artists’ choice imbues a givenobject with special properties which are tantamount to a metaphysicaltransformation of the object that it ceases to be a pedestrianartefactand becomes,by virtue of the artist’s choice, art”. This ideology leads tothe absurdity of much of the ‘installation’ stuff in galleriesthat baffles all but elitist insiders and, as Ballagh recounts, theclaim by loyalist killer Michael Stone that his attack on Stormontwas a piece of performance art. He argues that the bureaucracies mustset aside this ideology and make galleries more open and democratic .For these views and forhis artistic method and, among some I suspect, for his politics,Ballagh has been frowned upon by certain elites. One prominent figurein the Irish art world said of him with dripping condescension thathe is “not a real artist, he is a mere illustrator”. Typically,Ballagh responded with humour and defiance in a self-portrait wearinga t-shirt saying ‘Fuck the Begrudgers’. I cannot recommend thisbook highly enough. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27482  ","story":"Pearse Doherty: The Interview  Ruairí Doyle“Society is organised in the wrong way - we should not have a housing crisis - what is happening with our children in emergency accommodation is immoral. It is a scandal that we will look back at in twenty years with shame.” - Pearse Doherty TDSinn Féin TD and Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty has spoken of his origins, his le and how they influence and inform both his political ideology in an extended online interview. He also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. Speaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.The Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the ’s. This informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, evenit were  or  years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.Pearse, who has been a TD since , talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. The Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. He said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,I am in thatposition.”Sinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.Pearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. This is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”He continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €. billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”As Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.Deputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  “What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  “It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”Touching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the  Counties.Pearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. He continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  “And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”Sinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. This Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them. Teachta Doherty states in the conclusion of his interview: “Our job isto provide opportunities so that people can live and work at home. We need togive people the opportunity to raise their families at home, so that they canget through le and reach their opportunities and reach their potential athomethat’s what they wish.” test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27483  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinWe are facing into a politically challenging time.

They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.- Mary Lou McDonaldDUP Leader Arlene Foster has called for fundamental changeto the Good Friday Agreement to facilitate Brexit. In other words an agreement endorsed by the majority of people north and south must make way for Brexit, a proposition rejected by a majority in the north. The latest position of the DUP leader lays bare the root of thecrisis in the north. Remember, the DUP opposed the Good Friday Agreement, campaigned for a No vote in that historic referendum and they continue to oppose the Agreement. An Agreement that has underpinned peace for over two decades.They oppose the all Ireland nature of the Agreement, they oppose the rights and safeguards of the agreement and they oppose power-sharing.   to be in them.” The institutions in the north could no-longer bear the weight of this contradiction and collapsed. This was brought to ahead by the continual refusal to implement agreements, opposition to marriage equality, rights to an inquest, an Irish language Act and the financial scandal that is the RHI Cash for Ash scheme.Add to the mix a British Government that has no understanding of Ireland, our economy or our agreements. The Tories are at war with themselves over Brexit and seem intent to bring their own country down with them. This same Tory Government entered into a toxic deal with the DUP to stay in power. That is why there are no institutions in the north, and why the DUP leadership walked away from the deal they had made with Sinn Féin in February this year to get the Assembly up and running.These latest comments by Arlene Foster are a desperate throw of the dice by an increasingly marginalised Unionist leadership. The deal with the Tories will end. Its only legacy will be Brexit. Meanwhile Ireland north and south is changing and a New Ireland is emerging. The joyous revolution of Marriage Equality and Repeal of the Eighth has resonated with a new generation in the north. The largest political demonstration in Belfast is Pride. A magnicent event that celebrates the ersity of identities that make up our communities.Similarly there is a growing demand for access to abortion services. As a placard proudly announced in Dublin Castle when the Repeal result came through, “The North is Next”.Brexit has also unied those who voted to remain within the EU. Brexit will be a disaster for the economy in the north, particularly for agriculture. A community that values prosperity and access to the EU is looking beyond Brexit and Westminster and instead towards Irish Unity. We are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.As for Arlene Foster and the DUP - the game is up. If their leadership want the institutions in the north up and working then they must support real power sharing, respect, equality and the rights of others. When this happens Sinn Féin will be a willing partner. Now is the time for political courage, to look forward in the interests of all communities. Meanwhile the debate on Irish unity and a unity referendum grows. I am confident that we can build a New United Ireland, a home for all that share this island. That is the big challenge for our generation. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27484  ","story":"• RUC unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons Mícheál Mac DonnchaCivil Rights campaigners in Derry had been pressing for a march in their city which had long been a byword for unionist sectarianism and discrimination.Using gerrymandered electoral boundaries and a corrupt voting system which allowed wealthier citizens to have multiple votes in local elections, the unionists maintained a majority of members on the council in a city with a nationalist majority.Nationalists lived in very poor housing conditions and were affected disproportionately by the % unemployment rate in the city.Unionists had long regarded the old walled town as a citadel that could never be surrendered and their dominance was symbolised by the walls towering over the crumbling th century terraced streets of the nationalist Bogside. The last time nationalists had attempted to hold a parade inside the walls was on St Patrick’s Day  – when they were batoned by the RUC.Housing was a massive issue in Derry and the Derry Housing Action Committeeprovided the focus for leadership as the Civil Rights campaign took off. The DHAC had organised a James Connolly commemoration in the city in July  which was banned by the unionist government.The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Associationagreed to hold a march in Derry on  October. The loyalist Apprentice Boys organisation immediately announced a counter-demonstration with the purpose of forcing the unionist government’s hand to ban the Civil Rights march. But the regime at Stormont did not require forcing because the Home Affairs Minister was ultra-unionist William Craig, who promptly imposed the ban.NICRA held an emergency meeting with the DHAC. Many on the NICRA Executive and some Derry nationalist figures, including John Hume, wanted to cancel the march, but the majority of Derry activists were determined to defy the ban. They won out and the march was to proceed as planned.It was a relatively small march, beginning on Craigavon Bridge with several hundred people. The objective was the Diamond in the city centre.The march was stopped in Duke Street by the RUC. A meeting was held with speakers including Gerry Fitt, Betty Sinclair, Eddie McAteer, Ivan Cooper, Austin Currie and Eamonn McCann. Three Westminster Labour MPs were also present.After the meeting, the marchers found themselves hemmed in on all sides by the RUC. They could not disperse and after a tense stand-off the RUC, oblivious to the presence of TV cameras and photographers, unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons, boots and fists. Water cannons were then used.Bernadette Devlin McAliskey, then a young People’s Democracy activist, recalled:“Quite deliberately, they hosed in the upstairs windows and shopfronts, and they went right across Craigavon Bridge, hosing all the onlookers. The police just went mad.”The RUC attack in Duke Street brought the Civil Rights struggle in Ireland to a world audience for the first time. It was a complete eye-opener to many people in the  Counties and in Britain. But most profound was its effect on young nationalists.Derry man Mickey Devine , the last of the ten Hunger Strikers to die in the H-Blocks of Long Kesh in , recalled:“Like every young person in Derry, my whole way of thinking was tossed upside down by the events of  October . I didn’t even know there was a Civil Rights march I saw it on television.“But that night I was down the town smashing shop windows and stoning the RUC. I developed an intense hatred of the RUC. As a child I had always known not to talk to them or to have anything to do with them, but this was dferent.The RUC attacked the Civil Rights march in Duke Street, Derry, on  October .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27485  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering and pain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contested narratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.- Declan KearneyThis week the NIO consultation on dealing with the legacy of thepast in the north of Ireland closed.It will inform a legislative process and bringforward future legacy legislation.Failure to deal with the past remains one of the most signicantimpediments to political progress here.It is a barrier to the development of a comprehensivereconciliation and healing process in this society.British state policy has been the primary factor in preventinglegacy issues from being addressed or resolved.Powerful sections of the British military and intelligence systemhave never embraced the peace process. They remain psychologically andpolitically locked into a conflict mind-set even twenty years after the GoodFriday Agreement was signed.The role of British State forces and their agents, a refusal toacknowledge and be accountable for their actions, combined with a disregard forsuccessive binding court rulings, has defined the British state’s approach tolegacy matters.That has been reinforced in recent times by a cynical and narrative, including interventions by the British Prime Minister Theresa May,and British Secretary of State in the north, Karen Bradley, to suggest thatonly state forces were being made subject to legacy investigations.These statements are offensive and wrong, and are an egregiousdemonstration of the partisan nature of British policy towards dealing with thepast.They are consistent with the British practice of denying wrongdoing, concealing the truth, and preventing accountability.This poses a major challenge to ensuring that a robust,independent, and impartial facilitation of the legislative process will emergefrom this consultation on addressing the legacy of the past.All sides suffered, and caused suffering to each other during theconflict.There are multiple narratives regarding our tragic past. There isno single narrative despite the attempts of the British state and politicalunionism to assert otherwise.The past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering andpain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contestednarratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.The Stormont House Agreement, , , set out an agreedframework of legacy mechanisms which provided an unprecedented opportunity tocomprehensively deal with the past in all its aspects.Subsequent draft legislation reneged on the British government’sobligations under the SHA by introducing a national security veto, which hadthe effect of blocking a way forward on the issue of legacy.Full implementation of the SHA on a human rights compliant basispresents the best opportunity to deal with the legacy of our past and guaranteea framework which is victim centred.Facilitation of any future legislative process will require thatthe British government must ensure all victims are treated with equality,respect and dignity that the legislation reflects the policy intent of theAgreement and, that the legacy architecture is fully independent, human rightscompliant, and properly resourced and funded.The following key principles should be central to the operation offuture legacy legislation and mechanisms.-          Allprocesses should be victim centred-          Allprocesses must secure the co-operation of all relevant parties to ensuresuccess-          Allprocesses should be based upon equality, respect, and dignity-          Allprocesses must be free from political interference and be absolutelyindependent-         Acknowledgement should be central to the operation of the legacy framework-          The aim ofthat framework should be to enable reconciliation and healing within widersocietyIf there is to be a collective and comprehensive engagement withthe past in a human rights compliant manner, there can be no hierarchy ofvictimhood or humanity.There must be no change to the definition of a victim.High-quality services should be provided to all victims at thepoint of need.This should extend to the immediate provision of a pension for allseriously and psychologically injured during the conflict.The British Government should also immediately release therequired funding to resource the Lord Chief Justice’s inquest plan, as aseparate distinct process from any new legacy mechanisms.The Office of the Police Ombudsman should be adequately andimmediately resourced.Any attempt by the British state to introduce a statute oflimitations to protect its forces and agents would be a violation of the SHA and must be opposed.Full participation and unfettered disclosure by British stateforces and its agents with the legacy mechanisms will be essential to achievefull public confidence in their ability to deliver on behalf of all society.Periodic reviews should be carried out to inform the extent offunding requirements and necessary timeframe, for all legacy mechanisms.Legacy processes should not be limited or impeded by closedmaterial proceedings. In addition, for future legacy mechanisms toasintended, it is essential families are given full access to legal aid.The legacy legislation which ultimately emerges from theconsultation must comply with the policy intent of the SHA by:-          Promotingreconciliation-          Upholdingthe rule of law-         Acknowledging and addressing the suffering of all victims and survivors-         Facilitating the pursuit of justice and information recovery-          Beinghuman rights compliant-          Beingbalanced, proportionate, transparent, accountable, fair, and equalThe full implementation of that Agreement representsthe best potential and opportunity to address the legacy of our politicalconflict and the suffering experienced by everyone during the conflict inIreland, Britain and beyond. So, it is now time to finally deal with the past.  It is time tobuild for the future.

permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office”Ive been wondering lately whether anyone in Democratic Unionist Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27487  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe Liberal Party was in government in Britain and had introduced the Home Rule Bill with the support of the Irish nationalist MPs in Westminster.

Leading members of the British landed aristocracy, capitalists and senior military figures jumped on the bandwagon and backed up Unionist leader Edward Carson with threats of civil warHome Rule was brought in.Amidst the political frenzy there were very few Protestants in Ulster who were prepared to oppose Carsonism. But there were some and among them was the Reverend J.B. Armour of Ballymoney, County Antrim. A minister of the Presbyterian Church, Armour stood out from most of his co-religionists in advocating self-government for Ireland. In , he opposed a resolution at the Presbyterian General Assembly condemning Gladstone’s second Home Rule Bill. He was also a strong critic of landlordism.In , he again opposed a resolution against Home Rule at the Presbyterian General Assembly.Calling for freedom of conscience for Protestants to support or oppose Home Rule, Armour slammed the intolerance of Carsonism when he told the assembly:“If you deny the right of private judgment and of free speech, how much do you have of Protestantism worth keeping  Nothing at all.”Armour organised a public meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney to support Home Rule and oppose Carsonism. Banners in the hall proclaimed “No provisional or provincial government for us” and “Ulster for Ireland and Ireland for us”.The resolution stated that the meeting of Protestants of Ballymoney and the protests in The Route“against the claim of Sir Edward Carson and the self-constituted Provisional Government of Ulster to represent the Protestant community of north-east Ulster” and “disputes the narrow claim that dferences of creed necessarily separate Irishmen and women into hostile camps”. Among the speakers at the Ballymoney meeting were JB Armour himself, historian Alice Stopford Green, Jack White, son of a British Army general and later a leading figure in the Irish Citizen Army, and Roger Casement, who was executed in .

With his Antrim family background, Casement regarded the occasion as hugely signicant and in his speech he denounced any notion of partitioning Ireland. The meeting was a once-off and failed to turn the tide of Carsonism but it did show that a signicant minority of Protestants in the North-East were still prepared to stand up for Irish unity and self-government. The meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney in support of Irish self-government was held on  October ,  years ago this week. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27490  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.- Declan KearneyLast weekend the Irish Congress of Trades Unionsand Irish Labour History Society organised a conference to commemorate William Walker in Belfast.Walker was an anti-Home Rule unionist who was a leader in the Belfast Independent Labour Partyin the early twentieth century.When James Connolly, Irelands most signicant historical, socialist republican leader called on the ILPs membership to support socialist unity in Ireland, his appeal provoked a rebuke from Walker.This led to a robust debate between both figures in the pages of Forward between May and July .Their debate came to be known as the Connolly Walker controversy and later became an historical reference point for the anti-imperialist struggle in Ireland.I participated in a  alongside veteran trade unionist Joe Bowers, Ulster Unionist councillor Chris Mc Gimpsey, and ICTU Assistant General Secretary, Owen Reidy, to discuss the post Walker years and the current situation in the north.Not surprisingly we delivered four very dferent perspectives on Walker and his legacy as well as, Brexit the north strategy and politics on the Left and, future prospects.A very challenging but fraternal debate ensued between the lists and the audience.I opened my comments by saying that any consideration today of William Walker’s legacy needs to be within the historic and contemporary reality that the advancement of socialist and Labour politics has been held back due to the effects of British colonial policy in Ireland.He was a product of his native Belfast and directly influenced by the communal environment within which he grew up.He was a protestant in a largely protestant workforce. Sectarianism in the late s and early s stalked Belfast.While Walker was severely limited in his political analysis he was committed to improving the conditions of his fellow workers.He is an integral part of Belfast’s industrial history and his contribution to the city’s labour heritage deserves recognition.British policy in Ireland and its consequences for Irish society has ided Irish workers along communal lines. It has paralysed the labour movement from effectively challenging partition and championing the strategic aim of Irish unity.Partition is the central fault line at the heart of Irish society and politics.Sectarianism remains a visceral blight in this state.Following partition, it was used by the ruling unionist elite to cement the foundation of the state and prevent unity among citizens on issues of common concern.The fact is Labour was indeed told to wait as the resurgent struggle for national independence grew in momentum just over  years ago.The counter revolution which took place post partition represented a strategic setback for labour and working-class interests in the new free state.It eclipsed the seminal influence which socialist republicanism had on the  Proclamation and the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil.The rights of workers became subservient to the conservative elites, north and south.However, sections of the labour movement were compliant with British policy in Ireland and the imposition of partition.That was personied in the political thinking of Walker and others pre partition.This tendency opposed Connollys core position that \"the two currents of revolutionary thought in Ireland, the socialist and the national, were not antagonistic but complementary\".Walkers debate with Connolly reflected a key contradiction inherent in the Irish labour movement and its relationship with the Irish national liberation struggle, and anti-imperialism generally.That contradiction has existed ever since.Walkers brand of ‘Municipal Socialism’ was in reality a euphemism for self-imposed strategic and political limitations which went on to define the Trade Union movement in the north.As a result, the Irish labour movement, particularly in the north has failed to challenge partition and modern British political policy towards Ireland.Partition has been an abject failure. It was never designed to make the northern state a political or economic success.From the beginning this state has carried within it the conditions of inherent instability.It was built upon institutionalised and structural sectarianism which ensured that a substantial minority was destined never to be treated as equals.The Civil Rights Movement fty years ago exposed the inability of the unionist state to treat the minority as equals.That belligerent opposition from powerful sections within political unionism against reform of the northern state persists today in the form of political unionism, and specically DUP hostility towards implementation of the Good Friday Agreementsince .Refusal by the DUP to embrace a rights-based society and equality, culminated in the collapse of the GFA political institutions in January , and our associated political crisis which has continued since then. Those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power-sharing.The party brand is now indistinguishable from financial scandal and sharp practice in government.As a party, the DUP is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic reforms, social modernity, and standards in public office.Its project is negative and tactical, and entirely focused upon slowing down and blocking progressive change, while maintaining a sectarian hegemony within the unionist constituency.The DUP is in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarian, homophobic and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists and many others, including sections of civic unionism, have concluded that the DUP has had its chance and cannot now be trusted in government.They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power at the risk of allowing it to continue practicing discrimination, intimidation, bigotry, or sharp practice.The enduring political crisis is accentuated by systemic structural weaknesses in the regional economy.The required investment in local public services and protection of workers’ rights are confronted with a combination of Tory austerity and Brexit.Pressures on public services are intensying.The regional block grant, or public expenditure settlement, has been reduced by .%.Real term cuts to public funding are now factored into future budget profiles alongside ·         Actual net cuts in take home pay for public and private sector workers·         Welfare cuts and the universal social charge·         Higher inflation and living costs, adults in working families live in relative povertyAverage wages in the north remain lower than ten years ago.Precarious working conditions, zero hours’ contracts, and the scam of bogus self-employment used by some employers are in common practice.Workers’ rights and protections are being systematically reversed.The onset of Brexit will be a catastrophe for the regional and island economiesIt will deepen an existing race to the bottom by further undermining the potential for economic growth, and new investment.The Brexit agenda, twinned with Tory austerity threaten jobs across all economic sectors, workers’ terms and conditions, and, any potential for sustainable public services in the north.The dawning political and economic reality is that Brexit has changed everything.It has exposed the negative role that partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentally anti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.  The British state has been pushed into an unprecedented, existential political crisis.Brexit is a train wreck being jointly steered by the DUP and extremists in the British Tory party.But it also has become a defining moment for these islands.A new generation is questioning partition.There has been a seismic sht in the ambitions and expectations of citizens in the north.A new political discourse has begun about the future of Ireland north and south, and our relationships with Britain and EuropeThe debate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have moved centre stage.The time has come for a fundamental paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.The Irish government needs to begin preparing constitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish Unity.It should facilitate an open, inclusive national conversation involving all citizens, political parties, social partners, and civic society.That is a dialogue about our collective future on this island which addresses all the concerns, accommodations and compromises relevant to negotiating a new, all Ireland, constitutional, pluralist democracy.Today this new focus upon Irish unity provides Irish trade unionists and workers with an opportunity to influence the debate about future constitutional and political change.Previous moments of political change have required that labour should wait.The emerging challenge for the Irish labour movement north and south is to engage with this emerging discussion.To paraphrase Connolly in his opening contributions to the Connolly Walker debate\"Constitutional change then is almost a certainty of the future.”The labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.I said to the Belfast conference this reality will require Irish trade unionists to take strategic positions on supporting an Irish unity referendum and then to campaign positively for constitutional change.On Monday of this week I reiterated that opinion when I met Patricia King, General Secretary of ICTU in Dublin.Of course, this will be a challenging discussion for the Irish labour movement, as comrades noted both during and after the plenary discussion. But it should not be feared or avoided.Today in modern Ireland there is a battle for hearts and minds about how society is organisedThe status quo has failed us all.Connolly’s vision of a united Ireland which serves the interests of the many instead of the few will not be wished into existence.Labour should not wait again.The Irish labour movement needs to assert itself on the Irish unity debate by introducing a progressive labour agenda to the unfolding discourse on future constitutional and political change.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27492  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaAt the start of the th century women began to campaign actively against the denial of their right to vote. In  the Women’s Social and Political Union was founded in England and the militant feminists commenced the battle for the vote. In Ireland there had been groups working for women’s suffrage but the campaign really began here on the instigation of Hanna Sheehy Skeffington and Margaret Cousins. Margaret Cousins came from a unionist family in Dublin but she later wrote: “I belonged in my heart from the beginning to the fighters for freedom.” Her husband James Cousins also rejected the unionism of his background and became involved in the Gaelic revival. Margaret came into contact with the women’s movement in England in . On herto Ireland she co-operated with a remarkable young woman who was to make her mark on Irish history. Hanna Sheehy was the daughter of a Fenian, David Sheehy, who took part in the  Rising and was elected as a Parnellite MP in . Hanna was an exceptional student and excelled academically despite the restrictions on women’s access to education she achieved a first class honours MA in . She became a teacher and married Francis Skeffington. In line with their shared feminist principles they adopted each other’s surnames. Francis resigned his post as registrar of University College because the authorities refused to register women on the same basis as men. In  Hanna and Margaret founded the Irish Women’s Franchise League , with the active support of both Francis Sheehy Skeffington and James Cousins. From the beginning they stressed that the IWFL would address the specic needs of Irish women in “a subject country seeking freedom from England” and would “work on independent Irish lines”. Margaret Cousins described the IWFL’s position: “Its policy was to educate by all forms of propaganda the men, women and children of Ireland to understand and support the members of the League in their demand for votes for women, and to obtain pledges from every Irish Member of Parliament to vote for Women’s Suffrage Bills introduced in the British Houses of Parliament, and to include Women’s Suffrage in any Irish Home Rule Bill.” The IWFL campaigned throughout the country and made an impact beyond their numbers of about  activists. Not all militant women agreed with the IWFL’s tactics the republican group Inghinidhe na hÉireann refused to join in lobbying the British parliament, preferring to “organise a women’s movement on Sinn Féin lines, or on lines even broader still”. Despite this dference, republican women such as Constance Markievicz played an active role in the IWFL’s work and Hanna Sheehy Skeffington herself was strongly republican. Markievicz urged young Irishwomen to prepare to fight: “Arm yourselves with weapons to fight your nation’s cause. Arm your souls with noble and free ideas. Arm your minds with the histories and memories of your country and her martyrs, her language, and a knowledge of her arts and industries. Andin your day the call should come for your body to arm, do not shirk from that either.” Markievicz said Irishwomen were “doubly enslaved with a double battle to fight”. Following the  general election the Irish Party at Westminster was in a position to press the Liberal government to publish a Home Rule Bill. But Redmond and his party still refused to support women’s right to vote. The IWFL became more militant and Hanna and Francis founded the Irish Citizen newspaper to further the cause of women’s rights as well as Irish independence, social justice and pacism. When British politicians visited Ireland they were challenged by the IWFL. Margaret ‘Meg’ Connery confronted British Tory leader Andrew Bonar Law and Unionist leader Edward Carson when they came to Dublin. In Belfast Hanna Sheehy Skeffington challenged Winston Churchill. Margaret Cousins joined protests in England in  and was jailed for a month. In June  eight women from the IWFL smashed windows in Dublin Castle and other prominent buildings. Hanna was arrested at the Castle and she and the seven others were imprisoned in Mountjoy. The following month British Prime Minister Asquith visited Dublin and there were more protests. Three English feminists had followed Asquith to Ireland and they were also jailed for their protests. After a hunger strike in Mountjoy by the English suffragists and the IWFL women, all were released except two of the Englishwomen who were subjected to forced feeding. Many meetings of the IWFL were physically attacked at this time by Redmondites who saw the campaign for women’s suffrage as a threat to their political dominance and their relationship with the British Liberal government. In contrast, republicans such as Pádraig Mac Piarais and Thomas MacDonagh were supporters of the IWFL. The IWFL also won the support of prominent trade unionists James Larkin and James Connolly. They were closely allied with the Irish Women Workers Union in Liberty Hall and in  Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed after a confrontation with the Dublin politan Police during the Great Lockout. She was released after a six-day hunger strike. That year also saw the death in England of feminist Emily Davison who ran on to the course at the Epsom Derby and was trampled by a race horse. Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed again in  for campaigning against recruitment to the British Army. Her influence and that of the IWFL was seen in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic of  which enshrined women’s right to vote. Her friend James Connolly told her: “You will be glad to know that in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic we are including equal citizenship for women.” Hanna replied that she knew who was responsible, meaning Connolly himself. “We were practically unanimous, Only one questioned it,” replied Connolly. Francis Sheehy Skeffington was murdered in Portobello Barracks by a British Army officer during the Easter Rising. Hanna embarked on a tour of the United States to expose the truth about the murder and other British atrocities. She continued to play a leading role in the struggle for Irish freedom, as did many of the pioneering feminists of the IWFL. In  the IWFL saw its central aim achieved when women voted for the first time in the general election which resulted in a massive Sinn Féin victory, although women under  were still excluded. The IWFL actively opposed British rule and supported Dáil Éireann. For example in August  Hanna was badly beaten by the RIC who attacked a Sinn Féin meeting at which she spoke in Kilbeggan, Co. Westmeath. IWFL women went on to champion women’s rights in the decades following the Treaty when they faced the very dferent challenges of a partitioned Ireland with conservative anti-women governments North and South. The Irish Women’s Franchise League was founded  years ago on  November .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27493  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonA wreckers’ agenda is being driven by the DUP and Tory government.

They must not be allowed to destroy the democratic option formaking change in the north.It is these circumstances which bring sharply into focus theIrish governments responsibilities.Those who courageously signed this letter to the Irish government are saying the negative position of the DUP and British governmentmust not be tolerated.These are citizens who want the political institutionsre-established but only on the basis of democracy and equality.They are assertive in their resolve to see a rights basedsociety created, which guarantees rights, respect, and parity of esteem, in ashared, inclusive future.But they are not prepared to be treated as second-classcitizens in this part of Ireland.Those days are over.It is time for the Irish Government to indeed redouble itsefforts to step up to the mark by absolutely opposing the imposition ofBrexit, and guaranteeing equality and rights for all citizens in the north.An Taoiseach and the Irish Government needs to reflect verycarefully about the signicance and timing of this intervention, respondpositively and act decisively, in cooperation with the politicalrepresentatives of Irish citizens, and others in the north, to ensure thattheir democratic rights are delivered upon.test"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8695614.1541521803!/image/image.jpg","title":"irish language group funding snub claim rejected by dup","story":"A DUP councillor has rejected claims that unionists #snubbed# a request to fund an Irish language event.Irish language group Conradh na Gaeilge submitted a request to Mid and East Antrim Council to fund an event as part of Seachtain na Gaeilge , which takes place each March.Sinn Fein councillor Patrice Hardy claimed unionist councillors had “refused to even countenance” the request, adding: “Seachtain na Gaeilge is a hugely positive, global event which this council should be supporting rather than snubbing. “The Irish language community aren’t seeking special treatment, they are only seeking equality.”Last year, Ms Hardy accused the council of being “anti-Irish to the core”, after a move to have the local authority participate in Irish Language Week was rejected following a vote by members.

A report by the Air Accidents Investigation Branchstated that autopilot was engaged when the Bombardier Dash  Q turboprop plane reached an altitude of ,ft. The aircraft continued to climb to ,ft but it \"pitched nose-down and then descended rapidly\" because autopilot was mistakenly set with a target altitude of zero feet. Cockpit alarms alerted the captain and first officer to what was happening. They later reported they had \"become visual with the ground\". The captain disconnected autopilot and recovered the aircraft, having dropped to ft. The maximum rate of descent of , feet per minute during the event suggests the aircraft may have hit the ground just a few seconds laterthe crew had not intervened. They continued the flight to Glasgow and landed without incident. The AAIB concluded that the crews selection of a particular autopilot mode before take off led to the zero-altitude target. Autopilot systems are used to automatically control aircraft. Flybe has taken several safety measures in response to the incident, including revisions to simulator training and amendments to pilots pre-take-off checklists. A spokeswoman for the airline said it \"implemented remedial actions quickly in response to the incident and our training and procedures have been amended to minimise the risk of a reoccurrence\". \"Flybe operates over , flights a year and the safety of our passengers and crew remains our number-one priority.\""},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland traffic updates latest delays and diversions","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHomes  InteriorsSeptember CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The new RHI - Social Investment Fund dished out millions despite conflicts of interest and shoddy records He said: “Whilst some organisations may be delivering good outcomes on several projects, SIF has been characterised by a lack of transparency and delivery since its inception. “The decision of the DUP and Sinn Fein to dispense with proper public procedures for the appointment of steering groups and lead partners is another governance failure by these two parties. SIF audit case study: £.m rental costs of surgery not good value “The management structure, in addition to the lack of minutes and accountability around the entire scheme, are just some of the many reasons Alliance brought an Assembly motion expressing deep concern around the formation, implementation and operation of SIF, while calling for an independent review of the entire process. However, it was defeated by a combination of DUP and Sinn Fein votes.“These fundamental issues are why there should be an independent inquiry commissioned into SIF and its operation immediately, so the lessons which this report outlines can be learned and we can ensure there is no repeat of the vast sums of public money being spent without proper accountability.” SIF audit: Another blow to confidence in devolution SDLP deputy leader Nichola Mallon MLA said the findings bore “a striking resemblance” to revelations from the RHI Inquiry. The report is “further evidence of the appalling type of government the DUP and Sinn Fein were running in partnership” she said.“It is a damning report on how the SIF scheme was devised and operated,” she added.Ulster Unionist MLA Mike Nesbitt accused the DUP and Sinn Fein of “taking a good idea and mangling it”. Editors Viewpoint: Flaws in social fund truly beggar belief He said: “The NI Audit Office report is damning in its own right, but in the context of what we have heard from the RHI Inquiry, yet more proof that the  years the DUP and SF ran devolution from Stormont Castle was a wasted decade for our people. “For anyone thinking RHI was a blip, this report shows the failings are systemic.” However, the DUP’s Emma Little Pengelly MP said “all decision-making on the projects happened at an armsbasis with maximum flexibility given to the local steering groups”. “The Social Investment Fund represented an innovative approach to tackling issues within communities where previous attempts had failed to deliver outcomes. The programme has benefitted so many communities in some of the most deprived neighbourhoods right across Northern Ireland and many thousands of people’s lives have been improved by it.“SIF was designed to be flexible, with a ‘community-up’ approach allowing communities to identy where needs lay. The aim was to provide maximum flexibility to enable and empower communities to identy problems and solutions. This was an innovative, co-design approach. “In adopting a new approach some challenges and early issues arose and the report identies how many of these were recognised at any early stage and action taken. Whilst there were some issues around local steering group approach given the maximum flexibility context given to them by the Department, I welcome there is absolutely nothing to substantiate politically motivated allegations which had been levelled against the scheme.”Sinn Fein MLA Raymond McCartney said that the report had “flagged up a number of weaknesses in regard to processes, governance and transparency in the SIF scheme”.He added: “Those lessons must be learned and applied to any future schemes. The Social Investment approach was based on a progressive ethos, seeking to empower local communities and include them in the decision making process.“The Auditor and Comptroller General identies a number of projects that are likely to have a positive impact. Sinn Fein’s focus will continue to be on tackling disadvantage and deprivation.”"},{"url":null,"title":"facebook ireland base to gain capacity for additional","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHomes  InteriorsSeptember CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Those responsible have branded by the local politician as ldquogrossly irresponsible.Cllr Curran described those who engage in such behaviour as ldquoselfless, reminding them that they are guilty of an environmental crime by dumping their waste in unauthorised areas.There are a number of illegal dumping hot spots across the district with the Downpatrick councillor suggesting the mentality of those responsible is particularly dficult to fathom.ldquoI cannot understand why people do not make use of household waste centres in Downpatrick, Castlewellan and Ballynahinch, declared Cllr Curran.ldquoThe mentality of those who dump waste along rural roads is beyond me. What puzzles me most is that people who engage in this activity end up paying for its removal through their rates bills. They are literally costing themselves money, but that does not appear to register with them.Cllr Curran said there was no excuse for illegal dumping as there were so many ways for people to dispose of their waste legally and safely.ldquoFly tipping and illegal dumping results in a blot on the landscape and is an image no one wants to see. I firmly believe that those responsible for despicable behaviour should feel the full force of the law, otherwise this activity will continue, he warned.ldquoIllegal waste can range from bin bags dumped at the side of the road to old household furniture, rubble or old trees.

Delamont Country Park offers huge potential and re-establishing a network of community trails is an exciting proposal which we hope will come to fruition, he said.ldquoThe response from the public to have its say on the future of the park was brilliant and thanks to everyone who took the time to take part in what was a very worthwhile event. I initially lobbied for more investment in the park and am glad local council officials took this on board and are developing a masterplan with public input at its heart.Cllr Andrews said he was pleased to take part in last weekrsquos consultation and was impressed at how many people took the time to attend, confirming he will be supporting the motion and views outdoor leisure as an economic driver for the whole region.ldquoThe people who attended last weekrsquos event agree that the country park is a major tourism asset and offers signicant development potential which must be appropriate and not spoil what is already in place, he continued.ldquoDelamont can act as a major economic driver and benefit not just the immediate killyleagh area, but the wider district..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Rogue trader tried to swindle £7k from Newcastle pensioner  ","story":"A FRAUDSTER tried to scam an  year-old Newcastle woman out of nearly pound, for tarmacing her driveway which he had deliberately damaged, Downpatrick Court has heard.Dean James Winderstood shamefaced in the court on Thursday on five charges relating to work he carried out in February.Winder, who traded as Unique Style Driveways, admitted one charge of fraud by misrepresentation and three further charges of aggressive, misleading, and unfair commercial practice.He was also admitted using an inaccurate service flyer which failed to say that his business was registered in England.All offences took place between February -.The court heard that the scam may never have been uncovered had it not have been for the actions of a taxi driver.Police praised the driver who raised the alarm with the Trading Standards Service after he learnt of what was happening as he brought the woman to a bank to withdraw pound,.Trading Standards called the police who arrested Winder and another person at the scene.Winder was given  hours of community service and fined pound by District Judge Amanda Brady for his actions, which were later condemned by police as ldquodisgusting.He was also instructed to immediately pay back pound, which he had taken from the woman as a deposit.A prosecution lawyer said that Winder approached the woman and her partner unsolicitedly to power wash and seal a paved area at their Mourneview Road home for pound.However, after doing the work, Winder pointed out some problems with the driveway and offered to do further work for pound,, which was increased to pound, to tarmac the full driveway.Some of the problems that Winder had pointed out in the driveway were those he had actually created while doing the first job, the prosecutor added.A defence lawyer acknowledged that Winder, now with an address at Holmes Avenue, Dreghorn in Irvine, Scotland, had seen an opportunity to get further work from the elderly couple and had done a ldquopoor job of tarmacing the driveway.However, he said Winder had made a full admission for his actions, offered his apologies and had turned up in court with the full amount of money to be ed to the elderly householder.The lawyer added that while there was another man involved in the work and transaction, Winder was ing the money on his own.Judge Brady described Winderrsquos actions as ldquomean-spirited. She told him: ldquoYou took advantage of an elderly person, quite deliberately, and deliberately damaged her driveway to get more money.Winderrsquos conviction was later welcomed by the police.Chief Superintendent Simon Walls said: ldquoThis was a callous and calculated act by Winder who deliberately set out to scam this couple out of their hard-earned money.ldquoWhat Winder did was disgusting and I hope the courtrsquos judgement will bring some level of comfort and reassurance to the couple.ldquoI would also like to praise the taxi driver who raised the alarm and thank our colleagues in Trading Standards Service.Chief Superintendent Walls also appealed to friends and family of older or vulnerable people to talk to them about lsquocold callersrsquo and make sure they know what to do when salespeople come to their door.He added: ldquoNot all cold callers are rogue traders, but some are.

Keenan quickly tagged on a rsquo with two Morgan frees stretching the lead to four points by the th minute.Ballymartin were far from playing the role of bystanders, but they managed to shoot seven wides against the wind, misses that proved crucial at the finish.With  minutes gone Chris McKay had a stinging shot crash off the crossbar following a stunning passage of play, but Keenan and Morgan ensured St Johnrsquos kept ticking over with points apiece.Ballymartin continued to waste several good scoring opportunities before Michael Higgins picked up his sidersquos first score in added time at the end of the first half as St Johnrsquos went in with a - to - lead.It took the protagonists a while to settle in after the break, but with  minutes gone Cathal Doyle reduced the arrears to four points with a score from play. St Johnrsquos then cruelly lost the services of the influential Eoin Moag to a black card and minutes later he was followed for an early bath by Darren Savage, who received a second yellow and then red.St Johnrsquos backs were now to the wall and Ballymartin made sure they stayed there. However, another Morgan free stretched St Johnrsquos lead to - to - before the real Ballymartin fightback started.Consecutive points from Michael Cunningham, Ryan OrsquoHareand Ross Cunningham left a single point in it and Ballymartin were in the right tack.The Lilywhites pushed and probed for the equalising score, but with the game in added time St Johnrsquos broke free and a surging run from Conor Flanagan ended with him setting up Branf for the match-winning score.Just to rub salt into the wounds, Morgan added a point from play to leave St Johnrsquos with their Division  status intact.St Johnrsquos: D Morgan, C Magorrian, A Morgan, J Addis, D Savage, R Flanagan, M Grant, A McMullan, E Moag, C Brannf , C Morgan , C McKay, M Keenan , J Clarke, C Flanagan.

Projected as three-screens, the film was cleverly edited to juxtapose the ying yellow line constructions, from the scouts lining up their yellow kayaks to the farmers forming their line of yellow bales.With the use of dramatic aerial shots, the formation of the yellow lines could be seen clearly as they cut through the landscape, representing both the Border and itrsquos people. The film received great response from the audience participants as they witnessed the powerful result of their involvement.With lsquoAcross and In-Between,rsquo Suzanne Lacy highlights the wit and cleverness of Border le in the face of political pressures, focusing on the power of play in creatively responding to complex issues.Suzanne commented: ldquoOur project draws those who live along the often-invisible boundaries between countries into a conversationmdashmetaphoric and literal ndash on personal and symbolic meanings of this border and by extension all such borders drawn by political forces.ldquoThe artwork explores inverse paradigms: visible and invisible, official and unofficial, rural and urban, the real border and imagined ones.

If they succeed, this would automatically mean more barriers to trade with the EU, including across the Irish border, she stated.Dr Hayward agreed that the Mrs Fosterrsquos argument against any sort of backstop was ldquoperfectly reasonable as it is not ldquothe intended destination. But she still argues that it is of ldquocritical importance.. It is the issue over which the whole Withdrawal Agreement could collapse, leaving all of us in the mire of a lsquoNo Dealrsquo outcome.ldquoIt is therefore very important that all judgements of the backstop are based on a clear and accurate understanding of what it actually means, unclouded by hyperbole.And it is in relation to the backstop where Dr Hayward, who is a Fellow in the Senator George J. Mitchell Institute for Global Peace, Security and Justice, took most issue with Mrs Foster analysis:ldquoFoster claims that Northern Irelandrsquos access to the UK single market would be restricted. In actual fact this is entirely in the hands of the British government ndash it is a domestic issue unrelated to UK-EU negotiations, the Queens Reader asserted, before adding:ldquoSecondly, Foster says that lsquoEU access, comes with the requirement for Northern Ireland to fully adopt and implement EU regulations with no changesrsquo. But it is not necessary to have full regulatory alignment with the EU in order to have tarf free access to its market. That would be like saying wed have to have all our laws imposed by Beijingwe are to get tarf-free access to China.Dr Hayward does however admit that major ergence would require an operational backstop:ldquoThat said,the UK erges widely from the lsquocommon rulebookrsquo of the EUrsquos single market, it would not be possible for goods produced in Northern Ireland to have free movement around the single market as is currently the case. It would be in just such an instance that the backstop could come into play. This would not mean that all EU laws would apply in Northern Ireland but rather that goods produced here could be considered to be of EU standardcertain procedures are followed.In her opinion piece last week Mrs Foster stated that:ldquoFree Trade Agreements donrsquot just cover regulation but tarfs too. This would require not just being in the single market but in the customs union. In other words, a total sea Border descending between Northern Ireland and its largest market, Great Britain.Dr Hayward does not agree however and says ldquothere is absolutely no prospect of a total sea border under any scenario.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

They later reported they had “become visual with the ground”.The captain disconnected autopilot and recovered the aircraft, having dropped to ft.The maximum rate of descent of , feet per minute during the event suggests the aircraft may have hit the ground just a few seconds laterthe crew had not intervened.They continued the flight to Glasgow and landed without incident.The AAIB concluded the crew’s selection of a particular autopilot mode before take off led to the zero altitude target.Flybe has taken several safety measures in response to the incident, including revisions to simulator training and amendments to pilots’ pre-take off checklists.A spokeswoman for the airline said: “Flybe maintains a rigorous approach to ensuring the very highest flying standards are maintained.“As reported by the AAIB, Flybe implemented remedial actions quickly in response to the incident and our training and procedures have been amended to minimise the risk of a reoccurrence.“Flybe operates over , flights a year and the safety of our passengers and crew remains our number one priority.”UDR family welcomes John Downey arrest Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"It is not the first near-catastrophe on a Northern Irish flight in the last few years.In July , there was a bungled take-off of a Boeing  with  peopleon board as it left Belfast International Airport for Corfu.

The decision threatens to shut down  per cent of Northern Ireland’s generating capacity and has been widely criticised as leaving the region dependent on imported electricity and vulnerable to blackouts post-Brexit.Davy Thompson, Unite regional coordinating officer, spoke about the union’s fears for further job losses at Kilroot and Ballylumford, saying: “Last week Unite was notied of the likelihood of just over  job losses across Kilroot and Ballylumford however we are preparing ourselves for that number to rise substantially. We understand that approximately  AES employees are likely to be made redundant in the near future. Unfortunately they won’t be the only ones affected, we are estimating the knock-on impact in terms of job losses on that scale could include an additional  direct, full-time contractors who work on-site. These redundancies will come as devastating news for those workers’ families at this time of year.”Mr Thompson added: “We fail to understand the logic of a decision to cut  per cent of Northern Ireland’s generating capacity at a time when UK government briefings are warning of the possibility of black-outs post-Brexit. This decision will leave Northern Ireland dependent on electricity imported from the Republic when the our ability to do so is in question.“In the absence of a ‘contract to supply’ under the current ISEM, it is now vital that the energy regulator intervenes to provide a ‘contract for capacity’ as quickly as possible.

Knowing this, John gave up his teaching course and took a full time job at the boatyardhellipand the rest is history.Mr Freemantle moved from Penarth and started his own boat building workshop in South Clive Street in  with British Road Services ndash now National Freight Consortium.In , the business was expanded and relocated to a greenfield site within Cardf Marina, which is now the exact location of Bayscape.The boat yard at the time stored around - boats. Long before the Cardf Bay Barrage was built, the water was tidal and boats moored in the middle of the river.As there was no road to the marina, Mr Freemantlebuilt a track to enable him to get to and from the boat yard. In  he put pontoons for the boats and laid the first cement for the slipway which was all created by Mr Freemantles own hands.In  the Freemantlesset their sights on retiring and sold the boat yard - which had grown to storing more than  boats - to a family friend of their business partner who used to visit the boat yard as a child. And so Bayscape began.One day the couple were walking along the waterrsquos edge and looked across to see the unique development taking shape in the exact spot of Mr Freemantles beloved boat yard, where  years previously they brought in the original electrics, telephone line and water. The couple decided to move back to where they had spent many happy years.Mrs Freemantlesaid: ldquoWe love living here, it feels really safe and therersquos a great sense of community.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community.

Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief.

A national debate which “we have been swept up in”, he says.While he says there remain serious issues which leave his business, and the rest of Northern Ireland, in the dark, far from seeing the port’s proximity with the border – in fact much of the mass of water is in the Republic – as a negative, Brian believes it could positively position it following Brexit.“We are unique as we are both a UK and European port, which is a fantastic opportunity with Brexit coming up.“We are talking to the City Deal people, the UK and Irish governments along with Donegal.“I think we, along with others, particularly, have an opportunity… there are dficulties we could face, especially with a no deal. We are pleased we can articulate our concerns and still hopefully have practical solutions.“Even in a ‘no deal’ scenario, where we are located, there will need to be good relations. Around %commute from Donegal. They will still need to do that.“In a paradox, it does bring some benefits. We have benefits with this Atlantic gateway – it is under-used, and can be utilised in a way to straddle the border. We are speaking about how we can join the dots.”Brian says the port has been working with Donegal County Council, over plans for its new cruise ship terminal at Greencastle. “We have the ability to import materials into the Irish side in the case of a hard Brexit. It wouldn’t take a huge amount of investment to make that happen.“There’s another dimensioninfrastructure capacity. We have a lot of things in place which is strong.“We have deep water available, and have access to probably the biggest land bank in the British Isles.“Project Kelvin  – the high-speed trans-Atlantic fibre-optic cable connection – runs right past our offices. We have over MW of power right beside us. In terms of the building blocks for basic industrial development, they are all in place.“In effect, a ‘no deal’ hard Brexit would be the ultimate impact… it means additional bureaucracy, would cost our port customers time and money, and might make them look at alternative ports to bring material in.“We are not insulated form the operational side of things. Materials coming in from the rest of the world. What could be an extreme in this, ultimately, it might mean, bringing in two million tonnes a year, % from Europe – that % could be subject to tarfs, or a lot of bureaucracy.”Laying it all out, the key concern ishuge bulk cargo – such as grain or animal feed – has to be ‘unitised’ into separate lorry loads, which require single certication each time.“It could create a fairly substantial bureaucracy around the logistics. That’s the very worst situation.”But business is good. Brian says the port employs  staff directly, but around , indirectly.“The numbers we put out in turnover are really strong, but they are modest in a sense that they don’t reflect the impact of what we do,” he says.“Percentage-wise, it’s mostly about the job creation that comes into the regional economy. “We have reinvested £m in the last few years, have a £m asset base and handle about £.bn in commodities a year.”In the other corner, Brian’s closely involved in Derry’s bid for a City Deal, similar to that submitted by six councils, including Belfast, last month.“We are working really closely with the infrastructure around the City Deal. There are two strands – there is the innovation, which is being led by Ulster University, and there is the infrastructure, which we will be playing a fairly central role in.”So, back to Brexit. What will Brian and his team be doing on the morning of March   “As much as you can do, we will continue as normal,” he said.“We have a number of preparedness scenarios. We are as prepared as I think we can be.“We could be prepared, but log jamsare beyond our control. “I don’t hear anyone talking up, or looking for a no deal outcome. I think Northern Ireland businesses have articulated itvery well, and we are punching above our weight.”The biggest issue is whereby a customer could look to moving where, thus moving trade away from the north west, Brian says.Looking back almost two and half years ago, and examining the current landscape today – whereby the UK is set to leave both the customs union and single market – Brian says: “I would have stayed in the customs union and single market. Our strategy has been to defend and grow – why would anyone want to turn away from the biggest customer base “I am not critical of people who wanted to leave the EU – but the way it has been done has not exactly been helpful. “What we see, in my own personal interpretation, when we talk to politicians, particularly from the UK, that the decision to leave the EU was made onof immigration.“That is what took us on the path. There’s then the second thought of the Irish question. If you can solve the issue for Derry, you can solve it for Dover. I don’t think that was considered when the case for leaving on immigration.“We have been swept up in an alternative, national debate – not something relevant for us.”And what’s next for the port  Brian says it’s been through three successful strategies, so far, in terms of expanding the growth.“It’s about leveraging in the coreand selling out the additional capacity to other capacities.“For example, in our marine, we invested in vessels – dredgers. When not used for our work, we go around the UK and Ireland, and offering expertise to other ports.“The key things we are doing is the strategic aims, to defend and grow – maintaining our core business, with core customers, and then looking to developing the industrial land bank and tourist product.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Danske-cover.jpg","title":"danske bank leading the tech and digital charge","story":"Posted on Monday November  by Ulster Business Danske Bank has taken another leap forward in its support for nurturing and helping to get businesses off the ground. Ulster Business chats to Danske Bank’s Vicky Davies and Richard Caldwell about the bank’s new Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub and ‘Making more possible’ for Northern Ireland businesses When you are already leading the technology and digital race in Northern Ireland banking, where do you go from there  For Danske Bank, its sights were set on something hugely ambitious, and something philanthropic which it believes can help cultivate, boost and grow the next generation of technology and fintech business start-ups in Northern Ireland. Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub, run in partnership with Catalyst Inc, is a stunning, modern incubator and hub which will see dozens of entrepreneurs and start-up businesses shape and craft their ideas in the heart of Danske Bank’s own Belfast city centre headquarters. The partnership with Catalyst Inc makes a lot of sense, as it already plays host to dozens of knowledge-based businesses across  acres in the Titanic Quarter, and the Innovation Centre in Londonderry. Vicky Davies is managing director of strategy and corporate development at Danske Bank. “We have a clear ambition to be the best bank in Northern Ireland, and we plan to do that by making more possible for our customers, employees, stakeholders and society”, she says. It’s that message, ‘Making more possible’, that adorns the wall of one of the main meeting rooms in the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub. “Banking is changing so fast. It’s relentless in terms of new entrants, innovation and the level of new fintech money coming into the industry.” “We know we need to change at pace, or face being left behind.” “We needed a partner in this venture, and we were looking for someone with reach and expertise,” she said. Following an initial meeting last year with senior management at Catalyst Inc, Vicky says there was an immediate mutual connection, and they went from there. “They have the expertise in running a space like this, and we have access to banking and business expertise – with both of us having great experience in helping businesses to grow. So, every dimension we looked at – it was a really good fit.” The hub is an impressive space, awash with splashes of colour, connectivity, co-working spaces and meeting rooms – including a nod to Princess Leia with an image on a wall – and it is able to play host to around - entrepreneurs and business start-up professionals, with top end cable and fibre internet connections. It’s further evidence of Danske Bank ensuring it’s well ahead of the pack and out in front. It’s about bringing a business from an embryonic start-up, to a thriving company, helping lead the way in its sector. But for Danske, this isn’t all about the bottom line. It’s about creating a thriving hub for the future stars of Northern Ireland’s burgeoning tech sector. And it’s a two-way street – with the bank aiming to learn as much from the start-up businesses nestled in the top-end spacious ground-floor hub, as the other way around. So, what does this mean for Danske Bank in terms of business banking and as an institution further bolstering its credentials in the digital space. Richard Caldwell is managing director of personal banking and small business. “We want to be part of the local fintech journey. We want to help influence and develop ideas,” he says. “There are more than , businesses in Northern Ireland, and we want to continue to support start-ups in general – by putting expertise and support into this partnership, we will help this particular set of small businesses to grow in what is a burgeoning sector.” “Ultimately, real success for us would be seeing products brought to market, and helping businesses grow from an embryonic idea, through to start-up, growth and expansion. With the business maybe ending up as one of our loyal corporate customers in the future.” Richard says research showed that many of Danske Bank’s existing bigger business customers wanted the bank to provide “something more tangible” for start-ups, to grow companies for the future. Although tenants in the new fintech space don’t necessarily have to bank with Danske, the Bank does offer banking support, including everything from a current account, to receiving assistance from a growth adviser to support them with their banking needs. gt “This is a major investment for us,” Richard says. “This is one of the most expensive ground-floor retail premises in Belfast, and we have devoted it to this hub. This is front and centre in the heart of Belfast.” The location of the new hub couldn’t be better – with the new Glider bus linking the hub to Catalyst Inc headquarters in Titanic Quarter. And, as modern tech businesses evolve and reach out to new markets and time zones across the globe, there is also  hour access to the Fintech Hub. The hub has a team of four, two from Danske Bank and two newly recruited by Catalyst Inc. Together Danske Bank and Catalyst Inc have also launched a new online  to help the wider growing number of start-up businesses across Northern Ireland to connect with investors, peers and potential new recruits across Europe - thehub.io helps connect start-ups to relevant resources, such as talent, networks, financing, tools and advice from experts which will help them overcome some of the challenges of scaling up. It is clear that strategically this is a big push by both organisations to play a key supporting role through the provision of both physical and online resources. Digitalisation Richard is keen to point out support for the hubs is just part of a bank-wide digital transformation agenda at Danske. “For example, we want to change the nature of traditional relationship management at the Bank. In addition to managing traditional banking needs as we have always done so well, we are now moving into the added value space. As well as the human touch, customers increasingly want top notch digital solutions to make their lives easier, to give them ease of access and quicker credit decisions.” The digitally-savvy way of thinking is giving Danske Bank competitive advantage, and that is from an already well-established position in the market. Last year they appointed a chief digital officer, who is a member of the Bank’s executive committee. “Our people are still our best asset and will remain so,” Richard said. “We have great people. And customers still highly value that human touch and expert advice. But what the journey looks like for transactions, well we have digital solutions for everything. For your payments, wages, drawing direct debits or paying suppliers. “Right now we are piloting and rolling out digital credit decisions for business customers. This is transforming the credit journey for both our customers and our business relationship managers. For example, one customer recently applied for an overdraft through the digital credit solution and got approval and the funds in their account in  minutes.” Danske Bank was the first of the local Northern Ireland banks to bring in app banking, and solutions such as Samsung Pay, Fitbit Pay and Garmin Pay. And this new Fintech Hub is very much another stride forward. The bank is also leading the pack when it comes to customer satisfaction, right across businesses of all shapes and sizes. “For some time now we have been the market leader in business banking. Research continues to show that our customer satisfaction scores are first for large business, and first for small business,” Richard said. Both Vicky and Richard are keen to see what they predict will be short and long-term benefits from the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub. There’s an organic osmosis, allowing ideas to flow freely between the Danske Bank people visiting from upstairs and those entrepreneurs which it hosts on the ground floor. “The entrepreneurs in the hub bring a fresh mindset, one we can learn from as we continue our own digital journey throughout the bank,” Vicky says. Richard added: “The fintech sector is seen in many quarters as a challenger to traditional banks, but we are embracing it and feel we can grow with it, to the benefit of our customers.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Riccc.jpg","title":"ni house prices outpace uk market","story":"Posted on Wednesday November  by John Mulgrew RICS residential property spokesman, Samuel Dickey Northern Ireland homes have avoided a UK-wide dip in prices, according to a new survey. The latest RICS and Ulster Bank Residential Market Survey shows a larger proportion of surveyors pointing to a rise in the average cost of a home. That was a higher level than anywhere  in the UK, during October. It says that “Northern Ireland surveyors are also the most optimistic, looking forward. A net balance of % expects prices to rise in the three months ahead, while a net balance of % expects the number of sales to increase in the same timeframe. Most other regions expect prices and sales activity to fall or be broadly flat in the final quarter”. In terms of supply, the survey pointed to a slight rise in properties coming onto the market in Northern Ireland for the first time in five months. RICS residential property spokesman, Samuel Dickey said: “Interest from first time buyers and a strong rental have been two of the factors driving the Northern Ireland housing market, with first time buyers and investors both very active this year. “Surveyors remain confident about the market, despite political and economic uncertainty, and  is shaping up to have been a more positive picture for the housing market than perhaps was initially anticipated.” Terry Robb, head of personal banking at Ulster Bank, said: “As the survey indicates, demand remains relatively strong and we continue to see a good-pipeline of mortgage applications. “Our new paperless mortgage process has generated interest but more fundamentally, interest in the market remains firm from a broad range of mortgage purchasers including first time buyers, home movers and those remortgaging.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
