That\u0027s the kind of behaviour that increases competition and makes ads more effective for businesses large and small.\u0027The company also addressed claims that its \u0027open bidding agreement with Facebook harms publishers\u0027.Google responded by saying: \u0027Facebook is one of over 25 partners in Open Bidding, and their participation actually helps publishers.\u0027It continued: \u0027AG Paxton also makes misleading claims about Facebook\u0027s participation in our Open Bidding program. Facebook Audience Network (FAN)\u0027s involvement isn\u0027t a secret.\u0027In fact, it was well-publicised and FAN is one of over 25 partners participating in Open Bidding. Our agreement with FAN simply enables them (and the advertisers they represent) to participate in Open Bidding.\u0027Of course we want FAN to participate because the whole goal of Open Bidding is to work with a range of ad networks and exchanges to increase demand for publishers\u0027 ad space, which helps those publishers earn more revenue. FAN\u0027s participation helps that.\u0027But to be clear, Open Bidding is still an extremely small part of our ad tech business, accounting for less than 4 per cent of the display ads we place.\u0027The company added: \u0027AG Paxton inaccurately claims that we manipulate the Open Bidding auction in FAN\u0027s favour. We absolutely don\u0027t. FAN must make the highest bid to win a given impression.\u0027If another eligible network or exchange bids higher, they win the auction. FAN\u0027s participation in Open Bidding doesn\u0027t prevent Facebook from participating in header bidding or any other similar system. In fact, FAN participates in several similar auctions on rival platforms.\u0027And AG Paxton\u0027s claims about how much we charge other Open Bidding partners are mistaken - our standard revenue share for Open Bidding is 5 to 10 per cent.\u0027 A company spokesman for Facebook\u0027s owners Meta told MailOnline: \u0027Meta\u0027s non-exclusive bidding agreement with Google and the similar agreements we have with other bidding platforms, have helped to increase competition for ad placements.\u0027These business relationships enable Meta to deliver more value to advertisers while fairly compensating publishers, resulting in better outcomes for all.\u0027Facebook is not a defendant in the lawsuit."},{"url":null,"title":"50 year old Brian Jones letters 14 year old Rolling Stones fan consigned auction","story":"Share this article Christine, now 70 and married to Keith Jenkins for 50 years, found the items during a move.

The R number reflects the average amount of people every infected patient passes the virus on to. The R rate is, however, a lagging indicator and does not reflect the situation currently. Instead, it paints a clearer picture on how quickly the virus was spreading three weeks ago.Ministers once put the R rate at the heart of their Covid battle plan.

Australia will have wanted 300 (because it’s a round number, I guess), and they may yet get there if Wood keeps bumping Lyon. Boland drives the last, square, but can’t beat point. Lyon will be on strike.  From Brian: “Good morning Sam, Hope you have solved the smoke alarm issue - possibly set off by the friction of Mark Wood’s relentless bumper barrage? Never mind rubbing two sticks together - how about two brain cells?”  I thought Wood’s approach was working wonders, he just picked the wrong guy. If you are referring to my brain cells, the horse has bolted. The short tactic continues from Wood, but Carey gets inside the line of the third ball and parries it to fine leg for four. He pulls the next to deep square for one (“good cricket”). Wood gets two at Lyon and he smashes it out of the ground for six! Kids start scurrying out on to the ground to find it. I don’t think that landed on the roof, that cleared it! There’ll be a new ball now, won’t there? These are valuable runs. Wood goes over the wicket - a win for Lyon - but it doesn’t matter, Lyon obliterates this one for six too! Straight onto the hill! What a shot, that is sensational batting. Wood was causing fear until this point, Lyon has sat him down. What a riposte. Wood has now conceded 100+ runs. Woakes (1-50 off 12) replaces Broad, and his first is clipped for two by Carey, who pressures the hatless Broad with his running and elicits the misfield. Same again, but it’s just one to Broad, whose wide brim is now back on. Less fire this over, three from it. From John Little via email: “For all the naysayers, England are unbeaten this year. More than can be said for Bangladesh, India and New Zealand.... just a matter of perspective.” That’s the spirit, John. So, Wood succeeds against Cummins, bringing Lyon to the crease. Same ball, but Lyon hits down. Wood is now bowling bouncers every delivery, including to Carey. The Australian bats are almost facing chest on, legs wide apart, halfway to the crouch upon release. Wood’s at Carey’s chest, Carey stays leg side of it, and he slices it - with control - down to third for one. Lyon then pulls Wood for six! It splits Wood and Crawley who were making ground on it. Lyon plays that shot well, one knee up of course. That said, I’m probably backing Wood here. Wood is too short, next delivery. Carey chases a wide one from the round-the -wicket Broad, and his inside edge just misses the stumps. Meanwhile, a smoke alarm is going off inside my house, and it is not for smoke reasons. No one is home. Now I have decisions to make. It is not a battery issue. I think I’ve solved it. Anyway, Carey hooks one to fine leg for one and Cummins is defending to cover. Broad sends a fielder to the boundary and goes short to Cummins who pulls vigorously, achieving one run to deep square.  I’d ordinarily think the game is quite even, I just have reservations about England’s capacity to amass a match-winning score. That said, Root is due, and I’d like to see it.The chest-guarded Cummins faces up to Wood, who continues with the short stuff. There’s a wide slip, someone at third, and a bat pad. Cummins is uncomfortable. He somehow gets one around the corner for one. Carey’s then backing away trying to slap him through the off-side, but missing. Funky fields and tactics now. Carey’s back and across to the next, which is also short, and he fends it into space behind square for one. Cummins has the last, and he’s jumping then ducking underneath. Whoosh. Cummins laughs as he meets Carey mid-pitch.Broad’s in to Carey now. There’s two slips and a gully, but no pad pad to Australia’s keeper. Carey pulls him sweetly to the boundary rider for one. Cummins then works one to backward square, via the pad, and Billings hares after it to keep it to one. Carey sees off the last. There’s a bat pad for Wood now. He nabs Starc as described. Cummins is next, and Wood is wayward down the legside but Billings gloves it brilliantly, sprawling to his left. Wood is clearly trying to shorten him up, as Cummins ducks another. So Wood comes around the wicket and he hits Cummins. The skipper wanted to duck, it wasn’t that high, and it careers into (what looks like) his forearm.  Broad’s too straight, allowing Carey to tuck him off his hip to square leg for one. Some chat on radio here about who’s ahead ... most agree Australia are by virtue of England missing their opportunity in the first session. Must be said the pitch does now seem decidedly more docile than yesterday. Mike Atherton is also noting that there were some whispers that Craig Overton was set to play yesterday, before Ollie Robinson was included last-minute. I write this as we watch Ben Stokes seek an inspection of the pink ball from the umpire yet again. The cricket’s back on, and Starc looks far more comfortable coming forward to Broad than the guy at the other end. Something’s going on here ... Broad has to pull out of his run-up, just before his gather, and he’s immensely put off by the Fox SpiderCam, or FoxCam, or whatever it’s called. He remonstrates with it. Michael Vaughan laughs nervously, before they cut to SpiderCam. Wood’s first is timed quite nicely off Starc’s pads for one. Wood’s running in hard - though I suppose he always is. Carey gets one to fine leg. His partner Starc rides a throat ball into the ground quite easily, prods the next to mid-on looking a little jumpy, and that’s the over. Broad accompanies Wood. Starc drives handsomely early on but Stokes moves around at mid off and throws the stumps down, too. Starc gets one for his trouble and is off the mark. Carey is trying to drive the next, but can’t beat mid off. The next one is in the same area: Carey leaves, deliberately. Wood starts with a pretty sharp yorker to Carey, he jams it to square leg. Only three balls in this over, not a bad one to start with. Next one beats Carey all ends up, huge appeal, Wood is arm aloft celebrating ... but then there’s doubt, and no review, and replays confirm Carey was nowhere near it. Carey defends the last to mid-off. I said it was cloudy on screen. Well, the sun’s out now! Jerusalem is rung and sung. We’re away.It looks cloudy on screen, but everything’s in readiness to start on time. All in all, Australia finished with 241-6 – a scoreline most would be satisfied with after a full day’s play, only that this was achieved in 59.3 overs. Perhaps this isn’t quite the Chief Executive’s Wicket predicted ahead of the game. Nevertheless, both teams will be hoping to push things on today. For Australia, quick runs and a shot at England under lights, and for England, crossed fingers that the Bellerive wicket does flatten out, as is the local promise.

Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsThe State’s public health team Nphet will meet next week as the Taoiseach says he is “hopeful” that progress can be made on easing restrictions after that.Mr Martin said that the 8pm closing time for hospitality and indoor events will be looked at and that consideration will also be given to a package of supports for entertainers.“Certainly we are making progress in respect of Covid-19 and in respect of Omicron. It has been a very transmissible variant, which in its own way then makes gatherings potentially challenging,” he said.“That said, I want to say pay tribute to the sector for their great tolerance and forbearance has kept with it, with many performances during the day and earlier in the day and really trying to innovate around restrictions. The restrictions are very severe on the sector, there’s no point in saying anything else.”Mr Martin said while he is not yet in a position to say anything definitive on the easing of restrictions , he is hopeful.“We’re making progress against Omicron. There will be a meeting of Nphet next week and I would hope that we would be in a position to move forward in terms of the current restrictions.“We are hopeful in terms of the progress we’ve made to date.”Another 17,065 cases of Covid-19 in the State were reported by Nphet on Friday. The number in hospital with Covid-19 stood at 1,023, of whom 83 are in ICU, according to the latest figures released by the public health team. The number of Covid patients in hospital had increased by 12 since Thursday.Responding to the latest figures, chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan hailed the “exceptional” level of take-up of booster Covid-19 vaccines in the State. “To date, 59 per cent of the adult population here have availed of a booster dose, compared with just 32 per cent across Europe,” he said.Hospital peakTánaiste Leo Varadkar has said it is unlikely there will be a decision on the easing of Covid-19 restrictions until it becomes clear that the numbers in hospitals have peaked. Mr Varadkar, speaking at the new Aldi headquarters in Naas, Co Kildare, said the focus on Covid-19 data had shifted from the number of cases to the number of people in hospitals and in ICU.“It’s not yet clear that the numbers in hospitals have peaked. It is still over 1,000 and in ICU there are just under 100. “So I think we’d like to see hospital numbers and ICU numbers falling before we feel comfortable about easing restrictions.He said the current plan would see the current restrictions remain in place until the 31st of January. He said Nphet was meeting on January 20th and he expected the group to give advice to Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly that evening that will allow the Government to make a decision. He said on that basis, the hospitality industry would get decent advance notice about easing restrictions. Self-isolatingMeanwhile deputy chief medical officer Ronan Glynn has defended changes in the rules around self-isolating for close contacts which come into force today amid concern that they have become too loose. He emphasised that Nphet closely examined and balanced a number of issues before coming to their decision.In an interview on Today with Claire Byrne, on RTÉ Radio 1, he said that regular changes have been made to advice and guidelines during the pandemic given the ever-evolving situation such a virus presents.“The latest changes are in light of our evolving understanding of Omicron, the importance of boosters which is reflected in the guidance, the impact that we have seen on society broadly and our health service specifically over the past number of weeks and obviously what the ECDC said and also other international guidance.“There are certainly reasons for optimism and hope and we see across Europe that a number of countries have experienced a similar picture to ourselves in that the numbers in ICU have remained stable. “But I think it is a little too early for us to conclude on that at this point. We all want that to be true and we all want to move on from this but from our perspective we need another week’s worth of data.”The North’s Department of Health reported that a further four people who previously tested positive for Covid-19 in Northern Ireland have died. Another 2,954 confirmed cases of the virus were also recorded in the North in its latest 24-hour reporting period. On Friday morning, there were 402 Covid-positive patients in the North’s hospitals, with 30 in intensive care.‘Huge impact’Meanwhile, Anne O’ Connor, chief operations officer with the HSE, told The Pat Kenny show on Newstalk that Ireland has 1,023 confirmed Covid cases in hospitals as opposed to 1,011 yesterday. Ms O’Connor said about 70 per cent of patients in that number were hospitalised because of Covid-related illness. The other 30 per cent are patients who presented “perhaps with a broken leg” but were also found to have Covid.Ms O’Connor spoke of the “huge impact” the cases of Covid are having on the overall hospital system.She cited the example of Galway University Hospital which has 15 medical and surgical wards, three of which are now in effect “Covid wards” for Covid admissions.“They have another four wards which are impacted by Covid where they have outbreaks. It is important for people to understand that from our perspective the hospital runs like a whole system. This hampers our ability to discharge people.“For people who are in wards with outbreaks they can’t go on to nursing homes. We don’t have the same freedom to discharge.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"q a what are the new covid rules and what is the logic behind them","story":"People who test positive for Covid-19 on an antigen test will no longer be required to seek a confirmatory PCR test under new rules. File photograph: Damien MeyerAFP via Getty ImagesThe milder impact of the Omicron variant of Covid-19 on infected people and hospitals has led the Government to relax the rules on isolation and testing to allow more people return to work and to protect essential public services. Here is a guide to what you need to know about the new rules in this regard.What are the changes?The Government has agreed to loosen rules on Covid-19 testing, self-isolation guidance for those who test positive for the virus, and restrictions for people who are close contacts of Covid cases.What is the biggest change?The most significant difference is on fully vaccinated close contacts who have received their vaccine booster and are not displaying any symptoms of Covid-19. They no longer have to restrict their movements for five days. Instead, they are being asked to wear a medical (typically blue) or higher-grade face mask (the typically white FFP2N95 variety) for 10 days when in crowded or enclosed spaces and to take regular antigen tests over seven days, with the last test on day seven. Close contacts who have not been boosted only have to restrict their movements for seven days, instead of the 10 previously recommended.Close contacts of any age who have themselves recovered following Covid-19 detected by a PCR or antigen test since December 1st are not required to restrict movements or test if asymptomatic.What effect will these particular changes have?This new arrangement will likely affect tens of thousands of people who are stuck at home and cannot go to work, ensuring – most importantly – that essential services can continue.What is happening with testing?Previously if people between the ages of four and 39 with symptoms tested positive for Covid-19 on an antigen test, they had to get an official PCR test through the HSE to confirm their infection. From now on, anyone who has a positive antigen test no longer needs to go for a PCR test. They can register their positive antigen test result on and upload their close contacts to the HSE’s system and antigen tests will then be sent out to their close contacts.What is changing in relation to the rules for those who test positive for Covid-19?There has been no change in the rule for people who have received the vaccine boosters: if these people test positive, they still have to self-isolate for seven days. For those who have not received a booster dose who test positive, however, they only have to self-isolate for seven days, instead of the 10 previously. In other words, everyone who tests positive for Covid-19 will only have to isolate for seven days. People should only exit self-isolation after seven days if their symptoms have substantially or fully resolved for the final two of those seven days.Are any additional precautions being recommended?For 10 days including any isolation periods, both confirmed Covid-19 cases and close contacts are advised to limit close contacts with people outside their household, especially in crowded, enclosed or poorly ventilated spaces to wear a face mask in crowded spaces to take an antigen test before entering crowded spaces or prior to close contact with others outside their household, and to work from home if possible.Everyone over 12 who tests positive should wear a medical grade or FFP2 face mask for 10 days under this new advice and children aged between nine and 12 who test positive should wear a well-fitted mask for 10 days. Any close contacts over 12 who have not been boosted should wear an FFP2 or medical grade mask for 10 days. The State’s chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan has said that booster vaccines for children aged 12 to 15 will be considered shortly.When will these changes come into effect?From midnight on Thursday, so most people will not enjoy the benefit of these changes until they wake up on Friday morning.Will the State be sending out antigen tests and medical and respirator masks for free?The HSE is already sending out antigen tests to close contacts but the Government is not planning on providing them to the general public. There are no plans to distribute free medical-grade masks or the more expensive FFP2 respirator masks. Opposition parties have called on the Government to cover the cost of both antigen tests and medical grade masks for all households.What has led to these rule changes?New EU advice from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) issued last weekend paved the way, with a change in guidance for close contacts. The ECDC said that if any close contacts had a negative PCR or antigen test, they may not need to restrict their movements so long as they self-monitor for symptoms, continue to wear a mask and stay away from vulnerable groups. Dr Holohan told Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly in a letter on Tuesday that the updated guidance from the ECDC, considering the rapid spread of Omicron in Europe, aimed to provide options on quarantine, particularly when countries face “high or extreme pressure” on health systems and other essential services.What is the motivation to make the changes now when daily case numbers are still so high?The vast number of confirmed Omicron infections since Christmas has affected two or three times this number because of people being identified as close contacts of those cases. Given that Dr Holohan estimated that up to 500,000 people were likely to have been infected last week, this would mean well in excess of 1 million additional people may be forced to stay at home, based on the average number of close contacts. The Government had expressed concern that the rules on close contacts were causing major difficulties for businesses and public services. An estimated 15,000 HSE staff are currently out on Covid-related leave, putting hospitals under severe pressure.Is it premature given the high number of cases?Some have suggested that it is, particularly when the seven-day average of new daily cases is still north of 20,000. Dublin City University immunology professor Christine Loscher expressed surprise at the “blanket” easing of close contact requirements amid concerns over how much more transmissible the Omicron variant was and how little was known about what percentage of close contacts become infected.How do the changes compare with what is happening in other countries?In the UK, since Tuesday, most people with a positive antigen test have not been required to take a confirmatory PCR test to confirm they have Covid-19. Last week, Germany reduced self-isolation for positive Covid-19 cases and close contacts from 14 days to 10, with the option to end their isolation period on day seven with a Covid-19 test. The US has gone further, reducing the amount of time that confirmed Covid-19 cases must isolate to five days last month.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"hybrid leaving cert not ruled out by government says taoiseach","story":"Taoiseach Micheál Martin: ‘We are making adjustments and accommodations will be made, there will be more choices within the papers.’ Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsTaoiseach Micheál Martin has said the Government have “not ruled out” a hybrid Leaving Cert this year and a decision should be made within the coming weeks. Speaking on RTÉ’s Late Late show, Micheál Martin said discussions between education stakeholders are ongoing.The hybrid model caused grade inflation and put pressure on the third level system, he added. Regarding Covid-19, he said hospitalisations had remained steady and case numbers were stabilising, albeit at a high level. Mr Martin said he was optimistic for the first time in months, and further easing of restrictions would be considered by the end of next week with the potential for removing some restrictions by the end of the month. Mr Martin said the 8pm curfew on hospitality was introduced to reduce socialisation, and he hoped it would be lifted by February.“We wanted to get mobility down by 20-30 per cent ... we felt correctly we could halt the impact of Omicron.”He was conscious that hospitality and the arts had been badly hit by the pandemic. Mr Martin also said this measure was in place to ensure the schools could reopen, and he didn’t expect them to close again.He also thanked the Irish people for following public health guidance and getting vaccinated. The booster programme, especially the GPs and pharmacists who “played a blinder” before Christmas, played a role in ensuring the Omicron wave was not as serious as it could have been, according to Mr Martin. Ireland is currently developing a more long-term vaccination strategy, the Taoiseach added. “I can see the potential of a fourth dose for over 60s and the immunocompromised.

Good leadership is not just about having the confidence to do what you believe is right – but being brave enough actually to take that final decision, however difficult it may be. If we have learnt anything this week, then it is that Boris Johnson, and indeed the Tory party, could learn a lot from the Queen when it comes to doing the right thing.As the Prime Minister has refused to face up to his responsibilities – cowardly devolving his own decision-making to Sue Gray (with the support of the majority of his equally spineless Conservative colleagues), Her Majesty has shown the country how it should be done. In dethroning the Duke of York, her second, and some say, “favourite” son, the 95-year-old monarch has demonstrated the importance of a quality that currently appears otherwise absent from public life: accountability.The crisis that is engulfing the Prime Minister is not dissimilar to Prince Andrew’s situation. Both protest their innocence yet have been found guilty of bringing the institutions to which they belong into disrepute. Mr Johnson insisted at PMQs on Wednesday that Partygate may “technically” fall within the guidelines in the same way Andrew tried to argue that Virginia Giuffre Roberts should “technically” not be able to sue him after signing a 2009 settlement with Jeffrey Epstein.Both have at times behaved as if they are “bigger” than the organisations they are supposed to serve.Yet regardless of their guilt or innocence, what really unites these two men who, along with the similarly cavalier Novak Djokovic, have dominated the week’s headlines is their catastrophic lack of judgment.When the 61-year-old royal stayed with Epstein in New York in 2011, after he had been imprisoned for prostituting children, people rightly asked: what on earth was he doing there? The response to Mr Johnson’s 25-minute presence at No 10’s lockdown-busting BYOB bash has been similarly incredulous. Why didn’t he say anything when he must have known it was wrong? And are you only showing contrition because you have been caught?While I appreciate these two middle-aged, public-school boys are at opposing ends of the cerebral spectrum, they are surely unified in the stupidity of not only behaving as if they were somehow above the law, but also thinking the masses would let them get away with it. As Andrew has discovered to his peril, once you have been found guilty in the court of public opinion, there is little room left for manoeuvre.At least he has finally come to appreciate the damage he has done to the monarchy, albeit with considerable encouragement from his mother, the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Cambridge.In agreeing to be stripped of his royal patronages and military affiliations as well as official use of his HRH style, Andrew has finally managed his own liability, preventing yet another year – and a Platinum Jubilee no less – from being overshadowed by more allegations and innuendo.Note how quickly the Queen acted, echoing the assertiveness with which she managed the departure of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex from the Firm, and the fallout from the Oprah Winfrey interview (“recollections may vary but they remain much loved members of the family”). Andrew was forced to step back from public duties four days after his car crash Newsnight interview in November 2019. It took little over 24 hours for him to be completely stripped of his royal status after Judge Lewis Kaplan said the civil case against him would go to trial in New York. Brutal, yes, but straight from the textbook of “effective management”: consistent, clear, well communicated, collaborative and, most crucially, led by example.If only the same could be said of Mr Johnson, his Cabinet and his party.If the Prime Minister’s lame apology wasn’t insulting enough to the electorate, we now find him in a state of self-imposed limbo, “isolating” when he doesn’t even need to as Whitehall produces its own version of 50 Shades of Gray. There are already reports that the civil servant Sue Gray, described to me as “fearless and bloody lovely”, has not yet uncovered enough evidence of criminality to refer the matter to the police, and that she is expected to avoid drawing a conclusion over whether Mr Johnson broke the ministerial code. Allies of the Prime Minister believe he is likely to get a “rap on the knuckles” and could survive the scandal.But, just as Andrew is finished as a royal regardless of the outcome of any future legal proceedings, can Conservatives from the top down not see that this is game over?In the eyes of the voters – this is a black and white issue. It’s not about “technicalities” or, pardon the pun, “grey areas” but a simple case of right and wrong.And, furthermore, can Tories not understand that the longer Mr Johnson remains in post, the more the party is going to suffer from the collateral damage?Actually, Sir Keir Starmer made a mistake in calling for the Prime Minister’s resignation on Wednesday. If the Labour leader had any sense, he’d keep Mr Johnson in post for as long as possible and watch the Government’s poll rating tank even further. It’s precisely what the Tories did with Jeremy Corbyn.Boris Johnson was undoubtedly the right politician to “get Brexit done” and win a Conservative majority two years ago. For having kept the keys to No 10 out of the hands of Mr Corbyn, a shameful enabler of anti-Semitism and a man whose hard-Left programme would have immiserated this country, Johnson deserves the undying gratitude of his party and his country.And were it not for the pandemic, he may well have performed better. Having to deal with the biggest national emergency in peacetime – and almost dying in the process – must have been extraordinarily difficult, not least when it required him to sacrifice his libertarian instincts on the altar of state control. And I do not doubt for one minute his sense of patriotism and fervent desire to make Britain a global free-trade pioneer post Brexit.He should also be commended for the success of the vaccine rollout and his decision not to impose further coronavirus restrictions before Christmas in the face of yet more hysterical scaremongering by Sage scientists and the devolved administrations.He remains an extremely effective political communicator and, contrary to what the haters might have you believe, hugely personable. He is undoubtedly one of the most influential public figures of the 21st century.But let’s not pretend he is still fit for purpose. Not after he allowed our loved ones to die alone while Downing Street staff “made the most of the sunny weather”.And let’s not delude ourselves into thinking the Tories can’t survive without him, either, not least when his whole schtick, all these years, has been that he transcends the party.There has been a lot of talk this week of people “never voting for the Tories again”, even though, as has ever been the case, their beef is really with Boris and Boris alone. Which is why he and he alone must take responsibility and be accountable for his own actions.The stark reality of this sorry saga is that Conservatism itself will struggle to endure if it remains associated with someone perceived to disrespect everything it stands for: the rule of law, fiscal responsibility, and human dignity.More from NewsNovak Djokovic detained again after Australian government tells court he is a threat to the publicChanging Watford\u0026#39s Imperialist street names will come at a cost to residentsPrincess Beatrice spared being dragged into Prince Andrew sexual abuse caseIt\u0026#39s time for the Tories to rediscover their valuesPrior Covid infection confers ‘helper’ and ‘killer’ T-cells that protect against omicronPlan B restrictions to be scrapped as Boris Johnson plots fightbackMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"could jacob rees mogg save scottish conservatives","story":"For a party that boasts of its commitment to preserving the “precious” Union of nations that is the United Kingdom, the Conservatives have won more plaudits from the SNP than from Unionists this week.The humiliating description of Douglas Ross, the Scottish Conservative leader, by Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the House of Commons, as lacking in substance, following the former’s public demand that Boris Johnson resigns over the ongoing “Partygate” scandal, was yet another unforced error in what is becoming a never ending series of them for the Government. But could Rees-Mogg’s ill-mannered put down of Ross hold a key to future Scottish Tory success? Bear with me.Our history lesson for today is based not on events in the Tory party, but those that took place in Labour in the immediate aftermath of devolution. It is frequently forgotten that in Wales, Tony Blair insisted on a clumsy contrivance of party rules to impose his preferred candidate, Alun Michael, for first minister over the more popular Rhodri Morgan.It all ended in tears, and after Michael was forced to resign as first minister less than a year later, Morgan was formally appointed in his place. It was an important milestone for a devolved party that was flexing its muscles for the first time and demanding that its members’ views must take precedence over those of the UK leadership.Note the difference in fortunes of Welsh Labour and their comrades in the similarly devolved Scottish Labour, where the party has fallen to third party status with a single MP returned to Westminster. At Holyrood, with former secretary of state for Scotland, Donald Dewar, as first minister, the new Labour-Liberal Democrat coalition Scottish Executive bent over backwards to accommodate the UK government, as if believing that devolved and Westminster ministers had a duty to maintain some kind of collective ministerial responsibility, with the agenda set by the prime minister. Departing Scottish leader Johann Lamont effectively condemned her own party to long-term irrelevance when, in 2014, she described it, infamously, as no more than a branch office of the UK party. She should not have said it (especially since a general election was looming) but she was probably right.Scottish Labour’s demise, while remarkably short in terms of time, is complex, and the extent to which its reluctance to define itself against its UK counterpart plays a role in that downwards trajectory remains a matter for conjecture. Still, the difference in the party’s fortunes in Wales should give party leaders some food for thought.Like Scottish Labour, the Scottish Conservatives have been the subject of an ongoing debate as to whether it should split from the UK party and set itself up as a solely Scottish entity, whose rules, candidate selection and funding would all be decided north of the border without reference to the national HQ. Such a prospect has been resisted by the membership but no doubt the recent drinks-based shenanigans in Downing Street and the troubled waters threatening to overwhelm Boris Johnson’s leadership will restart the debate about cutting the Scottish party off from its “toxic” sibling.Rees-Mogg’s comments about Ross will have crystallised the problem for many. But perhaps, unwittingly, the leader of the House has provided Ross and his colleagues with a helpful jumping off point for a reinvigorated Scottish Conservative Party. If the Rhodri Morgan experience allowed Welsh Labour to carve out its own identity and autonomy, then perhaps this week will allow Ross to follow that example in a way that Scottish Labour failed to do.There would be no need to set up separate, independent structures or rebrand the party in fact, doing so would be an outright capitulation to nationalism and would benefit the independence cause far more than the Union. Welsh Labour remains part of UK Labour yet is seen as feisty and independent-minded and, crucially, is trusted to stand up for Wales against a UK government of whatever political colour. This is at least partly due to its initial belligerence towards London interference at the very start of the devolution experiment.If the timing of the Rhodri Revolution was key, then Douglas Ross’s own small act of rebellion against Boris Johnson may have come too late. But there’s nothing he can do about that, and his high-profile stand will at least earn him the respect of middle ground Scottish voters who would not vote for a Scottish Conservative Party that was seen to be under Boris Johnson’s influence.We often commend politicians for their willingness to state publicly their differences with the official line promoted by their party. By such measures are they judged to be heavyweights or lightweights, so Rees-Mogg was wholly wrong about the Scottish Conservative leader, whether he was right or wrong to call for the prime minister’s head. Ross has decided to put what he sees as the good of his country over loyalty to his party. However his opponents, internal and external, want to paint it, that is to be commended. And it could be the start of something bigger.More from NewsNovak Djokovic detained again after Australian government tells court he is a threat to the publicChanging Watford\u0026#39s Imperialist street names will come at a cost to residentsPrincess Beatrice spared being dragged into Prince Andrew sexual abuse caseIt\u0026#39s time for the Tories to rediscover their valuesPrior Covid infection confers ‘helper’ and ‘killer’ T-cells that protect against omicronPlan B restrictions to be scrapped as Boris Johnson plots fightbackMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"jamaican skier slaloms way history qualifying winter olympics","story":"Jamaica has long punched above its weight at the Summer Olympics, but when it comes to the winter event, the tropical island rarely makes waves.But a British-Jamaican skier hopes to change that, having qualified for Beijing 2022 despite at one point last year ranking just 3748th in the world. Benjamin Alexander, who grew up in Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, had a career in international finance and then as a DJ before taking up skiing just six years ago.He has among his mentors Dudley ‘Tal’ Stokes, a member of the 1988 Jamaican bobsleigh team, immortalised in the Disney film Cool Runnings.In October of last year, Mr Alexander said he was ranked just 3748th in the world at giant slalom, his chosen event. However, the Winter Olympics has a lower barrier to entry for nations that don’t usually qualify. That allowed Mr Alexander, who has a Jamaican father, to “nerd out” over the International Ski Federations’ database and target the races he competed in.On Wednesday, he secured qualification for Beijing 2022 by coming seventh in the Cape Verde National Ski Championships in Liechtenstein.Mr Alexander, who once worked in Hong Kong for an international financial company, told Olympics that he had spent “30-40 hours” plotting the races he needed to take part in and the times he needed to achieve to qualify for Beijing.He was “trying to look for patterns, trying to look for races that might be a little bit more favourable”, he said, which included looking at how many people were competing in each race and targeting those with fewer competitors.“I\u0027ve totally nerded out on that database and I have my own version of it, my own spreadsheet, which has all of the links to all of the information about the race and the historical races, so at any moment, if I decide to change my plan, I can just go into my own database and figure it out,” he said. Jamaica’s first Olympic skier only sampled the sport for the first time in 2016, spending most of that time falling over. Within two years, however, he had settled on the idea of hanging up his DJ’s headset and becoming a professional skier. The East Midlands native knew he never had any hope of competing for Team GB with its well-funded athletes, but after watching the 2018 Olympics he realised that there might be a chance of donning the black, green and gold of Jamaica. In 2019, he spent a day working with a former US Olympic skier, Gordon Gray. Mr Gray told him that his technique was “absolutely atrocious”, Mr Alexander told the BBC this week, but despite that, he managed to keep up with his coach.“You’re fearless, the fact that you’re fearless means you have more than half the battle won”, Mr Alexander said Mr Gray told him.From that base, Mr Alexander has built his international career. As recently as March, the Caribbean athlete was seven seconds off where he needed to be to qualify. He attributes his subsequent success to his inexperience.“Because I’m coming from such a low base, my improvements are happening very very rapidly,” he said.Being an outsider with little hope of a medal is not without its pressures, however. According to Mr Alexander, he initially looked to skiing as a “purely selfish pursuit”, but in the wake of the death of George Floyd and the protests that followed there was a “pressure to do this thing and perform” as one of the few black athletes in winter sports.Even now, a black man in professional skiing is a rare sight. “With my black friends, I’m the white person. With my white friends, I’m the black person. In skiing, I’m always the black person,” Mr Alexander told Time last month.It also meant he faced the same ribbing on a regular basis: “I got the same joke on the slopes that any Jamaican probably gets when they’re near a winter sport: ‘are you part of the Jamaican bobsled team?’”Rather than a slight, Mr Alexander, a fan of the 1993 film, took it as inspiration. “There is a little bit of pressure there being the one guy that’s going to go out there and do it, but I’m really happy to be that person,” he told the Daily Mirror recently, “I hope I can do us proud, both Jamaica and minorities.”More from NewsNovak Djokovic detained again after Australian government tells court he is a threat to the publicChanging Watford\u0026#39s Imperialist street names will come at a cost to residentsPrincess Beatrice spared being dragged into Prince Andrew sexual abuse caseIt\u0026#39s time for the Tories to rediscover their valuesPrior Covid infection confers ‘helper’ and ‘killer’ T-cells that protect against omicronPlan B restrictions to be scrapped as Boris Johnson plots fightbackMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"kew gardens change wont decolonising","story":"The director of Royal Botanic Gardens Kew has said that the institution is an “exemplar” of the Government’s policy to retain contentious history, after removing a promise to “decolonise” from its manifesto for change.Speaking exclusively to The , Richard Deverell said that the gardens’ plans to increase access and “improve equity” would go ahead as planned and were entirely in keeping with government policy.In March last year, Kew launched a 10-year “manifesto for change” that included a promise to “decolonise our collections”. That was subsequently rephrased to “re-examine our collections” following a backlash.Mr Deverell was speaking as Kew launched a new £1 ticket for those on Universal Credit and pension credit to broaden access to the site. Talking to The  on a grey and wet day at Kew, with the remnants of the Christmas light show being dismantled, Mr Deverell appeared, above all, bemused and a little indignant that his organisation had been dragged into a debate usually reserved for looted objects and statues of slavers.Mr Deverell initially pursued a punchy and defiant response to critics of the language in the manifesto, but has now, to an extent, walked back from it.Much of the reaction, he claimed, had been “asserting that we are doing things that we are simply not doing.“At first I found it amusing, And subsequently, it was actually quite annoying, because it was causing a lot of distraction. It’s why we dropped that word from our manifesto. It was causing heat, but not light.”While other public institutions are toppling statues or looking to send items back to their countries of origin, Kew is not removing any of its collection, Mr Deverell insisted.And although displays will be updated, there will not be a “didactic or hectoring tone”.“You’re not going to read anything, I think, that is critical of Kew’s, or indeed British history. What you will see, I hope, is a broader and actually, I think, more interesting and engaging set of stories that links our historical roots to contemporary issues,” he said.The whole programme, he said, made Kew “an exemplar of retain and explain”, the Government’s stance on contested history, “we are not removing anything we are seeking to broaden the stories we tell”.On a walk through the Chinese Grove, below Kew’s historic giant pagoda, Mr Deverell pointed to newer interpretation signs that included mentions of how Britain’s victory in the Opium Wars opened China up to Western botanists, explained how locals used plants well before Europeans “discovered” them and detailed the help Chinese iniduals had given to these foreign scientists.This was not, Mr Deverell was adamant, an admonishment of Kew’s history, but rather the correction of an attitude that “too often implied that white British men from Kew did it all on their own”. One focus of the row over the manifesto has been the suggestion that the story of slavery would be added to panels about sugar cane. On this, Mr Deverell was unapologetic.Mr Deverell was also at pains to point out that these changes were “really quite subtle” and a “touch on the tiller”.Moreover, they are only a fraction of RBG Kew’s work and its pledge to extend its reach and improve equity, which also involves conservation efforts and botanical research across the world.Most of the changes contained in the manifesto are focused on international conservation efforts aimed at fighting climate change and the bioersity crisis, including those reforms previously labelled as “decolonising”.The “number one priority” is digitising Kew’s vast collection of dried plants and fungi and granting access to scientists and ecologists from where the flora originated.“We gathered these specimens from around the world and they need to be available to the practitioners and scientists who work in those countries,” he said, adding “this is primarily about the outcomes we want to see, we want to see those tropical ecosystems protected and restored.”The Government is supportive of that project, with £15 million of public funding being made available to the digitisation project.Asked if he was surprised that Government ministers hadn’t spoken out to defend Kew, he demurred: “They’re busy people,” he said, but pointed out that he had received a supportive personal letter from Michael Gove, the former environment secretary, and that the current minister, George Eustice, had launched Defra’s Cop26 programme at Kew.He was not, however, concerned that future guidelines from the Government’s Heritage Advisory Board would cause Kew any trouble.“We’re not apologizing. We’re not trashing history. We’re not censoring. We’re not removing anything. So I would be interested to know if there is a concern? If so, help me understand it, because I don’t believe there are any grounds for concern.”More from NewsNovak Djokovic detained again after Australian government tells court he is a threat to the publicChanging Watford\u0026#39s Imperialist street names will come at a cost to residentsPrincess Beatrice spared being dragged into Prince Andrew sexual abuse caseIt\u0026#39s time for the Tories to rediscover their valuesPrior Covid infection confers ‘helper’ and ‘killer’ T-cells that protect against omicronPlan B restrictions to be scrapped as Boris Johnson plots fightbackMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph weekly news quiz cabinet minister got stuck lift bbc","story":"In the week that saw Boris Johnson admit to attending a Downing Street garden party on May 20, 2020 to the Novak Djokovic visa row, The \u0027s news quiz is here to find out how closely you have been paying attention to the headlines.In a medical first that could offer hope to huge numbers of people with failing organs, doctors have transplanted what into a human patient?Also this week, who was called a lightweight in a series of scathing comments made by Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg after telling the Prime Minister he should resign?If you\u0027ve been reading this week\u0027s  Front Page newsletters you will have come across all of the answers to the quiz.

The reputation of the former was assailed by endless revelations of lockdown parties the latter by allegations of sexual misconduct levelled at the Duke of York. It would be a dispiriting state of affairs at any time, but is especially so for a country desperate to put two years of pandemic suffering behind it. Instead of being hauled back by revelations from the past, voters want to look to the future — to the kind of thriving, entrepreneurial, economically confident, low-tax country that the Conservative Party is historically celebrated for building.The Queen, as so often, has shown the way, doing as much as is possible to ensure that the Virginia Giuffre affair can no longer tarnish the institution she leads with such grace. The banishment of her second, and reportedly favourite, son can by no means have been easy. But she, in concert with Princes Charles and William, has acted decisively and in the interest of those who honour the history, continuity and tradition of a monarchy that unites us all. No 10 could follow suit by anticipating, rather than meekly awaiting, the Sue Gray report, which it has used as an ever-less effective shield against legitimate questions about lockdown breaches. The Prime Minister should act with vigour to demonstrate that Downing Street is staffed by an effective team dedicated to driving through an agenda that has for too long been undermined by epidemiological or ideological ersions.On the former, the time has come, after two years, to abandon definitively the prospect of future restrictions and isolations, with their dreadful consequences on mental health and school disruption, hospital waiting lists and staff shortages. Such rules have never made complete sense. Voters are not angry, for example, because Downing Street held parties outside. They are angry because they were denied the opportunity to enjoy themselves in the same common sense way. They vividly remember being ushered off park benches by officials in high-vis jackets, or chased from sports pitches by the police.The utter illogicality of such rules was exposed this week in the Prime Minister’s apology – “I should have sent everyone back inside” – which of course would have been far less safe than keeping his staff in the garden. The public’s stories of contrasting sacrifices are hard enough to hear but the fury of those who made them is intensified because many draconian rules were always bafflingly irrelevant to the fight against Covid. One day, when we return to normality, they must be given an explanation and, in many cases, an apology.Normality must come soon, and for good. Despite the doom-laden warnings, omicron has proved to be a variant less severe than its predecessors. Henceforth Covid-19 — like flu — must be a disease we live with, not hide from. With that attitude clear, businesses will have the confidence to rebuild and grow again. We already know this can happen. In November, before the Plan B freeze in response to Omicron, the economy grew strongly, and was larger than before the pandemic. Since then, inevitably, it has contracted again.Sadly though, just as the worst of the winter is put behind us, the Government seems intent on making another significant mistake, persisting with tax hikes to fund an NHS which needs reform to ensure its money is spent wisely. This year a staggering 40 per cent of day-to-day departmental government expenditure will go on the NHS or social care.It is another example of sensible Conservative instincts being jettisoned. Doing so comes at a very real cost, as the Prime Minister may be about to find out. It is clear he instinctively felt outside Downing Street parties were perfectly sensible. Ironically, he may now be punished not because he was wrong, but because he was right, but still imposed the wrong path on the rest of the country.This weekend Tory MPs will be back in their constituencies, and doubtless be bombarded by outrage. Economically and ideologically they will be forced to reflect on what the Tory party should stand for.Their leader, the man who promised buccaneering freedom, has delivered crimped, polling-led policies and pettifogging restrictions which, with mask mandates and work from home orders, endure to this day. As Lord Frost makes clear in his interview elsewhere on these pages today, if the Conservatives are to come through, whoever is in charge, they must reaffirm and champion the principles of growth and, above all, liberty.More from NewsNovak Djokovic detained again after Australian government tells court he is a threat to the publicChanging Watford\u0026#39s Imperialist street names will come at a cost to residentsPrincess Beatrice spared being dragged into Prince Andrew sexual abuse casePrior Covid infection confers ‘helper’ and ‘killer’ T-cells that protect against omicronPlan B restrictions to be scrapped as Boris Johnson plots fightbackWoman fined £12,000 for birthday party on day after Downing Street eventsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"downing street party inquiry loophole","story":"Downing Street party inquiry loophole could let Boris Johnson decide his own punishmentSue Grays independent report has been hailed by Cabinet ministers.

Sue Gray’s report will make findings of fact, but it’ll be for police to punish lockdown breaches - and for the Prime Minister’s advisor on ministerial interests, Lord Geidt, to look at any breaches of the Code.  Lord Geidt can only start an investigation on the say-so of… Boris Johnson. And evenhe finds the Code has been broken, Boris Johnson can overrule him.Deputy Labour leader Angela Rayner said: “The PM has set the terms of Sue Gray’s probe and he has chosen to exclude the conduct of Ministers from it, creating a neat loophole for himself.“Any judgement on the conduct of Boris Johnson goes to... Boris Johnson. “A farcical circular process from a Prime Minister that will escape responsibility in any way he can. He has managed to make himself judge and jury even though he is the man in the dock. So how on earth does this all work  We’ve looked into the ious rulebooks, documents and terms of reference, and explain the process below…What is Sue Gray investigating Sue Gray is investigating a string of parties in Whitehall between May  and April  - mostly in  Downing Street and its garden. The -year-old took over the inquiry from Cabinet Secretary Simon Case after it emerged a party had been held in his own office. Her inquiry includes four events the PM is accused of attending:May : Garden party at Noin which Boris and Carrie Johnson were pictured in the garden with wine, cheese and more than a dozen other people. No said this was an outdoor work meeting.May : Second garden party at Nowith more than  staff told to aposBYOBapos by top civil servant Martin Reynolds.November : Leaving doSources told the Mirror  to  people crammed into a room in No to see off top aide Cleo Watson.December : Christmas quizThe Prime Minister was on screen flanked by two colleagues, one wearing a Santa hat, while the other was draped in tinsel. Will Sue Gray issue any punishment to Boris Johnson No. Her inquiry has been set up to get “a general understanding of the nature of the gatherings”. That means saying who attended, the “setting and the purpose”, and “reference to adherence to the guidance in place at the time”. This suggests her report might - for example - say Boris Johnson was at a party, and some comment on lockdown rules. If necessary the report will recommend “inidual disciplinary action”. But it appears this would only be against civil servants, not ministers. That’s because “any matters relating to the conduct of Ministers” will have to “follow the process set out in the Ministerial Code.” The Ministerial Code adds: “It is not the role of the Cabinet Secretary or other officials to enforce the Code.”  Catherine Haddon of the Institute for Government said in a blog: “Gray’s report is set to be a largely factual account about parties that were held in Downing Street. It may not assign inidual blame but might refer disciplinary action to others.“It may touch on the role of the prime minister, but it isn’t Grayaposs place to judge his behaviour.“The bare facts alone could prove deeply damaging, and how she sets them out, and the language used, may indicate her view on the seriousness of what has happened and the wider culture that allowed it to happen.”What happens nextthe PM might have broken the Ministerial Code The Ministerial Code says politicians “should be truthful”, and must “comply with the law and protect the integrity of public le”. If it’s possible that Boris Johnson broke the Code, then it’s not for Sue Gray to investigate. Instead, it gets referred to Independent Advisor on Ministerial Interests Lord Geidt - the same man who probed the No flat. He has the power to provide advice on whether the Code has been broken. No said: “It remains for the Prime Minister’s advisor Lord Geidt -he wishes to raise an issue with him, the PM will obviously consider that carefully.” Can Lord Geidt trigger an investigation whenever he likes Nope! He can only trigger an investigation with the permission of… Boris Johnson. Government guidance says,Lord Geidt thinks an alleged breach “might warrant further investigation”, he can “raise the issue confidentially with the Prime Minister”. But it’s for Boris Johnson to decidehe should “refer” the matter to Lord Geidt for investigation. Lord Geidt wants to change this and gain the power to launch his own investigations, according to The Times. If Lord Geidt finds the PM broke the rules, what happens next Lord Geidt gives his report to Boris Johnson, and any punishment is then decided by… Boris Johnson. The Ministerial Code is clear - the PM is the “ultimate judge of the standards of behaviour expected of a Minister”. And the Prime Minister also decides “the appropriate consequences of a breach of those standards”.This was in evidence when the last Advisor ruled Priti Patel had broken the Ministerial Code - but the PM overruled him, and decided she hadn’t.The Code isn’t explicit, but it seems this applies even when the person accused of breaking the rules is Boris Johnson. That would mean Boris Johnson could rule there’s been no breach of the Code, or decide not to inflict any punishment on himself. He can ask the Advisor to spell out a recommended sanction, but “these recommendations will remain confidential”. Finally… what about the police That’s a dferent process. It’s one part of the jigsaw not overseen by Boris Johnson. The Met Police can launch an investigation - and eventually prosecutions - into the ious No partiesthey want. However, so far they’ve not done this, and they’ve indicated they will wait until Sue Gray finishes her work before making a decision. Many are sceptical that the police will investigate retrospectively. Scotland Yard has insisted officers are still assessing the material on the May  garden event and a decision could be made either way. Solicitors for the Met told the Good Law Project: “The available material relating to the gathering on  May  has been referred to the Specialist Enquiry Teamfor assessment. “In accordance with the approach outlined in my response dated  December , the findings of the SET assessment, once finalised, will be considered by the Gold Group to determine the appropriate MPS response.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON CabinetScotland Yardpolitan PoliceBoris JohnsonCivil servantsPublic servicesPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

But in the basement, staff had wheeled in a suitcase of wine and were blaring out tunes from a laptopThe view over the fence into the highly-obscured Downing Street garden, when a marquee was erected in May  for Boris Johnsons wedding reception Image: Ben Cawthra LNPByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  Jan Updated:,  Jan | comments On the roof of  Downing Street, the Union flag was flying at half-mast in mourning for Prince Philip.But in the basement, a staffer nicknamed “DJ” was blaring out tunes from a laptop on a photocopier at a boozy party. Excruciating new claims have emerged of two staff leaving dos at the same time in No on the night of Friday  April.One No staffer was reportedly dispatched to the Co-Op on the Strand,  minutes’ walk away, to fill a suitcase with wine. They would have wheeled it back through Trafalgar Square, where lockdown law banned Brits meeting in groups of more than six. A source told the Mirror they slipped into No through a back entrance, using a keypad to get in away from watchful police.  Staff later spilled into the garden, which is shielded from view from Horse Guards Parade by high brick walls topped with security wire. They tried a swing belonging to the PM’s one-year-old son. They reportedly broke it in the process. Riotous staff were said to be saying goodbye to a photographer, at the same time as a separate leaving do for spin chief James Slack. The Prime Minister’s former official spokesman, who left the Daily Mail to rise through the ranks to comms director at No, gave a leaving speech where in the building, before the two parties allegedly merged. I wish to apologise unreservedly for the anger and hurt caused,” Mr Slack, now an executive at The Sun, said today. He added: “This event should not have happened at the time that it did. That’s something of an understatement. The next day, the Queen sat alone at her husband’s funeral - one of the defining images of the pandemic.  And the staff behaviour could not be more dferent from either the grieving for the Duke of Edinburgh, or their own Covid laws. A week earlier, the UK had entered a period of “national mourning” and government communications were put into a blackout. There were no Covid press conferences, no ministerial interviews, and no press releases other than essential public health ones. Ministers and civil servants were told they should wear dark clothes and a black tie in any public-facing events. Not even SAGE papers on Covid were published, with the mourning ending only at .pm on Saturday. Meanwhile, England was still in its third lockdown, with most gatherings illegal.Desperate to contain lockdown-weary Brits, Priti Patel had announced £ fines for people who attend house parties - much higher than the £ fine for attending most illegal gatherings. Organisers could be fined £,.Four days before the boozy No bash, some rules were eased in ‘step ’ of England’s roadmap. But indoor social gatherings between dferent households were still illegal, and outdoors they were limited to the rule of six. Non-essential shops, hairdressers and public buildings like libraries had all been shut until the week of the No bash. Even people who met outdoors were warned not to hug, and to maintain two-metre social distancing where possible. Fears were also growing in No of the Indian iant of Covid - now known as Delta.  The day before the party, UK authorities announced the first  cases of the B.. iant had been detected in the UK. Hours before staff kicked back, the PM’s deputy official spokesman told reporters Mr Johnson’s visit to India was scaled back. It’s against this backdrop that No staff drank alcohol and danced “well beyond midnight”, one source told the . No aide Shelley Williams-Walker was reportedly nicknamed ‘DJ SWW’ after playing tunes from a laptop in the basement. A total of  people attended the two parties, according to the newspaper.No insist Boris Johnson was not there at the time. According to the , he had left for Chequers, his country retreat, on the Thursday - a day before the party. He spent Prince Philip’s funeral at the grace-and-favour mansion, watching it on TV to ease up on the -mourner limit. His last engagement before that was to visit a naval college in Devon on the Thursday, as part of tributes for the Duke. Yet in briefings for the press, the PM’s spokesmen did not appear to mention that Mr Johnson would be going to Chequers until Friday. Even then, they said the Prime Minister “will be at Chequers tomorrow”, rather than claiming he had already been there for more than a day. Supposing No’s version of events is completely accurate, the next question is - when did the PM find out  And what did he do about it  Evenhe did not know, as Labour MP Jess Phillips said: “The fish rots from the head. “The culture in Downing Street is one of disregard and impunity. Do you think this would have happened under Theresa May ”Both parties are now being investigated by Whitehall enforcer Sue Gray, a minister said today. Key to the defence will be whether staff thought they were work gatherings. But this defence appears to be shattered by the suitcase of booze, the tunes on the laptop and the broken swing. Most MPs are keeping their counsel until Ms Gray reports back - and there are concerns the PM could get away with it. The Ministerial Code suggests he will make the final decision on any sanction on himself. And the Met Police have indicated they will only investigateMs Gray finds evidence of criminality - which The Times reported she is unlikely to do.  But even before last night’s revelations, a Tory association had backed Mr Johnson’s removal and five of his own MPs - including his Scottish leader - had called for him to quit. Deputy Labour leader Angela Rayner said: We have a Prime Minister up to his neck in scandals of his own making. He can no longer do his job but is so desperate to save his own skin he is looking for anyone  to blame. He canapost keep hiding. The Prime Minister needs to make a public statement on this latest revelation today, quickly followed by his resignation.” A No spokesman said of Mr Slackaposs farewell event: On this inidualaposs last day he gave a farewell speech to thank each team for the work they had done to support him, both those who had to be in the office for work and on a screen for those working from home.

The UKs levelling up fund is a measly £.bn in totalProfessor Dominic Harrison said levelling up Britain would require a herculean effort Image: GrabByKevin MaguireAssociate editor:,  Jan | commentsBridging the gulf between North and South is like reunying Germany after the end of the Cold War, says Prof Dominic Harrison, Director of Public Health and Wellbeing at Blackburn with Darwen council.He argues that truly levelling up in Britain would require a Herculean effort on the scale of that launched  years ago to bring together poorer Communist East and richer capitalist West Germany to create today’s European powerhouse.He says: “That took them many years and West Germany had to invest loads in East Germany and now by miles and miles they are Europe’s bankers. “Levelling up the North, because of the dferences we’ve got, is going to be like reuniting Germany.” Germany spent the equivalent of £billion a year between  and  on reunication. The UK’s levelling up fund is a measly £.bn in total, according to the Centre for Cities think-tank.  Prof Harrison calls for a -year plan backed by serious money and genuine devolution for the North. In his Lancashire patch, le expectancy for men is ., three years less than England’s . average, while for women it is . instead of .. Prof Harrison says: “We are  years behind the average England le expectancy in Blackburn with Darwen. “One narrative is levelling up. The other narrative is left behind.” He blames deep-seated inequalities, such as a pay gap of £ an hour between North and South, combining to make le tougher, with economic hardships ruining health. Levelling up is supposed to be the big idea of Boris Johnson’s government.When he was elected in  he pledged to spread opportunity to every corner of the UK. But two years later we are still waiting for the Prime Minister to deliver on his promises. A White Paper setting out the Government’s plan was supposed to have been published this month but has now been shelved until the new year.Many are starting to question whether Mr Johnson is genuinely committed to spreading wealth and opportunity orlevelling up is just an empty slogan. That is why the Mirror is today launching Levelling Up Watch. We intend to hold the Government to account over its plans to improve schools, communities, education and transport. We also want to see any additional money distributed fairly and not just to seats the Tories need to retain to stay in power. What is clear is tinkering with the structure of local government and sprinkling money on piecemeal transport schemes will not be enough. The regional inequality in Britain is not only deep and engrained, it has become starker since the Conservatives came to power in . During that period more than , Sure Start Centres have closed, local councils have seen their funding cut by more than % and the budgets for public health and education have been badly squeezed. The National Audit Office found that since , funding in the most deprived fth of schools fell in real terms by .%, while funding in the fth least deprived schools rose by .%. The additional money announced by Chancellor Rishi Sunak in his Budget will onlyper pupil funding to  levels. People in poorer areas are likely to have worse health and shorter le expectancy but the budget for Public Health England in - is % – £billion – lower in real terms than in -. Nor can it be right that - transport spending was £ per capita in London, compared to £ in the North East and £ in Yorkshire and Humber. We have heard plenty of words from Mr Johnson about his ambitions to level up but the time for rhetoric is over. We need to see some action.  He says: “What companies pay you, how well you’ve been educated, what your transport links are –you go through those drivers of inequality,you live in the North you are less invested in than in the South. “We need to reinvest in a whole range of dferent things. “Inequality isn’t a single disease. It’s more like a syndrome and it requires a redistribution of the country’s resources.” He appeals for investment in people, not just infrastructure. He says: “It needs to be more sophisticated. We need to regenerate and level up people.” Create fairer society to close health gap By Sir Michael Marmot, Director of University College London Institute of Health Equity It has not been good for your health to live in the North West, North East, or other deprived parts of England. The conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work and age are the key determinants of health. If social conditions are poorer, health will be poorer. Until , le expectancy was increasing by about one year every four years but since then, le expectancy in the most deprived % of areas has declined.Austerity, regressive cuts in local government and rises in child poverty have all contributed and the pandemic has made health inequalities worse. Covid- mortality was % higher in the North West than the English average. We urge the government to act on our Build Back Fairer reports. Give every person the best start in le – education, good employment and working conditions. Make sure people have enough money to lead a healthy le, and offer them healthy choices of diet, exercise and other behaviours. Building back fairer will take money, investing in the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work and age. It is a matter of social justice. The result will be a fairer distribution of health and dignied lives.

Bills are due to hit £, in April amid the soaring cost of gas.The Mirror and Labour have urged the Government to axe VAT of %. A Yonder survey of , voters for The Royal Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce think tank found just % could afford a % rise in dual-fuel bills, and % say that cutting VAT on energy bills would benefit their family, including % of people who voted Conservative at the  general election. Asked whether they would prefer a universalist approach like cutting VAT, or targeted help, as proposed by Boris Johnson, % would prefer cutting VAT, rising to % of  Conservative voters. Alan Lockey, head of the RSA’s future of work programme, said: “With economic insecurity so widespread — our survey shows % of Brits are concerned they cannot afford the coming hike in energy bills — we can’t limit help to just a few householdswe want to maintain support for the essential move to decarbonisation. Measures like a tax cut are a step forward, but ultimately we should move to a carbon levywe want to cut emissions, help the most vulnerable, and ensure the sht to net-zero benefits ordinary families.” Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves said: “In a week where Conservative MPs voted down a plan to cut VAT on energy bills – despite the Prime Minister and senior figures previously backing the move – these figures will make tough reading. Instead of backing Labour’s plan to scrap VAT on home energy bills – paid for by a one-off windfall tax on north sea oil and gas – Conservative MPs would rather leave hard working people to face the cost of living crisis alone.” Age UK warned the predicted % rise in energy bills from April could trigger a national emergency for millions of older people.  The charity said cutting the five percent VAT from all households’ energy bills from April until at least the end of , and providing additional payments of up to £ to those on the lowest incomes could encourage vulnerable older people to keep their heating on this winter. Conservative MP Ben Bradley said there are other options to bring down energy costs, including removing green levies, than scrapping VAT.

When the fridge was delivered in December , rules banned two or more people from dferent households from meeting indoors, unless “reasonably necessary” for work purposes.  Downing Street today apologised to Buckingham Palace after it was revealed more parties were held in No the day before Prince Philip’s funeral last Spring. Two leaving bashes - one for Mr Johnson’s top spin doctor James Slack and another for the PM’s photographer - took place at Downing Street on April . It was just hours before the Queen sat grieving alone at St George’s Chapel, Windsor. ‘Wine-time Fridays’ were scheduled into the electronic calendars of around  No  staff between pm and pm every week. They are a long-standing Downing Street tradition, including under previous administrations, to help staff wind down at the end of a busy week. But the event continued many Fridays even after restrictions were introduced to help curb the Covid surge.  It was organised by the No  press office but periodically advisers from other parts of the building would join in. Sources said one regular attendee when tough mixing rules were in place was Captain Steve Higham, then the PM’s defence adviser. The Royal Navy officer now commands the new aircraft carrier HMS Prince of Wales which is the UK’s largest warship.The Ministry of Defence declined to comment.Whitehall enforcer Sue Gray is investigating rules-busting parties. It has already been suggested that she plans to criticise the “drinking culture” across Downing Street and other Government departments. Sources said the gatherings on occasion went on as late as midnight with up to two dozen aides drinking wine and beer and playing games like Pictionary.  They were particularly popular from autumn  to the Spring of  when staff were “fatigued” with the tough Covid restrictions, sources said. However, their popularity waned as the country began opening up and staff no longer had to rely on them for social interaction. The PM was said to have attended a “handful” of the gatherings at points when indoor socialising was banned under lockdown rules. These include an event on November , , the day Dominic Cummings walked out of No , when he stayed for a glass of wine and chatted to the team. It has previously been reported that the PM gave a “shambolic” speech for departing communications director Lee Cain, with the pair posing with “Get Brexit Done” boxing gloves.At the time, England was at the height of its second national lockdown with no indoor mixing between households allowed for social reasons. But in an explosive revelation, No  insiders claimed the PM often witnessed ‘wine-time Fridays’ on his way to the Downing Street flat.One source said: “Boris used to stop by for a chat while they had a drink.It was on the way up to his flat and the door was usually open. He knew about it and encouraged it.” Another added: “He could see everyone sitting there drinking as he walked up. “He would come in and say ‘Hello everyone had a hard week  Letting off some steam  Oh great’. “The idea that he didn’t know there were drinks is total nonsense. If the PM tells you to ‘let off steam’, he’s basically saying this is fine.” Downing Street’s humiliating apology to Buckingham Palace comes after two leaving dos the night before Prince Philip’s funeral last Spring. Staff downed alcohol and revellers danced to music blaring from a laptop,with someone sent to a local shop to cram a suitcase with wine.The partying, which started indoors, became so raucous in the garden that one guest had a go on - and broke - the PM’s son Wilf’s swing, according to the . The Government’s guidance at the time warned: “You must not socialise indoors except with your household or support bubble. “You can meet outdoors, including in gardens, in groups of six people or two households.”A Downing Street spokesman said of the leaving celebrations: “It is deeply regrettable that this took place at a time of national mourning and Nohas apologised to the Palace.“You heard from the PM this week, he’s recognised No should be held to the highest standards and take responsibility for things we did not get right.” Labour leader Keir Starmer stepped up calls for the PM to quit.He said: “This shows just how seriously Boris Johnson has degraded the office of Prime Minister.“The Conservatives have let Britain down. An apology isn’t the only thing the Prime Minister should be offering the Palace today - Boris Johnson should do the decent thing and resign.” Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey said: “Boris Johnson should apologise personally to the Queen for the offence he’s caused her and millions around the country mourning for loved ones. “He should also use that opportunity to officially hand in his resignation.” The latest Partygate revelations piled pressure on Mr Johnson, who has bunkered down in No after a family member tested positive for the disease.Grieving families who lost relatives to coronavirus blasted Downing Street staff who partied the night before the royal funeral.Fran Hall, of the Covid- Bereaved Families for Justice said: “If your neighbours had behaved like this, you’d have been disgusted.“For the people running the country to do it and then lie about it shows a complete disdain for the general public. “We shared the same pain of grieving in isolation as the Queen did - and she must be just as sickened as we are at hearing this.” Former No director of communications Mr Slack, who was appointed deputy editor-in-chief of The Sun newspaper last year, said: “I wish to apologise unreservedly for the anger and hurt caused. “This event should not have happened at the time that it did. I am deeply sorry, and take full responsibility.” Mr Johnson is drawing up a list of officials to offer resignations over the Partygate affair in a bid to salvage his premiership, with chief-of-staff Dan Rosenfield and private secretary Martin Reynolds both featuring, The Independent reported. Dubbed “Operation Save Big Dog” by the PM himself, also includes a plan to highlight Mr Johnson’s achievements in Government after the publication of Ms Gray’s report, expected next week. Supporters of the PM urged people to wait for Ms Gray’s verdict. Security Minister Damian Hinds said: “I think it’s important that we have an investigation ongoing into events, plural, and alleged events.” Tory backbencher Andrew Bridgen became the fth Tory MP to publicly demand Mr Johnson’s resignation. “Sadly, the Prime Minister’s position has become untenable,” he wrote in the .“Leadership is not just about the job title, or even making big decisions,it is equally about having a moral compass, of knowing not just right from left but right from wrong.”Sutton Coldfield Conservative Association withdrew its support for Mr Johnson, saying the move reflected “local views at the very grassroots levels”. A No  spokesperson said: “There is an ongoing investigation to establish the facts around the nature of gatherings, including attendance, setting and the purpose with reference to adherence to the guidance at the time. The findings will be made public in due course.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Prince Philip, Duke of EdinburghBoris JohnsonTescoConservative PartyLiberal DemocratsBuckingham PalaceRoyal NavyMinistry of DefenceGrievingRoyal FamilyArmed forcesPoliticsCoronavirusDaily Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Most people will find they are able to treat themselves from home and not need to get medical attention, although they must still isolate themselves from others to prevent the spread of the virus. Despite this, the dangers of the latest strain are still very real.The US-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, has made clear five specic symptoms that indicate someone with Omicron may need closer medical attention than first thought.What Omicron symptoms mean you need medical attention  The CDC say that the following symptoms are all signs you may need to receive medical attention: Trouble breathing Persistent pain or pressure in the chestNew confusion Pale, gray, or blue-colored skin, lips or nail beds, depending on skin toneInability to wake upor stay awakeExperts are saying this list is not definitive and overall you should look at getting medical attentionany symptom is concerning you.

Staff fear that the lonely dog has been struggling to find a home because she’s misunderstood by potential adopters.Hannah Hawkins, behaviour and welfare advisor atAshley Heath Animal Centrein Dorset, has been working with the lurcher since she arrived in February .She said: “Bella was originally rehomed to a family from another charity but they struggled to cope with her behaviour around other dogs and agreed to sign her over to theRSPCAfor behavioural work.“Bella is really worried by other dogs and lacks socialisation skills that she missed out on in her early, formative months. “We believe that incorrect management has worsened this and she was incredibly frustrated when we first started working with her but, thankfully, after months and months of intensive work we’ve started to see her making improvements.” Bella is described as a friendly, affectionate dog who loves to spend time with people. She enjoys being groomed and loves nothing more than fuss and attention, as well as running off-lead, playing with her toys and splashing in the water. “She’s responded well to our training and has even made some doggy friends here at the centre,” said Hannah.

She needs time to get to know new dog friends and can be reactive to unknown dogs, so she’ll need an experienced and confident adopter who can continue her training and be mindful when walking her.

Ms Goddard said a complaint to police led to a restraining order stopping Boulton contacting her and a further one was then made after a separate incident in February . But the defendant continued to contact his ex via calls, messages and unannounced and uninvited visits to her home, the court heard. A few days after their deaths, Ms Vincent and her kids had been due to move to an address unknown to Boulton.  Social services had also become involved with the family after her first complaint to police relating only to the risk Mr Boulton presented, the prosecutor added. Ms Goddard said he had been seen running from an alleyway leading to the back of the exaposs house on the evening of May  and told witnesses to call an ambulance before casually walking away. Paramedics found Ms Vincent curled in a ball in the living room, and Darren on his bed, both clearly already dead. Both appeared to have been stabbed numerous times and, in addition to obvious stab wounds, they had marks consistent with blunt force trauma - being hit by something, said the prosecutor.  Police quickly identied Boulton as a suspect. He forced entry into an empty cottage and stole clothing and food, the court heard. On June , off-duty PC Dennis was walking his dog near the property, when he recognised Boulton and became concerned about the safety of another dog walker because he knew the circumstances of the killings. In a short confrontation, the officer was stabbed in the leg but was able to contact colleagues and soon the area was flooded with police, said Ms Goddard. Concluding, she added Boulton had planned his actions, was fully in control of them, and should therefore, be held fully responsible and accountable for them. Boulton, of Alexandra Road, Skegness, denies murdering Ms Vincent and her son, assault with intent to resist arrest, and burglary.

The man emptying therecyclingbins in the Penrhyn Bay area of Conwy, Wales, can be heard shouting “I’ve told you dirty bas***** before, Iaposm not emptying it at a house after looking inside their blue bin on collection day. According to reports fromNorth Wales Live , the bin man is heard again shortly after, shouting “Empty your food bin, smelly”.He then heads down the street with the bin wagon. A council spokesperson said they have been in touch with the resident to provide an update and apology. Local Jade Ashleigh caught the man mouthing off on her family’s CCTV system, which she has now sent to the council along with a formal complaint. She claimed it wasn’t the first time the bin men had been heard “hurling abuse” at residents.  Normally I wouldnapost check back on the CCTV but I checked it as my food bin and recycling trolley had been damaged so I wanted to see,” she said. I heard him shout that he had previously said he wasnapost emptying the bins before, and called someone aposdirty bas*****apos across the street, then go to his colleague and mutter something . The CCTV camera was able to pick up some of it but we are unsure of who he was talking about as the person shouting is off camera. It was just over the contents of a bin and all he had to do was leave a note saying they couldnapost empty the bin, but even at that - it’s a bin. I donapost get what he is expecting to be in there. After muttering to his work colleague he continued to walk along the pavement with truck and can be heard again shouting telling someone to Empty their food, before calling them apossmellyapos. She added: Since posting the footage on facebook I have had several neighbours message me telling me this isnapost the first time itaposs happened, and that itaposs about time they are reported for their behaviour. One resident has told me that one of the bin men called him a apostw*tapos, followed by another saying the bin men always break their bins due to being heavy handed. No matter how bad of a day they are having, we still pay council tax so we should not have to deal with abusive language being shouted across the street. I complained to the council about this and they said theyaposd look into it, but theyaposre not going to be able to tell methey actually do anything.  In a comment, Conwy Councilaposs Environment, Roads and Facilities Service said: “We received a call from a resident in Penrhyn Bay and logged her complaint, which is being looked into by the manager. Council staff are expected to carry out their duties in a professional and respectful manner. “We have been in touch with the resident to provide an update and an apology.”Late last yearThe Mirror reportedon a council binman that called a family “scummy” in another potty-mouthed tirade, after he “found potato peels” in her recycling bin.Charlotte Wallace alleges she heard the Stoke-on-Trent City Council worker shout “scummy f****** p****” at her house after looking inside her blue bin. The incident, which took place outside of Charlotte’s Stoke-on-Trent home, was caught on her CCTV camera. Charlotte said she typically wouldn’t have been home at that time due to her work schedule. But on that particularly morning she was at home to hear the binman’s outburst, she said. “I heard him shout aposscummy f****** p****apos up at my house, then go to his mate and say aposscummy f****** b*******apos. Our CCTV camera was able to pick up some of it,” she said. It was just an over the top reaction to a few potato peelings. All he had to do was leave a note saying they couldnapost empty the bin. While the council has apologised and told her it is looking into the incident, it says it wouldn’t tell her what the outcome of its investigation will be.

Its been a fantastic week for rich, entitled men getting their comeuppanceThis week, Boris Johnson, Novak Djokovic and Prince Andrew have all experienced the crashing sensation that - actually - theyre not as special as they think, writes Polly HudsonThis is a time for genuine celebration - we need to pause, take notice and appreciate something very unusual. A magical hat trick of justiceopinionByPolly Hudson:,  Jan Updated:,  Jan There’s a moment, growing up, when every child realises a harsh truth, and the world is never quite the same afterwards: le’s not fair. After a strict diet of fairy tales and movies where the baddie loses in the end every time, it can be a pretty bitter pill to swallow. In reality, good doesn’t always triumph over evil, nice guys regularly finish last, and those who deserve it least are often the most rewarded. So this is a time for genuine celebration - we need to pause, take notice and appreciate something very unusual. A magical hat trick of justice. This has been a fantastic week for rich, entitled blokes with seemingly unbreakable senses of their own exceptionalism finally getting their good, old fashioned comeuppance. Hoorah!Prince Andrew now he’s been stripped of all his royal gubbins – a Madonna-esque just Andy  has learned that he can’t hide behind his mum’s tiara forever.It looks likely he will face a civil sex abuse trial, just like any other human being on the planet. On the bright side,any news was ever going to cure his medical inability to sweat, it’s presumably this. There’s “No-Vax” Djokovic who is having the opposite of a wizard time in Oz, where he had rocked up to play in the Australian Open. The law is that you must be vaccinated to enter the country, but they don’t mean him, right  He’s special. And for a while it seemed like it was going to be advantage Djokovic, the oldest story in the book, loaded spoilt brat gets to do whatever he wants. But nope, common sense seems, at time of typing, to have won in the end. Out!And then we come to our shameful, shameless Prime Minister, who has been shown up for yet again deciding that the rules he set for the rest of us didn’t apply to him and his cronies. Party on, doofus! This appalling, dishonest, hypocrite not only thinks he’s above the general public, but also apparently the Queen, who happily stuck to the restrictions on the unhappiest day of her le when she laid Prince Philip to rest. Johnson was forced to offer a weak, excuse-laden apology-lite this week, served with a side order of ludicrous lies about not knowing what a party is. No point in asking what kind of fools he takes us for, because he answers with his every action. These three very unwise men thought they were able to do whatever they wanted with zero consequences. Like always. They thought they were the exception, almost God-like in their untouchability. It’s hard not to hope that the realisation that’s not true, and subsequent fall from grace, is exactly as painful as it should be.Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON MadonnaPrince Philip, Duke of EdinburghNovak DjokovicPrince Andrew, Duke of YorkBoris JohnsonAustralian OpenRoyal FamilyPoliticsDowning Street party\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

It wasnapost until he joined his local Slimming World group in , where he would later shed nine stone, that he began to take back control, reports HertsLive. I didnapost see myself as fat, said Hugh. I was disgusting, I really was, and I look back now and I just let myself go.  That was the problem, and it was comfort eating, boredom eating. To me, those were the two main problems. Iaposd just retired early from a part-time job I had in BQ and it was boredom. Itaposs so easy to fall into that trap. In , Hugh went to the doctors who then sent him to Slimming World for  weeks, free of charge, because he had developed diabetes. At the same time, doctors also advised him to go to the gym, which he also did for  weeks. I ended up having an angiogram, he added. Thataposs how bad it was weight-wise. An angiogram is where a wire gets put up your blood vessel to seethereaposs any blockage to your heart. I had that and they found out I had angina, and I think they found out after I was in hospital for septic arthritis.Hugh wanted to make a change and so joined his local Slimming World group in Great Ashby and Bedwell, which is run by Jan Tooley. He found out that he weighed  stone and .lbs at his first weigh-in. But having now swapped his  slices of bread a week for rice cakes, veg and more exercise, he lost an incredible nine stone, dropping from a  inch waist to a . I was out with the dog this morning at half past eight, got back about  oaposclock, but I could never have done that before, he continued. It was bad and you donapost see it. This is the thing about putting weight on, you donapost see yourself that way. Well, I definitely didnapost see myself that way and it was a shock when I found out I was  stone and .lbs. I was eating for the sake of eating. When I was working Iaposd have two slices of bread before I went to my work for my breakfast, Iaposd take four slices with me for my sandwiches and about two or three slices of bread a night.  Now I donapost eat bread at all, all I have is a small brown loaf and it lasts me about  days. Time spent in the gym was an uncomfortable experience for Hugh. He says he felt self conscious walking into a space with plenty of young people, most of whom were all ready fitness fanatics, and didnapost really feel like fitting in. The benefits of attending the weekly Slimming World groups though, even throughout lockdown, have been le-changing. He says he wasnapost judged by others and the encouragement from everyone spurred him on when things got tough. He still attends group sessions now and has managed to keep the weight off. I can walk further since I lost the weight, the threat of diabetes has gone altogether, I got rid of my diabetes he said. I donapost eat as much, I donapost eat as often but I eat a lot more healthier food. After about three or four months Iaposd lost a tenth of my body-weight. Itaposs not easy, donapost get me wrong, itaposs dficult. But once you put your mind to it, itaposs all in the mindset, and the support you get from everybody that goes, itaposs the best way. Having seen the health benefits and how much happier he is since losing the weight, Hugh encourages anyone thinking about joining their Slimming World group to just go and do it. Join, he said, without a momentaposs hesitation. Evenyou join for three or four months, youaposll find you lose a lot of weight. Iaposd advise anyone to go, evenyou just want to get a couple of stone off. Iaposm very grateful to them [at Slimming World]. They helped me a great deal and even to this daysomebody says to me aposOh, I only lost half a poundapos I say, aposAre you stupid man apos Iaposd love to lose half a pound every week. People want it now, thataposs the problem. Itaposs hard to do. Itaposs like smoking, but itaposs a mental thing. Iaposm quite proud of what Iaposve done.To find out more information about your local Slimming World group, press here.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON BQ PLCSlimming WorldHospitalsHeart diseaseArthritisFitness\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Mark Hughes was told the devastating news in  after a tumour was discovered in his lung. Now he is calling for a fairer a fairer benefits system for the terminally ill after his diagnosis made his le “impossible” He was given the news the cancer had spread to his lymph nodes meaning it was only a matter of time for him to live.Mark told MyLondon : “They found out that I had a tumour the size of a golf ball in my lung,” he said, “but then they told me that the cancer had spread to the lymph nodes.“Once it gets to the lymph nodes, it’s a ticking time bomb. You don’t know when it’s going to explode.”  He added: “The doctor was in tears. My we was in tears. But funnily enough, I’d already sort of come to terms with the illness when I was in hospital.” Mark’s GP recorded that he was terminal, and would never be able to work again. Thankfully, Mark has survived far longer than doctors expected but his experience trying to access his sickness benefits changed the course of his le. Mark had worked for most of his le as a long distance European truck driver, which typically required him to travel for two to three weeks at a time. He and his we contacted the Department for Work and Pensionsto file for sick benefits soon after his diagnosis. What arrived, said Mark, was a stack of forms “the size of War and Peace”.  “My we is dealing with the news that her husband is going to die. But each form opened up a minefield of other forms. “You’re getting forms left, right and centre,” he explained. “You’re dealing with so many dferent departments. Some of them are about  pages long. “It’ll say ‘Sorry, you didn’t need to fill in that form,’ ‘Sorry, you’re not eligible for that benefit.’ ‘Sorry, we’ve passed this on to another department.’ “Jane was getting really depressed and upset about it, and I’m getting depressed watching her go downhill. There’s just nothing we can do. “We got the feeling that it was as though they were trying to grind you down, so that you just give up.” Eventually, not able to navigate the complex process themselves, Mark and his we received help with the forms from a charity working with the terminally ill. They were given full benefits and a blue badge. Soon after, a small pension of £, arrived at the couples’ house, which they cashed in. Unknowingly, this cut their benefits in half. “To me, I’ve been working  to  hours a week, paying my taxes. The Government encourage you to get a pension, they encourage you to save. “But what they don’t say is, when you become terminally ill,your savings are over the £,s, you lose half your benefits.” After this, things began to unravel further. The pair sold their house in Southend. With a terminal diagnosis, it was important to Mark to begin ticking off his bucket list - the first, he noted, was to swim with sharks in Australia. Visitors from the DWP would visit his home once he’d sold it. “They’d ask, ‘Why did we have so much money  Where had the money come from ’” On another visit, a woman asked, ‘Can you wash ’, ‘Can you dress yourself ’, ‘Can you cook ’ “They told me to answer honestly,” said Mark, “so I did.” “I didn’t know that by answering honestly that the points system would go under what it was to require any benefits. “But they stopped them completely.” At that moment, Mark decided to start campaigning. Chasing the benefits he believed he was entitled to had been a three-year battle. “And this is happening to thousands of people on a daily basis,” he said. He joined a campaign with charity Marie Curie called #ScrapMonths, which called on the DWP to fast track those with terminal illnesses through the benefits system - a privilege that was only granted to those with six months to live. Mark personally handed a petition about the campaign to Number  Downing Street. Since the campaign, the DWP have extended this to those with le sentences of up to  months. But he doesnapost believe that this is enough. He feels strongly that those who are diagnosed with terminal illnesses should not have to prove this to the DWP - rather it should be automatic once it is on their medical records. “I shouldn’t be having to do those forms proving I’m terminally ill,” he said, “I shouldn’t have to go to the doctors to prove that I’m going to die.” He references his work with Michelle McCluskey, who’s mother died of cancer, while waiting for the DWP’s response about her benefits.The DWP’s response arrived on the day Christine McCluskey died - and it did not approve her application, theMirrorreported.Mark said Christine experienced “appalling treatment” at the hands of a broken benefits system. “People are relying me to stand up and speak on their behalf, he said, because they haven’t got the willpower to do so. “And things need to change.”  Mark Jackson, Policy and Public Affairs Manager for England at end of le charity Marie Curie, which campaigned for the change in the six-month rule, said: “Last summer, we welcomed the news that changes would be put in place to the benefits system for people living with a terminal illness. Now the UK Government needs to take action and rapidly move forward with the reforms it has promised. “The sooner these improvements to the benefits system are implemented, the sooner dying people can concentrate on making the most of the time they have left, rather than worrying about whether they will get the support they need. “At a time when the cost of living is rising dramatically, these changes could not be more urgent. “There is more to be done to improve how the social security system supports terminally ill people, but this is an important first step. “We will continue to work with and push the UK Government to enact legislation quickly to support people during a time when costs of living continue to rise. A DWP spokesperson said: “Terminal illness is devastating, and our priority is dealing with people’s claims quickly and compassionately. “Those nearing the end of their lives can get fast-track access to the benefits system, with the majority receiving the highest possible award and paid within three days of making a claim.

The Prime Ministeraposs desperate battle plan includes selecting officials to offer their resignation as the fall-out continues after a slew of scandals over Downing Street parties.Boris Johnson has reportedly himself dubbed the idea aposOperation Save Big Dogapos as the anxious government await the publication of senior official Sue Gray’s findings. In the latest revelations, officials in No allegedly drank late into the night as they said farewell to their top spin doctor and one of the Tories photographers. Staff, it is claimed, hired a DJ’d to supply music in the basement of No as the enjoyed the boozy bash. They earlier went on an alcohol run with a suitcase to the local Co-Op on the night before Prince Philip ’s funeral. Now, the The Independent say Mr Johnsonaposs is drawing up a list of colleagues to throw in the towel over partygate.His chief of staff Dan Rosenfield and private secretary Martin Reynolds are both being considered as possible departures, the publication reports. A former Tory cabinet minister said a “root and branch” overhaul of No  is a “bare minimum to translate contrition into action”.  Mrs Gray’s report will make findings of fact, but it’ll be for police to punish lockdown breaches. She is investigating a string of parties in Whitehall between May  and April  - mostly in  Downing Street and its garden. Minister Michael Ellis said the report, possibly due next week, will be a “fair and impartial investigation before there is a judge, jury and executioner.” Downing Street today apologised to Buckingham Palace for the two staff bashes on the night before Prince Philipaposs funeral.  The PMaposs spokesman said it was deeply regrettable that this took place at a time of national mourning. Mr Johnson was not at either party - but he faces further questions over alleged Covid rule-breaking at No .Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said: This shows just how seriously Boris Johnson has degraded the office of prime minister.The Conservatives have let Britain down. An apology isnapost the only thing the prime minister should be offering the Palace today. Boris Johnson should do the decent thing and resign.

The Queen took decisive action against her son after a US judge ruled a sex abuse lawsuit against Andrew could go to trial. Prince Andrew fears he faces “financial ruin” over the case, amid mounting legal bills and a potential £million settlement with his accuser Virginia Gufre, it has emerged.Andrew has been left to fight allegations of rape after Her Majesty, with advice from future kings Prince Charles and Prince William, banished him from royal le forever. The monarch and her heirs decided to cut him adrt after becoming “infuriated” with the crisis threatening The Firm, it is understood. One royal source suggested senior royals believed stricken Andrew had “run out of road” as the pressure signicantly increased this week, following a New York judge’s decision to throw out the Duke’s latest bid to halt a full civil trial. The Prince of Wales today refused to acknowledge a reporter’s questions on his brother’s “situation”, during a visit the Haddow Country Park in Aberdeenshire. Buckingham Palace has offered no further comment since a bombshell statement was delivered announcing Andrew’s banishment on Thursday at pm.  The Mirror can reveal that Andrew was today locked in talks with his teams of lawyers in the UK and US as they waited for Ms Gufre’s team to respond to a pm deadline about her living arrangements. The Duke’s legal team still believe his case can not be heard under US federal law due to a “domicile arrangement”, arguing that at least one party in a civil lawsuit must be a resident in the country. Ms Giuffre, , who claims Andrew had sex with her on three occasions when she was just , has lived in Australia since . But amid the chaos and uncertainty, Andrew - who has always denied the allegations - is understood to have taken time to bemoan his financial situation, telling his closest confidants he fears being left insolvent in addition to an outcast from his family.  Despite rushing to complete the sale of a £million Swiss chalet, his mounting debts include lawyers’ fees of at least £million and a £million payment to a French socialite he bought the alpine mansion from in . Legal experts believe Andrew may have to stump up as much as £million to Ms Giuffre to stop the case coming to court. In contrast Ms Giuffre’s lawyer has insisted she was not only interested in financial recompense. A royal source said: “Until very recently it appears the absolute enormity of this case and the consequences he faces has not hit him . “Now the bills are mounting up and the possibility of a settlement, or even worse a judgement against him, is being widely discussed he fears complete financial ruin. Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter “Andrew thought, indeed he was advised that this would all go away in time and neither has happened, leaving him facing an extraordinary uphill battle to even salvage any crumb of his reputation. “There is a very real prospect of him being completely broke.” The Mirror understands the Queen “would not assist” her son in paying a settlement to Ms Gufre due to the perceived reputational damage to the Crown. Sources close to the Duke maintained he would “continue to fight to clear his name” despite being cut adrt from his family. As Andrew limps towards the next stage of his legal battle, it can be revealed how he was given just two hours notice on Thursday to attend a face-to-face meeting with the Queen at midday. Sources close to the Duke revealed he was “fully aware what was coming” and stayed with Her Majesty for just half an hour to be told he was being stripped of all military associations and patronages. The Queen’s most senior counsel had already laid bare the chances of Andrew being forced to pay out a multi-million pound settlement to halt an explosive trial taking place. But despite clear water being placed between Andrew and the monarchy due to the tawdry saga, sources have confirmed that Andrew will not lose his security detail, although it is likely to be scaled back. Sources have suggested the Queen would privately meet the cost of her son’s £, annual security billhe is left broke. Palace insiders suggested that although such a decision has not been rubber stamped, were it to be rubber stamped it would be likely to cause further friction within the family after Prince Harry and his we Meghan after they were cut adrt and told to pay for their own security when they quit their royal roles.

The opinion heaps yet further pressure on the Duke of York to consider settling Virginia Giuffre’s lawsuit out of court in order to avoid further damaging the reputation of the monarchy. Following a disastrous week for Andrew, on Thursday he was stripped of all his military titles and patronages while forced to drop his HRH title- dashing his hopes of resuming public duties. Now, leading US attorney Spencer Kuvin told the Mirror, the royal could face possible prosecutiona jury finds in favour of his accuser. Such a move would leave ‘Air miles Andy’, who earned his nickname from his prodigious globetrotting as senior royal, open to arresthe were to venture onto foreign soil in a country that has a deal with the US.  Mr Kuvin, who represents several of sex offender Epstein’s victims, said: “If I were Prince Andrew’s counsel, I would tell him never to leave the UK. “He should never travel outside of the UK. To never step foot out of the UK - the jurisdiction of his country. “The moment he does step foot into a country, he could potentially,Ms Giuffre’s allegations are proven true, be charged criminally and brought to the United States from a country that has an extradition treaty with it. “He effectively could become a prisoner in his mom’s country.” A civil case like Giuffre has brought against the Duke, , can lead to criminal charges in America.  When a trial between two private parties reveals evidence that one may have committed an offence, a criminal case can be launched. After allegedly lying in a civil case, Andrew’s pal, convicted child sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell, , has been charged with two counts of perjury - a crime punishable by up to five years in prison. Prosecutors took evidence from the British socialite’s defamation lawsuit with Giuffre to pursue her criminally. Pressure has been rapidly mounting on the Duke to quickly resolve the case in order to avoid damage to Her Majesty as well as her Platinum Jubilee celebrations. Currently, the royal has a stark choice to make. He can either take the risk to press ahead and attempt to clear his name by going in front of a jury, seeing Andrew face the humiliation of having to give public testimony against lurid allegations of rape and sexual assault on oath. Or he could try to persuade Giuffre to accept a multi-million-pound settlement but then have the ignominy of always having the suspicion of guilt hanging over him. Giuffre welcomed New York judge, Lewis Kaplan’s decision on Wednesday to deny Andrew’s motion to have her lawsuit against him thrown out.  Today, she tweeted: “I’m pleased with Judge Kaplan’s ruling that allows my case against Prince Andrew to go forward. I’m glad I will have the chance to continue to expose the truth and I am deeply grateful to my extraordinary legal team. “Their determination helps me seek justice from those who hurt me and so many others. My goal has always been to show that the rich and powerful are not above the law  must be held accountable. “I do not walk this path alone, but alongside countless other survivors of sexual abuse and trafficking.” Her lawyers have said she wants to be “vindicated” by the legal process and is not motivated by reaching a “purely financial settlement”. It came as US legal experts said talk of a settlement offer by the Duke was “premature”. Giuffre, , has sued Andrew using New York’s Child Victims Act that allowed those abused to sue their alleged attackers. In , lawmakers introduced a “look-back window” that gave victims of decades-old abuse two years to file civil claims by August , , eventhe statute of limitations had expired.  The deadline for claims was later extended due to Covid by then New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. Mum-of-three Giuffre filed the lawsuit on August ,  - just five days before the window closed. She claims in , she was trafficked by billionaire Epstein and Maxwell to have sex with the Duke in London when she was , a minor in US law. Giuffre also alleges she was forced to have sex with the royal at Epstein’s home in New York and the US Virgin Islands. The Duke has “absolutely and categorically” denied her allegations. She is suing Andrew for unspecied damages, which Mr Kuvin said could “easily” be more than £ millionshe is successful. Sources say the Duke has been left “hugely upset” over his lack of foreign travel since stepping back from royal duties.  In August , he announced he was standing down from public le as he sought to contain the firestorm over his friendship with Epstein. It came after he built a formidable reputation for his love of the high le abroad at the taxpayer’s expense while promoting British businesses. In , the Prince’s official visit to China and the Far East cost £, for transport and accommodation costs. A year later, his visit to Switzerland racked up £, for hotel, travel and other costs. All his travels in  cost the taxpayers £,. It was later reported the Duke racked up travel bills of almost £, for his foreign trips. The Treasury, funded by the taxpayer, paid the cost. Andrew was dubbed “Air miles Andy” because of his penchant for using helicopters and planes on official engagements when he could use a train or car.Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Ghislaine MaxwellPrince Andrew, Duke of YorkFar EastThe TreasuryPrisonsRoyal FamilyCrimeBillionaires\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Virginia Giuffre claims Andrewaposs pal Jeffrey Epstein forced her to have sex with the royal on three occasions when she was .The Duke of York vehemently denies the allegations. Prince Charles was visiting the Haddo Country Park, Ellon, Aberdeenshire when Sky News correspondent James Matthews asked: Can I ask your view on your brotheraposs position   The heir to the throne ignored the question and chose to speak ot iniduals affected by Storm Arwen in November. Royal experts have claimed the family is absolutely furious with the Duke. Angela Levin saidthe Queen sought advice from Charles and William, they would have been very firm on the matter.  She told the Sun Online: If the Queen asked Prince Charles and Prince William they would have been very firm, Prince William and Prince Charles have been absolutely furious with him bringing the Royal Family into disrepute. Whatever he may or may not have done he certainly was a friend of Epstein and invited him to parties, royal parties when they knew he had been accused of having relationships with underage girls. So there’s no doubt about that. I would imagine that this time the Queen would also listen to her aides. Yesterday, it was announced Prince Andrew has been stripped of his military affiliations and royal patronages by the Queen and as a royal source claims he will neverto official duties. The disgraced Duke of York will no longer use the title of His Royal Highness in any official capacity as he fades away from public le. A Buckingham Palace spokesperson said: With The Queen’s approval and agreement, The Duke of York’s military affiliations and Royal patronages have been ed to The Queen. The Duke of York will continue not to undertake any public duties and is defending this case as a private citizen. Prince Andrew served in the Royal Navy as a helicopter pilot and saw active service in the Falklands War.  The royal said he stopped sweating after suffering an aposoverdose of adrenalineapos while being shot at in the conflict.The Duke revealed this medical condition in a BBC Newsnight interview when addressing Ms GIuffreaposs description of him sweating profusely.Prince Andrewaposs titles include Colonel of the Grenadier Guards, Deputy Colonel-in-chief of the Royal Lancers, Colonel-in-chief of the Royal Irish Regiment, Colonel-in-chief of the Yorkshire Regiment and Colonel-in-chief of the Small Arms School Corps.Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON BBCBuckingham PalaceRoyal NavyThe QueenJames MatthewsPrince WilliamPrince Andrew, Duke of YorkPrince Charles, Prince of WalesFalklands WarNewsnightRoyal FamilyArmed forcesThe Falklands\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

A crowd carrying Union Jack flags, beer bottles and wine bottles chanted my name is Boris and this is a work event.Itaposs believed the event was organised by YouTuber JaackMaate, who shared images from the gathering on Twitter, saying: We hired  Boris Johnsonaposs and threw a party outside Downing Street.It comes after excruciating New claims have emerged of two staff leaving dos at the same time in No on the night of Friday  April.One No staffer was reportedly dispatched to the Co-Op on the Strand,  minutes’ walk away, to fill a suitcase with wine. They would have wheeled it back through Trafalgar Square, where lockdown law banned Brits meeting in groups of more than six.  A source told the Mirror they slipped into No through a back entrance, using a keypad to get in away from watchful police. Staff later spilled into the garden, which is shielded from view from Horse Guards Parade by high brick walls topped with security wire. They tried a swing belonging to the PM’s one-year-old son. They reportedly broke it in the process. Riotous staff were said to be saying goodbye to a photographer, at the same time as a separate leaving do for spin chief James Slack.  The Prime Minister’s former official spokesman, who left the Daily Mail to rise through the ranks to comms director at No, gave a leaving speech where in the building, before the two parties allegedly merged.I wish to apologise unreservedly for the anger and hurt caused,” Mr Slack, now an executive at The Sun, said today.  He added: “This event should not have happened at the time that it did. That’s something of an understatement. The next day, the Queen sat alone at her husband’s funeral - one of the defining images of the pandemic.Desperate to contain lockdown-weary Brits, Priti Patel had announced £ fines for people who attend house parties - much higher than the £ fine for attending most illegal gatherings. Organisers could be fined £,.Four days before the boozy No bash, some rules were eased in ‘step ’ of England’s roadmap.  But indoor social gatherings between dferent households were still illegal, and outdoors they were limited to the rule of six. Non-essential shops, hairdressers and public buildings like libraries had all been shut until the week of the No bash. Even people who met outdoors were warned not to hug, and to maintain two-metre social distancing where possible. The allegations of parties held at No are now being investigated by Whitehall enforcer Sue Gray, a minister said today. And the Met Police have indicated they will only investigateMs Gray finds evidence of criminality - which The Times reported she is unlikely to do.Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Priti PatelBoris JohnsonPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

People are tired and stressed andyou live or work in a city, the chances are your journey will be busy. Luckily for commuters in London, one woman is going out of her way to make the journey in and out of work just a little less miserable, by singing and chatting to passengers on the tube.Sarah Chipperfield, , became a London Underground driver four years ago but when she ed to work on the Northern Line after the birth of her third child just as the pandemic hit, she decided customers needed something a little dferent when travelling on her trains.I think that bringing smiles to the faces of our customers and train operators sharing their personalities is part and parcel of what operating trains on the London Underground is all about, the mum-of-three said. I’m on the frontline of a world-class service – it brings immense pride to be able to do what I do and to wear the roundel, and that reflects in my efforts to give back to the city of London by spreading some joy to our customers.  Sarah took the job on the Northern Line as she was looking for a change of career that would fit around her children. She said: Transport for London were advertising externally for night tube roles so I crossed my fingers and applied. I work two days a weekand during the week I’m at home with my three children. I live in Romsey in Hampshire. It’s a bit of a commute into London but my in-laws live there so I can stay with them when I’m working. Two years ago, after ing to work following maternity leave as the pandemic hit, Sarah decided to approach the announcements dferently. She said: Upon ing to driving it was so quiet and there was so much anxiety around going out that I decided to get a bit more aposchattyapos to reassure people that I was there and to help me concentrate. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here.  Recently, one of Sarahaposs announcements went viral after a passenger recorded a clip of her jokes and suggested she deserved a payrise. In the video, she can be heard singing we will now call at many Clapham stations, Balham, two lots of Tooting, Colliers Wood, South Wimbledon, and then Morden and home for tea, to the tune of The  Days of Christmas. The video, which was captioned,   entertainment on the northern line today. Someone give this tube driver a pay rise, shows passengers laughing at Sarahaposs jokes.Other favourites Sarah posted on her own Instagram include, If you’re hanging and you know it clap your hands and The Northern Line has severe delays to the tune of Tis the Season to be Jolly.Though she never films them herself while driving, she likes to record them afterwards for fans on social media. Sarah said: I was upstairs putting my children to bed and my phone was charging downstairs. I came down and picked up my phone to quite a few messages from friends and colleagues saying aposis this you apos It was with some trepidation that I watched the video. Unfortunately, some people have commented that they find it annoying and unprofessional but the overwhelming majority of comments have been positive. Most people have been absolutely lovely. It’s also really heartwarming when people come up to your cab door to wave or say thanks or approach you on the  when you’re at a terminus. It’s so good to see people smiling when they leave the train.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

Amber Mills had been planning the nursery rhyme-themed shower for two months when she discovered she had the virus. The -year-old, who is expecting a baby girl in February, tried to reschedule the event but the venue in her hometown of Houston, Texas, was fully booked. Reluctant to miss out on the celebrations for her first baby, Amber purchased a aposUnder The Weather apos pod online, which are normally used by people watching sports, so she could still attend without infecting any of her guests. But the expecting mum has come under fire over her decision and revealed that a third of her guests walked out when they discovered she was Covid positive.Amber said: I had a little bit of congestion and a stuffy nose. I brushed it off as allergies but I wanted to get tested because of the shower and didnapost want to infect anyone.  Iaposd been looking forward to it, planning the theme and buying decor. By the time I found out I was positive, we had all the food and a cake. I was upset because I thought I would have to miss this baby shower that Iaposd been planning for months. The original plan was that I wouldnapost go until everyone had left but I ended up finding an aposunder the weather podapos. I had seen them before and I was just laying there thinking about how I was going to have to miss my baby shower and it just popped into my head. I could be zipped up so the air I was breathing out wouldnapost go near my friends. Of the  friends and family members who showed up,  decided to leave when Amberaposs partner, Ethan, , announced she had Covid but would still be attending. Since the baby shower on January th, Amber said sheaposs been checking in with guests and none of them have tested positive for Covid. Amber, who works at a car dealership, sent a friend to pick up the tent and arrived later than the other guests to give anyone who didnapost want to be there a chance to leave before creeping in through the back door of the venue. Amber said: I donapost think anyone thought it was a bad idea, people were telling me to come out. I had a mask on as well but everyone told me to take it off. No-one seemed to have an issue with me being there - people were glad to see me. My boyfriend opened the gts for me so we werenapost constantly zipping and unzipping the tent. It was weird sitting there and watching and not being able to get close and look at my gts. We could talk and hear each other. After everyone had left, I came out and had my mum, dad, boyfriend, stepdaughter, one friend and one cousin there so I could have a look at all the gts and have a slice of cake. I enjoyed it in the end even though it wasnapost a traditional baby shower and Covid-wise, everyone who came to the baby shower is fine. Since sharing a video of herself perched inside the tent at her baby shower on social media, Amber said people were split down the middle over whether it was a good idea or not. Amber said: Iaposm getting a lot of mixed messages. Itaposs  .  A lot of people have said itaposs a great idea, I kept guests safe but there were a lot of people saying itaposs dumb and I shouldnapost have gone and I put people at risk. I donapost feel like I put people at risk. I feel like I took every precaution I could to not spread it. I wore a mask and I let the people coming know I had covid so that it was their decision to stay. Ten or so people said they couldnapost be around people because of their jobs and I respect that. When I tested positive, the paperwork they gave me said I needed to quarantine for five days butI needed to be around people, I should wear a face covering. I have been quarantining apart from those  minutes. A lot of people are thinking Iaposm going to the supermarket and things like that and thataposs not the case.Just because I had my baby shower doesnapost mean Iaposm not taking this seriously. Some social media users accused Amber of putting lives at risk and threatened to report her while others praised her for trying to protect guests.One commenter wrote: If you were trying to protect those around you, you would have cancelled it. This isnapost the flex you think it is. Another commented: Oh and I took the liberty of notying the Texas dept of state health services. However jumped to Amberaposs defence, arguing it was a aposbrilliantapos idea. One wrote: Leave her alone, she took her precautions. Those who went to see her definitely deserve to be there when the baby is born. Another commented: I totally appreciate that youaposre trying to protect those around you.

In a vid that has led to social media users hailing Layla as a aposfuture PMapos, the Leicester schoolgirl explained: Boris Johnson told everyone to stay at home, but in lockdown he just went down to a party, in the lockdown. Heaposs been naughty, so he had to go to the naughty centre to tell everyone heaposs sorry for going to a party in lockdown.She continued: Now he canapost be prime minister anymore and he canapost go back to his prime minister home, so heaposs not prime minister anymore. So, someone  is being prime minister and there will be a good prime minister, but Boris Johnson is not a prime minister anymore, heaposs a bad prime minister. However, astute Layla did concede that the PM can go back to his prime minister home and he can be a prime minister again but onlyheaposs lucky, concluding: Weaposll see tomorrowheaposs lucky. The family reportedly couldnapost stop laughing at Laylaaposs spot-on summary and couldnapost believe how much sheaposd picked up - and many social media users have been left similarly impressed. With the clip gaining more than , views and , reactions, mum Devina has revealed that Layla already has aspirations for a career in politics, with the little girl having promised sheaposll definitely become prime minister one day.Devina said: She just started coming out with it. She said he had to leave his house and go to the naughty centre. It was even funnier. It was amazing to capture the moment because some of these things she says you miss. Sheaposs maybe a future politician. Sheaposs absorbed that from the news herself. She was able to tell whataposs right and wrong. Layla apparently developed a keen interest in the government and the royal family during a family trip to London last year, and has since kept up with goings-on through watching the news. Davina said: Last year when we were able to go on holiday, we did one visit to London. She has a great passion for the Queen so we took her to Buckingham Palace and we were saying about how Boris Johnson runs the country for the Queen.We teach her certain things and from there, sheaposs had this thing for Boris Johnson and the Queen. She talks about  Downing Street because we showed her. Devina, who has shown Layla the many supportive online comments, continued: She was very proud when people said aposLayla to be future PMapos.

The woman, , and her brothers, , went through a rough time when their parents orced, and when their mum remarried, the brothers didnapost want anything to do with her husband, so a relationship was never established. However, the bride-to-be still lived with her mum and therefore her husband too, and during that time they established a good relationship. My step-dad did what he could to help me out with school and everything, he even offered to fund my wedding which is going to be in five weeks time and Iaposm very grateful for that though this was his decision, she wrote on Redditaposs AITA forum. I sent Dean and Kevin invitations but once they found out that our step-dad was going to be there, they said they might not come.

I told her that my brothers threatened not to come which pushed me to make this dficult decision becauseit was for me Iaposd have everyone there.

Your step-dad obviously cares about you and is PAYING for your wedding. He is in no way the problem here. Your brothers are being childish and are the ones you canapost just get along to be there for their sisteraposs wedding without being petulant little babies about it, one Reddit user commented. You should reinvite your step dad and let your brothers know that they after still welcome but thatthey donapost come they only have themselves to blame. Unless thereaposs more to his than meets the eye, they seem to have no legit reason for disliking your stepdad other than the fact that he is not your actual dad, another added.

Her death sparked a debate about the safety of women in IrelandAshling Murphy was found dead on WednesdayByStephen WhiteNews Reporter:,  Jan The murder of a young teacher has “united the nation in solidarity and revulsion”, the Irish premier said today.Police are continuing to hunt the killer of -year-old Ashling Murphy, who was found dead on Wednesday after going for a run on the banks of the Grand Canal in Tullamore, County Offaly.Taoiseach Micheal Martin said: “It’s very poignant and a very sad moment in our nation’s affairs when a young talented musician had her le violently taken a few days ago, and our hearts and our minds go out to the Murphy family, to her community, to her family and friends, and to particularly the young pupils who no doubt would have been looking forward to Ashling’s presence in the classroom, teaching music or sport as well as the broader curriculum. “I’ve always been of the view that a national schoolteacher, from the beginning of the State, has been the bedrock upon which our society was built.  “And, in many ways, Ashling Murphy represented and personied the very best of that tradition of national teaching. “I think it has united the nation in solidarity and revulsion at what has happened.” His comments came as Ireland’s deputy premier Leo Varadkar said society has to face up to an “epidemic of violence against women”. He added: “No stone will be left unturned in terms of bringing this investigation to a completion and to bring the person responsible for this to justice.” The death of Ms Murphy has sparked fresh debate about the safety of women in Ireland, with many asking how such an attack could happen in broad daylight.  Mr Varadkar continued: “I know people in Tullamore must be very worried at the moment because the killer is still at large and I want to assure people that all of the resources of the gardai are going into making sure that this person is found.” The murder has triggered widespread outpourings of grief and anger, with vigils taking place in towns and cities across Ireland. Today police renewed their appeal for witnesses and asked anyone with information about a bicycle - a Falcon Storm mountain bike with straight handlebars and distinctive yellow green front forks - to come forward. Officers released a -year-old man they had been questioning, saying he is “no longer a suspect”. The man’s solicitor told the PA news agency that he has had his “le ruined”.  Donal Farrelly, who represented the man during his two days of questioning, condemned those who had tried to identy him on social media. In a newspaper interview, Ashling’s father Raymond said: “She was a great worker, with great drive. A marvellous musician. “She crammed so much into her short le.” Those who knew her described her as a gted musician who was loved by her pupils. Several hundred people attended a vigil in her memory in Galway on Thursday, many of them with flowers and candles. The route along the Grand Canal is often busy and is a popular spot for walkers and joggers. Floral tributes were left outside the gates of Durrow National School, where Ms Murphy taught.In a statement posted on Twitter, the school said it was “utterly devastated by the passing of our dear colleague and friend”.“Ashling was a very professional and talented young teacher. We are deeply saddened by her tragic loss. Our thoughts are also with her beloved family at this sad time.” Principal James Hogan said Ashling was a “bright light who put a smile on anyone’s face”.

Matrosov originally faced a murder investigation for his suspected part in Sviridov’s death. But now he has been told this has been dropped, say sources close to the case.  In a landmark decision, he will now face prosecution for inciting Sviridov to commit suicide, which carries a lesser sentence than murder. There was a wave of public support for Matrovov in the Samara region of Russia after he was linked to the killing of suspected paedophile Sviridov. Locals in the village of Pribrezhny raised money for his initial legal fees. A petition signed by , people demanded that he should be fully acquitted.  They supported him for “saving our children by ridding us of a child sex attacker”. Prominent TV journalist and former Russian presidential candidate Ksenia Sobchak told her followers: “All parents are standing up for the paedophile’s killer.” The explicit sex abuse footage on Sviridov’s phone had been filmed when the girl was six. His daughter, now eight, was heard pleading: “Oleg, thataposs enough, I canapost take it anymore. “I want to go home”. Matrosov, a former rocket engine factory worker, always denied murder. He is now said to be “pleased” that he will not face a charge of deliberately killing Sviridov.  He is also no longer required to wear an electronic tag as he awaits trial this year. He will face prosecution for “inciting a person to suicide or attempted suicide by threats or abuse”, which carries a minimum six year sentence - like le for murder - but often also leads to non-custodial punishments. Source close to the case said that detailed forensic evidence showed that Matrosov had not stabbed Sviridov in a forest where the dead man’s body was found later in a makesht grave. There are claims Sviridov was given an ultimatum to go to the police and confess to sexually abusing the girl, or face the fatheraposs wrath. A relative said Sviridov was seen badly beaten on the day in September he disappeared, more than a week before his body was found in the makesht grave near Vintai village. Two other children in the village are feared to have been abused by Sviridov.

This disaster was caused by two hurricanes which followed in quick succession, wiping out homes, crops and in some tragic cases, lives. Hurricane Eta and Iota killed  people in Central America in November  and their impact on families like hers has been devastating. Never in meteorological history had two storms made landfall so close in time and place at a Category  intensity. The likelihood of an Atlantic storm intensying to become a major hurricane has increased by about % per decade over the past four decades, according to research. “During Eta we had heavy rains all day and night, causing the soil on the mountain where we live to become saturated with water, -year-old Nancy says.  “By the time Iota hit us  days later, mudslides came thick and fast. “At about am on November , I was at home when I heard one of my cousins shout at me to get out of the house immediately. “The rain was coming down hard but I hadn’t realised that part of the mountain was sliding towards the house. “After grabbing what I could and fleeing for my le, I heard what sounded like a small explosion and as I looked up, I saw the land pummelling down on top of the house.”  She adds: “I placed my hands on my head as I tried to process what I was seeing. “A lump formed in my throat as I sobbed silently. My home was destroyed. “All the land, stones and crops were still sliding and I was left without a house, with nothing.” After about  minutes, Nancy and her cousins went to see what they could salvage from the rubble but it was still raining and there was a chance of another landslide.  With their hearts still pounding, they could just about make out the desperate meow of their kitten amongst the pouring rain. “We found her in what was left of the kitchen under all the debris and mud, her little nose poking out,” Nancy says. “She was the only thing we managed to save that day. “The structure of the home, the kitchen, the bathroom, the organic waste drain that we had recently erected, as well as an essential water drain had been demolished by the landslide.” One year on, the house still needs some repairs but the family were lucky in some ways that day. By some miracle, their coffee crops survived the storms. Others were not so lucky - entire coffee farms in the region were wiped out. “I am proud to come from a long line of coffee farmers in Nicaragua and took over our small family-run business from my late father, who died in July ,” Nancy says.  Nicaragua has , coffee farmers, with % of them being small producers like Nancy. But living on the front line of the climate crisis is making le even more challenging. Nancy says: “When my grandparents settled on the mountain in , the land was fertile and the climate was ideal for growing coffee. Now  years later, coffee is still cultivated on the same land but the temperature increase we’re experiencing is destroying our crops.” As temperatures rise, it’s thought that good coffee will become increasingly dficult to grow. And by , about half of land used for high-quality coffee will be unproductive, studies show. Crops are also affected by fungus such as coffee rust and berry spot which wipe them out. Extreme weather resulting from climate change only hastens the spread of this fungus.It’s thought these factors alone could wipe out as much as two-fths of Central America’s coffee crop. “This is a heartbreaking statistic, Nancy says. “My late father, who died age , is my greatest source of inspiration and pride in le. As a coffee farmer he made sure not to harm the environment and taught me the best approach to use and manage natural resources, which is what I will eventually study at university.  “He worked for almost a decade to become a % organic coffee producer and run a self-sustaining farm while still protecting a portion of the virgin forest. Our farm, Rancho Viejo, was his le’s work until the end of his days. “I had to take over the unfinished business when he died because harvest time was approaching and the place was so special to him. So I committed myself to carrying on his legacy.”  In the past three years alone climate change and emigration has had a signicant impact on the cultivation, harvest, and profitability of coffee. Last year coffee ripening was delayed by the heavy rains that affected the country, but this year it began early in October due to a lack of rain. And many people in the rural regions are emigrating in search of higher-paying jobs, so the labour force for coffee harvesting has decreased signicantly throughout the years. “We fear the hurricanes we faced last year are just the beginning,” Nancy says. “It is getting harder every day to continue my father’s legacy as a sustainable and responsible coffee farmer, but I will carry on for as long as I can.”Hixell volunteers with Raleigh International Find out more and support their work here.Raleigh International is a global youth action organisation supporting a global movement of young people to take action for the planet.Young people are at the forefront of building a fairer, more inclusive and greener world, and are actively confronting the planet’s most urgent crises through Raleigh International’s Action Not Excuses global campaign.

Zane Wedding went for a dip at a swimming pool and when he ed he had a blocked ear.He put some drops in his ear reports CNN and went for a snooze on his couchThe following morning, however, his ear was still blocked and it still was casing him huge irritation. And he was annoyed by it so much, he waited outside the doctors before the door of the surgery opened Mr Wedding was told by his doctor, he may have water stuck in his ear and suggested using a hairdryer to tackle the problem and dry it out.

Mr Wedding, of Auckland, New Zealand arranged a booking with a specialist as soon as he could get to the bottom of the issue The specialist took one look inside Mr Weddingaposs ear and said he thought there was an insect inside. Mr Wedding realised every movement he had felt a wriggle was the insect moving inside his ear. He said: I instantly thought of the fact I had just been pumping hot air into my head and cooking a cockroach in my ear canal all weekend. It made me feel sick.  To his enormous relief, a dead cockroach was finally removed by his doctor a five-minute procedure. Every time she touched it I just imagined her squishing a cockroach into my eardrum, so I wasnapost the perfect patient. It was instant relief... I felt a pop as soon as the doctor pulled it away, he said. Once I knew it was a bug it all clicked together... Thataposs why the water would move even when I was still.

It#s estimated that  million plant pots and seed trays are sold every year and the majority are sent to landfill or are incinerated.But there are non-plastic alternatives such as biodegradable pots made using materials like coir, wood chips, bamboo and rice husks.A growing number of garden centres and nurseries use biodegradable pots, but it#s worth checking out their sustainability policies.You can also make your own pots using newspaper or toilet roll tubes.And now is a good time to make your own supplies of biodegradable pots so you have stock for the planting season in a couple of months.If you#ve got a supply of old newspapers to hand, simply roll a cm-wide strip of newspaper tightly around a glass tumbler, leaving cm beyond the bottom of the glass.Fold the excess paper across the bottom, then press the glass down to flatten the pot#s base.There is no need to fix your paper pot with tape, just slide it off the glass.When ready to plant, just fill with compost.Taking good care of existing plastic is a good way to ensure you don#t have to keep buying it – so reuse any plant pots you have again and again for new seedlings, cuttings and plants.If you look after your propagator trays and lids, repairing themthey crack, they will last for several seasons.You can also reuse compost bags to store compost or turn leaves into leaf mould.The added bonus of recycling or reusing items in the garden is that it also reduces cost – as does growing from seed rather than buying established plants.Even in winter, you can grow something from seed, you just need a seed tray and a window ledge, or small cold frame or greenhouse – whatever space and budgets allow.For anyone growing their own vegetables, January is great for sowing onions.If you sow onions then, it saves the expense of buying onion sets – small bulbs – later, and you can have a much larger crop of onions in the summer.Onions seeds do not have a long shelf-le, so it#s best to buy new seeds each year.Seeds will germinate between C and C, one or two weeks after sowing.When large enough to handle, transplant to inidual small pots and keep in a bright, frost-free place until April when they can be planted outside.Varieties to try include: Setton – high yield, yellow skinned and good storage potential Red Baron – a late maturing red onion with globe shaped bulbs and strong taste and Hybound – an early iety with bronze-brown skins which is excellent for long-term storage.January is often the coldest month in the garden but there are still some things you can be doing to keep busy.As the Royal Horticultural Society says, January might be the middle of winter but, as the days en, the garden starts to grow.It is a great time to plan for the coming gardening year and to order seeds and plants.Enjoy the fresh air on dry sunny days, and check your winter protection, stakes, ties and supports are still working after any severe weather.Also, put out food for birds and leave some garden areas uncut, a little longer, to provide shelter for wildle in your garden.Top three jobs this month: clean pots and greenhouses ready for spring, dig over empty or unused plots, and prune apple and

available all from Scotland#s west coast and help boost links between tourism and food and drink.Top Argyll chefs and others from farther afield will be preparing a range of mouth-watering dishes utilising the area#s products including oysters, venison, scallops and meat from Scotland#s only snail farm based in Tayinloan.In addition, there will be new products from the area including trout

demonstrations, visitors will be able to sample oysters at a specially-created oyster bar and a range of other foods.Speed cameras could be installed on Argyll roads in a bid to cut down on speed-related accidents.Argyll and Bute Council#s roads director Alistair Gow told councillors that use of both fixed and portable cameras to detect speeding had increased dramatically in the last few years.They had been pioneered by the former Strathclyde Regional Council which had paid for their purchase and installation with the police meeting the running costs.From the limited information available, an average drop of  per cent in injury accidents was being achieved where they were being used in the UK.#A substantial proportion of injury accidents within Argyll and Bute are speed related and in view of the above statistics, remote speed enforcement could substantially reduce the occurrence of accidents of this nature,# he said.#There are other types of equipment available which are not intended to operate as enforcement tools, but instead to convey a visual message to speeding motorists. This equipment has the advantage of raising driver awareness of the technology available, without the need to proceed with enforcement.#Councillors agreed that officials should investigate the ious forms of remote speed detection equipment, in consultation with Strathclyde Police and the Scottish Office, as trunk roads authority, and report back.FIFTY YEARS AGOThe New Year in Campbeltown was celebrated quietly at the weekend.Apart from a few breathalyser tests, police said the town was remarkably quiet. There were no incidents of breach of the peace, assaults and so on.All was peaceful on Islay too.No public houses or hotel bars were open to the public on New Year#s Day, which undoubtedly helped to keep everything quiet.There was one New Year#s Day incident. A van belonging to the Redfusion television company struck a wall on Low Askomill. Nobody was hurt.The breathalyser appears to have retained its purpose.All the burgh#s taxis were kept going non-stop over the Christmas and New Year period and operators reported heavy bookings.The West Coast coaches were also well used by people who sensibly left the car at home.Shops were kept busy during the few festive days and licensed grocers sold big amounts of the #cratur# and other alcoholic drinks.Christmas and New Year Day babies expected at Craigard Maternity Hospital failed to arrive and the staff had a quiet time of it.A large crowd of people of all denominations and from all over the country converged on Carradale House, home of the authoress Mrs Naomi Mitchison, to take part in the New Year celebrations.This was the rd time that Mrs Mitchison had played host to a large number of guests at Carradale.Politicians, government workers, farmers and fishermen all mingled together, danced, sung and sampled an excellent buffet.Many Carradale villagers were also present.Addressing the guests, Mrs Mitchison talked about the effects of the Common Market and fishermen.

the east of the county.And most respondents insisted that the only place where they would be acceptable would be the Honest Toun.People were asked their views as East Lothian Council consulted over whether it needed to introduce a licensing policy for sexual entertainment venues.The policy, which could also apply to swingers clubs and private house parties, comes after the Scottish Government gave local authorities discretionary powers to introduce the additional licences.A survey launched on the East Lothian Consultation Hub asked for public views on whether venues should be licensed and which locations would be acceptable for such venues and which would not.The findings, which go before the council’s licensing sub-committee tomorrow , saw a majority of those giving a view naming Musselburgh as the only suitable place.Residents in the east of the county insisted that their towns and villages would not be suitable, with Gullane, North Berwick and Dunbar all ruled out by those taking part.The vast majority of people responding told the council that they did not believe anywhere was suitable for sex venues in East Lothian, with most also responding to a question about the number of licensed venues the county should allow by saying there should be zero.When asked which locations were unsuitable for such venues, responses included: “Gullane, North Berwick, Dunbar”, “wherever you’re thinking of putting them” and “the rest of East Lothian except for Musselburgh”.One respondent, however, suggested the county’s secluded Archerfield and Renaissance golf clubs as suitable sites, pointing out that they were “away from public locations”.While another pointed to unused sites across the county, adding: “There is a lot of wasteland areas in small towns such as Haddington I can think of from the top of my head that would be more than perfect for establishing a business like this.”This week’s sub-committee meeting will be asked to consider introducing a licensing policy, with members warned that having no policy would leave the county open to sex clubs opening without any controls in place to oversee them.However, a report to members added: “Introducing the licensing of sex entertainment venues is not equivalent to accepting or supporting such businesses.“That control could,deemed appropriate, include a policy setting the number of such businesses to be permitted at zero.”"},{"url":null,"title":"eighteen-lady-members-now-playing-muirfield-course-prepares-host-womens-open","story":"Women were invited to join the world-famous

that I would one day give my grandchildren their very own picture book or early reader chapter book.”He said: “Snoozlewhoosh is not any normal toy owl but an adorable, mystical and magical

dinosaurs and asked to travel to an island with Snoozlewhoosh, Jude also picked a triceratops, a stegosaurus and a t-rex.”Mr Brown added: “They were both very excited when we discussed that Snoozlewhoosh comes to le when children fall asleep and that Snoozlewhoosh takes them on amazing journeys in the magical world of dreams.”He was advised to trademark Snoozlewhoosh by a friend in the

each grandchild at the very least.“Once the trademark was successful, I decided I would write and create a series of books, starting with a story for each of my grandchildren.”Evie Brown and her five-year-old brother Jude, both pupils at Stoneyhill Primary School in Musselburgh, received their books as gts on Christmas Eve, much to their delight and that of their parents, Zander and

But its the right decision.\"It makes so much sense to do a fourth its at the top of its game, people love it, the money goes up. But I think its right, artistically, to end on this high.\"After Le follows widower Tony , whose beloved we Lisadied from cancer.Through both funny and heartbreaking flashbacks, we see how amazing the couple was together, and in the present day, its clear that journalist Tony is still struggling to live with his grief and being left behind.But while in the previous series he discussed being suicidal, this series feels more hopeful.His beautul dog Brandy continues to bring him joy and hes become close to Emma , who was a nurse at his late fathers care home.We see him opening up to people , hes more involved with the local communityand he realises that making others feel good can give him a reason to live.\"Thats probably the biggest single change in series three to the first two its infused with the idea thatyou lose everything, hope is everything,\" suggests Gervais, whose long-term partner is author Jane Fallon.One of the reasons After Le has been such a success is how raw and emotional it is seemingly out of nowhere, youll be a hit with a gut-wrenching moment.After all, the subject of death and le after death is something that we often avoid.Has creating, writing, directing, and starring in this show made Gervais think about his own mortality more \"Ive always thought about it,\" he muses.\"I studied science and biology. I know the circle of le. I knew that from an early age that you live, you get old, you die and thats it. Ive been an atheist since I was about eight or nine. I studied philosophy, so I had to think of those things.\"I do a podcast with Sam Harris and it always gets around to mortality, death, morality, whats the point - all those things.\"But I dont think of it in a morbid way we are all going to die and theres nothing we can do about it.\"I think its beautul that le is finite.\"A few of the quirky and outlandish characters Tony has met through his work at the Tambury Gazette come further to the fore in these six episodes .Then there are the scenes with Matt , who is Lisas caring younger brother .Theres a poignant exploration of how Matts grief was put to one side after his sisters death because the focus was on Tony. It feels rare to see men talking about their emotions and mental health on screen in such a candid way.Gervais thinks thats partly the fault of broadcasters and creators, because \"theyre second-guessing the audience and they go, Maybe they dont want to see this.\"And I think thats not true - I think people want to see themselves,\" he continues. \"All the feedback Ive had was people going, When I lost my partner, or my mum, I was angry like that, and they think, Oh yeah, thats normal. Its okay to be not okay.\"And also, most TV comedies dont want to go there - they dont want to bring people down, because they think they cant make it funny. Most heroes in dramas, you dont see them crying, because its like a weakness and heroes shouldnt have weaknesses which, again, its not true.\"Some of the lighter moments in the new episodes come from Tony and Matt competing against each other in ious sports.Its Matts idea because hes worried about Tonys health, and he thinks it will help him to release some anger and emotion.Tony is up for the challenge as he insists he will come out on top - and its hilarious.\"My sport is tennis its all I can play now, and then I cant walk the next day,\" quips Gervais.\"But I chose sports that I could actually play, I chose racket sports, and I made sure that Tom could [play]. And it was just great, it was so much fun.\"He came up with the storyline with Basden and says that this teamwork happened with the rest of the cast too .\"They dont just turn up on the day, and Ive written this amazing script - theyre involved.\"Its an ensemble piece, but its also collaborative - I just get all the credit.\"Its clear just how much Gervais enjoys talking about After Le, and how passionate he is about all of the characters.Maybe, just maybe, we could be reunited with Tony in the future - perhaps a Christmas special \"Its so tempting,\" confides Gervais. \"Id love every minute of it. Never say never.\"I love working with [this cast]. The next thing I do Im going to hire everyone again, so its not over as far as thats concerned. And that is a big issue I love working with people I like. I dont want to go through hell, hate everything, to win an award.\"Letting out one of his signature laughs, he adds: \"I want people to love it, I want awards, I want to be paid, I want to have the best time, every day, with all my mates - thats all I ask.\"After Le season  is available on Netflix"},{"url":null,"title":"resign-boris-says-everyone","story":"On  Live Nicky Campbell said that  per cent of those phoning in were condemning what had happened and also condemning the Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who was reported to have attended. There was a similar level of disgust on Stephen Jardine’s show over on Radio Scotland.Perhaps inevitably, the anger for many was tied to grief. Dave from Bolton rang in to tell Campbell about his -year-old daughter who had been diagnosed with a brain tumour in December  and was in hospital in an isolation ward with Covid at the time of the Downing Street party.“We saw the news last night and my we just sat there breaking her heart, absolutely breaking her heart,” Dave told Campbell.  On Radio Scotland Jardine read out a text from one listener who said simply: “On the day when the government drinks party was going ahead one listener simply said I was watching my brother dying on an iPad.”Callers to Radio Scotland were mostly of one mind. The Prime Minister has to go. On  Live Guto Harri, a former adviser to the Prime Minister, suggested that it needn’t go that far. What he had to do, Harri suggested, is come out, apologise profusely and eat a lot of humble pie. “I can see why he’s an ex-adviser,” the next caller suggested.On Tuesday BYOB was trending on Twitter for obvious reasons.

Mabuse took some tap lessons, spoke to a film historian and in passing learned about his genius.  Astaire’s legacy, Bourne concluded, is simply that he made us “feel like we all could dance like him.” If only, Matthew,only.Random radio joy of the week came last Saturday on Radio ’s This Classical Le when conductor and composer Eimear Noone explained to Jess Gillam that she always plays AC DC’s Back in Black before she goes onstage to gee herself up.“Would the boys from AC DC be nervous right now  No, they wouldn’t.

The lightweight Mr Ross failed to land any punches last year, to the disservice of our country.As the Tories look to haemorrhage more support in May, its time they accepted that the real problem with the Scottish Tories is the Scottish Tories – no vision, no new ideas to counter existing dogma and unwilling to stand up for anything they really believe in.If they truly believe that their electoral success will improve with Mr Johnson gone, then it proves simply they have nothing to offer in their own right and their success is dependent on the UK party they appear to so despise. Mr Ross should consider his own position before anyone s.Jamie Black, Largs.* I HAD the honour some time ago of being appointed to work at the Arts Council in London by William Rees-Mogg, whose son Jacob on occasion tripped into the office with his father. The son’s reputation after those occasions, I’m afraid, was as an over-indulged and precocious brat. As William Wordsworth observed, \"the child is father of the man\".So, when the child calls Douglas Ross a \"lightweight\", one has to take account of the gravitas of the name-caller. Certainly, I would be reluctant to call anyone who has regularly served as a referee at Scottish football grounds a \"lightweight\".As to the suggestion Mr Ross has less gravitas than the current Secretary of State for Scotland, I have to say it is dficult to judge the relative weight of someone who is prepared to face the public and speak his mind openly and honestly with an invisible man.Ian Brown, Gfnock.THE PROBLEM IS THE SYSTEMIT’S hard not to draw parallels between the increasing public concern regarding the extra-curricular activities of the Duke of Yorkand the behaviour of Boris Johnson. Both are from privileged backgrounds and from what one can glean, both have led shall we say colourful lives. Their joint response to their activities being questioned has been much the same, one of denial and obfuscation and an assumption that their status allows them a degree of latitude denied others further down the social scale.The situation in my eyes is the embodiment of the “us and them” nature of British society where the “haves” matter and the “have-nots” can be ignored. The situation was summed up nicely in an interview with Jacob Rees-Mogg, the archetypical upper-class stereotype and bastion of the Establishment. While unequivocally supporting Mr Johnson, Lord Snooty condemned the leader of the Scottish Conservative Party as “lightweight” and declared the unanimous opinion of all Scottish Conservative MSP to be irrelevant.Mr Rees-Mogg appears to think that as long as the Westminster-appointed Scottish Viceroysupports Mr Johnson then what anyone  north of Hadrian’s Wall thinks is irrelevant. That is UK society and UK democracy in the proverbial nutshell. The problem is not Boris Johnson but the whole rotten system.David J Crawford, Glasgow.SCOTS TORIES REAL ENEMY IS SNPTHE attacks on Boris Johnson from the media and from within and without the Tory Party would seem justied. His time in power seems to have been chaotic at best and bumbling and stumbling haplessly from one mess to the next can only go on so long, even for the up-to-now Teflon-covered Boris Johnson.However, what disturbs me is that the attacks on the Prime Minister from the Tories in Scotland, as well as from other opposition parties, are particularly fierce. I despair that the real enemy for Scottish-based politicians is surely the SNP, yet it does not receive anywhere like that opprobrium. The opposition parties in Scotland have never shown the same ferocity in their attacks on the First Minister and her administration, who are equally,not much more, inept. Of course I am aware that many think that with a stronger Tory leader and Prime Minister, the nationalist dragon will be slain, but that is surely wishful thinking.If they – and the media – would only put Scottish nationalism under the same microscope and pressure they exact on the Tories in London, this country would perhaps begin to find a way out from under the dead hand of perpetual grievance, rancour and mind-blowing incompetence that is an administration of Scottish nationalists.Alexander McKay, Edinburgh.CONSERVATIVES ARE TO BLAMEI BLAME the Conservative Party.Anybody with any interest in politics knows that Boris Johnson is not a fit person to be Prime Minister. He has a long history of irresponsibility, mendacity, indolence, promiscuity, entitlement, self-interest, and more.Yet the Tory Party, a party which would claim to be the party of honesty and decency, ignored all of this, and put him in place because they thought that he could help them to achieve their aim of leaving the EU, a cause which most sensible people, who are not rich, or likely to benefit directly, knew full well would be a disaster.Yet, for their own advantage, the Tories disregarded the national interest, and put this disreputable, discredited inidual in charge.Their rich friends and donors have benefited hugely, whilst the country has become a laughing stock internationally, with a large section of the population living on the breadline, even those in work.Mr Johnson should never have been entrusted with any responsible position, and certainly not leader of the nation, and the Conservative Party put him there in the full knowledge of his character and competence.It’s time they accepted responsibility and took the appropriate action.Les Mackay, Dundee.BETTER THE DEVIL WE KNOWIT looks asAlison Rowat , along with most others, wants Boris Johnson to go, whether willingly or unwillingly. I am not in any way a fan of our dear leader, but getting rid of him leaves the way clear for somebody worse. There is nobody with any empathy or compassion in the Conservative Party. To look at the worst-case scenario, we might get Priti Patel, who believes desperate migrants should be pushed back into the Channel and left to drown. This despite her family being welcomed into Britain herself when Idi Amin was throwing Asians out of Uganda.I say lets keep Mr Johnson, at least we know what he is likely to get up to – have parties and tell lies and get Tory donors pay for his new sofas.Margaret Forbes, Kilmacolm.THIS WAS A VALID EXEMPTIONSOME obvious and pertinent facts are being overlooked in the explosion of indignation over the \"garden party\".A country will not run itself that is the job of the Prime Minister and his advisors, and must be conducted however grim the circumstances.Downing Street is unusual in world terms: Numbers  and  house the private residences of the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Unusually, however, they are also the workplaces of members of the Cabinet Office and the Prime Ministers office.In other words, Boris Johnson more or less lives in the shop, and the entire building has access to the garden.He has to consult on a daily basis with his work staff. After all, he is the Prime Minister.Given the stress that his office was under at the time, it seems sensible that his work bubble was invited into the garden for a little fresh air relaxation. And yes, why not a drink as well During the Covid crisis not everyone could isolate: Royal Navy ships went to sea, Army battalions were in a state of readiness, hospitals worked at full capacity, and the vital business of government had to continue.Working from home, lockdown, isolation rules and so on were necessary during the worst of Covid, but there are valid exceptions to most rules.Bruce Walker, Largs.PM LACKED BOTTLEWHY didnt Boris Johnson bring a carry-out to Prime Ministers Questions It might have helped to convince us all to believe that a BYOB do is normal working practice,he had turned up with a couple of screwtops in his jacket pockets.David Hay, Minard, Argyll.Read more: The UK deserves a far better leader than this"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13357804.jpg?type=article-full","title":"celtic-connections-online-concerts-announced-festival-adapts-amid-covid-restrictions","story":"Launching on Wednesday, January , the online programme will run for three weeks and showcase performances from acts spanning traditional folk, roots, Americana, jazz, soul and world music.The opening week of the festival will also now see a series of new live filmed sessions hosted at Glasgow’s Royal Concert Hall.

While Nicola Sturgeon urged the public to postpone Christmas parties and curtail socialising, Boris Johnson insisted that school nativities and office shindigs should go ahead Yet, in spite of all those dferences, Scotland and England have finished up in the same place. Or have they Firstly, it depends what we mean by \"cases\". Cases have been falling in England and Scotland since the beginning of the year, based on official daily data NB: England daily average up to January  Scotland daily average up to January  Based on positive tests reported through the NHS and Lighthouse laboratories, cases have been falling in both Scotland and England since the beginning of January.But these figures - which are also used to produce the official rate per , estimates - are mostly based on people proactively going for testing, either because they had symptoms orbecause they had tested positive on a lateral flow device.That can be skewed by everything from the availability of test slots, to asymptomatic infected people failing to get tested.The Office for National Statistics household surveillance project is therefore a more accurate gauge of the virus genuine prevalence in the community.: No baby deaths among vaccinated mothers who caught Covid in pregnancyAccording to it, England went from one in  people infected in the week ending November  to one in  by the week ending December  - a four-fold rise in prevalence. In the week ending January , the estimate was unchanged at one in , suggesting that infections are not actually in decline quite yet.In Scotland, virus prevalence increased three-fold over the same period - from one in  to one in  in the weeks ending December  and January .In fact, Scottish Government modelling - which takes into account undetected and asymptomatic infections - actually projects that Scotlands infections will finally peak today: January .Source: Modelling the Epidemic, Scottish Government On that basis then, infections spread faster and were  per cent more common in England than Scotland by the end of December and beginning of January.Similar patterns emerge when hospital admissions and deaths are compared.Between December  and January , a total of , Covid patients were admitted to hospital in Scotland out of a population of . million: a rate of . per ,.In England, with a population of .m, there were , Covid admissions: a rate of . per ,.On Covid deaths - , in England from December  to January , and  in Scotland - the rates were . and . per , respectively.In other words, the recent Covid hospital admission rate has been % higher in England than Scotland, and the death rate % higher.Hospital admissions both now appear to be levelling off in Scotland and EnglandOf course, not all Covid hospital admissions and deaths are \"because of\" Covid , but surely all of the above is proof than Scotlands restrictions saved lives, eased pressure on hospitals, and led to less infection-related disruption from staff absences Again, it is probably not so clear-cut.It is very dficult to unpick how much the better position in Scotland is down to the Governments \"protective measures\" per se, and how much would have come about anyway through voluntary behaviour changes and higher uptake of vaccines and boosters north of the border.Scotland has had higher booster coverage than England, although Northern Ireland - which has the lowest of the UK nations - although has an infection rate of one in , according to the ONS In Scotland, booster coverage across the total population climbed from % on November , before Omicron, to % by January  in England, it went from % to % over the same time.In Scotland, the iant also took hold initially in more affluent areas where vaccine uptake is higher in England it was seeded in London, which has one of the lowest vaccination rates in the country.It is also worth noting that the more confident tones of UK ministers clashed with messages of caution from government scientists such as Jenny Harries and Chris Whitty: regardless of official advice, the English public - worried about another ruined Christmas - shunned pubs and restaurants en masse, and many employers also chose to put their Christmas dos on ice.Notably though, Northern Ireland and Wales - which adopted much the same restrictions as Scotland on events, nightclubs, and hospitality - have also ended up with virus rates of one in .: Restrictions on outdoor events lted as Omicron wave turns a cornerSo, perhaps the restrictions - on top of behaviour changes and vaccines - were the thing that slowed the virus in the rest of the UK compared to England.The harder question is whether they are \"proportionate\": is the risk from the virus and the benefit of the restrictions still enough to balance out their harms to the economy and mental health  Arguably, isolation policies are now harming the NHS as much as the demands of dealing with sick Covid patients.The benefit-to-harm judgments have never been more polarised."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13377328.jpg?type=article-full","title":"saltcoats-harbour-emergency-car-plunges-water","story":"Police, fire and ambulance services, as well as coastguard personnel, were seen in the area at around .am on Friday.A er was also seen emerging from the water.It is believed no-one was in the car at the time. Eyewitnesses at the scene told the Herald an ambulance had been seen in the area at around am, though its not known whether that was connected..\" alt\"HeraldScotland: A car roof was visible in the waters .\" class\"editor-image\"A car roof was visible in the waters .

And, having taken over at the top of the URC last week with a commanding home win over Cardf, Mike Blair’s team go into this afternoon’s second cup game against London Irish in a very confident frame of mind.There is little or no risk of their getting carried away: Blair has insisted that these are early days both in terms of this season and of his steady transformation of the team’s playing style. Yet that style is one to which the players have taken with remarkable alacrity, not only because it is entertaining and attack-minded, but also because it allows them to take a lot of responsibility.Matt Currie, who takes over at centre from Mark Bennett in one of four changes from the side that beat Cardf, is a case in point. This will be only his sixth appearance for Edinburgh, but he has already distinguished himself for his mature leadership as well as his incisive attacking instincts.  “I think there’s the obvious stuff on the pitch, but what I also love about him is he’s a  year-old who’s leading in meetings,” Blair said yesterday after naming his team for the match in Brentford. “He’s putting his hand up, questioning the coaches and the other players. He’s askingwe’re doing things right and saying we need to do this here. From the outside he seems quite a quiet guy, but that ability to step up to try to drive what we want to do for a young man is really impressive.”While Currie has so far made only a handful of appearances for Edinburgh, that is also the case with the majority of the back ision, Ben Vellacott, Ramiro Moyano, Emiliano Boffelli, James Lang and Henry Immelman all having signed last summer. The number of newcomers has made Currie’s leadership qualities all the more important according to Blair.“You look at the back line we’ve got and there are six players with under ten games for the club,” the coach continued. “Matt was at the club last year and played a couple of games and has been involved in the academy. So he’s someone who knows Edinburgh Rugby better than most of the guys in the back line. It’s great that he’s stepped up and is driving what we’re all about.”Currie is the sole newcomer behind the scrum, and comes in for his third start of the season. Boan Venter gets a start at loosehead instead of Pierre Schoeman, Adam McBurney starts at hooker as both Stuart McInally and Dave Cherry are on the injured list, and Nick Haining is at blindside in a reshuffled back row from which Hamish Watson drops out. Patrick Harrison is back-up hooker and Connor Boyle is also among the forwards replacements. The three backs on the bench are the same as last week: scrum-half Charlie Shiel, stand-off Jaco van der Walt and centre Chris Dean.In addition to McInally and Cherry, six others are unavailable because of injury or Covid concerns: Luan de Bruin, Darcy Graham, Damien Hoyland, James Johnstone, Bill Mata and Ben Toolis.London Irish, meanwhile, include two former Edinburgh players in their squad  - Kyle Rowe, who starts on the right wing, and Scotland international prop Allan Dell, who is on the bench. “I love the way London Irish play,” Blair added. “They move the ball around a lot, are really innovative with what they’re trying to do, with their set plays and scrum plays - I think it’ll be an excellent game.”With three teams from each pool going through automatically to the last , another victory in London today would take Edinburgh within touching distance of the knock-out stages.Edinburgh : H Immelman E Boffelli, M Currie, J Lang, R Moyano B Kinghorn, B Vellacott B Venter, A McBurney, W Nel, J Hodgson, G Gilchrist , N Haining, J Ritchie, M Bradbury.

I feel lucky to have had involvement in it.Charlie has had a rough time with injury. She has maybe even written off by some.But she has kept chipping away at the process goals and in Schladming delivered a top  result as she skied herself into th place in a race that seen Mikaela Shfrin make ski racing history.It was also the first time the women’s tour had raced under the lights in Schladming and although Covid didn’t allow for the full experience it will forever stay in the mind of Guest as her first top  result. This has got to have filled the Scottish skier with confidence as the Olympics approach.And it was not just a one off as Guest has been bagging top s this season and is showing consistent skiing each week.Watching her the last few weeks took me back to our coffee in Switzerland and the conversation we shared about the beauty of the mountains.How even on the hard training days on the glaciers that this sport is special. Maybe as skiers we are biased but le in the mountains has a simplicity to it. Some would say they is a spiritual essence to le in the mountains.

However, when ministers then assert that ferry replacement costs must be met by Orkney Islands Council, but not by their counterparts on the west coast, it simply runs salt in the wounds.#Indeed, during the same question time, the transport minister boasted about a £m Scottish Government investment in port infrastructure serving one west coast route, even though it falls under the responsibility of the local council. That being the case, there is no reason why similar investment cannot be made in vessel replacement on Orkney’s leline internal ferry routes.#I welcome confirmation that discussions are ongoing between the Finance Secretary and OIC.

It’s not only Cristiano. We have Edinson , we have Harry , we have quite a few other older players – David de Gea in goal, Victor Lindelof, Bruno .“We have enough experienced, older players who can not only be role models themselves in training, on the pitch and in games but also in all those conversations that happen in the locker room or when they are together in the hotel for away games or home games.“This has to happen.

It doesn’t work the other way around.”Ronaldo could be back along with captain Maguire on Saturday, but Rangnick dismissed a suggestion that the Portuguese may be more effective as United skipper on a permanent basis.“Right now I don’t see a reason to do that because Harry has been the captain so far,” he said.“As long as Harry is playing he will be the captain andhe’s not playing then someone  will have to be the captain.

Dr Jaffa is essentially a spokesman and an apologist for the salmon farming industry.#It#s no coincidence that wild salmon stocks have collapsed in all areas of the northern hemisphere where open net salmon farming has developed.#Peter Cunningham, biologist with the Wester Ross Fisheries Trust, said: #It is the salmon farming industry#s inability to manage parasitic sea lice that is the major threat to wild salmon.

So much of what we learn in terms of socialisation and relationships does not happen in a classroom but across all the other day to day activities and interactions that take place.“It is a huge issue. Our young people have lost a lot in terms of their formal education but for me, they have also lost a massive amount in terms of the other areas of development that their education brings.”Portree High School pupil Luke Eveling, who has published a book about facing mental health challenges as a teenager on Skye, believes the pandemic had taken a toll on his age-group.He said: #Lockdown and the pandemic more widely definitely had an effect on young people in school. A lot of my friends are finding it hard to cope with exams and more broadly the pandemic simultaneously. This has influenced how well they are doing at school.#I have a few friends who have turned to serious drug abuse as a way of coping with the combined pressure, and others have stopped going to school completely.”In April , Luke bravely shared his own challenges through his book ‘A Series of Essays About Mental Health’.Within the book, Luke, who lives in Broadford, wrote frankly about a wide range of issues including heartbreak, peer pressure, drug abuse, and suicide. at the time, Luke talked about being diagnosed with Asperger’s and coping with isolation during the pandemic.While last year Luke spoke warmly about the “overwhelming support” he had received from family, friends and the wider community after opening up about his own circumstances, he believed more support services should be made available to help other young people.He added: #There are some, but there just isn’t enough for everyone. Things like having a school counsellor sound good but just don’t seem to reach everyone who needs help.#Councillor Finlayson added: “We know the importance of mental health # people are nervous about the pandemic and have not been able to socialise as before. We already have and will continue to have a situation where some young people will really struggle to get back to being with their peers and to sustaining positive relationships.“Parents are rightly concerned. Their children are in a totally unique situation given the global scope of the pandemic and the impact it has had and will continue to have on how education is delivered.“Supporting all aspects of education in its widest form needs to be a priority for all levels of government from the UK Government to Scottish Government to local government.“We all need to realise that the young people who have been in schools for the last two years have been disadvantaged in many dferent ways.“We need to take account of this going forward in terms of additional resources and possibly a catch-up curriculum and perhaps even more importantly, support for all aspects of young people’s health and wellbeing including mental health.”Assessing the lay of the land in schools across the region, Councillor Finlayson said: “Within Highland we will be continuing to follow the rules and mitigation measures that were in place previously and have come from the Scottish Government # all these things masks in classrooms, social distancing, ventilation in classrooms, limiting contact with other year groups and classes as much as possible will continue. What the rest of the country will be expected to do.“Better ventilation is being encouraged in schools # but we must consider the time of year and the fact that some of the schools within the Highland Council are pretty antiquated and not in the greatest condition.“I am keen that schools should make decisions that suit their own circumstances # because each school is dferent.#"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/annie-johnston-with-John-Lorne-Campbell.jpg","title":"tobar and dualchais a visit to canna south uist and barra in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineI have drawn on an intermittent diary kept at the time, to help with my present memories of the occasions., was by any standard a memorable experience.Campbell, a leading Gaelic scholar already well known internationally, had from the s carried out ground-breaking fieldwork recording Gaelic oral tradition in the Hebrides and in Gaelic Nova Scotia.

Credit: PAJanuary   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailAt last, some explanation and some contrition. But the Prime Minister’s long-overdue statement to Parliament on Wednesday at the stroke of noon posed yet further questions which will dog him in the coming days.That it took so long for the Prime Minister to even admit he attended the now-notorious party on th May  — which could have easily been delivered to camera outside Downing Street or in a studio hours or even days before — is yet more evidence he is being badly advised.  Or, as I strongly suspect, it’s worse than that: diligent advisers who did the job I used to are giving Boris Johnson the correct advice, but he is ignoring it.His excuses will not convince his MPs, or the public.The contention that “I didn’t know it was a party” has already been widely ridiculed, as have hollow words about the Downing Street garden being an extension of the workplace.Many quite reasonably ask: since when was a work event labelled BYOB  Downing Street has a beautul, large garden and as a journalist and former special adviser I have often attended s there in non-Covid times.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up There is no doubt what the rules were in May .  Less than an hour before the party, the then-Culture Secretary even reminded us of those rules from another part of Downing Street at a press conference, beamed into homes across the UK.On Wednesday, I did what the Prime Minister took so long to get around to, and checked my diary from May .Less than  hours after the Prime Minister’s event with  colleagues, knocking back wine and enjoying the London sunshine, I attended the funeral of my great aunt Beryl in Lisburn. There was no service. Close members of Beryl’s family unable to even touch her coffin to say goodbye.  Around  people in total there, all socially distanced, for the shortest time possible.Countless other people will have similar — and indeed much worse — tales of sacrices made because of rules we were instructed to follow. Political scandals come and go. Who can honestly recite the finer details of the lobby scandal engulfing the former Secretary of State Owen Paterson in November Who can remember to whom David Cameron sent those Greensill WhatsApps, and why  The danger with Partygate is that it’s so straightforward: the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom imposed a draconian lockdown on the country, and then ignored it himself. Doctors died and Boris boozed.Ian Blackford, the leader of the Scottish Nationalists in Westminster, demands almost every week at Prime Minister’s Questions that Boris Johnson resigns, to the groans of MPs.For two years, Sir Keir Starmer has never once done the same, nor has he straightforwardly called the Prime Minister a liar.On Wednesday he did both, and that is signicant.And, late on Wednesday afternoon, the leader of the Conservatives in Scotland, Douglas Ross, called for the Prime Minister to go — the first Conservative MP to publicly do so.We know Mr Ross has also written to the chairman of the  committee — the backbenchers’ shop steward, essentially — Sir Graham Brady, to express his lack of confidence in Boris Johnson.The relationship between Johnson and Ross is fundamental to the fight for Scotland to remain in the Union, and it is now at its nadir.The Conservative bible, The Spectator magazine, asks this week on its front page, simply: ‘Is it over ’The veteran backbencher Sir Roger Gale has dubbed Boris Johnson a ‘dead man walking’.In contrast, the Prime Minister’s Cabinet colleagues Priti Patel, Michael Gove, Nadine Dorries and others attempted to rally the troops in support of their beleaguered general in the House of Commons tea rooms and on MPs’ WhatsApp groups.The Prime Minister remains in serious political danger.More evidence — perhaps photographs of Boris Johnson at the party — will most likely emerge by the weekend.It is clear these leaks and this campaign are co-ordinated by the Prime Minister’s political enemies, who are media savvy and possess a laser-like focus on their goal.Boris Johnson is — just about — still the most powerful man in the United Kingdom. The most powerful woman, now, is the former landlady of The Cove Bar on the Hilltown Road between Newry and Mayobridge, the senior civil servant Sue Gray.The question of whether she will call time on the Prime Minister’s career will be answered in the coming days.Peter Cardwell is a former special adviser to four Cabinet ministers, the Political Editor of talkRADIO and the author of The Secret Le of Special AdvisersRelated topicsBoris JohnsonMore On Boris JohnsonBereaved families in NI reveal pain endured during Covid lockdown and say Boris Johnson should resign over partyDaughter of Prof Jim Dornan joins growing number of people calling for Boris Johnson to resign PremiumAlliance councillor Michelle Kelly ‘sickened’ by Boris Johnson’s party after she suffered traumatic lockdown birth PremiumMark BainOpinionBoris Johnson apology: PM cut the figure of a man who knows he let country down over party PremiumNI’s Westminster parties voice opposition to planned MP pay riseMost ReadRUC held on to informers it knew were part of loyalist murder gang, Police Ombudsman report findsAllison MorrisOpinionLatest Ombudsman’s report a shocking snapshot of the dirty war at its worstPrince Andrew loses patronages of NI golf clubsAshling Murphy: ‘She was our youngest, a little angel.

Raymond has played for the Furey Brothers in the past, and later with the band Best Foot Forward.Kathleen is also a talented musician, so Ashling was immersed in music and the country’s musical heritage from an early age.Described as having had a natural talent, she played the fiddle and tin whistle, and had recently taken up mastering the dficult uilleann pipes.But her musical exploration wasn’t just personal. Ashlingliked to share her talents, her family explained.Despite being busy with work and hobbies she would teach local people music at the family home on Friday nights and all day Saturday, making sure that music would spread beyond her own family, and that its future as a traditional and cultural expression would be alive and vibrant. In the corner of the room sat a box containing her instruments and equipment. Picking up her tin whistle delicately, dad Raymond almost whispered: “That’s Ashling’s.” His daughter’s time as a teacher was to be tragically short-lived. The proud father said she had graduated from Mary Immaculate College in Limerick just last October.Photographs show her with her partner Ryan Casey and with her family, smiling proudly, with her whole le ahead of her.“When the position in Durrow National School came up, Ashling was interviewed and she was happy to be offered the position teaching the young first-class pupils,” Mr Murphy said.“And she was so happy because she was able to come home at night,” he added with a palpable sense that that proximity should have been a safety net of sorts.School principal James Hogan spoke of how Ashling was adored by pupils and staff, and how she brought all her talents to the classroom with a smile.A shrine of candles and flowers was placed at the gates of the school yesterday along with a photograph of Ashling. At another one inside the school doors, young pupils are leaving their own notes and thoughts.Ashling’s family also remember her love of sport, a passion she had since she was a young girl. “She was a marvellous hurler. She played camogie with the Kilcormac Killoughey club since she was five years of age,” said Kathleen.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseAshling Murphy FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueAshling MurphyRaymond said Ashling was jogging on the canal pathway to get her fitness up because the team were back training. “I was just talking to the manager of the club and he’s so distraught,” he said.Ashling was delighted to be able to get back into her le after Covid lockdowns started to ease and brightness lingered longer in the evening sky now that the shortest day of winter had passed. The new year held promises of better days to come, but she could not have known when she left Durrow National School on Wednesday afternoon that she would never make it home, and neverto school.As neighbours arrived throughout yesterday to comfort the family, Ashling’s grieving mother told how her daughter was “so well loved by everyone, and so well known”.“She was a beautul girl, she was just the best, She was our rock. She loved her style and her fashion, and she was so elegant. “She was so soft and gentle. She loved her boyfriend Ryan who she was with for five years. “He’s heartbroken.

Strangford Lough is a vital stopping off point as thousands comes to feed on its shores at low tide. Itrsquos an annual audio and visual spectacle that wildfowl expert Kerry Mackie never misses.As the woodlands burst into colour, songwriter Brigid OrsquoNeill draws inspiration before performing a secret gig at a small converted church on the shores of the lough.On a farm to the south tip of the lough, RSPB ranger Mark McCormick looks for endangered species like the yellowhammer. He explains how his work has helped him overcome PTSD which he suffered after witnessing a terrorist attack on Westminster Bridge in London.Around boats are being removed from the water and repaired, in Portaferry former ferry captain -year-old John Murray is getting his boat, the St Brendan, on to the quay for the winter, with the help of four generations of the Murray family.In the second episode, as winter approaches Hugh Thurgate is moving livestock between islands and Katy Bell from Ulster Wildle checks barn owl boxes at Mount Stewart. Bad weather is coming and preparations need to be made.As winter storms howl, Kenny Smyth makes sure the boats in his boatyard are secure, before retreating to his shed to work on Laragh, his beautul wooden River yacht. Working on the boat reminds Kenny of his father who established the yard after the war.Rough winter weather also gives Heidi McIlvenny a chance to search for shark egg cases, known by some as mermaidsrsquo purses. Strangford Lough provides habitat for sharks and rays and Heidirsquos work provides important research.At her farm near Greyabbey Kerry Angus looks forward to lambing and reflects how the care she provides for her flock is consistent with providing meat for the farm shop. Close by, Kerry Mackie is setting up traps for tagging oyster catchers.At Port Loughan farm, Katy is installing barn owl nesting boxes before the spring nesting season. Itrsquos been a long winter, but installing the boxes is a real sign that spring is on its way.In the third episode spring has sprung and there is new wildle arriving at the lough. As boat owners prepare for summer, Kieron Black says an emotional goodbye to Pavane, the boat owned by his late father, Brian Black, the environmental broadcaster and journalist who died in a tragic accident in Strangford harbour in .The fourth and final episode is set in summer, a busy season as humans and birds flock to the lough to enjoy its un-spoilt beauty and unique habitats.At Slievemoyle farm Mark McCormick from the RSPB is camping out for a dawn chorus survey. He is hoping he will hear the distinctive call of the endangered yellowhammer.Summers on Strangford lough mean long evenings stretching into glorious sunsets. In Portaferry four generations of the Murray family take the St Brendan out for an evening of fishing.Summer is regatta season on the Lough and a big moment for Kenny Smyth and his River class yacht. Itrsquos  years since the Rivers were built, and Kenny is hoping to wrestle a race trophy from his brother, Graham.Away from the buzz of summer activities, Katy Bell is hoping to find healthy barn owl chicks. Wet and extremely hot weather has meant most of the sites have failed this year, but a new site may have some healthy chicks.Out on the lough Kerry Mackie is counting greylag geese. Itrsquos important to monitor the populations as they can cause problems for farmers.

Newcastle did not make things easy for the visitors and constantly remained a threat in attack with the experienced Neil Corr causing problems all afternoon.Celticrsquos Conaill Kerr had his headed goal chalked off after he was adjudged to have fouled custodian Canavan by referee Peter Kelly.Kerr was determined not to be deterred by this and went on a surging run in the next passage of play, dancing around the Newcastle defence to unleash a shot that just whisked wide of the post.This seemed to wake up the Seasiders, who forced Celtic to retreat into their own half largely in thanks to the midfield display of Peter Brannigan.Newcastle nearly had their momentum derailed when lsquokeeper Canavan misplaced a pass to the feet of Gibney, although the Celtic strikerrsquos snapshot landed safely back into the arms of the grateful number one.As the hosts went back on the attack, Richard McInerney combined well with Shane Kearney before the Newcastle number rsquos inviting cross into the box was punched to safety by Celtic lsquokeeper Nathan Curran.The following ten minutes of play consisted of both teams battling for possession in the middle of the park, where man of the match Corey McCartan was notably winning the lionrsquos share for his Celtic side.The Hoops almost doubled their lead when Jordan McCoubrey fired a cross into the Newcastle box where team-mate Gibney managed to poke his head in front of Canavan to round the lsquokeeper.However, with the angle at goal not in his favour, the Celtic number nine saw his effort sail across the line and eventually out for a throw-in. This signalled the last notable passage of play before the half-time interval.Celtic began the restart positively with the ball quickly making its way back to lsquokeeper Curran, who sent a cross field pass to the feet of Stephen Galbraith.The Hoopsrsquo midfielder played a cute first time pass to Gibney, who sumptuously back-heeled to team-mate McCoubrey for a shot on goal that resulted in a corner.Newcastle decided to fight fire with fire and went on the attack. In what was possibly another sign that it wasnrsquot to be their day, the hosts had appeals for a penalty waved off after Brannigan was met with a tackle that sent him to the floor inside the box.The Seasiders enjoyed a purple patch where they hit the visitors with wave after wave of attacks, although they couldnrsquot find the vital touch to put the ball in the net.Celtic lsquokeeper Curran was forced to clear his lines on multiple occasions, and to his credit, The Hoopsrsquo number one remained sharp and focused throughout the  minutes.Peter OrsquoHare and skipper Louis Brunsdon were pulling the strings for Newcastle, but their final ball was just off the mark in what was becoming an increasingly frustrating afternoon for the home side.As the playing conditions began to become increasingly worse, there was a bright light in Celtic youngster Eoin Kelly, who made an impactful appearance off the bench and slowly began to swing the momentum in favour of his side ndash largely also in thanks to team-mate McCartan overturning possession in midfield.Another Celtic substitute, Sean McMahon, forced Newcastle lsquokeeper Canavan to produce the save of the match after his left footed effort was erted outside the post by a spectacular acrobatic e.The resultant corner was met with a similarly impressive save from Canavan, who stopped a point blank flick on header from Kelly.Newcastlersquos purple patch had well and truly ended and this was signied further when Celtic doubled their lead through skipper Michael Rice.After a long ball into the box looped over the Seasidersrsquo defence, the ball rolled invitingly out for Rice to toe poke beyond the impressive Canavan with  minutes left on the clock.The home outfit were not one to give up and went in search of the goal that would set up a nervous last few moments for their opponents.Corr almost awarded his side this opportunity when the ball landed at the veteranrsquos feet with only Curran to beat.However, the stubborn Celtic custodian refused to be bettered and spread his six foot frame as wide as he could to narrow the target and deny the certain goal.Moments later, Celticrsquos Peter Casey was clattered in the middle of the park but referee Kelly waved on the advantage which turned out to be an important call.Megahey gathered the loose ball on the right hand side of the pitch, before squaring a pass to Gibney, who struck a curling effort into the top right corner of the net to round off the scoring.Resilient to the end, Newcastle launched one last attack in search of a consolation goal.Despite the ball hitting the Celtic post in the midst of a goalmouth scramble, Newcastle captain Brunsdon couldnrsquot supply the required rebound and the referee blew his whistle for the final time.After the contest, man of the match Corey McCartan gave his thoughts on his sidersquos performance and winning start to the year.ldquoAll of the boys worked hard, especially coming back from a few weeks off after Christmas, he said.ldquoIt was a hard game and everyone was still stf, so I think it was physically tough for both teams and the weather definitely didnrsquot help.ldquoNewcastle surprised me because of how sharp they were and how high of a level their fitness was, but we got the job done and are now focused on the next game.Newcastle: F Canavan, C Scott, S Kelly, D Allister, J Maginn, P Brannigan, P OrsquoHare, L Brunsdon , R McInerney, N Corr, S Kearney.Subs: D Rooney, C McMahon, C Morrison.Celtic Bhoys: N Curran, S Megahey, R Quinn, B Connolly, M Rice , C McCartan, S Galbraith, P Casey, J Gibney, J McCoubrey, C Kerr.Subs: R Fitzpatrick, E Kelly, S McMahon.Referee: Peter Kelly..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/12_January2022_IrishStreet.jpg","title":"Downpatrick regeneration ‘offers some light’ for year  ","story":"A LOCAL politician has warned that  could be a dficult year for the economy.Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran says he fears there could be job losses in the retail sector and has called on Newry, Mourne and Down Council to do all it can to provide support.He said the council should consult with the business community and also consider some form of rate relief.He said the economic situation had been exacerbated by the pandemic and urged the public to adhere to Covid regulations.ldquoThe virus has no respect for age or gender.

Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.However, dual mandates will only be permissible until the next general election, which could be as far away as December .The details are still emerging and as I write this not confirmed, but it does seem to be a very clear effort to get the DUP out of a major bind.It shows a determination on the part of the government in London to maintain the devolved institutions in Northern Ireland, amid repeated warnings from the DUP that they will close this Stormont parliament and bring forward an electionthere is not sufficient progress on the reform of the NI Protocol .What is as yet unclear as of late on Friday is whether or not this is part of an agreement between the DUP and the Conservatives.For months journalists have been aware of suggestions that some sort of arrangement will be made to hep the DUP out of its ious crises.One huge problem for the party is, first, how to get Sir Jeffrey Donaldson elected to the Assembly and, second, how to hold on to Lagan Valley.The web version of this article will link to an article I wrote a few months ago about how one of the safest unionist seats in the country has suddenly become a constituency with a very split vote.The swing against the DUP in Lagan Valley in the  Westminster election was dramatic, and the biggest in Northern Ireland in percentage terms.It is likely, but by no means guaranteed, that the DUP would retain itSir Jeffrey got into Stormont and, due to the double jobbing rules, had to vacate his position as MP, leading to a by election.It is clear from last night’s announcement that Boris Johnson’s government does not want to see the DUP plunged into even deeper troubles.The DUP faces enough of a challenge in Lagan Valley in the coming assembly election.It once had four Stormont seats in the constituency and now only has two. It is very likely, but not even certain, that it will hold two, given the large number of well-known candidates now in Lagan Valley, and the sharp rise in the votes of most of the DUP’s rival parties.Yet it still seems possible, despite at times conflicting signals from the party, that Sir Jeffrey, Edwin Poots and Paul Givan will all be standing there.The BBC says that details of the plan to allow MPs such as Sir Jeffrey to hold on as MPs after entering the assembly were outlined in a letter from the government peer Lord Caine to fellow lords.Jonathan Caine is little known among the public but was a very influential Northern Ireland Office advisor.Critics of the NIO’s institutional weakness in the face of a partisan pro nationalist Irish Department of Foreign Affairs, of whom I have been one, were struck by Lord Caine’s recent appointment as a junior NIO minister.It seemed that for once London was putting in place a minister who had understanding of some of the cultural problems withing the NIO and perhaps a welcome retreat from the UK tendency to install NI ministers who are, at least in tone, neutral on the political ide here.The appointment of Conor Burns as a minister who openly expresses his unionism was similarly signicant.But some unionists will be alarmed by this new development on double jobbing.The TUV leader Jim Allister QC MLA said in a statement late last evening:“Tonight’s news that MPs will be permitted to contest the Assembly election while retaining their Westminster seats is a shameless fix. Is this the last throw of the dice, a desperate attempt by the DUP to reverse their nosee in the polls ”He added: “If so, I suspect they will be in for a rude awakening. Dual mandates were abolished for good reason. The public demanded a policy of one man   woman one job. They are unlikely to be impressed at this policy being reversed.“The only thing which has changed since the abolition of duel mandates is the desperation of the DUP. What price have they paid for this  Is this why they toned down their Protocol opposition ”This last point is the most important one. The DUP has got defensive recently when it has been criticised, above all by Mr Allister, for seeming in recent weeks to have tone down its rhetoric about the NI Protocol.Gregory Campbell wrote a long letter to this newspaper during the week, attacking the TUV leader for his persistent warnings about the DUP weakening its position.So has there been an understanding between the DUP and the Tories  Or is this a sweetener given to the unionist party without any assurance in .As it happens, I have for years argued that the double jobbing ban was doing nothing to help politics here. The ban on being a councillor and an MLA or MP is particularly stupid.I think you should be able to be a member of all three – council, Stormont and Westminster —voters vote for you but you should only then get one salary, whichever is the highest.However, this development,accurately reported, seems like a cynical way of amending a flawed policy.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

The film had its Irish premiere at the Waterfront Hall in November, but Northern Ireland movie fans have had to wait until this week to see the film set in s Belfast.Meanwhile, to tie in with the NI release of Belfast, BBC NI has announced a new programme profiling Sir Kenneth Branagh.It will include the only television interview filmed during histo the city of his birth last November for the red carpet premiere. The film, written and directed by Branagh sees himto his roots in the city of his early childhood. In ‘Branagh: Bringing Belfast Home’, he talks atto Kathy Clugston about his new film – what drove him to write it, working with the actors and even his refusal to water down the Belfast accent for international distribution. He also discusses his own childhood experiences of being caught up in rioting as both bystander and participant, his parents’ zest for le and how leaving the city left a deep mark on him. This is combined with footage from the film ‘Belfast’. The programme also features footage from red carpet events in both London and Belfast in which viewers will see the impact ‘Belfast’ is having on the film world. The -minute film also shows some of the many hours of BBC archive following Branagh’s rise to the very top of his field. Branagh: Bringing Belfast Home is on BBC One NI, on Tuesday, January  at .pm.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Either he takes a decision himself around his future or it’ll be the Conservative Party that will take that decision.“And this report, I think, is going to be very important, which Sue Gray is responsible for.“I think there is an imperative for that work to come to a conclusion so that we can all draw a line under this and ensure that the wider public health messaging is consistent, rather than being distracted by what’s going on at Downing Street.”Mr Givan added: “We know from what the Prime Minister has now admitted that there was an event of Downing Street which he has said sorry over.“He wishes and regrets what had happened and that should have been dferent to that.“Now, what we need to get is this investigation as soon as possible, I don’t think it’s helpful to have this investigation going on for a protracted period of time.“That should be done as quickly as we can and the Prime Minister has said that he takes responsibility and whenever that report is produced, then he’ll be tested on how is taking that responsibility.“But, as a party, what has happened we have said shouldn’t have happened, it has undermined the public health messages.“It’s right that the Prime Minister has said sorry for that.”While not naming her, Mr Givan aimed criticism at Sinn Fein deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill for her attendance at the mass funeral of republican Bobby Storey in Belfast in  at a time when strict limits on such events were in place.“I only wish in Northern Ireland other people that went to events, which was against the rules, had said sorry,” he said.“Indeed, some have said that they would never apologise for some of the things that they attended.“What I want to see is this report now published as soon as possible and then the Prime Minister will have to be tested on whether or not he’s going to take responsibility based upon the findings of that report.”North Antrim DUP MLA Mervyn Storey said that “those who make the rules should not only abide by them but should be seen to do so”.He added: “Whether Boris Johnson continues in office or resigns is a matter for him and Conservative MPs. We have seen closer to home how some of those involved in breaching Covid regulations simply brazened it out and made clear they would ‘never apologise’ for blatantly disregarding the regulations they helped design.”Secretary of State Brandon Lewis yesterday urged people to wait for the outcome of the Gray inquiry before making judgments on the Prime Minister’s future, adding that Mr Johnson believed he was within the rules.Cabinet ministers publicly defended Mr Johnson after his apology on Wednesday, but the late interventions of Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and Chancellor Rishi Sunak – both tipped as potential successors – did little to instil confidence in his future.The Prime Minister’s official spokesman insisted the Cabinet fully supported Mr Johnson. Asked about the delay in Ms Truss and Mr Sunak showing their support, the spokesman said: “What the Prime Minister wants and expects is the Cabinet to be focused on delivering on the public’s priorities.” But Mr Johnson faced open revolt from one wing of his party, as Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross urged him to quit, with almost all Tory MSPs supporting the call.Three other Tory MPs publicly said Mr Johnson should go – Sir Roger Gale, former minister Caroline Nokes and chairman of the Public Affairs Committee William Wragg.Boris JohnsonPaul GivanFirst MinisterPrime MinisterDowning Street  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularSpeedy response brings fire drama at Europa Hotel in Belfast city centre to a closeMichael D Higgins ‘caught out by a contradiction’ over which centenaries he wants to markUnionists should ‘recover’ St. Patrick’s Day says former PUP manWatchdog probing loyalist murders finds evidence of ‘collusive’ police actsVAT on fuel in Northern Ireland cannot be cut due to the NI ProtocolMost PopularBest dehumidiers UK: keep your home warm and dry through winter, humidity low in summer, and reduce energy billsBest gym shoes UK: workout trainers for CrossFit, weightlting and cardio, from Nike, On, Inov-, ReebokBuying a Nintendo Switch for your household  Our guide on how to choose between the original, Lite and OLEDCharlotte Tilbury Beautul Skin Foundation: we review the new product launch - which foundation suits you Dyson Airwrap: best alternative hair styling tools, and when will the Dyson Airwrap be back in stock                        This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-gsNilK sc-bXTejn cGeDpV iufVtK\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperCoronavirusMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

In the s she took a career break to run a pub four miles outside Newry on the Rathfriland Road with her husband, Co Down man Bill Conlon. Called The Cove, the premises is now a children’s daycare nursery.Yesterday Leontia and Seamus Duffy, who live close by, told the News Letter about their friendship with her in the s. “Sue was quiet, the loveliest girl ever,” Leontia said. Her husband added: “She was very mannerly, she spoke to everybody, she knew everybody’s name.”In , BBC Newsnight’s policy editor Chris Cook described Ms Gray as “the most powerful civil servant you’ve never heard of” and “also perhaps the most secretive you could ever hope to meet”.Almost four years ago her appointment as permanent secretary of Stormont’s Department of Finance drew attention. She applied for the role of head of the civil service in NI but later said she may have been rejected for the top job because it was thought she was “too much of a challenger”. She is now Boris Johnson’s principal adviser on the union.Members of the Government have urged Mr Johnson’s critics to wait for the findings of Ms Gray’s inquiry before passing judgment after Tory MPs began publicly calling for him to quit.The Times reported that the inquiry was expected to find no evidence of criminality but that the investigation could censure Mr Johnson for a lack of judgment and criticise the culture in Downing Street.A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

So it is an important element of our city le.”He added: “I know we have had some dficulties in the past with the Saint Patrick’s Day celebrations, but there is evidence that more groups are looking to become involved in this event.

It was a part of the annual events: the Rugby Schools Cup final was on Saint Patrick’s Day, some of the Irish regiments recognised it, indeed the Orange Order at one time recognised Saint Patrick’s Day.“So it is something I think we need to recover, and we need to encourage full participation in the Saint Patrick’s Day celebration. These developments in the council’s Cultural Strategy do provide for more outreach work, and for more development work. They provide for more longer term planning, and they will reap rich rewards, and create a truly inclusive celebration from which the city can benefit.”The council’s ten-year cultural strategy, “A City Imagining” outlines a new approach in delivering St. Patrick’s Day events from  onwards with a three-stage process being used to assess applications to deliver pilot projects this year.A council report recommends the commissioning of Beat Carnival and The Duncairn, to deliver pilot projects in March  with funding of £, and £, respectively.

There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Daisy Dog AcademyFriday, th January , : pm  \"       \"  Yvonne MyersDogs’ physiology is not that far removed from our own, their brains are very similar with the two obvious exceptions, we have a much larger frontal lobe area of the brain than dogs which is where we process logical thought and they have a much larger olfactory bulb,  times bigger in fact where they process scent. When our dogs get stressed like us their sympathetic nervous system kicks in and that activates what we call the four Fs, standing for fight, flight, fool around or faint. This is a stress reaction, not dissimilar to our own. We have all heard of the fight or flight response.When a dog is on lead and they have lost the option for flight, this can mean a dog starts displaying what appears to be aggressive behaviour which is in fact all based on fear and stress. They are trying to be big and scary to scare away whatever it is that is scaring them. When we continue to move our dog towards the scary thing, we can damage our dog’s confidence in us as being there for them. This fight response is really their only option as they have no way of escaping.When a dog has a ‘reaction’ to an off-lead dog approaching them and making them feel scared the stress hormone Cortisol is released into their bloodstream along with Adrenaline and noradrenaline, so a huge cocktail of chemicals is released! It can take up to eight hours for the Cortisol to leave the dogs blood stream. That means in one walka dog is made to feel unsafe by an off-lead dog three or four times that is a huge amount for the body to deal with and they will take a long time to recover, the whole day in fact.That can mean that taking the dog out again on the same day will only result in more stress and distress for your dog which is not beneficial to their mental or emotional state. This is very dficult as an owner as you only want to take your dog out and let them have some time out enjoying the environment. If you have a happy go lucky dog that is allowed off lead, that is fantastic for you but, allowing your off-lead dog to approach an on-lead dog that is frightened is not only irresponsible as a dog owner, but it is rude. I have been with clients with dogs on lead in a park and had off lead dogs approaching and, in some cases, harassing the on-lead dog. Their owner has no control over that dog, and they either have made no effort to call them back even when asked to or they have advised me that the dog has no recall. You do not have exclusive rights to spaces to walk your dog. All dogs have the right to have a peaceful and relaxing walk without being approached with unwanted attention. As an owner of a dog that is fearful, they are doing their best to give their dog the best le possible, they are minding their own business with their dog on lead. As a dog owner you have a responsibility under the Dangerous Dog Act to be always in control of your dog in a public space, that is the law. This meansyou are unable to recall your dog or stop your dog from approaching on lead dogs then you should not allow them off lead until you have trained a solid recall. With so many dogs that were bought during lock down we have more and more dogs that are concerned and have higher levels of stress through no fault of their own. They were brought into a world where their socialisation was massively limited, and this has caused them to be more fearful. These dogs need our support, help and understanding. If you areof a dog that is finding the world stressful, be your dogs voice! If your dog has had a stressful interaction do not continue your walk, instead take them home and use their brain through training and using their nose, this will help to calm them and lower their blood pressure and reduce their heart rate. Continuing the walk may be counterproductive for your dog and your emotional state.Do not suffer alone, seek help from a professionalneeded. There are many highly qualied dog trainers who can offer you support and fantastic advice to make your le and your dogs as stress free as possible, but ensure you check their credentials as the dog training world is not regulated and anyone can call themselves a trainer.
