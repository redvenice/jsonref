I cannot wrap my head around these accusations.\u0027Stranger Things actress Ryder was in a relationship with Depp during the early 1990s, and he famously tattooed \u0027Winona Forever\u0027 on his arm – before changing it to \u0027Wino Forever\u0027 following their split.What Depp is being questioned about at the High Court during the libel caseDepp has been questioned since Tuesday over 14 alleged domestic violence incidents, and his Hollywood lifestyle, past relationships with Ryder, Vanessa Paradis and Kate Moss, and his well-documented use of drink and drugs. The court has heard disputed accounts of a three-day trip to Australia, when Depp lost the top of his middle finger, and the so-called \u0027defecation incident\u0027 in which faeces were found in the couple\u0027s bed after Heard\u0027s 30th birthday.Depp finished giving evidence today after around 25 hours in the witness box at the Royal Courts of Justice in London. NGN\u0027s lawyers have said Depp first hit his ex-wife in early 2013 during a heated argument over a painting - which he allegedly tried to set alight - by Heard\u0027s ex Tasya van Ree and attacked her on a number of other occasions before the couple split in May 2016.The publisher claims Depp is a \u0027Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde\u0027 character who snapped when he was drunk and on drugs and turned into \u0027the Monster\u0027 - an \u0027alter ego\u0027 he assumed when he would \u0027lose control and become a violent thug\u0027.The Pirates Of The Caribbean star has admitted giving misleading evidence about his drink and drug use before a flight from Boston to LA in May 2014 and \u0027accidentally\u0027 headbutting Heard during a row at their home in December 2015, but says his ex-wife\u0027s allegations are \u0027complete lies\u0027 and that she was \u0027the abuser\u0027 in the relationship.He accuses Heard of severing the top of his middle finger with a vodka bottle in Australia in March 2015 and of \u0027building a dossier very early on\u0027 in their relationship to align herself with the #MeToo movement.The court also heard evidence last week on Friday afternoon from LAPD officer Melissa Saenz who attended the couple\u0027s penthouse after the actor allegedly hit Heard in the face with her own mobile phone in May 2016, who said she \u0027did not see any injuries\u0027 or damage to the apartment.Paradis, 47, and Ryder, 48, were originally due to give evidence this week, as was alleged Harvey Weinstein victim Katherine Kendall, 50, who accuses Mr Wootton of \u0027deliberately misusing\u0027 her quotes and \u0027using the #MeToo movement\u0027 to damage Depp.Heard\u0027s evidence was expected to begin on Friday morning - but it is not clear when the Aquaman actress will give evidence as Depp\u0027s cross-examination has taken almost two days longer than scheduled.The three-week trial, which is due to finish on July 27, will also hear evidence from current and former employees of Depp and Heard, as well as her sister and friends by video-link from LA.The actor is suing NGN and Mr Wootton over the publication of an article on April 27 2018 with the headline: \u0027Gone Potty: How can JK Rowling be \u0027genuinely happy\u0027 casting wife beater Johnny Depp in the new Fantastic Beasts film?\u0027NGN is defending the article as true, and says Depp was \u0027controlling and verbally and physically abusive towards Heard, particularly when he was under the influence of alcohol andor drugs\u0027."},{"url":null,"title":"Government announces major Huawei U turn bans firm UKs 5G network","story":"Share this article Tom Tugendhat, the Tory chairman of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee as well as the China Research Group (CRG) of Conservative MPs, tweeted that the Huawei decision was a \u0027major victory for Parliament\u0027.He wrote: \u0027Huawei\u0027s position in the UK\u0027s phone networks is now in reverse and our future prosperity will not be tied to a company linked to Chinese state.

Jenny Stallard speaks to salon owner Melissa Timperley and pub chain boss Helen Charlesworth to find out how they’re keeping staff and customers safeMelissa Timperley is used to the demands of her clients as a salon owner. As a “treat” destination, she knows that everything – from the friendly welcome and the gown she puts around a customer’s shoulders, to the chocolate with their coffee – makes a visit to her eponymous hair salon a luxurious experience.And that isn’t changing just because of lockdown rules – in salons, restaurants, bars and shops, owners want their customers to feel special as they reopen in the “new normal”.Based in Manchester, Timperley’s three-floor salon recently had a makeover of its own, becoming a place of tape measures and screens, with every area considered for adaptation, from the reception desk to the basins, as it prepared to reopen.“I think salon owners have two really important jobs,” says Timperley. “They have, first and foremost, to keep their staff healthy and happy, and then they’ve got the job of keeping every single client healthy and happy.”Her first step was to see what other countries had been doing, in advance of any UK guidance. “The whole of lockdown has been a rollercoaster of emotions for most people, you have great days and bad days, and things get overwhelming. We researched what a lot of other countries were doing before our guidelines even came out,” says Timperley.Then, when the UK government did announce its own rules, specifically for England, it was a case of acting swiftly and safely to make some key decisions that worked for customers and staff. As the online appointment book filled up, she worked hard to make the salon accessible while still keeping that luxury feel.For Timperley, that has meant installing hand sanitiser stations and ordering new gowns. There will be branded face masks for those who want to wear them, although customers are not obliged to since staff will wear visors.There’s a huge emphasis on loyalty in the industry, where customers have been patient while they wait for news of appointments, and salon owners like Timperley want to show that’s appreciated, while also making sure her staff feel safe, too.“You’ve got to show that you’re doing the best for everybody. That means buying the best equipment, not cutting any corners,” she says. “We’ve staggered the appointments, we’re opening longer hours and we’re even opening on a Sunday to be able to service all our regular clients who’ve waited for us.”When the UK government announced that non-essential businesses in England could reopen on 4 July, many people were more than ready for a hair appointment, which shows the impact of not having these services around.Different salons needed to adapt in different ways. At Melissa Timperley, there is no “sharing” of clients, but at other salons that’s often not the case. For example, you may have visited a hairdresser and had your hair washed by one assistant, your cut done by your stylist and then the blow dry by another. Timperley’s salon has always been one-on-one with customers, which helped post-lockdown planning, as that needed to become the norm for all salons, according to UK government guidance.It’s a familiar scenario not just in salons but in pubs and restaurants across the country – wanting customers to feel valued and welcomed and staff to feel safe and appreciated, too – all while sticking to the guidelines laid out by the UK government.For Helen Charlesworth, managing director of the Stonegate pub company – which owns the Slug and Lettuce chain, among others – opening up has also been a “one day at a time” process. For the duration of lockdown, each day was one where she and the team planned for a future where they could reopen.Helping staff feel connected was a priority, she says, and a lot of time also went into ensuring the chain had a robust “closedown” manual. “We’ve never in our time had to close down an entire pub chain before. So we learned quite a lot, and we felt it would be good to document our learnings and have a precise manual. I’m glad we did as we’ve had to activate that in Leicester,” she adds, referring to the city that became subject to the UK’s first local lockdown on 30 June.The company furloughed a lot of team members, and then faced the task of ensuring their mental and physical health was kept in good shape. “We communicated with our people every day throughout the lockdown process, then once they went on to furlough we’ve had a very robust communication programme led by our CEO Simon Longbottom. He’s done twice weekly calls with the teams, video calls, kept everyone abreast of what’s going on.“We’ve had various groups raising money for charity. Lots of teams of people within Stonegate who have felt looked after and felt part of the Stonegate family have been out there raising cash for employees and families affected by Covid-19, the NHS and charities,” explains Charlesworth.Stonegate has an intranet hub where it could upload everything from key messages to quizzes and games. “Hundreds of different articles and things you can do whilst you’re off and we kept that updated,” adds Charlesworth.Keeping in touch with staff, both Charlesworth and Timperley agree, was key during lockdown so they felt valued and knew what was happening with the business.And what about the rules when the doors do open? Your haircut or that fancy G\u0026ampT will now come with a side serving of screens and socially-distanced chairs.“Customers don’t have to book a slot, but we are taking bookings in all our pubs, just so that people have got somewhere to come in and sit down and it’s easier because then we’re capturing customer data at the booking point,” says Charlesworth.“If you come to the pub and you haven’t booked, you’ll have to scan a QR code and put your details on to a website and we have to keep those details for 21 days,” she says.“The wonderful thing about hospitality, it’s pretty much a vocation rather than a job for people and it’s their way of life, and their customers end up being their friends, so it is quite sad and difficult for them to be at home and not be part of that. When they have come back it’s like walking into the unknown.”Part of the reopening has been a video filmed in one of Stonegate’s Manchester venues, showing staff how things would look and operate. “What we’ve done is we’ve tried to take away any level of anxiety,” she explains.The distancing has depended on which areas they were dealing with, she adds.“Where it’s outside we’ve tried to stick to a 2-metre rule, whereas when it’s inside we’ve tried to use screens, PPE and back-to-back tables. We’ve tried to be a bit more strategic and play around with what the layout looks like. We’ve spoken to all our authorities and they seem pretty happy with what we’ve done.”Hair salons, restaurants and pubs may be something you take for granted. Well, took for granted. Now they’re reopening, operators such as Timperley and Charlesworth feel this is their chance to showcase their new, and often improved, offerings.Timperley says: “Everything that we’ve had to do differently, we’ve done better. For example, the disposable towels are the nicest I could get, and the gowns are scented with vanilla. We’ve tried to keep the luxury touches and as soon as we can introduce more back in, even if we can do a coffee in a disposable cup, that would make it feel nicer again. But I think people will just be so grateful to have their hair done, you know ... what I think has happened is people have tried cutting their hair at home and colouring their hair at home, and they realise how talented hairdressers are!“I think the biggest challenge has been remaining positive in lockdown when everything around you is negative. For me, keeping the staff upbeat and the clients informed. Everything has been extra work.”This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

On Friday, Boris Johnson wore a mask in public and discussed the possibility of them becoming compulsory, before Michael Gove denied this was the plan on Sunday.But 48 hours later Matt Hancock, the health and social care secretary, confirmed in a Commons statement that shoppers would be required to wear face coverings in England with legislation coming into force on Friday 24 July.Face coverings became a requirement on public transport in England on 15 June.Captioned “If you don’t mask - you don’t get”, the Banksy video is the first new post by the artist since early June when he responded to the statue of Edward Colston being removed and thrown into the harbour in his home town of Bristol.“What should we do with the empty plinth in the middle of Bristol?” he asked, before offering a solution. “We drag him out the water, put him back on the plinth, tie cable round his neck and commission some life size bronze statues of protesters in the act of pulling him down.

The correspondence – which proves the governor general of Australia flagged a “last resort” option to dismiss Whitlam with the Queen’s private secretary, Martin Charteris, and Charteris supported Kerr in his view that he could use his reserve powers – has renewed the debate over whether Australia should become a republic.Hocking is continuing to examine the letters, but has pointed to a handwritten note added as a postscript to a letter from Charteris to Kerr, dated 24 September 1975. Charteris wrote to Kerr about the political crisis gripping the Whitlam government, saying “the governor general of Australia does not seem to lie on a bed of roses”.“It is clear that you may be faced with some difficult constitutional decisions during the next month or so,” Charteris wrote. He added a handwritten note at the bottom of his letter, pointing out a book that postulates a governor general can dissolve parliament when supply is blocked.“I suppose you know Eugene Forsey’s book The Prerogative of the Dissolution?” he says. Charteris says Forsey’s book articulates the idea that “if supply is refused this always makes it constitutionally proper to grant a dissolution”.As well as revealing the exhaustive conversations between Charteris and Kerr during the lead-up to the dismissal, the letters suggest the palace was nervous about the prospect of Kerr writing about the events of 1975. In January 1977, Kerr wrote to Charteris advising him that he’d been writing and had received “offers from publishing companies to publish my ‘memoirs’ or ‘autobiography’”.He said he was aware he couldn’t write about his time as governor general but may be able to write about his earlier life. “I shall not make any decision about any of this until I have a chance to speak to you when you are in Australia,” Kerr wrote.The reply from the palace left little room for ambiguity about its view of Kerr recounting of events from his time in office. “We will discuss the matter further when we meet in Australia. In the meanwhile I think all that I can usefully say is the obvious: that it would be clearly improper for you to publish anything about events which have taken place during your term of office whilst you remain governor general,” he said.“I can visualize commentators avidly going back to your childhood and school days for ‘leads’!”The attorney general said on Wednesday he was yet to read all the documents, but he said the letters did not support “a theory that somehow the Queen and the palace “gave a royal green light” to the use of the reserve powers. “I certainly don’t think that they show that.”He said advocates for a republic in Australia had “tried fruitlessly to argue for a better system than the one we’ve got for 40-plus years without much success, so whether or not they want to be devoting their energies to that or more important matters is a matter for them”.“I think our system works remarkably well, probably the best working system in the world,” Porter said. “The idea that when we’ve got actual problems around employment, around dealing with the health crisis that we’re in, ensuring that our economy can grow its way out of the most tumultuous period in at least 100 years – the idea that we would even entertain spending oxygen on a debate about a republic, to me, seems bizarre.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/65a6b48adbe24dbf6df921f6c85642709b560834/0_676_2546_1528/master/2546.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f6a1750d191c46c7d2639fa96f63e7cf","title":"british airways to sell art collection to ease covid 19 pressures","story":"Multimillion-pound collection features work by Bridget Riley, Damien Hirst and Marc QuinnBritish Airways is selling its multimillion-pound art collection, including work by Bridget Riley and Damien Hirst, as it attempts to raise funds while the Covid-19 crisis continues to devastate the aviation sector.The Sotheby’s sale will include several artworks that could fetch six-figure sums and have previously decorated BA’s executive lounges and company headquarters.Riley’s Cool Edge, which featured in her Hayward Gallery retrospective last year and has an estimate worth of up to £1.2m, is the standout piece from the BA collection that will be auctioned at the Rembrandt to Richter evening event on 28 July. Another online sale is taking place in July.The auction is likely to only scratch the surface of BA’s losses during the coronavirus crisis after the carrier grounded most of its fleet in late March, with most routes only restarting later this month. BA’s parent company, IAG, has said its airlines were burning through cash at a rate of £27m a day.The sale will help the airline demonstrate its commitment to making any savings possible before shedding staff.BA told unions in April that it was planning to make up to 12,000 redundancies, and reduce the pay, terms and conditions of thousands more long-serving pilots and crew. Unions and MPs have accused the airline of taking advantage of the pandemic to slash staff costs.Carolina Martinoli, British Airways’ director of brand and customer experience, said: “We are fortunate to have been able to showcase a wealth of artists and creativity through our artwork collection, many of which have been a special part of the design of our lounges worldwide.“During this unprecedented time we have made the decision to work with Sotheby’s, one of the world’s leading and most trusted auction houses, to sell a number of pieces by artists including Bridget Riley and Damien Hirst.”Oliver Barker, Sotheby’s chairman for Europe, said the collection features “the best of British art”, from British modernists to the Young British Artists of the 90s.BA’s art collection of about 1,500 pieces, with a focus on British artists, has been displayed in its Waterside HQ and its executive lounges. The custom for its airport lounges is in particular doubt, with a large downturn in business flying expected even once travel restrictions are lifted.Seven other Riley prints are included in the two sales as well as others by Marc Quinn and Julian Opie, while Peter Doig’s Grasshopper portfolio is also featured, as are paintings by Terry Frost and Patrick Heron."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21e120ed9ba9bd105b66b43d57058d864dc07c97/0_27_5250_3150/master/5250.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8cc32269fb3ae6caf64e5453010f7259","title":"obr publish three covid 19 forecasts for the uk economy","story":"Worst-case scenario warns output may not rise to pre-pandemic levels until 2024 The Office for Budget Responsibility, the Treasury’s official forecaster, has published three possible scenarios for the UK economy as it tries to recover from the coronavirus pandemic:Activity rebounds relatively quickly, similar to the OBR’s central scenario published in April during the early stages of the Covid-19 emergency.

This should maintain a downward pressure on inflation, which could fall further, especially if there is a spike in unemployment later this year.”Inflation has been driven down during the Covid-19 crisis by a falling global oil price and fading demand for goods and services as businesses temporarily ceased trading and furloughed millions of workers. Although the oil price has risen again in recent months and shops, restaurants and pubs have begun to reopen, a sharp rise in the cost of living is not expected.Paul Dales, the chief UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said: “We suspect that after the initial release of pent-up demand once non-essential retailers opened in mid-June, retailers will have to use heavier discounts to get people through the doors.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5910dd9f0183a3adc6dff0d4fc715efa4f67b783/280_0_2674_1605/master/2674.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=8c4a3f40fc713ccb78250cf82f475093","title":"uk inflation computer games clothing stock markets ftse business live","story":"Rolling coverage of the latest economic and financial newsAlthough inflation picked up in June, it’s still close to its lowest level in four years.The Financial Times suspects weak consumer demand will pull prices down again:Rising prices for clothes, footwear and in recreational and culture activities such as computer games drove up the rate of inflation, but it was offset by falling costs of food, hotels and restaurants.The nationwide shutdown imposed to prevent the spread of coronavirus has sent inflation plummeting, from 1.5 per cent in March to 0.8 per cent in April. The Bank of England’s target is 2 per cent.With wage growth forecast to remain low in a slowly reopening economy, and many businesses dropping prices to attract customers, economists have forecast that inflation is likely to slow further. Some have predicted a near-zero rate in the coming months. Ed Monk, associate director for Personal Investing at Fidelity International, explains how computer games prices nudged inflation up last month:UK fuel costs also remained low last month... although millions of people under lockdown won’t have really benefited.Average petrol prices stood at 106.5 pence per litre in June 2020, slightly higher than May’s four-year low. Average diesel prices were 112.7 pence per litre in June, the lowest since August 2016, the Office for National Statistics reports. That reflects weak demand from drivers, as well as the tumble in crude oil costs since the pandemic floored the global economy.Despite the pick-up in consumer prices in June, City economists don’t expect inflation to keep rising.Paul Dales of Capital Economics predicts that inflation could fall below zero this summer, as retailers try to lure anxious consumers to spend.Samuel Tombs of Pantheon Economics also predicts CPI will fall back:Muted inflation paves the way for further action from the Bank of England as economic activity remains anaemic This chart shows which items pushed the UK inflation rate up last month (mainly clothes and games) and which pulled it down (mainly food).Deliciously, that includes expensive crisps - meaning gamers can offset rising console prices by tucking in.The effect comprised small movements from a variety of product groups, with the largest (of 0.03 percentage points) coming from vegetables. The largest inidual downward contribution in this category came from premium potato crisps, reversing the upward contribution observed between April and May.Restaurant and hotel prices also fell -- which the ONS partly attributes to “muffins and inidual cakes”.Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician at the ONS, explains why UK inflation inched up last month:The inflation rate has increased for the first time this year, but remains low by historical standards“Due to the impact of the coronavirus, clothing prices have not followed the usual seasonal pattern this year, with the normal falls due to the start of the summer sales failing to materialise.“Prices for computer games and consoles have risen, but food prices, particularly vegetables, have fallen.” Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.Inflation across the UK has risen for the first time since the Covid-19 pandemic began, as the lockdown pushed up the cost of computer games and forced clothes retailers to delay the usual summer sales season.This shows the impact of the coronavirus lockdown on the UK economy. In normal times, clothing retailers would have been holding summer sales in June - rather than gingerly reopening.Price movements this year have not followed the normal seasonal pattern. In recent years, prices have generally risen between January and May before the summer sales season starts in JuneAnd on computer games, the ONS suspects that prices may have risen as people scrambled to find entertainment during the lockdown: It is possible that prices have been influenced by the coronavirus (COVID-19) lockdown changing the timing of demand and the availability of some items, particularly consoles. However, it is equally likely to be a result of the computer games in the bestseller charts.Price movements for computer games can often be relatively large depending on the composition of these charts.More details and reaction to follow....One of the Bank of England’s external members, professor Silvana Tenreyro, is speaking about the impact of Covid-19 on the UK economy this morning (as it suffers its worst slump in centuries)European stock markets are set for a strong session, on hopes that the coronavirus crisis will ease.Last night, US biotech firm Moderna reported that its potential Covid-19 vaccine had produced immune responses in patients in the early stage trial.New manufacturing output data and oil inventory figures from the US will show how its economy is faring.Luxury goods maker Burberry, online fashion site ASOS and electricals retailer Dixons Carphone are all reporting results (more on that shortly too)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eee9d8711457c446431b70a9d6ef3edbe0a93d74/309_476_4194_2518/master/4194.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=74994c220bba385a6c7afd42ea488152","title":"bella hadid deleted instagram post palestinians silenced","story":"The model posted a picture of her father’s passport only for it to be removed. Sometimes asserting your humanity as a Palestinian is portrayed as an act of aggressionIs the word “Palestine” hate speech? Instagram seems to think it may be. The social media platform recently removed a post by the model Bella Hadid celebrating her Palestinian heritage. According to Hadid, Instagram deleted a photo she’d shared of her dad’s US passport, which listed his birthplace as Palestine Instagram said it violated “community guidelines on harassment or bullying” and noted the platform doesn’t allow “hate speech”.“Are we not allowed to be Palestinian on Instagram?” Hadid demanded. “This, to me, is bullying. You can’t erase history by silencing people.”According to Facebook, which owns Instagram, the post’s removal had nothing to do with Palestine – rather, the platform doesn’t allow people to put personal information online. (That way, anyone could take your data, not just Facebook!) However, as the passport number was blurred out, Instagram acknowledged the post was mistakenly deleted. While this explanation makes sense, its policies don’t seem to be evenly applied. A quick search for #passports pulls up multiple posts that should, according to the guidelines, have been removed – including a page shamelessly selling counterfeit driving licences and ID cards.I have no idea whether Instagram censored Hadid for being Palestinian, but I can tell you that being Palestinian means having your identity marked as “hate speech” and erased every day, online and off. Like Hadid, I’m half-Palestinian and I’ve lost count of how many times people have informed me Palestinians don’t exist. Simply asserting your humanity as a Palestinian is often twisted and portrayed as an act of aggression – just look at the outraged reaction last year at calls to boycott Eurovision, which was hosted by Israel. In the US, rightwing activists have tried to push laws on public university campuses that would suppress any criticism of Israel some states have tried to prohibit the boycotting of Israel as a condition of public employment. Personally, I’ve found that talking about Palestine can be so fraught and exhausting that sometimes I just end up self-censoring erasing my own history by silencing myself.

It stinks worse than any of the other carrion this government has buried. Every day for the past fortnight, I’ve been asking myself why this scandal isn’t all over the front pages. Under cover of the pandemic, the government has awarded contracts worth billions of pounds for equipment on which our lives depend, without competition or transparency. It has trampled on its own rules, operated secretly and made incomprehensible and – in some cases – highly questionable decisions.Let’s begin with the latest case, unearthed by investigative journalists at the  and openDemocracy. It involves a contract to test the effectiveness of the government’s coronavirus messaging, worth £840,000. It was issued by the Cabinet Office, which is run by Michael Gove. The deal appears to have been struck on 3 March, but the only written record in the public domain is a letter dated 5 June, retrospectively offering the contract that had already been granted. There was no advertisement for the work, and no competition. No official notice of the award has yet been published. The deal appears to have been done with a handshake and a slap on the back.But we do know who the contract went to. It’s a company called Public First, owned by a married couple, James Frayne and Rachel Wolf. Since 2000, Frayne has worked on political campaigns with Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson’s chief adviser. When Gove was education secretary, he brought both Cummings and Frayne into his department. Cummings was Gove’s chief political adviser, while Frayne was his director of communications. At roughly the same time, in 2010, Gove’s department awarded Wolf a £500,000 contract to promote his “free schools” obsession. Guess what? That didn’t go to competitive tender, either. Wolf co-wrote the Conservative party’s election manifesto in 2019.In response to these latest revelations, the government claims it had to override the usual rules for public procurement because it was responding to an emergency. There are several problems with this claim. The first is that six weeks elapsed between the government’s first recognition that coronavirus presented a potentially serious public health risk and striking the deal with Public First. The second is that, of the four contracted services later listed on the government’s website, two were not for testing the government’s coronavirus messaging at all, but for “EU exit comms”: in other words, Brexit. The coronavirus work, according to this list, did not begin until 27 May. The Cabinet Office now claims that when it said “EU exit”, it meant coronavirus. This seems an odd mistake to make.The third problem is that the government’s communications on the pandemic have been disastrous. Did it choose to ignore Public First’s “emergency” work, or was it of little value?On Friday, the Good Law Project (GLP) issued proceedings in the high court against Gove, alleging breaches of procurement law and apparent bias in the granting of the contract to his longstanding associates. It is crowdfunding the challenge.If the government had to provide the money upfront, why didn’t it order the gowns itself? And why, of all possible outsourcers, did it choose PestFix? In the two weeks before it awarded this contract, it was approached by 16,000 companies offering to supply personal protective equipment (PPE). Some of them had a long track record in manufacturing or supplying PPE, and had stocks that could be deployed immediately.Again, the government relies on the emergency defence to justify its decision. But it issued its initial guidance on preventing infection among health and care workers on 10 January. On 14 February, it published specific guidance on the use of PPE. So why did it wait until 13 April to strike its “emergency” deal with PestFix? Moreover, it appears to have set the company no deadline for the delivery of the gowns. Astonishingly, even today only half of them appear to have reached the UK, and all those are still sitting in a warehouse in Daventry. On the government’s own admission, “none of the isolation suits delivered so far has been supplied into the NHS”. So much for taking urgent action in response to the emergency.Again, the contract is surrounded by secrecy. Crucial sections, such as the price paid for the gowns, have been redacted. Bizarrely, the award notice initially stated that the contract was worth £108m. But in responding to the lawsuit, the government now says the real value is £32m. Apparently, it struck “further contracts” with PestFix for other items of equipment. It has so far failed to reveal what these might be, or to publish the contracts. It is worth remembering that while all this was happening, frontline health and care workers were dying as a result of inadequate supplies of PPE.There are plenty of other cases: such as the employment agency with net assets of £623 that was awarded an £18m government contract to supply face masks the confectionery wholesaler that according to the GLP was given a £100m contract to supply PPE and the £250m channelled through a “family office” registered in Mauritius, specialising in currency trading, offshore property and private equity, also to supply protective medical equipment. Altogether, billions of pounds’ worth of contracts appear to have been granted, often to surprising companies, without competition. I think we may reasonably ask what the hell is going on.This is not just about value for money, important as that is. Transparent, competitive tendering is a crucial defence against cronyism and corruption. It is essential to integrity in public life and public trust in politics. But the government doesn’t seem to care. As the scandal over Cummings’ trip to Durham shows, its strategy is to brazen out disgrace until public outrage subsides. We know it cheats and lies. It knows that we know, and it doesn’t care.But these things matter. People die when the government gets them wrong. Our challenge is to discover how to make them count."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/949964b4e9762052520b4eecad07ccd466a35357/0_202_4719_2831/master/4719.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1ac2ee3924af905d35e40c0667a9e412","title":"face masks england second wave leaders","story":"Wearing face coverings protects us, protects others – and could help prevent a second wave. Yet our leaders have dithered againAfter going around in circles about the merits of face coverings for months, England has made them mandatory in shops from 24 July. Just like the delays and endless commentary in March and April about whether testing, tracing and isolating is important during a pandemic, whether travel restrictions can help prevent the importation of Covid-19 cases and whether lockdowns are necessary, the media and government have spent months prevaricating about face coverings before finally accepting that England has little choice but to follow others’ lead.The UK government has learned a painful lesson during the coronavirus pandemic: the most difficult thing about controlling outbreaks isn’t knowing what to do, but actually doing it. Take testing, for example. Already by early March the World Health Organization had made it clear that testing, tracing and isolating carriers of the virus was the best way to control outbreaks. In the words of its director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus: “We have a simple message for all countries: test, test, test.” Yet it took England until the end of April to deliver on its testing target. Even now, we don’t know the true number of people who have been tested – as the government has stopped making this information publicly available.Controlling outbreaks requires clear leadership that sets out a coherent strategy and compels advisers to shift from conversations about “what needs to be done” to “how best to achieve it”. By the time many other European countries had made face coverings compulsory, UK cabinet ministers seemed incapable of forming a consensus on the right response. On Friday, Boris Johnson hinted that a change in advice on face masks was coming – but Michael Gove then told Andrew Marr that wearing masks should be a matter of “basic good manners”.What observational studies such as these have made clear is that face coverings play an important role in protecting the wearer from infection, and preventing an infected wearer, if wearing a mask, from transmitting the virus. No one wants to see cases rise, or to have a second lockdown. The clear message should be: I wear a mask to protect you, and you wear a mask to protect me. The director general of the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention said the biggest mistake made in Europe and the US was that people didn’t wear masks from the start.Making face coverings mandatory, rather than voluntary, is about reaching a “tipping point” where the majority of people start to comply with this guidance. If one person is wearing a mask in a shop and nobody else is, that one person feels out of place. The social norm then becomes not to wear a mask. But if the same person walks into a shop and everyone else is wearing a mask, they will feel awkward and uncomfortable not having one. Of course, some iniduals, such as those who have breathing difficulties, won’t find it easy to wear a mask. We shouldn’t be shaming people for not wearing masks, as we don’t know the full circumstances.As lockdown measures are eased, a careful balance must be maintained between reducing transmission of Covid-19 and supporting businesses and the economy by shopping, moving around cities on public transport, and getting back to daily life as much as possible. This virus spreads through droplets escaping from noses and mouths from speaking, coughing, sneezing and loud breathing. And these droplets can even become airborne, as the WHO has recently acknowledged. Masks can therefore play an important role in stopping droplets from infectious iniduals reaching other people. According to scientific studies, outdoor transmission seems minimal. The real challenge is to stop transmission within indoor settings, where iniduals are in close contact with limited ventilation for a prolonged period of time, such as in shops, pubs and restaurants. Compounding this challenge is the role that presymptomatic and asymptomatic transmission – where an infected person spreads the virus before they develop symptoms themselves, or where they never develop symptoms – can play in spreading the disease. Relying only on those with symptoms of coronavirus to self-isolate is not enough to stop transmission given the role that these silent carriers play in its spread.When the Scottish government made face coverings mandatory in shops from 10 July, the general reaction from the public was one of acceptance and relief – especially from people who work in shops and those who are anxious about becoming infected. Wearing a face covering while indoors, particularly when distancing may be difficult, seemed a small price to pay to avoid a second wave of coronavirus cases and reverse the progress made to contain the virus. Other countries, particularly some in Asia, will have been puzzled by why England took so long to make such a simple, low-cost decision.• Prof Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03fd9f4d55e1f368fcc6bcde47d5ba4c6e2d84e1/0_149_4000_2402/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=79a5e51305b1156e7ffac75f8cec7ce7","title":"big three london museums to reopen in august","story":"People will have to book to visit V\u0026ampA, Science Museum and Natural History MuseumThe three museums, all neighbours in South Kensington, will reopen on different days in August to avoid pressure on public transport. Visitors will have to book time slots.Sir Michael Dixon, the director of the Natural History Museum, said he expected visitor numbers would be limited to 2,800 a day, about a fifth of the usual average attendance.“This is a fantastic opportunity to experience all three of our museums without crowds,” he said at a joint announcement of the reopenings on Tuesday.Face coverings would be “strongly recommended” but not yet mandatory, the museums said.The V\u0026ampA was setting up recommended routes and trails but visitors would still be able to freely explore whichever part of the museum was open, its director, Tristram Hunt, said.“The ability to linger on something that catches your eye and not be forced in a certain direction” was important, he said.The Natural History Museum will reopen first on 5 August and be open Wednesday-Sunday, 11am-6pm the V\u0026ampA on 6 August, initially Thursday-Sunday, 11am-3pm the Science Museum on 19 August, seven days a week, 10am-6pm. The Science Museum group’s first reopening will be at Locomotion in Shildon on 28 July.It costs the museums far more to reopen than to stay closed but Sir Ian Blatchford, the director of the Science Museum, said the government’s recently announced £1.57bn emergency arts and heritage package would allow them to get through the current financial year.He said the settlement was, “let’s give them credit, resoundingly good. It is the kind of thing you’d expect the German or the French government to spend, we were very impressed that they listened.”Blatchford said he did not expect the nation’s museums to return to normal until the spring of 2022, and the only way to get there was to be open for visitors.Imposing admissions charges at national museums could help cover costs but Blatchford said that would be “the worst possible policy”.“There is no support for entrance fees from any major political party. As far as I’m concerned, that debate is dead, buried and covered in concrete. If the government introduced it, I would resign.”The plans were announced as figures were released showing the popularity of UK museums and galleries.The most visited attractions outside London were in Scotland, with the National Museum of Scotland in 12th place and Edinburgh Castle 13th.Chester zoo was the most visited attraction in England outside of London, in 14th place, and Stonehenge was the the most visited heritage site in England outside London, at 20th.Bernard Donoghue, the director of ALVA, said the figures had been due out months ago. “To be honest it has never felt like the right time to publish them because last year was so successful and so positive for UK visitor attractions … it never felt like the right day to release that enthusiasm.”He said factors contributing to the increases included strong and creative temporary exhibitions an increase in staycations, possibly because of Brexit and a rise in the number of foreign tourists.He acknowledged next year’s figures would be very different. “They will be extraordinary. But what you see here is how loved and important visitor attractions are to us Brits and how much we want to support them at times of adversity.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c69c2fd623f4e1feec37ca23ad4607b7fcbdd2e/0_217_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=06b833b9241f285ae3efc4f2a712e92e","title":"governments put green recovery on the backburner","story":"G20 countries aim their pandemic bailout spending at fossil fuel industries, leaving Paris climate change targets in doubtGovernments are spending vastly more in support of fossil fuels than on low-carbon energy in rescue packages triggered by the coronavirus crisis, new data has shown, despite rhetoric from many countries in support of a “green recovery”.Data from the Energy Policy Tracker, a new research effort by several civil society groups, shows that at least $151bn (£120bn) of bailout cash has been spent or earmarked so far to support fossil fuels by the G20 group of large economies. Only about a fifth of this spending is conditional on environmental requirements such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions or cleaning up pollution.The G20 countries are directing about $89bn (£71bn) in stimulus spending to clean energy, despite most of those governments being publicly committed to the Paris agreement on climate change.In the US alone, at least $58bn (£46bn) of stimulus spending is going to the fossil fuel industry, equivalent to about $177 (£141) per capita. Clean energy spending stands at less than half that amount, about $25bn (£20bn) or $76.50 (£61) per capita.The findings come ahead of a vital meeting of G20 finance ministers this weekend when countries are likely to discuss how to alleviate the global recession resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic.Some of the spending on fossil fuels is likely to be designed to quickly stabilise hard-hit industries, preserving jobs and preventing a worse recession. For instance, the figures include spending on airlines that have had fleets grounded or their flights drastically curtailed, and the plummeting oil price has threatened millions of jobs.However, green campaigners are concerned that so much of the money is flowing to companies with no conditions to force them to take even basic measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or other pollution. Some countries have attached “green strings” to their bailout packages, including France and Austria on airlines. Canada has required some of its fossil fuel companies to clean up oil pollution or reduce leaks of methane as a condition of receiving bailout funds.Economists and energy experts have already shown that green spending can jobs and a higher return on investment in the short and longer term. Fatih Birol, the executive director of the International Energy Agency, warned that the world had only six months to put the policies in place to prevent a rebound in emissions that could put the Paris targets permanently out of reach.The EU has resolved to push ahead with its EU green deal that would cut emissions, but aspects of its recovery package are mired in difficulty. France is devoting an estimated £13bn to a green recovery, and Germany more than £35bn. The UK government unveiled a package of £3bn last week to be spent on improving the energy efficiency of buildings, and campaigners are hoping for more to come.As the data studied by Energy Policy Tracker is focused on the energy sector, the figures may not capture all of governments’ green spending. For instance, governments have been urged to spend on many “shovel-ready” non-energy issues, such as cycle lanes, tree-planting, nature restoration, flood resilience and enhanced broadband networks to help people work at home, all of which will also contribute to a green recovery.Gerasimchuk said: “We have some anecdotal evidence on these sectors which suggests that total green recovery numbers can be higher. Similarly, global environmentally harmful recovery numbers can be higher as there are measures leading to deforestation, land degradation, overfishing, etc. A lot of government support policies remain unquantified.”While spending so far has failed to match the green promises to “build back better” that many governments have made, campaigners are hoping that the rush to shore up stricken fossil fuel companies will fade and be replaced by low-carbon plans as governments consider their next steps.Elisa Arond, research fellow at Stockholm Environment Institute, said: “Today, governments are doubling down on fossil fuels as they grapple with the pandemic and plans their recoveries, but there is still time to build back better.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a841dd93d23e44d05da1695522900230093099e/0_95_1616_970/master/1616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8d76fb784b873c6a92f7be1165af1934","title":"uk government planning new green investment bank","story":"Move to help finance climate ambitions follows calls from campaigners and economists The UK government is poised to reveal plans for a new state-backed green bank to help finance Britain’s climate ambitions, three years after ministers agreed to sell the UK’s Green Investment Bank.Kwasi Kwarteng, the energy minister, said that he expects the government to set out how it plans to create a successor to the Green Investment Bank “in the not-too-distant future”.The move to rebuild a new green lender comes amid growing calls from climate campaigners, economists and academics to invest in green infrastructure to help revive the UK’s struggling economy and help meet its climate targets.The government sold the UK’s original Green Investment Bank to Australian bank Macquarie in 2017, only five years after it was formed, in a controversial deal dubbed “deeply regrettable” and “politically dubious” by critics of the sale.At a digital event hosted by climate campaign group UK100 on Monday, the minister said it is “no secret” that there is “an ongoing debate within government about how we can in effect create the Green Investment Bank 2.0”.“I fully expect there may well be announcements in that regard in the not-too-distant future,” Kwarteng added.The minister said that the UK’s commitment to build a “net zero carbon” economy within 30 years, and the “huge amount of investment” needed to reach this goal, “suggests that there may well be scope” for a new green development bank.He added that his personal view favoured a bank that focuses on the consumer and suggested that a bank similar to Germany’s state-owned development bank KfW, which was set up in the wake of the second world war to invest in infrastructure, could facilitate this.Polly Billington, the director of UK100, said business and banks should take on a much bigger role in “building back better”.“Green investment will create thousands of jobs, tackle climate change and secure the recovery. Our research with Siemens found that investing £5bn in renewable energy could unlock £100bn of private capital. We look forward to working with the government to make this happen,” she said.Researchers at the Grantham Institute, part of the London School of Economics (LSE), have called for ministers to plough £20bn in paid cash towards a new national investment bank to establish a pipeline of clean infrastructure projects including carbon capture and hydrogen.The new report, commissioned by the Aldersgate Group, proposed the state-backed bank alongside a string of near-term public investments and long-term, low-carbon strategies.The recommendations include funding for energy efficiency upgrades, tree planting and wetland restoration to boost Britain’s green recovery and help create new jobs and training opportunities.The report’s four-prong approach also set out a “low carbon skills” strategy to level-up workers who might be left underemployed or unemployed following the pandemic, and a long-term framework for low-carbon investment using a rising carbon market price to incentivise private investments.Dimitri Zenghelis, a senior visiting fellow at the LSE and the co-author of the report, said: “The government has made a good start with the summer statement and early stimulus measures will help shore up a more resilient economy over the next two years. But the government must now turn its rhetoric on green recovery into predictable and credible commitments to build a sustainable economy over next decade and beyond.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/954933f65e4d3122c4fc967de0f942ce7a89f701/0_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2cfff7c1399cb883385118cb2b85a67a","title":"what tattoo are you planning on getting post lockdown","story":"We would like to hear from people who are looking at getting a new tattoo and the reasons behind itWith tattoo parlours in England able to reopen from 13 July we would like to know what tattoos people will be getting post-lockdown.What design are you getting and why?

She managed to elegantly balance an artfully made short film (models doing finger-clicking interpretive dancing, around a Twin Peaks-ish stage curtain) with a good showcase of the collection.Helpfully, the films did not distract from the clothes. For the menswear, Prada kept to last season’s utilitarian vibes: trousers cut with straight precision, paper-crisp white shirts, ties that erred on the side of skinny and sylph-like crossbody bags.The men’s collection had an almost eerie feeling: occasionally recalling the exactness of the costumes in the 1997 dystopic sci-fi film Gattaca. The womenswear was noticeably freer: dresses cut in tiered and bubble shapes, coats with bat sleeves and peaked Mary Jane shoes.In an age of fashion austerity, with its focus on the minimal and functional, it felt perfectly judged.Miuccia Prada herself appeared briefly at the end of Terence Nance’s closing film, a blink-and-you’ll-miss-her glimpse through a doorway. As a swansong to this era of Prada it was gentle, subtle and sort of perfect.But it wasn’t as if this “digital era” hasn’t provided any highlights. Kim Jones’s collaboration with Ghanaian artist Amoako Boafo for Dior was an authentic celebration of Black Lives Matter, Casablanca oozed with summery fun, Viktor and Rolf’s couture show – heavy with witty postmodernism – played like a Fast Show sketch, while Jonathan Anderon’s show-in-a-box for Loewe was predictably brilliant and inventive. And of course Prada. But too many played like trailers to the main event. Which they sort of were.A sense of lack pervaded the proceedings: a lack of curation within the medium, a lack of nervous energy that propels that “anything could happen” energy in the live show and a lack of actually being able to see the clothes. Obscuring the collections behind obtuse and artful intent felt more like you were watching a confusing Tumblr page of an overzealous art student.But there’s light at the end of the tunnel: Milan fashion week returns to physical shows on Wednesday with Dolce and Gabbana (live models! Real clothes! Problematic references!) and London fashion week has announced physical shows will begin again in September."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ffe112c644731cee8dee9bf00dc22acaec63b5d/0_185_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8c0c7ebad536babbd61fd1417844d151","title":"the meaning of pampering in a post lockdown world","story":"As we ease back into normal life salon treatments are comforting – but there’s a chance they will never feel the same againI was so keen for my post-lockdown trim last Saturday that I arrived at George Northwood’s salon just off London’s Oxford Street 20 minutes early. At the check-in point, instead of offering me a coffee, they took my temperature. I felt a brief jolt of greedy disappointment, because in the old days you used to get a tiny bar of chocolate with your coffee. But I was still so happy to be there that I made a terrible joke about being cool enough to come in, which the receptionist kindly pretended to laugh at from behind his visor.I hate the word “pampering”, with its frilly talcum-powder overtones. (“Grooming” is even worse. What is this, Crufts?) And yet I was thrilled when I put that hair appointment in my still-barren diary. And while I’m typing this article with overgrown cuticles, that is only because my local beauty salon is fully booked for manicures and pedicures till later this week. The reopening of hairdressers and beauty salons has been a landmark moment, not just for a workforce estimated between 150,000 and 200,000 people, but for many, like me, who have rejoiced in the novelty of being back in the treatment chair, despite being under no illusions about the true relative importance of the perfect post-salon hair or shiny new nails.Elliot, my stylist at George Northwood, told me while he chopped away that getting back to work had felt “like a real honour. So many clients have said to me that their first time back in the salon has been the moment when it felt like they were getting a little bit of their old life back.” Despite the plastic screens and the disposable gowns, the mood in the salon was cheery and oddly comforting. The polite ritual checking of water temperature, just in case madam is in a particularly fussy mood. The staccato blast of hairspray that signals the end of a session.And yet for all the current enthusiasm, the beauty industry may never return to anything like the old normal. The extended lockdown forced many who were in the habit of outsourcing beauty treatments to hone DIY skills. I have learned from bitter experience that home hair colouring ends in tears. (One word: khaki.) Therefore, I had no choice but to live with mouse roots and blond split ends through May and June. But I dabbled in seven-day foot peel socks. (Too revolting to discuss in public, DM me for details.) And in despair at eyebrow threading treatments still being off limits – a harsh and seemingly sexist line having been drawn which disallows a treatment where both parties can wear a mask, but permits beard trims, for which the client cannot – I have just ordered an eyebrow epilator.Many beauty treatments – manicures, spray tans, blow-dries – are about painting on a topcoat of polish with which to face the world. They are armour for life in meatspace. But with life having contracted to the size of a bubble, perhaps that armour is no longer necessary. Many people are still working from home, cooking instead of eating out. There are no parties, except on Zoom, and there’s a beauty filter for that. Many people who used to see themselves as outward-facing, economically-engaged citizens now feel more domestic instead. (If your pre-pandemic takeout coffee expenditure strikes you as a financial lunacy you are determined not to slide back into, then I’m talking about you.) Now that our colleagues have been behind the scenes of our lives as we Zoom from the kitchen table, is there any need to get back into stage makeup, even when we are back at our desks?But beauty means so much more than makeup and manicures. An industry of commodified attractiveness is connected, even if with a dotted line, to beauty with a capital B. And the pandemic has not been pretty. Now, clearly, no one’s primary objection to a virus that has killed half a million people is aesthetic. The point I am making is that this has been an ugly time, literally, as well as metaphorically – and so, by the laws of physics, we long for the opposite. The optics of the past few months have been bleak, jarring and unfiltered. (Rishi Sunak is, of course, the honourable exception, but apart from him.) Think of the yellow and black stripes of official messaging campaigns, with their wasp-sting associations the one-way arrows and taped-off sections that make every public space feel like a building site. On one day towards the end of lockdown when I was feeling particularly low, I walked into my nearest Sainsbury’s Local – not the Uffizi to start off with – and the sheer visual assault of hazard tape and barricades almost did me in.After the blinding heatwave that accompanied the adrenaline-surge of lockdown drama, even the weather now seems to reflect our uncertainty, a certain instability of mood. Peering out into this strange twilight summer, we crave light. Remember that it was a rainbow, not a virus emoji, that became the symbol of this strange season. We are all craving beauty. And we are grateful to get it anywhere we can."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b89e74e549764386b3a434cc2f9c143f45b061a/0_175_6049_3630/master/6049.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b364878e4df7e0ce7af43d1ca2bdc9d","title":"collaborations backstage films and a pop up show paris mens digital fashion week in pictures","story":"The global pandemic saw the springsummer 2021 Paris menswear shows delayed but they still went ahead, online.

Email feast@theI love Thai and Vietnamese curries, but is it  worth making the curry paste from scratch? And what’s the secret to a great one? Adam, London SE10When faced with a cooking conundrum, I often ask: “What would Nigel Slater do?” In this instance, he mixes his own green curry paste: “I like the vibrancy that comes from the freshly-blitzed lemongrass, ginger, garlic and coriander leaves,” to which he then adds shrimp paste, fish sauce and a pinch of sugar. For red curry paste, Slater turns to shop-bought, finding them hotter and the sourness “more pronounced” than his homemade efforts.The beauty of making your own, however, says Thuy Diem Pham, chefowner of The Little Viet Kitchen in London, is that you can tailor it to your own taste. “I’m from the south of Vietnam, and every household has their own recipe, using ingredients their family likes. If you buy it, you can’t do that.” For hers, she crushes lemongrass, galangal, red shallots, fresh ginger, chillies, shrimp paste, dried turmeric, coriander seeds and cumin, it keeps for four weeks in an airtight jar in the fridge.A granite pestle and mortar will make all the difference to the texture. As chef Sebby Holmes, author of new book Thai in 7, puts it: “A proper Thai curry is made with brute force.” Diem Pham agrees: “Don’t change tradition unnecessarily – you’ll see the colour and flavours alter as you crush more chillies and shallots.” Using a food processor isn’t the end of the world, though, she says – just don’t tell her mum.Chillies are always the starting point, and the type of chilli depends on what you’re making: dried, long red ones for red-curry paste, fresh green bird’s eye chillies for green. Dried chillies, Holmes explains, should be soaked, then charred in a wok to “take the edge off”, before removing the seeds. He then adds one ingredient at a time: “Get the chillies to a paste, scoop out, and go through your hardy ingredients – galangal, lemongrass, krachai (wild ginger) – before adding fresh chilli, coriander root and, finally, the spices (cumin, coriander seeds, white peppercorns).” The key, he says, is to pound, pound, pound: “You want to keep going until you think it’s done, and then go some more.”When it comes to cooking, Diem Pham scoops out two tablespoons of paste and adds coconut cream, followed by vegetables, tofu or chicken. For Holmes, it’s a tale of two halves: “Prepare your meat so it’s delicious on its own, then make the curry as good as you can, and stick them together at the end.” Cook it for too long, though, and the freshness from the paste will be lost.If ingredients are hard to come by, chef Natalie Tangsakul, whose debut venture Talad is a tribute to her northern Thai upbringing, suggests buying a ready-made hung lay curry paste. “It uses spices that are easy to find – cardamom, coriander seeds, peppercorns, cumin.” She adds smoked, dried chillies to taste, then uses it to marinate chicken thighs (or chickpeas, if you’re veggie) overnight alongside garlic and ginger, before frying with tamarind paste, palm sugar and tamari.For Holmes, leftover red curry paste should be seasoned with palm sugar and fish sauce, then rubbed into scored sea bass or bream. After resting for a few hours, deep-fry the fish whole in a wok filled with 180C-degree rapeseed oil for five to six minutes, until crisp, then serve in the middle of the table with salad and rice, “hacking at the fish with your fingers or, these days, a fork and mask”.• Do you have a culinary dilemma?

It has certainly turned consumers on to oat milk with sales almost doubling to $200m last year, aided by new products including ice-cream and yoghurt.Oatly chief executive Toni Petersson said: “I understand that it may sound naive to actually believe Oatly can change the world – that the impact of what we do can inspire others to make changes that will lead to a global behavioural shift among consumers – but that’s fine.”The cash would be used to fund expansion, including new production plants, and to create jobs in Europe, the US and Asia, he said.Although cows’ milk is still a far bigger market, worth more than £3bn a year in the UK, Britons are buying fewer pints of it than their parents.

The current world record, set by Joey “Jaws” Chestnut earlier this month, stands at 75.James Smoliga, a sports medicine specialist at High Point University in North Carolina who authored the research, described 84 hotdogs as “the maximum possible limit for a Usain Bolt-type performance”.The analysis is based on 39 years of historical data from Nathan’s Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest, an annual spectacle of gluttony held on Coney Island, New York, combined with the latest sports science theory, which uses mathematical modelling to project trends in performance.Hotdog composition and size have, reportedly, remained unchanged at Nathan’s Famous in the fast food company’s 104-year history, allowing for valid comparison between competitors across years.Improvement curves in elite sports ranging from sprinting to pole vaulting tend to follow a so-called sigmoidal curve, featuring an initial slow and steady rise, followed by an era of rapid improvement and finally a levelling off. “Hotdog eating has definitely reached that second plateau,” said Smoliga.The early years of the Nathan’s contest featured a motley assortment of winners – mostly “big obese guys” who chanced their luck on the day, according to Smoliga. In 1984, the contest was won by Birgit Felden, a 17-year-old, 130lb, West German judo team member, who managed nine-and-a-half hotdogs despite never having eaten one before the competition.By the 1990s, the participation of Japanese extreme eaters changed the playing field. In 2001, Takeru Kobayashi downed 50 hotdogs, smashing the previous record of 25.125.“It wasn’t just people with big appetites any more,” said Smoliga.Elite eaters started to follow elaborate training regimes, with some ingesting vast volumes of liquid or gels to expand the stomach without having to process the calories. Chestnut, this year’s winner, claims to train for three months leading up to the competition, including weekly practice runs, a carefully controlled diet and yoga and breathing exercises to help with mental focus.In the trade, being lean is generally viewed as an advantage because a thick layer of fat round the middle can constrict the stomach.The 84 theoretical maximum comes from fitting a curve to the data and also factoring in the possibility of outliers whose performance lies within a certain error margin of the curve.The prediction should hold true, Smoliga said, unless a “new kind of competitor” shows up – someone with gigantism or a metabolic condition that placed them well outside the normal parameters of human biology. The limiting factor is likely to be chewing and swallowing rather than gastric capacity, based on the observation that at the end of the 10 minutes many competitors are still trying to gobble down more sausages and buns.According to the research, published in the Royal Society journal Biology Letters, the achievements of human speed eaters are impressive even by comparison with other species. “Humans are able to eat faster than bears or coyotes,” said Smoliga. Wolves, which devour prey at incredible speed, could outdo even elite human eaters, however."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b56c0eded305b0716c3f221706f247d860a51d55/0_307_1990_1194/master/1990.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d0989a4126811aeeed39deba661a915","title":"top chefs back tom kerridge for calling no show diners disgraceful","story":"Concerns raised about high landlord rents and fewer customers due to social distancingTop chefs have rallied behind Tom Kerridge after he criticised “selfish” and “disgraceful” customers for failing to show up and honour their reservations.They also raised concerns about the high costs of landlord rents, which they still have to pay despite operating at half capacity, and the risks associated with a lack of custom.Over the weekend, Kerridge criticised 27 people who did not turn up at the Corinthia Hotel in central London without letting the restaurant know. In an interview with the , Kerridge said: “There has been a huge response from the industry around no shows. It happens all the time but quite often people accept it or don’t talk about it.”He added: “It’s not just about me, it’s about the people’s jobs who we employ and small independent restaurants, so the industry has been supportive and pleased that I highlighted it.” Kerridge said that he will probably introduce a cancellation policy at the London venue.Michelin star chef Tom Aikens, who has a 25-diner restaurant in London’s Belgravia called Muse, said he was not opening until September but usually asked for deposits that would cover the price of the menu. He said: “I don’t know why people think it’s OK not to cancel, it is like going to friends’ dinner party and then deciding on the night not to go. It would be rude to not even phone to explain, so why would you do that to chefs and restaurateurs?”“I think the one big thing for many restaurants is paying rent – it’s a big number for a lot of people and they need continued help with that while we go through the next six to nine or 12 months. Having customers that feel safe and want to come to restaurants regularly is going to take some time, it really is. I am not sure of when we will see restaurants full again.”Two Michelin-starred restaurateur Raymond Blanc said he was preparing to open Le Manoir aux Quat’Saisons and due to social distancing guidelines there were a limited number of tables. “As an ongoing policy, we take card details at the time of booking and explain to our guests that should their plans need to change, we ask that they kindly advise us in advance. We explain that changes to bookings can of course be made should they wish, however, if they fail to arrive without notice, a charge will be made to their card.”He added: “We are all working so very hard to ensure we keep our guests and our staff safe and it saddens me greatly to hear that as the hospitality re-opens its doors again so many people are just not turning up. We fully understand that people might be apprehensive, but if you are worried just be kind enough to let us know of your change of mind.”James Golding, head chef at The Pig in Dorset, said they had quite a few cancellations but were making it back through walk-ins. “I suppose if we did not have those walk-ins then we would be in a different situation. We also find that because we have a lot of open space … If you do come in and are not comfortable in the restaurant we can say go outside and order a lighter lunch option and go where you want to go.”Kerridge said that restarting the industry would be very difficult, especially for London-based restaurants. “There is not the travel and tourism there, the whole of London is relatively quiet… Marlow, where my other restaurant is, there is still a vibrancy about it and numbers booking there are relatively strong.”He added: “I have concerns about the whole economic situation we are facing – we are heading towards a global recession rapidly and I worry that when furlough ends many sectors will be affected by redundancies. Right now people are being paid by the government essentially and when that finishes, the month after that has finished, many businesses have to have earnt enough money to pay wage bills.”“I am of course worried about the hospitality industry as that is my industry but there is a bigger picture here, we are all heading to some form of economic slowdown. I am fearful it will be a rapid halt and then we have got the really lovely pressing engagement of Brexit to try and deal with.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2c8fa155ce653cde03b437928cc888d959eb130/0_155_3989_2394/master/3989.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=582c41aaca18e7f0433e3092a71505f7","title":"chelsea norwich premier league match report","story":"If the task was simply to show Frank Lampard that they are capable of communicating on the pitch, then Chelsea’s players passed the test. The desire was clear when César Azpilicueta roared with delight when the final whistle sealed a crucial win. Yet telling a teammate whether they have time on the ball seems a rather basic aim for a side chasing Champions League qualification, and although Chelsea found a way to bounce back from their Sheffield United debacle, it was disconcerting to see them fall short when it came to expressing themselves in possession against the worst team in the Premier League.Azpilicueta’s celebration hinted at relief. Far from running riot against opponents who dropped into the Championship after losing 4-0 to West Ham on Saturday, Chelsea ended up labouring once again on home soil, creating little and failing to build on Olivier Giroud breaking Norwich’s resistance just before the interval. Ruthlessness was in short supply and Lampard will not be fooled after Giroud’s firm header tightened his side’s grip on third place, four points clear of Leicester and Manchester United after playing one game more.Sterner examinations lie in wait. Chelsea’s final two league games are against Liverpool and Wolves, while they have Sunday’s FA Cup semi-final against Manchester United to prepare for. Being generous, pPerhaps they were keeping their powder dry. Even so there will have to be an improvement at Wembley if Lampard is to avoid a fourth defeat to Ole Gunnar Solskjær’sUnited this season.While an empty stadium offered an opportunity to assess whether Lampard was right to home in on his team’s lack of noise after the aberration at Bramall Lane, the early stages offered a reminder that Chelsea have more than an attitude problem. An inability to break down opponents intent on defending deep has been a weakness throughout the campaign and, as an uneventful opening period wore on, it was not hard to see why Chelsea have already signed Timo Werner and Hakim Ziyech to add incision to an inconsistent attack next season.“We need to move the ball quicker, not take time,” Lampard said. “Not take touches to allow a team to be compact, we have to move them more and be more mobile in our rotations.“We’ve done it at parts this season but we need to do it more and really move on. I’m talking longer-term and it can be better. But I don’t want to be too critical after three points at this stage. It’s not easy, there’s a nervy feeling for understandable reasons so I’m pleased.”A huge opportunity was threatening to pass Chelsea by after Manchester United’s late slip against Southampton. If Lampard was hoping to see his players let out some of their anger by tearing into Norwich from the first whistle, he was left sorely disappointed. Norwich, atrocious at the back for the majority of the campaign, were finding it too easy to spoil the contest.Chelsea’s passing was too slow. There were five changes from Lampard, who brought in some experience after speaking about the need for some character, but the frustration was mounting. Too many crosses were failing to hit the target, the one-twos on the edge of the area were failing to come off and the lethargy was summed up by Kurt Zouma picking out a cameraman with a crossfield pass.Yet the prospect of Norwich’s feeble defence holding out was unlikely and Chelsea upped the tempo, stretching the play and involving their wingers more. Zouma wasted a glorious chance from a corner, heading wide from close range, and Christian Pulisic forced Tim Krul to make a stunning save following a smart turn.Pulisic, always lively with the ball at his feet, looked the likeliest to pick the lock and so it proved on the stroke of half-time, the American teasing Norwich on the left before crossing for Giroud to head in from six yards.With the tension released, Chelsea ought to have been hungry for goals at the start of the second half. They pressed to win the ball and almost doubled their lead when Willian pinched possession before seeing his shot deflected over. Giroud, up front in place of Tammy Abraham, planted a header over from the resulting corner.Yet it was still too pedestrian. Ruben Loftus-Cheek, starting in midfield as he continues to build his fitness after recovering from an achilles injury, struggled to make an impression supporting Giroud. Willian, out of contract at the end of the season, was erratic on the right.Sensing that they were still in the contest, Norwich started to have a go. Chelsea needed maximum focus in defence to avoid a calamity and although Krul had to make late saves from Pulisic and Marcos Alonso, Lampard was shown that turning up the volume will not drown out the focus on his side’s flaws.Norwich’s manager Daniel Farke told Sky Sports: “In terms of commitment, desire, compactness, defensive workload, it was a really good performance. Of course we are sad that we were not able to right ourselves with at least one point but I’m happy with the reaction after relegation and for that, many compliments for my lads today.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c039e12613de6a28a164d1a2d1cedc96b6fffc0e/103_91_2163_1297/master/2163.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=80a26c82cd245cc0fd540cad5e90c504","title":"liverpool rebuild a great example for arsenal to follow says mikel arteta","story":"Mikel Arteta has warned Arsenal a return to the Champions League will become possible only if the club decide to “go for it” and invest significantly in the squad, with the stark alternative being an extended spell outside Europe’s elite.Arsenal’s best outcome from a tumultuous season would be a fourth consecutive Europa League campaign, although defeat at home against Liverpool on Wednesday would almost certainly mean their hopes hinge on winning the FA Cup – they face Manchester City in the semi‑finals on Saturday.Arteta said in April they would be able to do “more, less or nothing” in the transfer market depending on their eventual finish, but made it clear only sizeable outlay would give them a fighting chance of eventually returning to the elite competition, given the extra spending power top-four clubs possess.Asked how much more difficult Champions League qualification would be with each year out of the competition, he outlined the quandary Arsenal face. “Harder and harder, because that’s obviously something that has to feed each other,” he said. “If you are not in the Champions League and you say: ‘OK, I don’t invest because I don’t have the financial ability to do it,’ but the other clubs invest, then the gap becomes bigger. If I do want to invest and risk, and then I don’t reach it, what happens? So at some stage you have to make a decision: whether I want to aim to make that gap closer and go for it, or I stay where I am.”Pressed on whether he felt the club could still attract top-quality players, he insisted their appeal had not faded – the implication being that, with the right money, he would be able to recruit appropriately.“We’ve an incredible history, an incredible structure, in a beautiful city and a style of play that attracts players,” he said. “And I’m telling you now, because I am closer to the market now – when I speak to people, a lot of players want to play for Arsenal.”The spell outside the Champions League is thought to have cost Arsenal about £100m and that figure will increase substantially now, even more so if there is no Europa League campaign to mitigate.Arteta, who hinted he will make changes to the side that lost at Spurs on Sunday given Arsenal face their ninth game in four weeks, said talks about the club’s future direction would take place when the season is over.“What we need to do at the end of the season is see the direction we want to take, agree on the ambition of the football club, realise that where we are the demands are going to be huge – that’s never going to change because it’s linked to our history and our success – and move from there,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b51985dd51b10f8bde7f3ed9d5edba81fe2aca93/140_542_4030_2418/master/4030.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=540b34f2584cab667e5cf6b0892c5ebc","title":"saudi arabia bans bein sport to further complicate 300m newcastle takeover","story":"Newcastle United’s takeover saga has been cast into further uncertainty after taking an unexpected twist on Tuesday when the Saudi Arabian government permanently barred the Premier League’s Qatar-based Middle East broadcast partner from operating in the kingdom. BeIN’s £500m deal with the Premier League runs until 2022 and there is now no legal way for anyone in Saudi Arabia to watch England’s top tier till then.A Saudi-led consortium, also featuring Amanda Staveley and Reuben Brothers, is attempting to buy Newcastle from Mike Ashley for £300m, with the Premier League having been considering whether or not to approve the deal for the past 16 weeks. It had been thought that a resolution in the consortium’s favour was close after the kingdom appeared to have clamped down on the broadcast piracy that had been of deep concern to the Premier League and Qatar’s beIN Sports. Now, though, an attempted buyout played out against the bitter cold war between Saudi Arabia and Qatar which has been taking place since 2017 has apparently been thrown into further doubt.The matter is further complicated by the fact that beIN Sports’ transmissions have been illegal in Saudi Arabia – albeit on an apparently more temporary basis – for the past three years. Analysts from all sides initially struggled to comprehend why the government in Riyadh had formally cancelled beIN’s already suspended broadcast licence at precisely the moment when Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund seemed on the verge of being handed the keys to St James’ Park.On Tuesday night, though, it emerged that the Saudi government edict related to an old legal case dating back to 2016 and both PIF and their consortium partners were completely unaware it would be issued. Although it came as a shock and the timing is regarded as unfortunate sources maintain it should not affect the Newcastle deal.Indeed facilitated, partly, by discreet interventions from the UK government, which is understood to be in favour of Newcastle’s Saudi-led takeover, a diplomatic compromise in the SaudiQatari broadcast war seemed about to be brokered. Instead came the surprise announcement from the Saudi General Authority for Competition (GAC) stating that beIN Sports’ licence to broadcast was cancelled permanently and Qatar fined 10m Saudi riyals (£2.1m).Assorted sources were left puzzled at the timing particularly after Saudi Arabia had issued a raft of new laws outlawing pirate transmissions of the Doha broadcaster’s Premier League output. Last month a World Trade Organization report said the Saudi state had facilitated the operations of the illegal, and now closed, beoutQ platform.BeIN described Tuesday’s Saudi decision as “nonsensical on every single level” and “plainly absurd.” In a statement it said: “We would question – as we have for three years – how Saudi citizens can watch Premier League matches legally in Saudi Arabia with this ‘permanent’ ban on the Premier League’s licensed broadcaster.”The Premier League declined to comment but Steve Bruce is increasingly concerned that the current limbo is taking its toll at his club. “We need a decision,” said Newcastle’s manager on Tuesday. “I need it, the club needs it, the fans need it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/63419e25088b7b2480ea4c949744c7e3a2d61f05/0_75_4590_2754/master/4590.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7cb353887439da6e290fb4a29a2af60a","title":"majority of womens super league clubs against premier league takeover","story":"The majority of Women’s Super League clubs favour the ision being run independently rather than taken over by the Premier League, the  understands.In February Premier League clubs discussed a feasibility study into a possible takeover of the women’s top flight from the Football Association but a decision was pushed back a year.On 30 June the Premier League chief executive, Richard Masters, told the parliamentary select committee for digital, culture, media and sport it was his ambition to see the organisation assume responsibility for the top tier. However, there is a fear among most of the 12 WSL clubs that, despite likely intentions to the contrary and huge financial benefits, the league would play second fiddle to the Premier League.The belief is the focus would be total commercialisation without the wider investment and work, such as coach and player development and dual career pathways, that the FA champions alongside the league’s development. That has led them to favour independent leadership that can take a more holistic approach towards the growth of the game and its sustainability.An independent league would be able to make decisions solely in the interests of the women’s game. After the success of the US women’s national team at the 1999 World Cup there were numerous attempts to establish an independent women’s professional league in the US but none lasted long, with the governing body, US Soccer, stepping in to relaunch a professional women’s league, the National Women’s Soccer League, in 2012. The clubs own the NWSL but it is managed by US Soccer, although there are talks over a structured separation that would see the league move towards being able to stand alone.Handing the women’s game to a suitable custodian has been a long-term aim of the FA. However, it will do so only once the league is secure, has reached a point of sustainability and its worth is well established, with a new broadcast rights deal believed to be key to assessing that. The FA wants to feel sure the league is strong enough to avoid the fate of some of the early attempts in the US.Any decision on a takeover or the future running of the women’s game will be up to the new Women’s Super League and Championship board, made up of representatives from six clubs (Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City, Tottenham, Aston Villa and Durham), three FA representatives (the CEO, Mark Bullingham the director of the women’s game, Baroness Sue Campbell and the chair of the FA women’s board, Sue Hough) and three independent members.Last July the FA said it was “supporting the Premier League in a project to explore the long-term feasibility of the Premier League running the Women’s Super League. This is a purely exploratory project and based on a long-term timescale.”Masters told the DCMS select committee of the league’s interest: “We want the women’s game to be successful, which is why we are helping them and why we’ve engaged in those discussions with the FA about resuming responsibility for it.“From a personal perspective, it is something I would like to do in the future for this organisation – being not just responsible for top of the pyramid in terms of the men’s game but also the women’s game.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b222e114b57e6250f9fc9efd84b813a45c8408e1/0_289_5362_3218/master/5362.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=92e66e22650645e87961d622207394e6","title":"artists kabul mural artlords afghan imagery corruption","story":"Muralists are covering the Afghan capital’s blast walls with agitprop imagery and calling out corruptionby  Stefanie Glinski in KabulFrom the killing of George Floyd in the US and the drowning of Afghan refugees in Iran, to the signing of the US-Taliban agreement towards peace and brutal murder of a Japanese aid worker, a group of Afghan artists have taken paintbrushes to adorn Kabul’s grey blast walls with vivid imagery.The barriers have been transformed into politically inspired murals, which the artists hope will create “visual dialogue” and raise awareness of corruption and injustices.The war-torn Afghan capital is full of these large concrete barriers, often separating diplomatic and governmental headquarters from the rest of the otherwise beautiful city of rolling hills and old brick houses.The worsening security situation and countless attacks have seen more blast walls built all over Kabul, blocking off roads and sheltering buildings and people from potential suicide bombs.Kabul’s green zone, a highly fortified area home to embassies and news agencies, is surrounded by tall, heavy walls.Since 2014, Artlords – a word play on warlords and drug lords, of which Afghanistan has many – a collective of artists and volunteers, has put some of the country’s politics into paintings, aiming to reflect the city’s atmosphere.“We want to turn public opinion into murals, that’s why we paint what we hear on the streets,” explained Abrar Kakarr, Artlords’ programme manager. “We don’t want to offend, we want to criticise.”The group recently sketched a portrait of George Floyd, the 46-year-old black man killed by police in Minneapolis, as well as a mural of Afghan refugees drowning in a river in Iran after fleeing their home country It is alleged that Iranian border guards forced them into the water at gunpoint.“We painted those in a day,” Kakarr said. “We usually electronically project the image against the wall and then e into the painting process with brushes, ladders and a bunch of volunteers.”Another mural, of the head of a Japanese aid agency, Tetsu Nakamura, who specialised in irrigation projects and was killed by gunmen in the eastern city of Jalalabad in December, went up in Kabul shortly after his murder. “Let’s not plant anything but the seed of love and friendship in this pure land,” a line next to his painted profile reads.The group has 10 members of staff, including some artists, and around 35 volunteers.All this inspired Artlords co-founders Omaid Sharifi and Kabir Mokamel to paint their first mural: a pair of eyes and the words “I see you” – aimed at questioning the “corrupt government” and creating dialogue.Since then, the group has painted almost 2,000 murals in 19 of Afghanistan’s 34 provinces. Some work has been commissioned by UN agencies and embassies to raise awareness about the development agenda. But other independent pieces are aimed at stirring political debate.The group – now mainly funded by international donors – has faced praise and criticism. Some have questioned whether beautifying explosion-proof walls denies their purpose and the continuing war in the city, but Artlords has said it will continue to promote messages of peace and social justice, as well as use its work to target alleged government corruption.“Artlords has increased the authorised use of graffiti on the concrete walls segregating military and governmental actors from the public and with it has transformed the city’s walls into public canvases,” says Paniz Musawi Natanzi, who studies cultural politics in Afghanistan.Some murals may have caused controversy, but so far only one has been removed. Two years ago, the group painted a portrait of Hamida Barmaki, a law professor and human rights activist killed with her husband and four children in a 2011 suicide attack claimed by Hizb-i-Islami militants. The mural, painted on a blast wall near the home of the militants’ leader, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar – a former mujahiddin chief who has since entered the Afghan government – was quickly removed by Hekmatyar’s men.“They took buckets of paint to it,” Kakarr said. “We hoped to make a point: Look, he has joined the government, but he’s a killer.” His crimes were pardoned by the Afghan government as part of a peace deal.“We want to be a voice for the people through our art. We want to make sure that those who are in power hear this voice and feel ashamed. They should know that people have not forgotten the crimes that they have done during the past years,” said Sharifi in response to the vandalising of Barmaki’s memorial mural.Kakarr added: “Politically, we’re facing an uncertain future in Afghanistan. Many people fear the Taliban gaining strength many are directly affected by killings and attacks. We hope our murals can address the suffering and injustices faced and point towards peace.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/865925947914315f29ce616c6b7c22f5d0251992/0_0_2952_1772/master/2952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c1d747de96a2c5bc16de8fdfd1097729","title":"safety first six smartphone rules every kid needs to know","story":"From setting rules to snooping, here’s your guide to helping your child have a healthy relationship with their smartphoneYour child getting their first smartphone is a rite of passage in 21st-century British life. If you’re a parent like me, you’ll be used to the constant chatter about “when” this hallowed day will be.“Just as we teach our children to wash their hands or cross the road, they need to be taught – and reminded – how to use the digital world safely,” says parenting expert Kathy Weston, founder of Tooled Up Education. “Kids need to understand that a phone is a big responsibility and they need to learn how to handle that.”Try these smartphone guidelines to share with your kids and ensure there is never another cross word about phone use again. Wishful thinking? Maybe. But these six rules might lead to a slightly easier life ...1. Working together on the rulesWe sat down together and worked on a contract. There was give and take – I relented on “only use your phone downstairs” and they accepted parental controls. We regularly tweak the contract to reflect their age.“Aim for transparency and openness,” advises Weston. “If our children understand we have their best interests at heart and share a strong, trusting relationship with us from that first phone purchase, it will be a positive experience.” A good starting point is Vodafone’s digital family pledge, which offers great tech house rules.2. Safety firstWhile online safety is essential, the advice can feel overwhelming. “But internet safety doesn’t have to be complicated and time-consuming,” says cybersecurity expert Jonny Pelter, founder of Simple Cyber Life. “First, check your mobile device settings and ensure screen lock and software updates are turned on, plus secure browsing.”Any mobile will have parental controls to help you manage what your child does online and the main mobile providers automatically block 18+ rated content (the filter doesn’t apply on wifi). My girls also understand I may check in on their phone occasionally and they need to ask before downloading apps.“A phone is not a locked diary it is a gateway to the wider world,” says Weston. “Over time, as trust builds, teens can have more privacy as the extent of parental scrutiny changes.”3. No phones in your bedroom at nightThis is the one golden rule I will never, ever back down on. “One of the main things that affects children’s sleep is gadgets in their rooms at night,” says Weston. The Journal of Youth Studies has found one in five adolescents regularly wake at night to check social media or messages and are three times more likely to feel “constantly tired” at school.In our house, we’ve agreed on no phones after 8.30pm and have a family charging station in the kitchen.4. Remember you can always call your parents, no matter what It’s really important your kids know they can phone you whenever they need. Figuring out data use is part of this and it has definitely been a learning curve for us. Amelia was originally on pay-as-you-go and once when she needed to call me she found she had run out of data! Luckily the “emergency” was buying an ice-cream on a park trip.As giving your child a phone is part of keeping them safe, consider an unlimited data plan so they can always get hold of you, plus have access to apps such as Maps. I found data limits were hard for the kids to understand, so unlimited has made life simpler.5. Get social media savvyLove it or hate it, social media is here to stay. In our house we use “How would Granny react?” as a gauge on how to behave online.

I failed to notice that I had inadvertently added four additional packs to my order. So I ended up ordering 40 pairs of briefs at a cost of £193.I tried to cancel the order immediately, but was told to send it away at the door. Unfortunately, I’d broken my ankle so couldn’t get to the door quickly enough. I made an abortive attempt to return the 40 pairs in their entirety, but misunderstood the returns procedure, so the briefs boomeranged back. I’m hoping to return the excess packs when Next reopens but I might just wrap up a pair as a tree present to myself every Xmas for next four years. Tim ClarkThey apologised for the mix-up. Apparently it is a cycling mask for cold weather. We got a refund but she ended up keeping it. Nicholas OettleI love fashion and absolutely hate shopping online. I’ve been buying more fashion magazines than usual to replace browsing in shops, but I cannot bring myself to buy clothes without seeing them and trying them on in real life. But I thought I couldn’t go wrong with some lovely earrings I saw in Grazia – very cool looking amber resin hoops – so I put aside my online shopping fears and ordered them.When they arrived they were at least twice as big as I had imagined. They knock against my jumper if I wear a polo neck, they weigh a ton and hurt when I put my headphones on over them. Both my daughters think they look great so I kept them. Everyone says you can just send it back, but that feels like a personal failure of judgement and taste. Katy LimmerI bought some kitchen cloths from Amazon for £6.99. When the parcel arrived, it was a small box and I thought “that’s a bit big for cloths”. I opened it up to find a kids toy – a talking dinosaur called Torr. It did not clean surfaces at all. I found a gift message in the box too. I think it was meant to go to a little boy for his birthday. Vanessa Hosker, BerkshireI was desperate for flour as my husband is shielding, so I waited to make my order from the Cotswold Flour Mill one morning as they restricted orders to what they could manage each day. Unfortunately for me “should have gone to Specsavers” applied I meant to order a number of inidual bags, but bought a 16kg bag by mistake.At first I offered it for free to people on the local Facebook group formed to help during the crisis, but got no takers. In the end I set up a table in the front garden, bagged it up and made a sign asking people to help themselves on their daily walk. The women were very interested, but the men couldn’t get away quickly enough. My last bag went to two teenage boys I hope their mum was pleased. Sue Frezza, Burton on TrentWhen it arrived I was too nosy and decided to open it. We found it charming … It says all the phrases in Mandarin first, then English, so my child can still understand it. We decided to keep it. It’s funny and different and makes people giggle. Sophie Lawler, SouthportI bought a new wig for my 90-year-old mother. The delivery was very slow and the wig was the wrong colour and the wrong style. I ordered a stylish ash-blonde wig a Donald Trump orange cowpat wig arrived.I tried to return it, but the company suggested I sell it to someone else as returning it would not be cost effective. I am still not sure whether it is a bogus company or maybe even a scam. Their website now pops up all the time on my laptop just to add insult to injury. It was a dreadful experience. Caroline Swan, EdinburghThe water where I live is extremely hard, making my skin and hair feel horrible. Water softeners are quite pricey, so I thought this hard water shower kit could be the answer. When I opened it I realised it was cheap, very plasticky. The hard water filter was heavy and the shower head dropped off the cradle because it couldn’t take the weight. This stretched the hose, which showed the plastic tubing through the centre, which then started to leak. The shower head also had a stream of water drips coming off it. I bought 60 loo rolls on Groupon for £20 including postage. I had not envisaged the reality of 60 loo rolls and was very surprised by the huge bag that arrived on my doorstep. I gave lots of them away and made fun of myself on Facebook. I have previous for this sort of thing, having once ordered a 3kg whole salmon thinking it was three pounds. I had to cook it in the dishwasher. Sue NicholsonI bought a “camping table” from Blacks to prepare and cook meals on, but I neglected to check the dimensions. It doesn’t even reach my knees. The price – just £8 – should have been a clue. I ended up keeping it. My kids will get some use out of it.

But in a world starved of physical contact, I’ve been a guilty glutton, entangled in a cornucopia of limbsWhen I lie down on the floor – which is frequently at the moment because I’ve spent exactly 116 days in lockdown with a three-year-old and her baby brother and I’m never not utterly exhausted – my daughter takes advantage. She clambers up my shins, hooks her tiny rib cage over my bent knees and pulls herself up until it feels as if her lungs may crumple … then es headfirst down my thighs, crash landing on my stomach with a shriek of pure glee. We call it the Slide Game, one of the many activities we do together best described as “fun at first, losing its appeal by the 57th go”.The Slide Game normally ends with a bear hug her trapped wriggling under my arms as I press our faces together, wondering how long I can get away with not letting her go, because I want to never let her go. At least she can wriggle free, unlike her brother, who has little say in accepting my shower of soggy kisses and chubby thigh squeezes. Not that he seems to mind, choosing to attach himself to me koala-like for large parts of the day, nails dug in my neck while my lips rest on his fuzzy hair.Lockdown has been cruel on everyone I know, in all kinds of ways. I’ve been shielding because it’s still unclear whether the blood clotting cancer I have interacts badly with Covid-19. That has meant embarking on a perma-childcare shift, one that normally begins at about 5am and stretches ahead like a road in the desert, with no places to refuel along the way. I barely leave the house, my brain has turned to mush and I often find myself sitting slumped with my phone, too tired to conjure up entertainment beyond finding the channel PAW Patrol is on.But lack of human touch is not a trauma I can share. In a world starved of physical contact, I’m a guilty glutton, squirrelled away with my plentiful supply, entangled in a cornucopia of limbs feet in my ribs fingers in my nostrils. My kids slip soapily down my body when I shower them, murmur gently when I hug them close, spray hay fever sneezes across my face like the super-spreaders of love that they are. I can’t get enough. To quote the great Labi Siffre, I could almost eat them. Sometimes, I try, swallowing my son’s shoulder blade or cheek whole – nyom-nyom-nyom – while he yanks at my hair and ears (actually incredibly painful, please stop, if you’re reading this).At the end of this year, when corona was still just something you put half a lime in, I asked the comedian Rob Delaney how he spends his time when he is at home. “Jigsaws,” he said, “and being sat on by as many of my children as possible at any one time.” Well, my wife and I bought a 1,000-piece jigsaw after that comment and, after spending six months piecing it together, we both can confirm the second activity is a lot more fun. Touch is like a circuit board lighting up your insides, a druggy jolt racing through your pleasure diodes.So while this year has undoubtedly been one of the toughest periods I can remember, I can’t pretend that this abundance of touch has ever been suffocating, or even annoying. Instead, I have learned that touch is the one thing you can never have too much of.• Tim Jonze is the associate editor of  Culture"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae222ed9638678f99141b5433ad35342d6d847fe/1_0_3329_1998/master/3329.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3a91489748269edd0ebe1993f724ed28","title":"end of the office the quiet grinding loneliness of working from home","story":"Before Covid-19, many of us thought remote working sounded blissful. Now, employees across the world long for chats by the coffee machine and the whirr of printersDahlia Francis is sitting on a small couch at the foot of her bed, in her shared flat, on a housing estate in south London. She wears her new uniform of pyjama bottoms and a Zoom-ready plain T-shirt. Her room used to be a living room. Now the only communal space is the kitchen, where Francis’s three flatmates occupy a small dining table. They, like almost half of Britain’s workforce, are also working from home.Francis, who is 29, is a credit controller for a charity in central London. She commuted there, by bus and tube, for a little more than a year. There were baking competitions and quizzes and a kitchenette, where gossip and tea flowed freely. Now the kettle is silent and the cubicles are empty. They are likely to remain so for the rest of the year.For the first few weeks after her office closed in late March, Francis was too busy to consider her new circumstances. Then they hit her – and got her down. Days spent in her bedroom hunched over a laptop, centimetres from where she slept, blurred into endless weeks. She has become lonely.Francis has worked for a tool hire firm and a betting chain, as well as for charities. The offices she remembers have taken on a different shape in her mind. “I used to think of a desk as like a kind of prison cell, where I was chained for eight hours a day,” she tells me over the phone. “It was always like serving time. But, at this point, my desk would be my saviour.”Lockdown has not so much redrawn the workplace of millions as it has chewed it up like a broken printer. Working from home, a mode traditionally viewed with suspicion by bosses and with envy by commuting bureausceptics, has become the norm for those whose livings are tied to computer screens.As weeks become months and offices remain closed, many are predicting their permanent decline. Buildings that for decades have defined urban geography, diurnal rhythms and the meaning of work may never hum in the same way to the sounds of keyboards and fluorescent lighting.“I’ve spoken to about eight startups that have already got rid of their office,” says Matt Bradburn, the co-founder of London-based People Collective, which advises companies on human resources. “And we’re talking companies of 50 to 100 people.” Elsewhere, firms including Twitter and Facebook have said they will allow employees to work from home for ever.When Bradburn polled his network of more than 5,000 HR bosses, he asked for the biggest reasons their teams had shared for wanting to go back to the office. Seventy per cent cited social and mental health issues, including feelings of loneliness. “I think young people in particular really need that connection,” Bradburn says.The assumption has been that remote workers slack without direct supervision. But do they? In 2010, a Chinese travel agency with 16,000 employees came to Bloom in search of evidence. Ctrip, which assumed workers would prefer being at home, was spending big money on offices in Shanghai. It wanted to know what remote work might do for the bottom line. “Their proposition was that they’d save on rent, but lose on productivity,” Bloom says.Bloom devised a trial – the first of its kind – involving 250 members of a Ctrip call centre. Half of the group were selected at random to work from home for nine months. The other half would continue to work in the office and the productivity of both teams would be measured.But the experiment also measured happiness. When Ctrip polled staff, half of the home-based group wanted to go back to the office. “Loneliness was the single biggest reason,” Bloom says. Plus, they were not in lockdown conditions: only people with a spare room took part none had children at home or flatmates and they still worked one day a week in the office.Bloom is now constantly fielding calls from anxious executives. “They have said productivity has been great and they’re thinking of abandoning the office,” he says. “I’m counselling that it’s shortsighted and high-risk.” Bloom had always been supportive of remote working, if not full-time, even after the Ctrip experiment. “Now I feel like I’ve gone from being an evangelist for working from home to an evangelist for the office,” he says.Erin Mackenzie, 23, knows what it can be like to work remotely full-time without the stresses of lockdown. Last summer, she got a junior marketing job with an online education company based in the Middle East. Mackenzie, who lives in a small house in a small town 50 miles north of New York City, thought working from home would be great.After four months of long days alone at the tiny desk in her bedroom, Mackenzie had a panic attack. She had lost weight and become depressed. “At first, I thought it was because the job was demanding, but I realised it was more the isolation and not being able to interact with people,” she says. “I hadn’t realised I’d relied on that so heavily for my mental health.”Mackenzie also felt suffocated by the digital monitoring, which was already becoming standard in big firms. Hers was relatively light. An agenda app would track tasks and alert faceless bosses when they were done. Response times to chats were noted. “It definitely added to me feeling like I didn’t have set hours and the anxiety of it all,” she says.If offices were to evolve to extract as much as possible from human resources, there are concerns that firms would use technology to tighten the screws further in our homes. Interest in the software offered by Teramind, a Florida-based employee monitoring and analytics firm with more than 2,000 clients, has tripled in lockdown. When downloaded to employees’ computers, Teramind’s “agent” can measure time spent on different windows. It can play back or live-stream a view of an employee’s screen and record his or her every keystroke. It can also raise a flag if certain predetermined words are typed.Will Gosling, who leads Deloitte’s consulting on “human capital” in the UK, says: “We’re at the beginning of a very big ethical debate about this. We were already seeing businesses wanting to get more data on employees and the pandemic has brought it into sharp focus … but they need to support and build health and wellbeing.”Trade unions worry that working from home will challenge privacy and rights, making it harder for employees to organise or be aware of how colleagues are being treated, particularly in the most onerous fields of white-collar work. There are questions about liability. Mental health is part of the picture. “Employers have a responsibility to ensure worker wellbeing and that doesn’t end just because people are not in the office,” says Tim Sharp, the senior policy officer for employment rights at the Trades Union Congress.Mackenzie quit after the panic attack and got a job with an insurer. She immediately felt better, even while enduring a two-hour commute to Manhattan for her training. She now works in a smaller office a short drive from home – or, rather, she did until the pandemic. It helps that she now works for a better, kinder company. Her fiance is working at home, too. “Without him here, I probably would have crumbled,” she says.At their best, offices are crucibles for ideas and lifelong friendships, particularly among younger workers with small homes but big social circles. The Office was not just a comic study of business park malaise – it was a love story. Working from home may boost productivity for a while, “but it’s so costly in terms of creativity and inspiration”, Bloom says. “We’re all suffering from Zoom overload and feeling worn down.”Flick Adkins, who is 28, counts some of her colleagues as her best friends. For three months, she has been cut off from them while working from the flat she shares with five other people in north London. She works for LRWTonic, a market research company, and takes a lot of private calls. She has to sit cross-legged on her bed, stacking her laptop on part of her vinyl collection. She has settled on 20 records as the optimal height.Adkins’s now empty office has a ping pong table and a coffee machine, where she would chat with friends before starting her day. On Fridays, she and her 20 mostly young colleagues would go out for lunch and have drinks after work.Like Francis, Adkins feels lonely, down and unmotivated. “Having an office was symbolic of normality,” she says. “I loved just being at my desk and hearing the buzz and all the conversations … I can count on two hands the number of times I’ve said: ‘I don’t know much longer I can do this.’”Last month, Adkins’s boss, Anna Dunn, floated with her team the idea of ditching the office for good and saving £200,000 a year in rent. “I said that the money would be distributed to them in a bonus, to some degree,” Dunn, 40, says from her kitchen. She, too, misses the office. “I thought there might be this desire to stay remote, but not one person does. They all want to go back.”The sounds of the office have a new resonance. More than half a million people have tuned into The Sound of Colleagues, a web page and Spotify playlist of workplace sounds, including keyboards, printers, chatter and coffee machines. Red Pipe, a Swedish music and sound studio, created it in April as a joke, but its data suggests that people keep it on in the background.If reports of the death of the office have been exaggerated, everyone agrees it won’t look the same. Bloom envisages a new landscape of smaller offices, with employees alternately working at home for half the week to bring down costs and make physical distancing more viable. Budgets for nice interiors will fall. “I think the office will be more suburban, more spacious and nastier-looking,” he says.Francis would not care. When I speak to her, she has taken a week of holiday. She had anxiety before the pandemic, which partly expressed itself in a need to be busy all the time. But, after three months of sometimes 12-hour days and a deepening sense of unease, burnout has become a worrying prospect. Not that she can really escape her place of work. “I’m just sort of winging it this week and not planning too much,” she says from her bedroom couch. “I just need a bit of time to gather myself.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e64853270418239725248e64d757ab564f4497d8/0_50_1805_1083/master/1805.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=764e6f817deaebb90bc3d07aa622b7af","title":"is uk golden era relations china over podcast","story":"China and the UK have clashed in recent months over a draconian new security law in Hong Kong and the Chinese tech company Huawei. ’s Tania Branigan examines whether a much-promoted ‘golden era’ between the two countries is at an end In 2015 George Osborne, the then chancellor, promised a ‘golden decade’ for Chinese-British relations as he drummed up support for new trade opportunities and inward investment. That has all changed after China imposed a harsh new security law in Hong Kong and now the UK government is preparing to backtrack on an agreement to use the Chinese firm Huawei in its 5G infrastructure.  ’s leader writer Tania Branigan tells Rachel Humphreys that this new phase in relations is going to be difficult for the UK. Last week, Beijing’s ambassador to London, Liu Xiaoming, warned: “China wants to be UK’s friend and partner. But if you treat China as a hostile country, you would have to bear the consequences.” It comes as pressure mounts on China internationally to be open about the origins of the coronavirus pandemic first seen in Wuhan at the end of last year, and increasing outrage at the treatment of Uighur Muslims. But there is an acceptance too in government that even if the ‘golden era’ is over, China remains a vital trade relationship as well as a crucial player in global affairs, not least the battle to reduce carbon emissions.

But forced to lock down just as he was about to expand, what does he think the future will hold?From serinakaker butter biscuits to cinnamon buns, Paul Rawlinson was raised on Scandinavian treats galore, without even realising that there was anything unusual about it. “We had a waffle iron, and that was very much a tradition on a Sunday afternoon,” he recalls. “I never really wondered why other people didn’t eat them.”Rawlinson, who grew up in Manchester, had his grandmother to thank for the Nordic influence in his upbringing – an influence that continues to have a big bearing on his life and work. Born in Stavanger in 1923, Liv Esther Baltzersen moved to England after meeting her future husband at the London Olympics in 1948, and lived the rest of her life there, mainly in the north-west. Yet she never lost touch with her roots and would celebrate her Norwegian heritage in all sorts of ways – not least through cooking and baking. “These Scandinavian things were just part of visits to grandma really,” says Rawlinson. “There was always Norwegian family visiting, or Norwegian cakes and biscuits on the table.”After five years spent travelling the world as an army officer, Rawlinson decided to settle down in North Yorkshire with his wife – to start a family, and launch a business that he had dreamed about since childhood. In 2012, Baltzersen’s opened in central Harrogate – a cafe where Yorkshire-sourced ingredients meet Scandinavian inspiration. Locals and tourists alike were soon hooked on the homemade smörgåsbord of delights that Rawlinson and his team had to offer. Be it open sandwiches with meatballs or pickled herring, pølse street food sausages, lapskaus meat and potato stew, or traditional heart-shaped Scandi waffles (prepared on irons imported from Trondheim). All that, and enough cinnamon buns to feed a battalion – Baltzersen’s bakes and sells some 10,000 of the icing-swirled delights every year.How did Rawlinson’s time in the army, which saw him serve in Afghanistan among other places, prepare him for his new life serving food in a spa town near the Yorkshire Dales? Better than you might imagine, it turns out. “In many ways, they’re fairly similar,” Rawlinson says, of the military and the hospitality industry. “When you go to Sandhurst, you’re training to be a leader and what I do in my job now is lead people. I was an engineering officer, and I guess engineering is about designing processes and trying to make things as efficient as you can.”This training certainly came into its own when lockdown hit – how could they adapt? Rawlinson and some of his staff launched a major operation to keep the business running online. A small independent business such as Baltzersen’s could well have feared for its future – especially as it had just put the finishing touches to a new off-site bakery, an expansion designed to allow it to bake its own bread among other things. But in adversity Rawlinson sensed opportunity for a new initiative.Within a few days, Baltzersen’s had pivoted to start a “click and collect” option as well delivering their rye breads, sultanaboller buns and “cruffin” pastries direct to customers. The online service quickly proved popular, and Rawlinson ran it with martial discipline, converting the cafe into a temporary “logistics base” to plan and coordinate drop-offs of up to 1,200 products a day to about 100 different homes.“We got loads of nice feedback from people telling us it was the thing they looked forward to each week,” says Rawlinson. “The best part for us was being able to still see the people that we normally would see two, three, four times a week in the cafe, even if it was just from the doorstep, giving us a wave. It was great being able to maintain that connection with our regular guests.”Good reason to hope that the people of Harrogate haven’t forgotten about Baltzersen’s while it has been closed – and that they’ll start to return once lockdown lifts. “That’s a big worry for us, like all independent businesses, after all the work we do to build and maintain relationships with customers,” Rawlinson says. “To be locked down for so long has given people a lot of time to make new habits. Will they come back to us?” he asks.Only time will tell. But he’s encouraged to see Visa’s shop local campaign getting behind the independent traders that are the beating heart of the high street. “A company such as Visa can shine a big light on small businesses like ours,” says Rawlinson. “Hopefully when people read our story, it’ll make them think about their equivalent of Baltzersen’s on their high street, and think ‘it’s important for us to try to get back there reasonably quickly to support the businesses that we love’.”Shop local.

They said hospital managers and government officials told them failing to attend shifts, posting on social media or voicing objections would result in complaints to the National Security Agency, Egypt’s primary internal security body, which rights groups say has arrested multiple healthcare workers.A doctor in the outlying Cairo district of 6th October said hospital management regularly threatened staff with referral to the NSA, after they voiced concerns about a doctor who died but was not permitted to be PCR tested. “They told us our social media will be monitored to the extent I deleted all my colleagues since I can’t trust any of them,” she said.Another doctor at a hospital in Alexandria said when a group of medics gathered to demand a coronavirus test for a colleague showing symptoms people from hospital security and plainclothes police showed up.Egypt has recorded more than 80,000 confirmed coronavirus cases, although one government minister has repeatedly warned true case numbers could be five or even 10 times higher than official figures. The Egyptian Center for Public Opinion Research, known as Baseera, has estimated that at least 616,000 Egyptians were infected with Covid-19 . At least 131 doctors have died from coronavirus.Doctors have described a medical system overwhelmed by the virus with few hospital beds or medications available to treat even the most desperate patients and as the pandemic has tested Egypt’s health infrastructure, the medical workers branded the “White Army” by authorities have faced reprisals for speaking out.The Egyptian Medical Syndicate, a quasi-government body that represents healthcare workers, has also become a target after it accused the prime minister, Mostafa Madbouly, of inciting anger against doctors when he warned the government will “take appropriate legal measures” against absentee doctors, blaming their “lack of discipline” for the rise in cases.The rights group Amnesty International has documented the arrest of at least six doctors and two pharmacists, detained by the NSA for speaking out about the pandemic. In one case, the director of a hospital reported a pregnant doctor to the agency after she called a government hotline to register a Covid-19 case. She was detained on charges that included joining a terrorist group.“We are valueless for them. They sacrifice us,” said a medical worker at a public hospital in Giza. “We have no PCR tests. We have no drugs. We have no places to admit patients, we ask them to quarantine at home and to try to find drugs, even though we’re sure these drugs are lacking even in private pharmacies.”He described how doctors were told that absences mean they will be reported to the NSA, a body notorious for forcibly disappearing and torturing citizens in an effort to stamp out dissent from even the mildest critics. “I don’t dare to be absent, even from these shifts where I can’t help anyone,” he said. “I’m okay to put myself at risk if I can help people, but I’m doing so without any service to these patients.”The doctor said he bought himself a face shield, due to a profound shortage of protective equipment across Egypt. He feared requesting one from his hospital would be seen as a complaint, and would land him in trouble as the facility likely had none. “Buying it was much easier than prison,” he said. “This is a tradeoff between money and freedom.”All the medical workers interviewed said news of arrests or threats had a chilling effect, intended to make them reconsider voicing their own concerns. “They don’t have to arrest everyone who is talking,” said the Giza doctor. “They just have to arrest a few and the rest fear to do the same. These doctors don’t want to face the same fate.”A spokesman for the Egyptian health ministry and the head of Egypt’s State Information Service did not respond to requests for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd307553963fd56373a8dd03dd4cac6287fb0271/0_220_3300_1980/master/3300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=edd53d9d0a44851f53d9af824e39da4e","title":"nature led coronavirus recovery could create 10tn a year says wef","story":"Report says 400m jobs could be created, and warns there will be ‘no jobs on a dead planet’Tackling the global nature crisis could create 400m jobs and $10tn (£8tn) in business value each year by 2030, according to a report published by the World Economic Forum.The report warns that when the world recovers from the coronavirus pandemic there can be no business-as-usual, with today’s destruction of the natural world threatening over half of global GDP. In 2019 scientists warned that human society was in jeopardy from the accelerating decline of the Earth’s natural life-support systems.The report, from the New Nature Economy project, published by the WEF, says a nature-first approach from business and political leaders will be a jobs-first solution.“There will be no jobs or prosperity on a dead planet,” said Alan Jope, chief executive of Unilever and a WEF partner.The report says: “We are reaching irreversible tipping points for nature and climate. If recovery efforts do not address the looming planetary crises, a critical window of opportunity to avoid their worst impact will be irreversibly lost. Decisions on how to deploy the post-Covid crisis stimulus packages will likely shape societies and economies for decades.”Akanksha Khatri, head of WEF’s Nature Action Agenda, said: “Nature can provide the jobs our economies need. There is nothing stopping businesses and governments from implementing these plans today, at scale, to re-employ millions.”Many high-level observers, including economists, health professionals, climate experts, and developing countries, have urged governments and business to pursue a green recovery but largely focused on tackling the climate emergency.Another report in July concluded that almost a third of the world’s land and oceans could be protected while bolstering the economy. The UN has also warned that the world is currently only treating the health and economic symptoms of the pandemic, not the cause – the environmental destruction.The WEF report proposes a range of measures for boosting jobs and economies, such as cutting food waste by providing metal silos and crates to keep food from rotting. Better management of wild fish too could boost catches and add 14m jobs and $170bn in value, it says. It is also vital to end the $2bn subsidies given daily to agriculture which damage the planet, the WEF report says.“This expenditure of public money is actually creating harmful effects on the public good,” said Khatri. “Something is significantly broken in our system.”In cities, retrofitting to increase energy efficiency could save $825bn by 2030, the report says, while the market for urban green roofs is already worth $9bn and could grow rapidly.Renewable energy is also a huge investment opportunity and already matches the cost of fossil fuels in 30 countries, while the use of human sewage as an energy source is rising.WEF acknowledged that some workers would lose their jobs in unsustainable industries and urged governments to ensure people were retrained and that the transition to a green economy was fair to all. It estimates that $2.7tn of annual investment is required to fund all the opportunities identified in the report, a sum similar to the stimulus package announced by the US in March.Jennifer Morris, head of The Nature Conservancy, a US based organisation, said: “Nature simply cannot afford for us to waste any more time. None of this will be easy, system change at this scale never is. But WEF’s report underlines that it is our collective responsibility to transform the ways in which we eat, live, grow, build, and power our lives.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3cd169c13e5aa95f24511a628a84a0d1304eca6f/0_59_3200_1921/master/3200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=38ea0833deade30e1687e962b829ba9e","title":"race too close to call as north macedonia holds first poll since name change","story":"Vote will decide whether country continues on course of pro-European reformNorth Macedonia goes to the polls on Wednesday in an election viewed as crucial for the Balkan state’s future after months of political drift exacerbated by voting being postponed by the coronavirus pandemic.The vote, originally due to be held in April, will be the first since the country changed its name from Macedonia in a landmark deal with Greece two years ago. It is hoped the election will end the political uncertainty that has lingered since the European Union’s refusal to set a date for North Macedonia to begin eagerly-awaited accession talks with the bloc.“We need a government to start those talks,” said Eva Ellereit, resident representative of the Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung German political foundation in the capital, Skopje.“This is an important election because it will decide the future of the country. People have the chance to determine whether they want to continue on a course of pro-European reform. The result could be a beacon of hope for democracy in the western Balkans at a time of backlash in parts of the region.”Opinion polls show the two main parties, the Social Democratic Union of Macedonia and the conservative populist VMRO-DPMNE, neck and neck with the contest too close to call. Amid an alarming surge in coronavirus cases, the pandemic is expected to erode turnout, as members of the 2-million strong nation’s large European diaspora are unlikely to be able to return to vote.In another first, however, some 700 people ill with Covid-19, or in quarantine and unable to travel to polling stations, were allowed to cast ballots from their homes. The elderly and ill, along with prison inmates, voted on Tuesday.“A crucial factor will be who can mobilise more voters given restrictions,” Ellereit said, noting that Berlin, as current president of the EU, was keen to launch membership talks with North Macedonia.In western capitals the former Yugoslav republic is seen as key to the stability of a land-locked region Russia has long regarded as falling within its own orbit, and where it has openly sought influence.Zoran Zaev, the social democrat leader who was prime minister until January, is hoping to be re-elected on his record in office. Credited with overseeing the historic name-change accord, he navigated North Macedonia’s accession to Nato as the alliance’s 30th member, which Athens had blocked for years because of fears the nation had territorial ambitions against the Greek province of Macedonia. Zaev also finally got the green light for EU accession talks in March.“In the eyes of the international community Zaev is the good guy,” said Branko Geroski, a political commentator in Skopje. “While no one is denying the country was isolated before Zaev came to power, on issues of the economy, justice, corruption and nepotism there is a local perception that he has not done as well.”The social democrats, since replacing VMRO and ending a decade of autocratic rule under its then leader Nikola Gruevski, have been accused of failing to improve the everyday lives of citizens in a country that remains among the poorest in Europe.By contrast, VMRO, under its new leader Hristijan Mickoski, has run its campaign on the promise of renewal, delivering a noticeably more nationalist message that has appealed to the pride of citizens enraged by the state’s change of name. He has, however, moved the party more to the centre-right in contrast with Gruevski who, facing a prison term, has found refuge in Hungary.With neither party set to win an outright majority in the 120-seat parliament, analysts said the likelihood of one of them having to form a coalition with a smaller ethnic Albanian party was “very high”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d8fe78d60e8d0b6a6a7ff07cdb64a16bbf803d85/150_0_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6cf5e1f0dc679ae8fdee5ff3c8f34098","title":"revealed the inside story of europes divided coronavirus response","story":"Exclusive: A litany of failings meant that when Italy faced disaster, its distress call to the EU met with a shocking silenceby  Daniel Boffey Celine Schoen, Ben Stockton and Laura MargottiniIt was a moment of chilling clarity. On 26 February, with the numbers of Italians known to be infected by coronavirus tripling every 48 hours, the country’s prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, appealed to fellow EU member states for help.His hospitals were overwhelmed. Italian doctors and nurses had run out of the masks, gloves and aprons they needed to keep themselves safe, and medics were being forced to play God with the lives of the critically-ill due to an acute lack of ventilators.An urgent message was passed from Rome to the European commission’s Berlaymont headquarters in Brussels. The specifications of Italy’s needs were uploaded into the EU’s Common Emergency Communication and Information System (CECIS).But what happened next came as a shock. The distress call was met with silence.“No member state responded to Italy’s request and to the commission’s call for help,” said Janez Lenarčič, the European commissioner responsible for crisis management. “Which meant that not only is Italy is not prepared … Nobody is prepared … The lack of response to the Italian request was not so much a lack of solidarity. It was a lack of equipment.”Some 180,000 European citizens, across the European economic area and the UK, have died from coronavirus and 1.6 million have been infected since the disease crept on to the continent in December last year courtesy of a mystery patient zero.The true number of deaths is almost certainly higher than so far recorded. The recent rise in infections in Serbia and the Balkans are cause for great concern. The continent is now on an unalterable course to the worst economic recession since the Great Depression of the 1930s, largely as a result of the lockdowns required to shield its many under-funded healthcare systems.Leaders have been asked fundamental questions about the purpose of the European project when states fail to come to each other’s aid at the darkest times. This weekend the EU’s 27 heads of state and government will meet in Brussels for the first time in person for five months to try to plot a way forward.Today, through both analysis of internal records and interviews with dozens of EU officials and experts in both Brussels and the bloc’s capitals, the  and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism can tell the full story of how Europe emerged to be the WHO-designated “epicentre” of a global pandemic and what key lessons might be learned.It is a story of well-meaning officials in Brussels speaking in urgent tones of an impending disaster to empty press conference rooms. Of increasingly desperate health ministers unable to convince their heads of government and finance ministries of the scale of what was coming and the imperative to act. Of governments belatedly recognising the speed at which the virus was spreading, only to rush into uncoordinated acts of protectionism in moments of ill-concealed panic. And of EU institutions and agencies in which central figures either lacked the experience or powers to get capitals to act together in the face of a disease with respect for neither borders nor the glacial pace of Brussels’ bureaucracy. It is the story of an EU caught ill-equipped and institutionally incapable of mounting an adequate response to the crisis that so swiftly engulfed it.It was as millions of Europeans prepared for their New Year’s Eve celebrations that officials in the Stockholm office of the EU public health agency, the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC), first received notice of a cluster of pneumonia cases in China of unknown origin.Established in 2005 in reaction to the Sars outbreak two years before, the ECDC offers scientific advice. It can do no more. Responsibility for health remains entirely with the national governments of the EU, and not in the European commission or its agencies. Despite its limitations, the ECDC’s job is to look to the full European horizon, and call the alarm whether capitals listen or not.The initial concern was how to keep the disease outside the EU’s borders. On 17 January a first coronavirus conference call was held by another EU body born out of previous health crises – but again lacking the powers retained by the national governments.The European commission’s health security committee comprises health ministry representatives from each member state and has had responsibility for coordinating cross-border health threat responses in Europe since the H1N1 influenza outbreak of 2009.But on 17 January, just 12 of the 27 member states, plus the UK, phoned in.Wolfgang Philipp, the head of a small team within the commission’s health department in Luxembourg, chaired the meeting. He told those present that a few dozen people in Wuhan had been infected with a new strain of coronavirus.With 300,000 people expected to travel to Europe from China that month, many to celebrate Chinese New Year on 25 January, the question was what to do about direct flights from Wuhan to London, Paris and Rome.Screening all airport arrivals with symptom checkers and thermometers was believed to be largely ineffective in stopping the spread of the virus, an official from the ECDC told the committee. They instead recommended targeting passengers on the 12 weekly flights arriving in Europe from Wuhan.The UK and France shared information about what they were doing at airports. But there was no update from the Italian government, one of the many absentees. The Italian representative hadn’t noticed the email inviting him to the meeting.The committee had planned to release recommendations on border measures. But those who did attend couldn’t agree. It was an ominous sign of the difficulties the commission would face.Although governments are required to inform the health security committee before implementing measures, unilateral action would repeatedly be taken in the subsequent weeks. The format and short duration of the meetings – typically only an hour with about 100 people attending – would also limit the communication and cooperation possible, sources said.There would be frustration among attendees that some countries were not giving the committee the “weight that it deserves”. Its ability to coordinate effectively was questioned. “There was no time to catch up on events during the time of one week,” the source said. “Events happened at a tremendous speed.”And at the helm of the commission was Ursula von der Leyen, just a few weeks into her job as commission president.The pandemic was a crisis that could have been tailor-made for Von der Leyen, a medical doctor before embarking on a political career that would take her to the German defence ministry. She moved to the EU’s executive branch in December.A significant intellect with steel, according to sources who worked with her during the crisis, but some within the system would come to wonder whether she might have done more in those first weeks. Her first steps were said by some to be tentative. She appeared unsure of the levers she had at her disposal.“The commission should have taken a grip earlier,” said one EU official. “Von der Leyen is clever. But she is new to Brussels and relies on a couple of people from Berlin who also don’t have experience of the commission and what is possible. You don’t ask the member states if they want coordination, you just coordinate. Health is a national competence but you can push things.”If it was a stuttering start by a Brussels novice, the seriousness of what was happening in China was at least understood early in some parts of the commission.“We convened the first meeting of the so called crisis coordination committee on 28th of January,” Lenarčič said. “The commission did take this threat seriously. And we did not change course in our serious approach. Even when voices multiplied out there that ‘all this will just die out’. We even didn’t change the course when some others were toying with the concepts of herd immunity.”A swift decision was taken by the commission to ban its staff from non-essential travel to China and a press conference was called for 29 January to communicate a clear message: get ready.But if the alarm bells were sounding in Berlaymont, the media had other interests. The UK was about to leave the EU after 47 years of membership.“We went to the press conference and the press room was almost empty,” recalled Lenarčič. “We called for preparedness – for all member states to take this seriously and prepare. There was a lot of echo because of the empty room. But we were still hoping that there would be some echo in the media next day. We didn’t find much of that because all the media attention in Brussels was, at that time, devoted to the last session of the European parliament plenary where the UK members participated.”“So a lot of footage of people singing holding hands in the plenary,” Lenarčič said. “I understand that it was a historic moment, it was a sad moment it was emotional moment. But that all does not change the fact that we had something to say on that same day. And we said it, and not many people were interested.”It was not only the newspapers and broadcasters failing to listen to the siren voices from the EU’s executive branch and agencies.The ECDC in the same week advised governments to strengthen the capacities of their hospitals and, in particular, the intensive care units.The urgency of the warning did not hit home in the capitals. “I think what turned out is that they underestimated, in my view, the speed of how this increase came”, said Ammon, a former head of department for Infectious Disease Epidemiology at the Robert Koch Institute in Berlin who took over the ECDC in 2017. “Because it is a different situation if you have to look for an increase in capacity of beds within two weeks or two days.”Meanwhile, the virus was continuing to quietly seed. On 30 January, two Chinese tourists in Rome tested positive for coronavirus. The Italian government immediately banned all flights to and from China and sought a meeting of EU health ministers to push for stricter entry screening measures across Europe.But the meeting took three weeks to organise. The Croatian government, responsible for convening it as holder of the rolling EU council presidency, had become embroiled in a financial scandal during which the prime minister, Andrej Plenković, had been forced to fire his health minister, Milan Kujundžić. By the time health ministers did finally meet on 13 February, pockets of cases were sprouting.The response to the coronavirus threat had been “prompt and effective” declared the new Croatian minister of health, chairing the council meeting.But an internal ECDC report dated the day after the meeting gave a rather different account, listing a litany of things that were still unknown about the virus and its risks to Europe. The “preparedness status in different member states” was “uncertain”, it read.The stark reality was that in the months and years before coronavirus arrived in Europe, stocks of personal protective equipment (PPE) had dwindled. Emergency supplies of masks had expired, been destroyed and never replaced. Pandemic preparedness plans were out of date.“Several European countries had a strategic stock of masks that were outdated … Most of them were just destroyed,” said one scientific adviser.France held 1.7bn protective masks in 2011, but now had only 117m. Between January and March this year it incinerated 1.5m. In 2017, Belgium ordered the destruction of 38m masks and they were never replaced.No one, it appeared, had a hold on what was out there. Up until 23 February, flights carrying donations of PPE were leaving Europe for China in the hope of containing the virus there. But the unpalatable truth was that Europe itself was exposed.By the weekend of 29 February and 1 March, more than 2,000 people were infected in Europe. In Italy, 35 people had died. Von der Leyen decided to put herself at the forefront of the crisis.She informed Lenarčič that the scale of the crisis required a coronavirus crisis response team of commissioners covering everything from health to the economy and borders.The new team was presented to the public on the Monday. As Von der Leyen walked to the lectern to the click of camera shutters she gestured to the commissioners. “Come on” she was heard to say.Yet within hours, Europeans witnessed one of the biggest failings of the entire pandemic. Now each in full-blown crisis mode, European countries inidually acted to impose restrictions on the export of key medical supplies to neighbours.On 3 March, France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, announced that he was requisitioning “all stocks and the production of protective masks”. The next day, the German government banned the export of PPE.A total of 15 member states placed restrictions on the movement of equipment or drugs within the EU during the outbreak. Trucks of masks, gloves and protective gowns were stopped at some borders. European leaders accused each other of undermining EU solidarity and the single market.PPE shipments destined for EU countries that arrived in ports in Germany and France were “very simply stolen”, said a source. The Belgian and Dutch governments meanwhile were buying up the ingredients to make key drugs and delivering them to hospitals to be produced on-site.With a limited supply of these ingredients in Europe, the move hamstrung efforts by the pharmaceutical industry to increase the manufacture of medicines needed to treat the most severe coronavirus cases.By the time European health ministers attended a second council meeting on 6 March, the health commissioner Stella Kyriakides, flanked by Lenarcic and Thierry Breton, commissioner for the internal market, felt the need to stress the importance of European unity. “I ask you all today to commit to us all working together, openly and transparently, in a spirit of solidarity to ensure a coherent political response,” Kyriakides said.Yet just a few days later Germany unilaterally closed its borders, bringing the continent to a halt, with footage of 50km (31 miles) traffic queues on the German-Polish border dominating the news. The isions of old Europe appeared to be back.“It is not a problem to close the border but you have to talk to your neighbour on the other side of it and some didn’t,” said Lenarčič. “That was wrong and created a lot of problems. First it hampered the flow of goods which is dangerous not only for the functioning of the single market but also for the Covid response because some of those goods are essential like medical equipment, not to talk about food.”There was red-hot anger in the commission’s headquarters. “The commission acted forcefully and immediately in order to persuade all those member states that indulged in such selfish measures,” Lenarčič said.To placate those claiming that there were “people running around Europe with big bags of cash buying everything they could at any price”, the commission agreed to an export authorisation scheme to control what equipment left the bloc, Lenarčič said. But it had been a sobering moment for those with faith in the union. “Things were not done properly.”It was a scenario surely unimaginable even just a few weeks earlier. From 9 March, starting with Italy, and ending on 23 March when Boris Johnson finally followed suit, Europe’s governments shut down their economies one-by-one. Only Sweden went its own way.On 12 March, Von der Leyen’s experts told her the outbreak in Europe couldn’t be stopped. Next day, the head of the World Health Organization declared that Europe was now the “epicentre” of the global pandemic.For the commission, the overriding imperative was to source equipment. Ricciardi, however, recalls his deep disappointment with what then unfolded. “At the time we had desperate need of PPE and ventilators and it was almost impossible to find it on the market,” Ricciardi recalled. “So our call was distribution of what was present in Europe and joint procurement. But it took two months to do that. Not for lack of willingness of the European commission but the process was so slow and bureaucratic. We only had ventilators when our acute situation was over.”The commission had first raised the idea of joint procurement of PPE, of becoming “one big buyer”, in mid-January, but had been faced with a lack of interest from the member states. It was not until 5 February that it was decided to launch a formal assessment of what PPE member states might need.It then took two weeks, and a number of missed deadlines, for governments to hand over the information. By then global stocks had been severely depleted and the member states, waking up to their predicament, were inidually contacting Chinese manufacturers, creating further competition in the market place.By Thursday 12 March, the scheme hadn’t secured a manufacturer. A notice was posted to the EU’s contract database of the failure. It would take two weeks to find one. The first delivery of masks under the scheme was on 8 June.The commission had to take the initiative as it became apparent that the joint procurement scheme was proving ineffective. Emergency legislation was rushed through to allow the commission to build a central stockpile through a scheme called RescEU.While member states would be responsible for procuring the supplies, the commission would manage their distribution and cover most of the costs. Hundreds of thousands of masks have been distributed so far to the pandemic hotspots. And looking to the future, Lenarčič believes this is the model to follow as leaders come together in Brussels on Friday to discuss their seven-year budget and plans for a one-off recovery fund.“In the latest commission budget proposal the funding for health goes from €400m to €9bn,” he said. “The whole logic is give the commission the means to support member states more. Because when Italy asked for help, nobody could give help. We also couldn’t help Italy.” The commission wants to buy equipment for the stockpile rather than rely on the generosity of member states. It wants to expand the type of equipment to cover potential chemical, biological or nuclear crises. “I see one very clear lesson,” Lenarčič said. “There is a wish of an overwhelming majority of the European public to have more Europe on issues like this.”Ricciardi agrees. He also believes the ECDC should be a decision-making body not just advisory at times of crisis, and that the commission has to be given its head when coordination is vital. “The member states must learn that we need to prepare for this new normality – this will only be the first of a series of events,” he said. “We will have it in the future. The patterns of behaviour, trade and tourism, are changing around the world. And if we don’t realise this we are going to be seriously disappointed.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cdce01305b747cdfc7651ef39140bb42cfa0aec3/0_0_5643_3762/master/5643.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a89c76a728b53ace177c82eda1135093 700w","title":"coronavirus live news update covid 19 cases latest updates india lockdown","story":"Restrictions imposed on Indian city of Bangalore and state of Bihar Venezuela’s capital Caracas to go into a strict lockdown on Wednesday Face masks mandatory in France Follow the latest updatesAFP is reporting on Tokyo being on its highest coronavirus alert level after a rise in new cases - particularly in younger people, in nightlife areas and also in workplaces and in families - as experts said the rising infections were a clear “red flag”.However, the move to a “red” alert does not mean the city will ask businesses to close or events to be postponed. Even during a national state of emergency in April, there was no “lockdown” in Japan of the type seen in Europe.“The experts just told us that the situation of infections is at the fourth level of the four-level system, which means ‘the infections seem to be spreading,’” Governor Yuriko Koike said during a meeting on the virus.Authorities say many of the new cases come from night-life entertainment districts in the capital and those infected appear to be people in their 20s and 30s, who are less likely to become seriously ill with the coronavirus.As of today, there were only seven people requiring intensive care for coronavirus and authorities have insisted that the medical system is in better shape than at the height of the previous wave in April.And despite the latest outbreak, the situation in Japan remains considerably less serious than in many other comparable countries in terms of population.Japan has had just over 22,500 cases and close to 1,000 deaths since the disease was first detected in the country. No one has died of coronavirus in Tokyo for three weeks.AP are also reporting on how virus restrictions in Australia are being reimposed, shutting businesses and curbing people’s social lives as communities try to curb a disease resurgence before it spins out of control.Residents of Melbourne, Australia’s second-largest city, were warned today to comply with lockdown regulations or face tougher restrictions. Melbourne’s 5 million people and part of the city’s semi-rural surrounds are a week into a new, six-week lockdown to contain a new outbreak there.“The time for warnings, the time for cutting people slack is over,” Victoria state Premier Daniel Andrews said. “Where we are is in a very serious and deadly position.”Victoria reported 238 new cases, which authorities say may indicate a stabilizing trend underway in Melbourne’s outbreak.AP are reporting the bitter-sweet news that Florida surpassed its daily record for coronavirus deaths yesterday at the same moment that researchers announced that the first vaccine tested in the US had worked to boost patients’ immune systems.Florida’s 132 additional deaths topped a state mark set just last week. The figure probably includes deaths from last weekend that had not been previously reported.The new deaths raised the state’s seven-day average to 81 per day, more than double the figure of two weeks ago and now the second-highest in the United States behind Texas.The worrying figures were released just hours before the news about the experimental vaccine, developed by the National Institutes of Health and Moderna Inc.“No matter how you slice this, this is good news,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, the U.S. government’s top infectious disease expert, told The Associated Press.Key final testing of the vaccine will start around July 27, tracking 30,000 people to prove if the shots really work in preventing infection. Tuesday’s announcement focused on findings since March in 45 volunteers.There are conflicting theories about what is driving the outbreak.“We tried to give states guidance on how to reopen safely. ...If you look critically, few states actually followed that guidance,” Dr Robert Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Tuesday in a livestream interview with the editor of the Journal of the American Medical Association.Redfield said people in many states did not adopt social distancing and other measures because they hadn’t previously experienced an outbreak. But he went on to say, without explanation, that he didn’t believe the way those states handled reopening was necessarily behind the explosive rise in virus cases. He offered a theory that infected travellers from elsewhere in the country might have brought the virus with them around Memorial Day.The Mighty Amelia Hill reporting for duty!

Nurses did not wear face masks or stay two metres apart. Staff at the London hospital say they are baffled as to why the training session was allowed to go ahead, given that most medical training in the NHS is now done online to avoid people gathering.The Bank of Japan stayed hopeful about a future recovery but said the outlook was shrouded by possible future waves of the virus, which made calculations difficult.“Japan’s economy is likely to improve gradually from the second half of this year with economic activity resuming, but the pace is expected to be only moderate while the impact of the novel coronavirus remains worldwide,” the BoJ said in a statement.But it also stressed that “the outlook... is extremely unclear” with its assumptions involving “high uncertainties”.As always, we welcome tips, feedback, questions and news from.

Due to declining mortality and cancelled funeral ceremonies, half a dozen Norwegian undertakers, according to a public registry, have turned to the state for help after the initial success of Norway’s handling of Covid-19 left them struggling to make ends meet.On 12 March, Norway’s Prime Minister Erna Solberg announced what she dubbed “the strongest and most intrusive measures” the country had seen in peacetime.Those included the closure of schools, bars and many public spaces, a ban on sports and cultural events and a curb on foreign travel.Since then nearly all of the measures have been lifted and the virus has been mostly contained, in stark contrast to neighbouring Sweden which is still seeing community spread.Overwhelmed and ill-equipped medical staff in Egypt are being threatened for speaking out about poor working conditions during the Covid-19 pandemic, with increasing numbers detained by a domestic security agency.Doctors recounted threats delivered via WhatsApp, official letters or in person. They said hospital managers and government officials told them failing to attend shifts, posting on social media or voicing objections would result in complaints to the National Security Agency, Egypt’s primary internal security body, which rights groups say has arrested multiple healthcare workers:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f8ef8771d704bcada862904664df8501847e82e/0_0_1335_801/master/1335.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=227ac5f420b32dbae7c8172587057313","title":"a platform for the unheard the brand the zine and what it all means","story":"For the young creatives involved, deciding to apply to be part of a project to create a zine in collaboration with  Labs was easy. But why did Levi’s want to get involved?“Your Voice. Your Way is a celebration of imagination and identity,” says Yasmin Sinfield, brand marketing manager for Levi’s. But why does a brand best known for its denim care about amplifying unheard voices?“We believe we have a responsibility to support erse voices and make a stand against injustice – not just at this pivotal moment in history, but consistently,” she says.“As a brand Levi’s has a strong heritage of amplifying marginalised voices, and this zine has been in development for over a year. We’re committed to giving unheard voices a platform.”Levi’s, says Yasmin, has four core values: integrity, courage, empathy and originality. They serve as a reminder for the company to focus on what matters and to keep having important conversations. But what does that actually mean? And how does amplifying young voices contribute to those important conversations?“We’re doing our best to champion erse voices from the younger generation,” says Yasmin. This campaign wasn’t created to serve a financial purpose, but as a means to connect with, and rouse the voices of, this generation. Over the years, Levi’s has demonstrated its commitment to investing a portion of its annual earnings into communities. Take the Levi’s Music Project, for example, which connected global artists such as Alicia Keys and Skepta to young people to help them “champion their voice through music”.Levi’s also helped young LGBTQ+ photographers raise their voices, partnering with LGBTQ+ museum Queer Britain in celebration of Pride 2019 in the UK. The collaboration kicked off with a curated photography exhibition in London’s Covent Garden called Chosen Family. Levi’s truly believes that this zine is vital and authentic. From the company’s beginnings in 1853, it set out to enable people to express their iniduality. Now, Levi’s wants to work with us to empower our generation.Being courageous is about far more than building your own confidence. By raising your voice, you could inspire countless others. In this zine, Levi’s provides a platform for young voices because, says Yasmin: “Small changes spun together can create something much bigger that makes a real difference.”This zine isn’t the first Your Voice. Your Way project. Last year, the focus was on musicians from the Levi’s Music Project who had all faced barriers to achieving their dreams, but had transformed their lives by having courage in their own convictions.Musicians can make themselves heard when they perform, but there are so many people who don’t have a platform. “In a world where it seems like everyone’s talking over each other, it can be hard for young people to use their voices in their own way, because they don’t know where or how to do so,” says Yasmin.Levi’s thinks brands can provide a place to start, to platform emerging creatives and commit to listening to young voices. The partnership between Levi’s and  Labs has enabled us to set up and support a network of talented young creatives, bringing us together with mentors who will continue to encourage us.If you invented blue jeans, you have a good idea of what it means to be original. Levi’s had a practical purpose: its jeans were first created in 1873 to satisfy a need from workers who needed durable trousers those jeans evolved into one of the world’s most iconic fashion items. Now, our needs are more nuanced than durable workwear. Levi’s hopes Your Voice. Your Way will provide a “blank canvas for self expression”.When they told us we could create this zine our way, they meant it. We’ve had support but, ultimately, we called the shots. By giving us the opportunity to choose what stories to cover, we’ve had real creative freedom. We took the challenge to share our inidualism."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4304385.1594740926!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"home schooled leaving cert students feel abandoned by predicted grades scheme","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tKinga Szalaj: not eligible for predicted grades because she repeated at home for financial reasons Kinga Szalaj sat her Leaving Cert last year.While she was happy with her results, she did not have enough points for her dream course – medicine.The 19 year old opted to repeat the exams this year, choosing to educate herself at home for financial reasons. However, she now fears the year has gone to waste as she will be deemed ineligible for the predicted grade system introduced as a result of exams being cancelled amid the Covid-19 pandemic.“From the guidelines, I am not eligible for calculated grades. I’m not going to get any predicted grades probably for any of my subjects at this point,” Ms Szalaj said. “I’m extremely disheartened. I worked extremely hard this year and it doesn’t matter. It feels like I wasted a year.”Kinga watched video lessons online for four subjects she felt she needed assistance with, while the other three were completely self-taught. She decided to repeat in this manner because there was no dedicated repeat programme in the schools near her, and she could not afford private tuition.She said the way the system had changed was “penalising people like me” and this meant she would most likely have to give up her dream of studying medicine.“I probably won’t be able to go to college this year at all. If I do, I will have to use the points from last year for courses that I don’t really want. That was the entire reason why I repeated the Leaving Cert,” she said.“The only option that they’re giving people like me is to take another year out. That would be two years in total, and they’re not giving us any option. I really don’t understand why they’re throwing us under the bus.”She is not the only young person in this predicament.Related to tutorsElijah Thomas Burke, who was home-schooled by family members, is also ineligible for calculated grades because he is related to his tutors.Section 3 of the calculated grades guide issued by the Department of Education states that “in order to uphold the integrity of the process, it will not be possible, under any circumstances, to accept an estimated mark from a teacher or tutor who is closely related to the student”.Elijah said the situation has made him feel “worthless” since he could not progress to college at the same time as his school-going peers.“It’s quite frustrating. My plans have been completely thrown into disarray. People in the school system, they can move on with their lives and I can’t. I’ve worked hard, I’ve won achievements and now I don’t have a right to predicted grades,” he said.“I don’t think it’s acceptable. I’ve a constitutional right to education at home and I should have a right to go to university at the same time as everybody else.”While the criteria are clear, the two students have gone through the process of applying to the Department of Education for calculated grades.‘Serious injustice’The department said there were 920 out-of-school learners whose applications for calculated grades were currently being processed to determine their eligibility.Donnchadh Ó Laoghaire, Sinn Féin TD for Cork South-Central, has raised the issue with Minister for Education Norma Foley.He is calling for a “bespoke solution” for the people in this situation, which he described as a “serious injustice”.“These students deserve some form of opportunity,” he said. “Obviously, it’s not possible to run the Leaving Cert just for this small category, but I think there should be some sort of bespoke solution that allows the universities or the examinations commission to evaluate the ability of these students and to be able to offer them a grade on that basis.”The spokesman added that despite “every effort” being made, there would be a “small number of cases” where there was “no credible evidence” to support a calculated grade in a particular subject.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Analysis confirms Covid-19 lockdown translated to short-term emissions reductions\u0026lsquoI intend to make substantial progress\u0026rsquo on securing our habitats, says Malcolm Noonan"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"A beefed-up, independent National Parks and Wildlife Service would be just the ticketMichael Viney: Wild grasses have loved the mood swings of our climate this yearAnother Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needsThe list of causes of damage is long, making it hard to know where to startFew, if any, of Ireland\u0026rsquos mammals have evolved the ability to eat venomous creatures"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: Barry WhyteNewstalk RadioPA Serious concerns raised at a meeting of the National Public Health Emergency Team could endanger plans to reopen the remainder of the State’s pubs on Monday. It is understood concerns were raised at the emergency team by multiple participants regarding the current trends in infection rates in the country, as well as uncertainty over how the virus will behave. There is significant concern among the team over how these trends could interact with an increase in congregated settings reopening. It is thought that some recent clusters of the virus have been linked to congregated settings already permitted to be open under earlier relaxations of restrictions. Travel restrictionsThe Government will now consider these matters at a key Cabinet meeting scheduled for Wednesday evening at which moving to the next phase of reopening the economy will be discussed. There are also ongoing concerns on the emergency team over the incidence of the virus linked to travel, which will play into the Government’s upcoming decisions on travel restrictions. It comes as the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform confirmed that more than 300,000 public servants will have to take leave – including unpaid leave – to self-isolate if they go out of the country on non-essential business under new guidelines for the public sector.Public servantsThe guidelines, which will be published on Wednesday by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, state that when there is an intention to undertake non-essential travel overseas, “all employees must make provision by way of an annual leave or unpaid leave application for the additional period of self-isolation”.The rules will effectively rule out any foreign holidays planned by hundreds of thousands of public servants. There is also a requirement that employees advise their employer of travel abroad, which the department guidance states “is necessary for the protection of public health”.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4304537.1594761569!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus worrying trend of symptomatic people refusing covid 19 tests","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPatients are presenting with symptoms, such as cough, shortness of breath, sore throat or fever, but insisting it could not be coronavirus. Photograph: Mark FelixAFP Increasing numbers of people with symptoms of coronavirus are refusing to get tested for the condition, GPs have said.Dr Nick Flynn, a senior partner in the MyCorkGP practices group, said he was seeing a “worrying trend” of people presenting with symptoms, then refusing referrals for Covid-19 tests. “In the last two to three weeks I’ve had at least one patient a day, or two or three, who refused to go for testing,” he said. Earlier this week, the State’s acting chief medical officer Dr Ronan Glynn warned that “a significant portion” of people identified as close contacts of confirmed cases “are not coming forward for testing”.On Tuesday, he urged people with symptoms “to assume it is Covid-19 in the first instance, until a GP or test tells you otherwise”.GP recommendationDuring the height of the pandemic a very small number would refuse a recommendation from their GP to get tested for the virus, Dr Flynn said. Patients were presenting with symptoms, such as cough, shortness of breath, sore throat or fever, but insisting it could not be coronavirus, he said. Many with “recurring conditions” such as a regular cough or lung diseases like COPD, were convinced the symptoms were a “flare-up” of their pre-existing health issues, Dr Flynn said. “We can’t say that anymore, we have to rule out Covid for all respiratory symptoms until at least this time next year,” he said. Failing to do so could lead to a second peak of the virus at the same time the winter flu season hit, he said. The public had “lost the enthusiasm” for fighting the virus and many were “at the end of their tether”, he said. “They don’t get that this is a marathon, not a sprint . . . These people are then by definition not self-isolating,” he said. ‘Hung up’Dr Flynn said in one case a patient presented with a sore throat, but after being told they would need to be tested for Covid-19 backtracked and said they no longer had a sore throat. On two other occasions, people hung up the phone when they were advised they needed to be referred for tests, he said. During the peak of the pandemic when the number of new cases was increasing by several hundred each day it was easier to “win” apprehensive patients over, Dr Flynn said. There was a large testing backlog in March as many GP practices were inundated with calls from patients seeking referrals for testing. “We’re at the other side of that slope now,” he said. The test involves a swab taken of the back of the throat and nasal passage, which is “an uncomfortable procedure”, the Cork GP said. The resistance was not from a “fear of the test”, but patients’ “strongly held belief” that their symptoms were related to other pre-existing conditions, he said.Dr Tuathail said there had been a “distinct change” in the public mindset, with people increasingly reluctant to get tested, he said. As people returned to work they did not want to self-isolate while awaiting test results, he said. The public health messaging around the importance of testing had “waned” in recent weeks, he said.

While “it’s been a long time since I’ve seen anyone from Texas in west Donegal”, constituents were raising fears with him in relation to people travelling from Covid-19 hotspots, he said.The county often functions as a holiday bolthole for many in the nationalist community in Northern Ireland on the weekend of the 12th of July, but Mr Doherty said nervousness about that traffic was less pronounced than earlier in the year. While tour buses, a common sight on rural roads in the summer months, have all but disappeared, Mr Doherty said large numbers of camper vans were being seen parked up on beaches. “The concern is that they don’t have facilities, so they’re parking anywhere and everywhere.”Foreign touristsMichael Healy-Rae, the Kerry TD, said there were concerns over foreign tourists among his constituents. “We are seeing people coming in, and I know for a fact they’re not coming in through our airports in the south, they’re coming in from Northern Ireland as well.”He criticised the State’s approach to limiting the movements of overseas visitors. “People are really worried…just fearful about what is happening at present we have rules about wearing a mask and, at the same time, someone can come in from an infected region and there’s no checks and balances only that you have to give your name and address.”He said he would ask any person coming into the State to observe the guidelines. “Kerry is the most welcoming part of the whole world and once we have this situation under control, we will go back to what we’ve been doing for 100 years and that is welcoming people into our county.”Ms Connolly believes the emphasis now should be on next year’s season. “People are saying to me we make our living from tourism, but this season is gone anyway. Let’s struggle through it and keep our people safe, and open up and look forward to next year.”It’s a view shared by her constituency colleague, Fianna Fáil’s Éamon Ó Cuív. While he said he was not receiving a huge number of representations from constituents on the matter, his view was that “this season is largely lost to foreign tourism and we’re probably better discouraging people from coming and also making sure that if they do come, they quarantine, taking the short-term pain for the long-term gain.”Tour operatorsTour operators, meanwhile, say they are booking very little business amid the Covid-19 restrictions. A spokeswoman for the Irish Tour Operators Association said many members had coaches sitting in garages since last August. “With a 14-day isolation, the tour operators have no business on the books until spring of next year.“As long as there is a 14-day self-isolation period, there’s no business being done.” The spokeswoman said public health was the paramount concern, but that operators “would love to see a clarification on what’s the exit plan” from the current guidelines.

File photograph: CollinsMr Martin removed Mr Cowen after he refused to make a second public statement about a drink driving ban imposed on him four years ago after he was found to be over the legal limit while driving home from the All-Ireland final from Dublin to Offaly. In a development to the 10-day controversy arising from the 2016 incident, Mr Martin rose to his feet shortly before 9pm to announce he had sacked Mr Cowen. It is a little over a fortnight since he was appointed to the position. While Mr Cowen had made an unreserved apology in the Dáil last week, new disclosures had come to light since then over the Garda report of the incident that suggested Mr Cowen might have tried to avoid a Garda checkpoint.It is virtually unprecedented for a Minister to be dismissed just two weeks after a government is formed. The only shorter ministerial career was that of newly appointed minister for defence Jim McDaid who handed back his portfolio on the same day he was nominated by then taoiseach Charlie Haughey in 1991 over a photo of him with an IRA Maze prison escaper.In a lengthy statement issued on Tuesday night on Twitter, Mr Cowen criticised the Taoiseach’s decision to sack him on Tuesday evening, only hours after publicly backing him in the Dáil. Mr Cowen said the decision had “undermined and potentially prejudiced my entitlement to fair process”, referring to an investigation into how details of the case were leaked to the media. Mr Cowen said on Tuesday night the Taoiseach informed him by phone that he was being sacked adding that he was “both surprised and disappointed” . “Ten days ago and this afternoon the Taoiseach believed my failure of 2016 didn’t warrant my removal from office but he now appears to have changed his mind based on a Pulse report I gave him this morning,” Mr Cowen said.“Unfortunately the decision of the Taoiseach to remove me from office, when he supported me this afternoon in the Dáil, has undermined and potentially prejudiced my entitlement to fair process.”Mr Cowen said he had “sought an explanation – not as a government minister but as a citizen – as to how details relating to the incident were leaked to the media. “The authorities have agreed to investigate the matter. One point warrants emphasis: at no time did I attempt to evade the Gardaí. Had I done so, the charges brought against me would, quite correctly, have been of a different tenor to those with which I was charged. I am responsible for the offence with which I was convicted 4 years ago not for an inaccurate Garda entry on Pulse about that event.”It is understood that earlier Mr Cowen had been asked to resign by Mr Martin but that he had refused the request.Mr Martin told the Dáil that following discussions with Mr Cowen on Monday night and again on Tuesday morning “and having seen the Garda report this morning, it was my view that it raised additional issues requiring further explanation and clarification. I made this view clear to him and gave him space today to consider the matter further.“However, he has decided that he is not prepared to address this allegation publicly and will not make any further statement or answer any questions on the issue in this House.”“This decision has created a situation where legitimate doubts and additional questions are being raised, and Government colleagues are expected to address these. This is simply untenable.“It is my view that Minister Cowen had an obligation to come before the House. It is also my view that this issue is damaging to the ongoing work of Government.”Barry Cowen’s full statement:“The Taoiseach informed me this evening by phone that he was removing me from office as Minister for Agriculture.

Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillMinister for Agriculture Barry Cowen was dramatically\u0026nbspsacked by the Taoiseach on Tuesday night after refusing to make a second public statement about a drink driving ban imposed on him four years ago.In unprecedented development to the 10-day controversy arising from the 2016 incident, Mr Martin rose to his feet shortly before 9pm to announce he had sacked Mr Cowen. It is a little over a fortnight since he was appointed to the position.While Mr Cowen had made an unreserved apology in the Dáil last week, new disclosures had come to light since then over the Garda report of the incident which suggested Mr Cowen might have tried to avoid a Garda checkpoint.Mr Martin seemed to give Mr Cowen strong backing in the Dáil on Tuesday afternoon in the Dáil when questioned by Opposition leaders. However, less than seven hours later, he announced that he was sacking the Offaly TD from the Ministry, a little over a fortnight after he was appointed to Cabinet.Mr Martin had been shown the Garda report of the incident for the first time on Tuesday morning. He had discussed it with Mr Cowen and told him he would need to made additional public clarification. However, the Minister refused to do so.Sometime after Leaders’ Questions, Mr Martin informed the other coalition leaders, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar and Green Party leader Eamon Ryan that he has asked Mr Cowen to consider his position.\u0026nbspBoth leaders are said to have agreed with the Taoiseach’s judgement and said they would support the decision.The Taoiseach will appoint a new senior Minister on Wednesday.In his short statement to the Dáil, he said it was his view that “it raised additional issues requiring further explanation and clarification. I made this view clear to him and gave him space today to consider the matter further.“However, he has decided that he is not prepared to address this allegation publicly and will not make any further statement or answer any questions on the issue in this House.“This decision has created a situation where legitimate doubts and additional questions are being raised, and Government colleagues are expected to address these. This is simply untenable.”Mr Cowen has said he was “surprised and disappointed” by the decision. In a lengthy statement issued this evening on Twitter, Mr Cowen criticised the Taoiseach’s decision to sack him on Tuesday evening, only hours after publicly backing him in the Dáil.“Ten days ago and this afternoon the Taoiseach believed my failure of 2016 didn’t warrant my removal from office but he now appears to have changed his mind based on a Pulse report I gave him this morning.“Unfortunately the decision of the Taoiseach to remove me from office, when he supported me this afternoon in the Dáil, has undermined and potentially prejudiced my entitlement to fair process.”Mr Martin will appoint a new Minister on Wednesday. He told the Dáil that President Michael D Higgins had on his advice “terminated the appointment of Deputy Barry Cowen as a member of the Government”.It is virtually unprecedented for a Minister to be dismissed just two weeks after a government is formed. The only shorter ministerial career was that of newly appointed minister for defence Jim McDaid who handed back his portfolio on the same day he was nominated by then taoiseach Charlie Haughey in 1991 over a photo of him with an IRA Maze prison escaper.The Taoiseach said it was a “sad day for Barry, his family, and for me. Over the course of the last 10 days, he has been the subject of significant criticism and condemnation for a Road Traffic Offence that took place in 2016.”He said “he has been completely clear and unambiguous regarding his drink-driving offence. He gave a personal statement to this House on July 7th, in which he talked about the stupidity of his actions, he accepted what he did was absolutely wrong, and he apologised to all members.“I accepted that his remorse was genuine and I accepted his apology.”He said that when he was first confronted with the allegations, Mr Cowen “was immediately clear and emphatic about his drink-driving offence and understood the need to acknowledge this. However, he was equally clear and emphatic that one detail of the allegation he was being presented with was completely untrue. Namely that he sought to evade gardaí at the time.”He added: “We have had extensive discussions on this point last evening and again this morning, when he shared with me for the first time the actual Garda record under dispute.“Following these discussions and having seen the Garda report this morning, it was my view that it raised additional issues requiring further explanation and clarification. I made this view clear to him and gave him space today to consider the matter further.“However, he has decided that he is not prepared to address this allegation publicly and will not make any further statement or answer any questions on the issue in this House.“This decision has created a situation where legitimate doubts and additional questions are being raised, and Government colleagues are expected to address these. This is simply untenable.“It is my view that Minister Cowen had an obligation to come before the House. It is also my view that this issue is damaging to the ongoing work of Government.”Mr Martin said: “I am conscious that there are important and legitimate legal processes under way, where Deputy Cowen is questioning the accuracy of the Garda record and seeking to establish how his personal information became public. I have sought to respect these processes and I would ask that colleagues do the same. This decision I have made is without prejudice to those proceedings.“The challenges facing this Government are unprecedented in scale and the Irish people require nothing less than our full and unided attention.”The Taoiseach concluded: “It is in everyone’s interest that the Government not be distracted in any way from doing what is necessary to protect public health and our efforts to rebuild our society and our economy.It is understood that earlier Mr Cowen had been asked to resign by Mr Martin but that he had refused the request.Barry Cowen\u0027s statement in full: “The Taoiseach informed me this evening by phone that he was removing me from office as Minister for Agriculture.

Photograph: PA WireMore than £700 million is to be spent on building new infrastructure, hiring staff and developing technology to ensure Britain’s border systems are fully operational when the UK leaves the EU at the end of the year.UK cabinet office minister Michael Gove said the major investment would ensure traders and the border industry are able to “manage the changes and seize the opportunities” when the transition period ends in December.The £705 million package includes £235 million for staffing and IT systems, and £470 million for port and inland infrastructure to ensure compliance with new customs procedures and controls.New border infrastructure will be built inland where there is no space at ports, while ports will get one-off financial support to ensure the right infrastructure is in place.Of the £235 million for staffing and IT systems:The funding relates only to the implementation of the mainland Britain-EU border, and the UK government is expected to publish specific guidance and measures for Northern Ireland in the coming weeks.Mr Gove said: “We are taking back control of our borders, and leaving the single market and the customs union at the end of this year bringing both changes and significant opportunities for which we all need to prepare.“That is why we are announcing this major package of investment today.“With or without further agreement with the EU, this £705 million will ensure that the necessary infrastructure, tech and border personnel are in place so that our traders and the border industry are able to manage the changes and seize the opportunities as we lay the foundations for the world’s most effective and secure border.”The transition period is set to end at the end of December 2020, when the UK will leave the single market and customs union.The funding package comes ahead of a public information campaign in which guidance will be given to traders and hauliers explaining what they may need to do to prepare for the end of the transition period.Meanwhile, the Sunday  reported that Chancellor Rishi Sunak is poised to introduce tax cuts and an overhaul of planning laws in up to 10 new freeports.Mr Sunak is said to be planning to open bidding for towns, cities and regions to become freeports – where UK taxes and tariffs will not apply – in his autumn Budget.The paper said the ports will be “fully operational” within 18 months of the UK leaving the customs union and single market at the end of this year. – PAStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4192672!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"us democratic","story":"The process to choose the Democratic nominee to take on Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election is well under way.States across the country are in the process of choosing\u0026nbsptheir preferred candidate, either through a primary contest or a caucus. A primary is a traditional election where eligible voters select their candidate privately through a ballot system. A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates. All but one – Sanders – said they were opposed to this. The issue may become a headache for the Democratic Party as the primary process progresses."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4304442.1594757284!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"world population set to shrink after 2064 claims new study","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA boy selling produce in a market in Ibafo, Nigeria. The population of sub-Saharan Africa is forecast in a new study  to triple to 3.07 billion by 2100. Photograph: Olukayode JaiyeolaNurPhoto via Getty ImagesThe world’s population is likely to peak in 2064 at about 9.7 billion, and then decline to about 8.8 billion by 2100 – two billion lower than some previous estimates, according to a major study published in the LancetImprovements in access to modern contraception and education for girls and women are generating widespread, sustained declines in fertility, it concludes. Researchers from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington used novel methods for forecasting mortality, fertility and migration.By 2100, they conclude, 183 of 195 countries will have total fertility rates (TFR) – the average number of children a woman delivers over her lifetime – below the replacement level of 2.1 births per woman. The forecasts contrast with projections of “continuing global growth” by the UN population ision and highlight huge challenges to economic growth from a shrinking workforce.It predicts Ireland’s population (4.9 million in 2019) will peak at 5.8 million in 2057. The Republic’s population is predicted to decline to 4.82 million by 2100, assuming adoption of UN sustainable development goals on educational attainment and “meeting contraceptive need”.With an estimated 2.37 billion iniduals globally over 65 in 2100, compared with 1.7 billion under 20, the study underlines “the need for liberal immigration policies in countries with significantly declining working age populations”. The study was part funded by the Bill \u0026amp Melinda Gates Foundation. “Continued global population growth through the century is no longer the most likely trajectory for the world’s population,” said IHME director Dr Christopher Murray, who led the research. Lancet editor-in-chief Dr Richard Horton said the research “offers a vision for radical shifts in geopolitical power, challenges myths about immigration, and underlines the importance of protecting and strengthening the sexual and reproductive rights of women”. The 21st century would see a revolution in the story of human civilisation, he predicted. “Africa and the Arab World will shape our future, while Europe and Asia will recede in their influence. By the end of the century, the world will be multipolar, with India, Nigeria, China and the US the dominant powers.” The global TFR is predicted to steadily decline, from 2.37 in 2017 to 1.66 in 2100, with rates falling to about 1.2 in Italy and Spain. Ireland’s TFR is predicted to reduce to 1.57 by 2100 it was 1.84 in 2017.Much of the decline is predicted in high-fertility countries, notably in sub-Saharan Africa where rates are expected to fall below replacement level for the first time. Nevertheless, its population is forecast to triple to 3.07 billion in 2100, as death rates decline and an increasing number of women enter reproductive age.‘Fewer workers’North Africa and the Middle East is the only other region predicted to have a larger population in 2100 (978 million) than in 2017 (600 million).Many of the fastest-shrinking populations will be in Asia and central and eastern Europe. Populations are expected to more than halve in 23 countries and territories, including Japan (from 128 million people in 2017 to 60 million in 2100), Spain (46 to 23 million), Italy (61 to 31 million), Portugal (11 to 5 million) and South Korea (53 to 27 million). China’s population is predicted to reduce from 1.4 billion in 2017 to 732 million. “While population decline is potentially good news for reducing carbon emissions and stress on food systems, with more old people and fewer young people, economic challenges will arise as societies struggle to grow with fewer workers and taxpayers, and countries’ abilities to generate the wealth needed to fund social support and healthcare for the elderly are reduced,” noted first author Prof Stein Emil Vollset. Sub-Saharan Africa is likely to become an increasingly powerful continent as its population rises. Nigeria is projected to be the only country among the world’s 10 most populated nations to see its working-age population grow over the century, supporting rapid economic growth.“For high-income countries with below-replacement fertility rates, the best solutions for sustaining current population levels, economic growth, and geopolitical security are open immigration policies and social policies supportive of families having their desired number of children,” Dr Murray said. In a commentary, Prof Ibrahim Abubakar of University College London said the findings indicate the need for “a fundamental rethink of global politics”. “Nations would need to cooperate at levels that have eluded us to date to strategically support and fund the development of excess skilled human capital in countries that are a source of migrants,” he believed. An equitable change in global migration policy would need the voice of rich and poor countries, he said. “The projected changes in the sizes of national economies and the consequent change in military power might force these discussions.”“The choice we face is whether we improve health and wealth by allowing planned population movement or if we end up with an underclass of imported labour and unstable societies,” he said. With challenges such as climate change and greater global migration, “the distribution of working-age populations will be crucial to whether humanity prospers or withers”, Prof Abubakar added.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"britains tough new stance against china smoke mirrors","story":"Making the right decision about Huawei’s involvement in Britain’s planned 5G infrastructure was never going to be easy – or cheap. Freedom doesn’t come free nor does technological sovereignty come without a hefty price tag.The Government’s reversal of its previous indulgence of the Chinese tech giant as the key supplier of infrastructure for 5G – as it has been for 4G already – comes at a time when political but, more importantly, public opinion is on board for a tougher line with Beijing.Alarming issues from China’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak to its crackdown in Hong Kong and its aggressive assertiveness towards neighbours like India has woken the British public up to the downsides of China’s extraordinary recent growth in wealth and power.  No-one can accuse Whitehall of showing much foresight about China’s challenge. Boris Johnson’s government inherited two decades of complacent assumptions that China would be just another welcome foreign investor. Some critics argue Britain has been bounced by its major ally into dumping Huawei for fear of incurring secondary US sanctions on its products. There is truth in that. But Washington has also brought to the surface issues of cyber-security and potential data-mining and sabotage which too many in the establishment here preferred to overlook.  Deng Xiaoping once said China should rise unnoticed by its rivals. Maybe the disengagement from Huawei and other Chinese suppliers of key infrastructure should have been done without fanfare. But time for subtlety has passed.Long-term lack of strategic planning has been the hallmark of British governments from Blair via Cameron to today. Think about the looming energy crunch as Britain tries to move to a carbon-neutral future. China’s involvement in nuclear plants was a key part of that. What if Beijing retaliates by pulling the plug on its share of three planned new reactor complexes?Let’s hope the Government has thought through the challenges facing it even having made the right decision. A strategy for handling China over decades cannot be improvised on the model of how Britain has dealt with Covid.  There is a military side to this rivalry. Britain is deploying its newest aircraft carrier, the £3bn HMS Queen Elizabeth, in the Far East to take part in US drills. Big Lizzie is, nonetheless, another product of Whitehall’s short-sightedness, since her delayed entry into service comes a decade after Ark Royal was decommissioned on the eve of intervention in Libya. Even now the carrier lacks all her kit and the escort flotilla needed to protect it from Chinese carrier-killer missiles.Maybe our allies in the Asia-Pacific region will step up to provide the necessary vessels. That would be a good harbinger for a globalised alliance of democracies involving NATO with Australia, Japan and even India. But at the moment it is an improvisation. Sending Queen Elizabeth to the Far East without a plausible escort has ominous echoes of Churchill’s dispatch of the Prince of Wales there in 1941 without air cover.Governments have to react to events, but they need to fit their reaction into a strategic vision and integrate that with their allies’ thinking. Disentangling our infrastructure from China while asserting our commitment to allies in her region is going to challenge our leaders at least as much as tackling Covid. Setting a steady course needs to follow a good start. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"cities countries returning lockdown","story":"As the world continues to grapple with the coronavirus pandemic, some people are being forced back under restrictive measures.Nations that previously thought they had the virus under control are now suffering from a rise in cases. Here, we take a look at the locations back under lockdown and how they have chosen different approaches to keeping their populations safe.Key restrictions: A second, six-week lockdown has been introduced in the Australian state of Victoria, home to the city of Melbourne. Citizens will only be allowed to leave home for essential reasons, such as giving care or where working from home is not possible.Restaurants, bars and cafes will have to close but hairdressers may stay open. The border between Victoria and New South Wales has been closed and police say they are setting up  “ring of steel” around the city to prevent movement in and out.Key restrictions: The entire state of California rolled back the easing of its virus restrictions after a spike in cases through the month of June. Although lockdown 2.0 will not be as restrictive as the first iteration, all bars and indoor dining spots have been closed, as well as zoos and museums.In the 30 counties that are on Governor Gavin Newsom’s watchlist, including most of Southern California, gyms, churches, nail salons and other non-essential businesses will also be shuttered. Schools in Los Angeles and San Diego will begin the new academic year online.Key restrictions: Texas Governor Greg Abbott began encouraging people to stay at home in early July following a surge in cases in late June.Masks were made mandatory in counties where over 20 cases were reported and bars were closed, although all other shops and services remain open for now. Restaurants can still serve indoors but capacity has been reduced to 50 per cent. Outdoor gatherings are now limited to 100 people, a reduction from 500.Key restrictions: 250,000 residents in the city of Navotas, one of the 16 cities that constitutes politan Manila, will return to lockdown after just six weeks of freedom. Shops and businesses may stay open, but outdoor exercise will be banned and restaurants will be limited to takeaway services.The mayor of Navotas has requested soldiers be deployed to enforce the lockdown and arrest violators. Navotas is the prime fishing port of Manila and is one of the poorest districts in the capital.Key restrictions: Despite being widely acknowledged as a global success when it comes to curbing the advance of the novel coronavirus, Hong Kong is reintroducing some lockdown restrictions after a small spike in cases. Hong Kong Disneyland will close, cinemas will shut their doors and gyms will put up the shutters.Schools have closed a week early for the summer holidays and gatherings will be limited to four people, down from 50.  Restaurants will no longer offer dine-in services for the first time since the outbreak, with takeaways available after 6pm.Key restrictions: The Moroccan government has ordered a localised lockdown of the northern city of Tangier, cutting off all public transport both in and out. Cafes and public spaces have been closed and masks are mandatory. Tangier is suffering with 20 per cent of all cases in Morocco.As such, citizens of the city may now only leave home for essential reasons, such as to buy food or medicine, and will need special authorisation to travel within the city. Tangier is the second Moroccan city to be placed under a repeat lockdown, after the southern city of Safi was restricted from July 5.Key restrictions: India’s IT hub will enter an initial seven-day lockdown after joining the ranks of New Delhi and Mumbai as the epicentres of India’s outbreak. All transport will be banned except in emergency situations and all non-essential shops will have to close their doors.Places of worship and government offices will close but firms operating in the IT sector that provide back-office services for global corporations may keep their offices open, although they can only run at 50 per cent staffing capacity.Key restrictions: A weekend lockdown will come in to force in India’s most populous state, Uttar Pradesh. For at least the rest of July, the entire state will lockdown all weekend, from 10pm Friday to 5am Monday.All shops and markets will be forced to close, although banks and construction sites will be allowed to stay open, provided social distancing guidelines are enforced. Key restrictions: The northern state of Bihar will enter into a fresh 15-day lockdown to help flatten the curve and reduce the spread of coronavirus. Mass gatherings will stop and public transport will no longer be running.Restaurants may remain open, but only to provide takeaway services, while schools and places of worship will remain shut. After two weeks, the lockdown will be re-evaluated.Key restrictions: Israel has closed all bars, clubs, gyms  and public swimming pools as cases begin to rise for a second time.

A combination of the Trump administration’s decision in May to deny Huawei access to vital electronic components, together with the mounting unease among Conservative backbench MPs over Beijing’s increasingly autocratic conduct, meant that Huawei’s fate had been sealed long before Oliver Dowden, the Digital Secretary, made his Commons statement today.Boris Johnson’s decision, in January, to allow Huawei limited access to Britain’s 5G system was always going to be a risky call – not least because of the fierce opposition it drew from the Trump administration, which responded by making dark threats about ending intelligence cooperation. Now the Prime Minister’s hand has been forced, after British security chiefs conceded that, as a result of US sanctions against China, they could no longer guarantee being able to prevent Beijing from using Huawei’s involvement for its own nefarious purposes. Add to this China’s brutal assault on Hong Kong’s freedoms, which only hardened the resistance of Tory MPs to the deal, and it was clear that the Government’s position on Huawei was no longer tenable.So while ministers deserve credit for – eventually – making the right decision, yesterday’s ban on Huawei’s continued involvement in the 5G network, which is to end by 2027, nevertheless raises a number of important challenges, not least of which will be how Beijing responds.The Chinese ambassador to Britain has already warned about the possibility of a trade war with Beijing, and it has even been suggested that the communist regime might retaliate by launching a massive cyberattack.Scott Morrison, the Australian prime minister, has personally briefed Mr Johnson on a cyberattack targeted at the Australian government last month, affecting the country’s industry, political organisations and essential service providers. Canberra believes Beijing orchestrated the attack in response to Australia’s calls for an international inquiry into China\u0027s handling of the coronavirus pandemic.The Huawei decision undoubtedly signals the end of the so-called “golden era” in Sino-British relations that was once heralded by David Cameron. It is no coincidence that the original Huawei 5G deal was signed during Mr Cameron’s premiership and, in future, far greater scrutiny must be applied to any commercial undertaking with Beijing that has the potential to impinge on our national security.This does not mean that there should be a complete cessation of trade with China. Only that if any future arrangement involves dealing with Chinese firms that are designated “high-risk vendors”, it would be prudent to make a proper assessment of the possible security implications before proceeding.As part of the Government’s reset of its ties with China, consideration must also be given to building a new network of global alliances capable of managing the challenges presented by China’s more aggressive approach.Ending our reliance on Huawei should help to revitalise the transatlantic relationship with the US, which increasingly regards Beijing as a hostile regime, as well as resolving any doubts about Britain’s continued participation in the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing alliance with the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. This had been open to question so long as concerns persisted that Huawei might exploit its involvement in Britain to access the alliance’s communications network.Whether Britain can rely on a similar level of support from its European allies is another matter, particularly after the disgraceful way the EU has sought to exclude Britain from involvement in its new Galileo satellite communications system, despite the fact that London has provided the project with significant funding and technical expertise.Post-Brexit, it is imperative for Britain to build new alliances, which is why the proposal to base one of the Royal Navy’s Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carriers permanently in the Asia-Pacific region – with Japan the most likely base – is worthy of serious consideration. The plan, which would see Britain, with US backing, head a “Rainbow” coalition of countries, including Japan, South Korea and Australia, would provide a useful bulwark against further acts of Chinese expansionism in the region.For the plan to work, though, the Government would need to make a significant investment in Britain’s Armed Forces. Given the number of available combat ships, if the Navy were to go ahead with this deployment, with the carrier being supported by a minimum of two \u2028Type 45 destroyers and two Type 23 frigates, it would not have enough warships left to fulfil its equally important obligations in the North Atlantic, Mediterranean and the Gulf.Even so, the concept is not entirely without merit, and would send a clear signal that the days when Britain could look forward to a golden era in its dealings with Beijing are long gone.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"no mary beard not elitist boris speak latin","story":"Professor Mary Beard has been repeating her view that, when Boris Johnson talks Latin, it makes her want to vomit. The reason seems to be that it makes classics look “elitist” and does the subject, which she clearly loves and does great work for, no favours at all. But surely the real question is: does it make the Great British public vomit?Pauline and June run a small home cleaning service in Newcastle on Tyne. Some time ago I had ordered some wine for an old friend who could not get out, and they said they would deliver it to him.When they came round to pick it up, we started chatting, and the subject of Boris arose. When I revealed that I knew him slightly, they were thrilled, and Pauline proudly whipped out her mobile phone, to show me children shouting “We love Boris, hoorah for Boris”, and such like.This backed up rather persuasively the same conversations that I had had with Davie the postman and other locals in shops, the barber’s and elsewhere. They had no notion that Boris was out to demonstrate to all and sundry just how superior he was by quoting Latin at them and keeping them in their place.Which raises an important question: exactly how often does Boris quote Latin as he talks de haut en bas to the cowering, forelock-touching masses? He certainly uses classical quotations when addressing the alumni of the École normale Superiéure at EU meetings in Paris. After all, it’s their language – French is just a dialect of Latin – and they lap it up, surprised that an Anglo-Saxon knows anything about it at all.But, Professor Beard, is Boris really quoting Latin to hoi polloi every day of the week? What is the evidence? Or is any Latin too much Latin for the “ignorant”? That, to me, sounds like an elitist speaking.This raises another accusation against Boris: that he is not really a classicist. He’s forgotten it all. Indeed, one academic promised to read all of Boris’s books to demonstrate how wrong he always got the ancient world, which tells you more about the academic than about Boris.The point is that Boris adores the subject, and the subject needs classicists outside academe, like Boris, in the wider world, promulgating (as Professor Beard does) their enthusiasm for different languages and cultures. The charity Classics for All has benefitted hugely from his passionate support and that of hundreds of non-academics like him, which has enabled it to get classics – the languages, history and culture – into nearly 1,000 state schools, primary and secondary (and counting), half of them in very deprived areas, across the UK.Is this elitist? Of course not: merely democratic, open to all schools that want it.

The regional R rate in May can be seen on this graph below, from May 14. Beyond the diminished rate of infection, the research found young adults aged 18 to 24 were more likely to test positive than other age groups.People of Asian ethnicity were also more likely to test positive than those of white ethnicity, while people working in care homes were at greater risk of being infected during lockdown than the general population.The report also showed anyone who had recent contact with a known Covid-19 case was 24 times more likely to test positive than those with no such contact, emphasising the importance of contact tracing in keeping the spread of the virus under control.Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the study was crucial to the country\u0027s ongoing battle with coronavirus.This ambitious testing programme will help us better understand the spread of the virus to date, predict how it may spread in the future and inform our response to the pandemic, he said.It shows the impact our national lockdown efforts have had and demonstrates that we have taken the right actions at the right time.As a country we have made great strides towards beating this virus but we mustn\u0027t take our foot off the pedal, and such studies will be vital as we continue to fight this virus.The study, which has been upscaled and repeated for June, will now undergo peer review before a final report is published.Plans are underway for a second large-scale study, which will use antibody tests to determine how much of the general public has been infected with Covid-19 in the past.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 15th july 2020","story":"Comet Neowise over Stonehenge, Wiltshire.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.ITV commentator Clive Tyldesley says he is “upset, annoyed and baffled” by the decision to replace him as the broadcaster’s senior football commentator.The channel announced on Tuesday that Sam Matterface will step up to replace Tyldesley as their chief commentator, and that although the veteran broadcaster would remain a part of their football plans, he would no longer be the first choice for their England games and coverage of World Cup and European Championship fixtures.The 65-year-old first worked with ITV early in his broadcast career before switching to the BBC in the early 1990s, but retired in 1996 before going on to become their main voice on football, having covered some of the defining European and international moments in the sport’s recent history.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut having first been told of the decision three weeks ago, Tydlesley addressed the decision for the first time in an emotional video on social media, in which he said that he has struggled to understand the reasons for the decision given that he has not been told any.“If you haven’t seen the announcement I am being replaced as ITV’s senior football commentator,” Tyldesley said in a video posted to his Twitter page.Clive Tyldesley replaced as ITV’s chief commentator after 22 yearsTyldesley calls for commentary training after study finds racial biasClive Tyldesley on racism, Twitter vultures and finding the right word“Quite a few people have been in touch with me asking me to react, to comment. I’m not sure that would be a very good idea at the moment.“I was told about three weeks ago so I have had some time to get my head around the decision, but I haven’t got my head around it. To be clear, this is ITV’s decision, not mine, and I’m upset, annoyed, baffled.”The announcement came three days after what should have been the Euro 2020 final, which Tyldesley would almost certainly have commentated on, and he confirmed that there are no plans for retirement or complications with ill health on his side that have have played a factor in the move.“I would have been interested with commentating the Euro 2020 final for them less than 48 horus ago but now I won’t be commentating on any of the big England games in the coming year and I’m going to miss them. I love this job, and it’s gone,” he added.“Why? I don’t know. I do not know exactly why this decision has been taken. Already I’ve had the producer of a broadcaster that I am working on asking me if I have got any health issues. No, I have got no health issues. Asking me if it is something that I have done. No, there’s nothing.“I gather that one or two sites are reporting that I’ve been sacked, well I guess I have from one job but I’ve done nothing wrong. I’m the same broadcaster, the same person that I’ve always been. Like me or hate me and you’re entitled to do either. Like everybody else in football I am a matter of opinion and I totally get that, and I totally respect ITV’s right to change their opinion of me. ITV have been really good for me and yes I’ll carry on as their No 2 commentator.“But let me make it quite clear: I have not stepped down. I have been moved, moved aside. I’ve not even thought about winding down towards retirement or anything like that.”ITV have not given their reasons for demoting Tyldesley for Matterface, with director of ITV Sport Niall Sloane only saying “on behalf of ITV Sport, I would like to thank Clive for his superb work leading our commentary on some of the biggest occasions in world football throughout his outstanding career with us.”Sloane added that ITV are “very glad he will continue with is and look forward to working with him on many more occasions in the future”, but while Tyldesley was keen to stress that he remains in a privileged position given the number of people currently without employment, the pain of losing his his role hurts nonetheless.“Now listen, there are thousands of people in this country facing up to job losses and disappointment that is far more serious than this,” he said. “I am a lucky boy, I love my work and I’ve got plenty on, so I’m not making a statement or anything like that. This is not a grave matter of state, I’m just trying to explain and tell you that I’m really, really disappointed about this. I don’t know why I’m being replaced, I’m well, I’m able, I’m available and I’m just going to miss the England games so much, even more than I miss the Champions League games, and that’s all.”The latest football headlines direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.The largest study so far into the spread of coronavirus across England has found infection rates fell significantly in the month before lockdown restrictions were lifted.Initial findings have been published from the study, 120,000 volunteers took part.The Imperial College London research tracks the prevalence of the virus during May and will provide a baseline for continued studies into how the virus is spreading.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesScientists reported that rates of infection halved every eight to nine days during May, placing the overall reproduction rate at 0.57 – which is lower than previously reported. The report is yet to be peer-reviewed. Health secretary Matt Hancock welcomed the findings, saying: “This ambitious testing programme will help us better understand the spread of the virus to date, predict how it may spread in the future and inform our response to the pandemic.“It shows the impact our national lockdown efforts have had and demonstrates that we have taken the right actions at the right time.What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safely“As a country we have made great strides towards beating this virus but we mustn’t take our foot off the pedal, and such studies will be vital as we continue to fight this virus.”The report provides an insight into who was infected with the virus between 1 May and 1 June, comparing geography, age, sex, ethnicity, key worker status and symptoms.Asian participants were more likely to test positive than white participants, to which the DHSC said: “It is possible that higher infection rates have contributed towards the higher death rates observed in this ethnic group.”Health and care home workers were the most likely to be infected with Covid-19 during lockdown, with care home staff found to be 7.7 times more likely to test positive than non-key workers.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It puts the UK firmly on the side of the US, which has already imposed sanctions on the company.But aside from the geopolitics of the issue, the decision could mean significant changes for anyone who uses a phone in the UK.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHuawei itself has described the decision as bad news for anyone in the UK with a mobile phone. But the government has said that it was necessary to protect exactly those citizens, and that it will work to minimise disruption.The ban means that buying new Huawei 5G equipment will be banned at the end of the year, and that all Huawei equipment must be removed from UK 5G networks by the end of 2027. The existing ban on Huawei kit from the most sensitive core parts of the network is still in place.But for daily users, most obvious and probably significant change is that the work to strip Huawei out of the 5G network will delay the rollout of that technology by two to three years, as well as costing billions of pounds.The introduction of 5G has been widely hailed as a potentially transformative technology, since it allows for much faster connections, not only for phones but for any other device that can talk to the internet. That extra speed for the moment remains largely in the future: very few phones are currently able to use 5G networks, and the rollout of devices as well as the network is likely to be slow, meaning that the delay will probably hit fewer people than it would if it affected 4G networks, for example.(Huawei does provide equipment used in those existing 4G networks, but that is not covered by the new ban, despite complaints by some MPs such as Iain Duncan Smith that it should be. As such, those far more popular networks which are used by most modern smartphones should continue working as normal.)Boris Johnson orders Huawei removal from 5G network in major U-turnWith any delay to the infrastructure, users may not be able to get the full value out of their 5G phones, some of which are already out, but many more of which will arrive over the coming months. Some of the more revolutionary applications for 5G – which have included the suggestion that small devices could be given reliable internet connections to make them smart, and the ability to conduct even surgery remotely – might also be held back if the technology is not there.As such, the Huawei ban is less likely to affect any technology you currently have, or rely on. Instead, the main difference it will make is when certain new products arrive or become useful in the future – or whether they will arrive at all.Apart from the delay in its introduction, there is likely to be no obvious change as a result of the move away from Huawei equipment. The products that power the infrastructure underlying mobile data connections are largely invisible to users, and the new network is expected to function in the same way after the change is complete.Other companies are theoretically able to offer the same coverage and functions, and to take over from Huawei. Some have already committed to work in Huawei\u0027s stead, with Arun Bansal, Ericsson\u0027s president of Europe and Latin America, saying that it stands ready to work with the UK operators to meet their timetable, with no disruption to customers.The US\u0027s actions, which led to the ban in the UK, also affect Huawei equipment that is used in fibre broadband networks, such as those that provide home WiFi. But the government indicated that it would only advise that operators transition away from using new Huawei equipment, rather than requiring old equipment to be quickly changed, as with the 5G network.Taking that approach will help to support the connections that the public relies on, the government said, while still address the security concerns about Huawei equipment.The government said that those compromises were required to ensure that the network was safe, even if it also meant that it would not be available as soon as expected.“5G will be transformative for our country, but only if we have confidence in the security and resilience of the infrastructure it is built upon, said Oliver Dowden, the digital secretary.Created with Sketch.Europe replicated in Huawei City, China Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.18 Karl Theodor Bridge in Heidelberg, Germany28 Replica Karl Theodor Bridge in Huawei City, China48 Replica Heidelberg in Huawei City, China68 Replica Cesky Krumlov in Huawei City, China88 Replica Heidelberg in Huawei City, China18 Karl Theodor Bridge in Heidelberg, Germany28 Replica Karl Theodor Bridge in Huawei City, China48 Replica Heidelberg in Huawei City, China68 Replica Cesky Krumlov in Huawei City, China88 Replica Heidelberg in Huawei City, China“Following US sanctions against Huawei and updated technical advice from our cyber experts, the government has decided it is necessary to ban Huawei from our 5G networks. “No new kit is to be added from January 2021, and UK 5G networks will be Huawei free by the end of 2027. This decisive move provides the industry with the clarity and certainty it needs to get on with delivering 5G across the UK.The announcement only covers Huawei equipment used in the phone network\u0027s infrastructure, and not Huawei\u0027s phones themselves. They remain on sale in the UK – though because of a ban on Google providing products to the company, they are unable to use Android on new devices, and so the phones may not be as fully featured as they would be without the ongoing fallout.Huawei attacked the decision, but committed to continue to support our customers.This disappointing decision is bad news for anyone in the UK with a mobile phone. It threatens to move Britain into the digital slow lane, push up bills and deepen the digital ide. Instead of ‘levelling up’ the government is levelling down and we urge them to reconsider. We remain confident that the new US restrictions would not have affected the resilience or security of the products we supply to the UK, said Ed Brewster, a spokesperson for Huawei UK.Regrettably our future in the UK has become politicised, this is about US trade policy and not security. Over the past 20 years, Huawei has focused on building a better connected UK. As a responsible business, we will continue to support our customers as we have always done.We will conduct a detailed review of what today’s announcement means for our business here and will work with the UK government to explain how we can continue to contribute to a better connected Britain.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Several areas in England are experiencing a surge in new coronavirus cases, with places in the North West appearing most at risk to a second wave of infections similar to the one seen in Leicester.The latest figures from Public Health England reveal Bradford and neighbouring Kirklees in West Yorkshire have seen high numbers of daily confirmed cases in recent days.Higher infection rates in Leicester prompted the government to introduce a local lockdown just weeks after nationwide containment measures first began to ease.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFollowing Leicester’s lockdown last week, epidemiologist Professor Neil Ferguson warned that more localised lockdowns in the UK are “inevitable”.The former government adviser said that an estimated 8 per cent of the UK population has so far been infected, and that the pandemic is still in its “early stages”.Leicester remains the worst affected area in England in terms of cumulative case rate, with more than 1,000 people per 100,000 residents having been infected by Covid-19.Other areas to have experienced similarly high case rates include Ashford in Kent and Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria, however both places have seen new cases fall substantially since May.The rate of new coronavirus infections in Ashford began to flatten off in early June, according to data collected by PHE. By contrast, daily cases in Leicester appeared to accelerate at around the same time.A similar surge occurred in Kirklees, despite the curve initially appearing to flatten one month ago. The number of new daily cases consistently fell below 20 in the first week of June, before spiking to more than 40 on 11 June.In Bradford, the number of new cases fell significantly in late May, before rising again throughout June. Unlike Kirklees, however, the rate of new infections appears to be once again slowing.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.A teenager has donated more than 3,000 face coverings to The Independent’s Help The Hungry campaign to protect volunteers delivering food to the most vulnerable people.Business student James Eid, 19, has given thousands of protective coverings to our appeal partner The Felix Project, which is delivering up to 30 tonnes of food every day to those hit hardest by the pandemic.Mr Eid, who lives in Radlett, was inspired to make face coverings because his grandmother, Anna Ross, 68, has Behcet’s disease.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe condition, which causes blood vessel inflammation and has various side effects, also lowers the immune system meaning she is more vulnerable to Covid-19.Mr Eid struggled to obtain low-cost face coverings to protect his grandmother and so, spotting a gap in the market, decided to import specialist production machines and make them himself.How to support our campaignFamilies face ‘summer of hardship’, food charities warnWhat it’s like to volunteer on the frontline during a pandemicUsing money donated by his father, who is joint CEO of food company Signature Flatbreads, the Lancaster University student imported a production line of four machines, naming his new company Signature Masks.The entrepreneur has since opened a factory in Dunstable, Bedfordshire, with production beginning in earnest at the end of the month. To start with, he will make 36,000 face coverings a week, but the size and scope of the factory means he will be able to scale up production and make up to 500 million coverings annually.The coverings are disposable and made up of three-ply non-woven plastic material – meaning they are water resistant and can be worn for up to 24 hours. He will sell the coverings from his website – they will cost £3.79 for 10, or £2.99 if consumers subscribe for weekly deliveries.On donating thousands to The Felix Project, the teenager said: “I want to support those who are helping others in this crisis.” Mark Curtin, of The Felix Project, said: “These Signature Masks will help protect volunteers and staff in our food redistribution warehouses.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Our Help The Hungry appeal today passed the £7m mark, enabling our appeal partner, The Felix Project, to deliver the equivalent of 4.3 million meals to hungry schoolchildren and vulnerable Londoners in the 12 weeks since lockdown began.The milestone was reached thanks to more significant corporate donations, including an additional £100,000 from online grocer Ocado, taking its total donation to £390,000, and a further £90,000 from banking group Citi boosting their aggregate give to £250,000.It comes as the charity Feeding Britain warns that 3 million children face the prospect of hunger during the upcoming school holidays. Of these, it cautions, only 1 million are eligible for the government’s free school meal summer holiday voucher of £15 a week, with the remaining 2 million living with parents who narrowly do not qualify but cannot always afford food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHelen Barnard, of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, confirmed that the summer voucher scheme – agreed by the prime minister after being forced into a U-turn by footballer Marcus Rashford – only covers a minority of children in poverty. She said: “Soaring numbers of families are being pulled under and having to rely on food banks to get through the current crisis, even with the voucher scheme in place.”The harsh reality is that an astounding 66 per cent of food-insecure families – amounting to almost 200,000 children in London – cannot access government help and are forced to rely on food parcels from charities such as The Felix Project.Food and 10,000 face coverings donated to charities and vulnerableWhich star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day At the start of lockdown, The Felix Project faced an existential crisis with a total collapse of its fundraising.

Our pledge is given added urgency by the release of worrying economic data, including that the number of people out of work and claiming benefits jumped 23 per cent to 2.8 million last month.”Jo West, of Ocado Retail, said most of its donation had been raised from Ocado and their customers via their “you give, we give” scheme. She added: “We’re extremely grateful to our customers for their generosity which enables groups like The Felix Project to bring food to people in desperate need.” James Murray, chair of the Bridgepoint Charitable Trust, which donated £50,000, said: “We are delighted to contribute to the work of The Felix Project in feeding vulnerable communities.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.The government’s new messaging on face coverings has been criticised for appearing to promote a type of mask which fails to stop the wearer from spreading coronavirus to others.After months dismissing the evidence in favour of face coverings, health secretary Matt Hancock announced on Tuesday that they are to become mandatory in English shops and supermarkets as of 24 July.Shortly afterwards, the official Downing Street Twitter account posted a new video, which explained the changing “guidance”, concluding: “By wearing a face covering, you are protecting others and slowing the spread of the virus.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHowever, it was quickly pointed out that the face masks used in the graphic – which appeared to feature a valve – would be unlikely to offer protection to anyone but the person wearing it.Masks with valves are typically used in construction work and are unsuitable for medical settings because, while they filter the air consumed by the wearer, they offer no protection to those around them.What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safelyThe apparent error was spotted by Julia Simons, the Doctors’ Association UK’s medical student representative, who was deployed to the front line of the pandemic during her final year of studies.“How can the government video not get this right?” she tweeted in response to Downing Street’s video. “Continuous dither, delay and disaster.”Ms Simons added: “Please do wear a cloth face covering. Don’t wear a facemask with a valve. The valves means your face mask is no use for protecting others.”The video remained on Twitter nine hours later, having been viewed nearly 140,000 times and also shared by the Department for Health and Social Care\u0027s account.In the US, such masks have already been banned in parts of Florida and California.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Therefore, this type of mask is not recommended for Covid-19.”The San Francisco Department of Public Health tweeted in May that masks with valves “are NOT safe and may actually propel your germs further”.Responding to the government’s video, another Twitter user wrote: “The valve is a one way feature to let the wearer breathe out and not breathe in toxic or irritating fibres, dust etc.“The purpose of a mask in the pandemic is to stop you breathing out your virus, if you have it, protecting others.

I trust people’s good sense.”The cabinet office minister also revealed the government was significantly boosting the manufacture of face coverings, with factories “in Wales and Burnley”.Vaccine doses for all ‘in first half of next year’ if trials succeedThe government has been accused of spreading confusion on the issue, with only 36 per cent of Britons wearing coverings in public places – far short of the numbers in France (78 per cent) and Italy (83 per cent).Some scientists had welcomed the prime minister’s hints at being ‘stricter”, when he said: “We are looking at ways of making sure that people really do have face coverings in shops, for instance, where there is a risk of transmission.”Professor Venki Ramakrishnan, president of The Royal Society, said everyone’s mouth and nose should be covered in public, to reduce the risk of a second wave of coronavirus.The World Health Organisation said last week that there is “emerging evidence” that infections could be spread through particles travelling through the air.Speaking on the BBC’s The Andrew Marr Show, Mr Gove said “If tough measures are required, as we have seen in Leicester ... then tough measures will be taken.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Michael Gove is under fire for failing to wear a face covering while shopping – two days after telling the public it is “good sense” to do so.On Sunday, the cabinet office minister told TV viewers: “It is basic good manners, courtesy and consideration to wear a face mask if, for example, you are in a shop.”Yet, on Tuesday, he was photographed in a branch of Pret a Manger without a mask, even as his cabinet colleague Liz Truss’s face was covered up as she bought her breakfast.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesA professor of public health said Mr Gove’s behaviour was “very destructive” to what was already “very confused” government messaging.“When people see politicians adding to the confusion, they throw their hands up in the air and say ‘Why should I bother?’ Gabriel Scally told The Independent.And Munira Wilson, the Liberal Democrat health spokesperson, said: “Michael Gove\u0027s refusal to wear a mask today will simply lead to more accusations that it is one rule for the government, and one for everyone else.”The controversy came after Mr Gove was left embarrassed when Boris Johnson overruled him and announced mask-wearing in shops in England will be compulsory – from 24 July.Ministers were already facing criticism for delaying the crackdown by 10 days, after days of confusion over the policy.Face coverings in public places where people cannot safely socially distance was already the norm in more than 120 countries, including many in Europe, he said.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Michael Gove, it seems, is capable of neither.”People who fail to comply with the new requirement will risk a fine of up to £100, although the Police Federation warned that would be “nigh-on impossible” to enforce.George Eustice, the environment secretary, defended the 24 July timetable as necessary “for retailers to put in place measures to encourage people to do this, or potentially even to have some masks themselves if people haven\u0027t got one”.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The status quo has failed Wales. Under-investment and unfair funding forms the crux of this unequal union of broken promises — delivered by the Tories at Westminster and defended by Labour through their support for the stagnant status-quo.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Unions are demanding changes to the law to allow workers to bring claims for unpaid wages, sick pay and holiday pay not only from their immediate employer but also from any contractor higher up the supply chain.The demand comes amid controversy over working conditions in Leicester garment factories supplying big-name fashion brands like Boohoo.Recent reports have suggested staff in Leicester “sweatshops” are paid as little as £4 an hour - well below the minimum wage - and there are fears that workers’ reluctance to stay home when ill may have contributed to the spike in coronavirus infections in the Midlands city.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe TUC today said the situation had highlighted a “huge gap in the law” which allowed major firms to “wash their hands” of responsibility over the behaviour of sub-contractors.General secretary Frances O’Grady called on the government to extend joint liability laws to make “parent employers” responsible for stopping exploitation of workers in their supply chains, as they are in Australia.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Fields of echium and borage in full flower near the town of Thaxted in EssexPeople ride a rollercoaster in a theme park next to Southend pier.

Paying adequate sick pay is the bare minimum required from companies if they are to stop the spread of Covid-19 in their workplaces.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

As well as two Michelin-starred pubs – The Hand \u0026amp Flowers and The Coach – he also opened a traditional butcher and founded Pub in the Park, the biggest food and music festival tour in the UK.During lockdown, staff from Kerridge’s businesses were volunteering to help a new charity called Meals from Marlow which delivers free food to NHS staff, key workers and people in need. This started small in early April and with support from over 1,000 donors, it recently ended up serving its 75,000th meal.From 4 July, both The Hand \u0026amp Flowers and The Coach have reopened fully in Marlow to welcome back hungry diners.The team have prepared a comprehensive Covid-19 policy document with a number of measures to protect the health and safety of guests and staff. Measures include daily staff temperature checks, hands-free antibacterial gel dispensers, one-way systems, private sole-use of bathrooms, cleaning touchpoints and toilets every 20 minutes, and even sanitising deliveries.Kerridge is also working with a company that provides protection against a wide range of pathogens, including Covid-19, using a sanitising treatment applied through fogging machines to provide an even coat on all surfaces, followed by manual application to hot spots, such as door handles.Form a bubble with a one-adult householdVisit your local salon, restaurant or bar, following UK Government guidelinesMeet in private gardens with up to six peopleTravel on public transport without a face covering or maskShare a car with people outside of your householdFor more information, visit gov.ukcoronavirus“Welcoming, safeguarding and taking care of others is at the very heart of what we do, says Kerridge. The last few months have been such a challenging time and we have been eagerly waiting to establish a little normality back into everyone’s lives, and get back to what we do best – providing great hospitality and food.”Kerridge\u0027s pubs have also been altered to make sure that spacing is as per UK Government guidelines. Partitions have been placed to ensure people have privacy and are able to enjoy their experience in the same way as before.Following the success of Meals from Marlow, it has now become a permanent charity and is set to provide 30,000+ meals a year to local people. “I know the people of Marlow are a very generous group but I’m astonished by the speed and the level of kindness, says Kerridge. Thank you, Marlow, I’m proud of you.”Colin Steele and Jade Windsor, pub landlords of the Falcon InnColin Steele and Jade Windsor, pictured below, took over the Falcon Inn five months before lockdown, restoring the pub as a community hub at the heart of the village of Fawley, Hampshire. After coronavirus threw a ner in the works, they were eager to reopen last weekend. “We have social distancing, hand sanitisers and a booking system, so our locals get a guaranteed spot,” says Windsor.The couple made the most of the lockdown by revamping the pub, painting the interiors and outside fencing, and putting up a pergola in the garden for some weather protection. “Because of lockdown we had the time to give the garden the love and attention it really needed,” says Steele. “Painting the fence outside has meant that we\u0027ve been able to interact with the village as they walk past. We\u0027ve been trying to bring that community spirit back.” To keep business going, they opened their car park for plant sales and teamed up with local company HMS Spirits to serve takeaway cocktails on Friday nights, which they will continue on weekends throughout the summer. “It kept us doing what we love, says Windsor, and keeping in contact with our customers.” They also recruited a chef with the goal of making back some of the lost income from closure and the now-reduced capacity that allows for distancing. Where they once accommodated 150 inside, now they can host 40. The team have ramped up hygiene measures: doors are wiped every half hour screens at the bar and face shields protect staff. Additional outdoor seating means that everyone is seated, and a new app will enable customers to order food from their tables. “We\u0027re a family-run business and everyone just wants us to succeed,” says Steele.Windsor adds: “I\u0027m sure we will come across a few issues, it’s something that no one\u0027s ever had to deal with before. I want my pub back the way it was more than anyone, but we\u0027ve all got to deal with it together.”Sarah Bentley, owner of The Cutting Room unisex salon As a small village salon that’s been open for 16 years, it’s little wonder that The Cutting Room’s loyal clientele had been keenly anticipating its reopening after temporarily closing back in March.A tight-knit team with great customer relationships, Bentley and her employees were excited to get back to a sense of normality. After a meeting last week, they felt reassured about the safety precautions put in place for their return. “It was a bit of relief coming back from staff training and just seeing everybody’s face light up and looking forward to being back,” she says. “We’ve had Zoom meetings discussing all the guidelines.”The salon may have been closed, but plenty was going on in the background to ensure that the premises and the team were as prepared as possible for a safe reopening.For example, they worked hard to keep customers informed about changes to their haircutting experience: as well as the salon now being appointment-only, clients have been informed that they are not able to enter the premises before their appointment, as well being asked to wear a face covering.“Because we are such a small salon, we have screens up between all our sections,” Bentley explains, adding that their booking and payment system has been made completely contactless.Though refreshments or magazines can no longer be provided, The Cutting Room has set up its outdoor space for clients to sit in a socially-distanced manner.The Cutting Room\u0027s kit used has also changed: “We’ve got disposable gowns, towels – everybody’s got all their completely own equipment it’s all labelled in their name – their own trollies, Bentley adds.Ultimately, safety is The Cutting Room’s number-one priority. “It’s there to keep us and the clients and my staff safe – and if I felt that they weren’t safe, I would shut the salon tomorrow,” Bentley says. “Everybody’s health comes first.Keeping you safe: a selection of guidelines for UK businesses All businesses are required to be Covid-19-secure in order to help protect their staff and customers. Here are some of the guidelines that salons, pubs and restaurants have been provided with:All businesses will have conducted a risk assessmentThorough and enhanced cleaning facilities will be available for staff and customersBookings will be limited to ensure social distancing and risk mitigationCustomers will be provided with guidance prior to their visitWorkers in continuous close contact to clients, such as hairdressers, will wear visors to promote safetyStaff will be split into teams or shift groups where possible to limit contactIndoor and outdoor seating will be reconfigured to maintain social distancing guidelinesStaggering entry times and introducing one-way systems throughout venuesContact between kitchen staff and front of house staff will be minimisedTo find out more about business guidelines, visit gov.ukguidanceworking-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

But when coronavirus hit in March, Ireland’s biggest sportswear brand had to break the habit of a lifetime and sack its entire 750-strong workforce at its Strabane factory due to the lockdown.With sports events cancelled or postponed, orders from teams and retailers vanished.However, the company was thrown a surprise lifeline when, a day after announcing the layoffs, the Western Health and Social Care Trust approached O’Neills on a Friday about fulfilling a shortage of scrubs to safeguard frontline NHS workers.Factory staff spent that weekend making sample scrubs. By the Monday, O’Neills had secured an order for 10,000 sets of maroon tops and trousers for GPs at a coronavirus testing centre at Altnagelvin Area Hospital, Londonderry.As a result, the company rehired 150 workers immediately. It has since brought back more than 400 staff overall as orders from other health trusts across Northern Ireland grew, with the remaining 350 employees being furloughed.The company now produces some 10,000 sets of scrubs a week. Managing director Kieran Kennedy, a veteran of 41 years at the business, says employees have been supportive of the switch from making sporting goods.“We are a close-knit community in Strabane. Many employees know people who work in the NHS and they want to give back,” he explains. “We could either feel sorry for ourselves or be productive and take a bite at the cherry. Without the NHS orders, we would have had no sales and no cash flow. The scrubs kept the show on the road.”Kennedy says the move outside the company’s traditional business area has been relatively easy. For instance, O’Neills had stockpiled a six-month supply of yarn – the raw material for the scrubs and other clothing – from China to hedge against Brexit uncertainty. The company knits the scrubs at its Strabane factory, then dyes and coats them with anti-viral substances at its production plant in Dublin.Workers on the factory floors are social distancing, as well as wearing face masks, sanitising their hands and having their temperature checked.Kennedy is upbeat on the company’s future prospects, noting that big sporting fixtures are returning, which should boost sales and enable him to rehire more workers. But for the foreseeable future, Kennedy plans to continue producing protective gear – an unexpected new revenue stream.   The gift shop owner donating Happy Bags to localsWhen Sarah Lloyd Williams, pictured above, had to temporarily close her quirky little gift shop in Frome on 22 March, she had no idea what she was going to do with the time ahead.At first, Lloyd Williams relished the opportunity to spend every day with her dog, Chester, taking him with other dogs out for walks. However, by nature, she is a hands-on person and soon realised she needed to find something to fill her time other than dog walking and cleaning.She had found out that someone local to her had been having a hard time. “I knew this lady slightly and wondered if there was anything I could do to help, Lloyd Williams explains. I didn’t feel that I knew her enough to contact her offering assistance, so instead I decided to leave a little gift on her doorstep.” She called it a Happy Bag, containing a copy of The Happy Newspaper (a quarterly newspaper by Emily Coxhead containing nothing but good news), a chocolate bar, bath bomb and a little note.This good deed went down very well: the recipient messaged Lloyd Williams to ask if she could buy a Happy Bag for her friend. “I didn’t want any money, Lloyd Williams explains. This was something small that I could do with items that I already sell in Figgins, so I delivered a Happy Bag to her friend and it went from there.”She ended up delivering a number of bags in the local area and it led to doing a few other little things for people, such as picking up medicines, shopping and more dog walking.For Lloyd Williams, this became a lovely way to connect with people that she barely knew, or had never met before, and it made lockdown much easier to navigate: “Giving away some Happy Bags certainly made me feel much happier. It’s a tiny thing, but sometimes that’s all it takes to make someone’s day,” she says.Figgins has now reopened, with Lloyd Williams taking steps to make sure her shop is safer with a screen, hand sanitising stations, floor stickers and limiting the number of people in the shop at any one time. Lloyd Williams is also donating a Happy Bag every week to someone in the local community.At the start of lockdown, Andy Hibbert, above, transformed his car-sharing business.Launched in 2017, Car \u0026amp Away had enabled holidaymakers to rent out their cars from Gatwick and Bristol Airports while they were away, but when the coronavirus forced airports to close, business plummeted.The CEO from south west London quickly decided to use the business\u0027 existing assets to help key workers and launched a new service: Karshare.“We had this burgeoning desire for people to rent their car from home because it was sat there doing nothing,” Hibbert explains. “But then Covid came along. As a business we were stranded. We thought: this is ridiculous. We have all the systems in place to enable us to share cars. Why don\u0027t we launch the car-sharing concept where owners donate their cars to critical-care workers and people who are supporting the most vulnerable in our community?”At the peak of the pandemic, travelling by car minimised viral spread on public transport and limited key workers’ exposure, while making their journeys easier at a stressful time. Karshare encouraged members of the public in Bristol, Brighton, London, Manchester and Leeds to donate their cars for a week to NHS staff and volunteer organisations. The cars were then deep cleaned and matched to local key workers in need of transport.Insurance and road coverage were provided for free, and the owner received a full tank of petrol as a thank you.Impressively, 700 cars have since been donated – including to 31 London NHS trusts – with a total 19,000 days of use. Leasing company ALD donated 30 new cars in Bristol. “We were overwhelmed initially about the donations,” says Hibbert.One key worker who benefited was Michaela Morris, deputy chief operating officer at the NHS Nightingale Hospital London in Docklands. “She was put into a hotel and told she needs to be on call 247, so we quickly found her a car,” says Hibbert. “It’s remarkable that she has been able to continue that work because of the generosity of the public.”Karshare also helped a care worker who had only been able to reach a couple of vulnerable patients a day on his bicycle. When he was loaned a car he could reach up to 11 – and save more lives.While Karshare is now focusing efforts on making the business profitable again, it is also inviting donations to critical workers and will ask for contributions to cover the insurance. Karshare is also being extended to the wider community, allowing people to rent their cars from home.“There are financial pressures for people,” adds Hibbert, “yet they\u0027ve got an asset on their driveway that could really help.”The distillery that swapped gin for hand sanitiserIn the midst of a global pandemic, constrained by lockdown, a fledging gin brand was surrounded by alcohol with no bars open to supply. But reports of hand sanitiser shortages hit the headlines and gave the team an idea.Sean Roche launched Aintree Gin in December 2019. An organic, craft spirit, it takes its name from its home in Merseyside – a village renowned for its famous racecourse which hosts the historic Grand National.By spring, Roche and the team had introduced the gin to over 30 establishments around Liverpool. They were gearing up for the steeplechase, but lockdown put paid to their plans. “As soon as everything started to shut … all of our income went down to zero,” Roche says.Realising online sales would be key, the team started building a website – then they had a brainwave. “News reports started to regularly mention how shortages of… alcohol-based sanitiser were putting NHS and care workers at risk,” says Roche. “We knew that because we were already using pure alcohol to make our gin, we could change our production line to make sanitiser.”Their first batch was ready within weeks. Word got out and, soon after, they were inundated with requests from care homes, hospitals and more, Roche recalls.Volunteers were recruited and more than 600 litres were donated in six weeks. But as supplies ran low, and with no money coming in, the enterprise became financially unviable. “We had two choices,” says Roche. “Stop – or start selling something.”Opting for the latter, new containers were ordered and labels designed so the sanitiser could be sold online. They started offering a range of PPE products too, from face shields to masks. “This created a revenue stream that allowed us to continue,” adds Roche.A PPE pop-up and free hand sanitiser stations at an Asda store followed. “We donated more than we made in profit over the period,” Roche admits.Today, sales are going strong. As businesses look to reopen, many are turning to Aintree Gin for their sanitisation requirements – and also the brand’s primary product. They now aim to supply as many bars and restaurants as possible, and get into supermarkets as well.To read about more inspiring GREAT stories, visit greatbritaincampaigninspirationsWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The provincial agricultural department said in a statement that the dog meat trade had descended into “anarchy” in recent years, causing rabies and other diseases to spread from region to region.The department said in a statement that the “catching, buying, selling and slaughtering of dogs” would be punished “severely”, with maximum penalties including five years in prison and fines of up to 50 million riel (approximately £9,700).Dr Katherine Polak, head of Four Paws, said: “The historic decision by the Siem Reap government to ban the stealing, trading and killing of dogs is a huge milestone for animal welfare in Cambodia and is reflective of current sentiment among Khmer people.UN warns of ‘steady stream’ of infectious zoonotic diseases‘If we don’t buy, they don’t die’: Tackling the wildlife trade demandCan social media be weaponised against the illegal wildlife trade?Prince William backs report to ‘end the illegal wildlife trade’Yulin Dog Meat Festival: How did it start and will it get banned?“We hope that Siem Reap will serve as a model for the rest of the country to follow suit to protect the lives of millions of dogs.”The dog meat industry in Cambodia sees an estimated three million dogs slaughtered for consumption annually. Thousands of animals are transported from Siem Reap to different parts of the country each month, including to the capital, Phnom Penh.Tea Kimsoth, director of the provincial agriculture, forestry and fisheries department, told Reuters that demand for the meat was driven by foreigners, especially South Korean visitors to the country.“They like it, that’s why it led to restaurants serving it, so now we ban it,” he said, adding that the trade was “alarming”.The Cambodian province’s decision follows China recent ban on the sale of dog and cat meat. The animals were kept in poor conditions, making them vulnerable to disease that could be transmitted to humans, said activists.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They need our help.⚠️ Read our coronavirus live blog for the latest news  updatesWe can all play a part in saving our towns and cities.If we head out to eat, drink and shop, we can throw a leline to businesses on the edge.It’s our patriotic duty to get back to the pub.For years, town centres have struggled because it is hard for shops to compete with the online retail giants.The switch from old-style shopping to ordering online has sped up in lockdown.The Government’s massive programme of economic support has helped many businesses survive.A total of £.billion in grants has been paid to more than , firms, mainly in hospitality and retail.The Government is also paying the wages of .million people through the furlough scheme.I have heard from small businesses in my Chipping Barnet constituency in Greater London how vital this help has been in getting them through lockdown.But the only long-term way to save these businesses is for customers to start heading through their doors again.That is why I was one of the first MPs to call for the lockdown to be lted.Now that Prime Minister Boris Johnson has given us the freedom to go back to work and back into town, we need to use it.With so many still working from home, our city centres feel like ghost towns.Jobs are already going or under threat at many familiar big names, from Boots and Burger King to Pret and John Lewis.Taxi drivers, caterers, news vendors, cleaners, millions of livelihoods depend on bustl-ing offices and workplaces filled with people.The situation is very grave. Economists are predicting one of the worst global recessions since records began, with up to .million Brits potentially losing jobs.All the evidence indicates that prosperity is driven by successful cities.If tumbleweed continues to roll through London’s world-class tourist attractions,Manchester’s bars and clubs are half empty,Newcastle’s nightle remains muted, then pulling ourselves out of recession will be far harder.For the sake of all our great cities, we need office workers back at their desks.Of course, it is vital that we behave responsibly and respect social-distancing rules.Huge care has been taken to ensure the process of lting the lockdown is a cautious and gradual one, with some £million being spent to make the high street safe and ready to welcome people back.And I pay tribute to the massive efforts being made by businesses doing everything possible to make their premises Covid-secure to keep their workers and customers safe.I know their reluctance toto public transport. I see that every day as I commute to Westminster on near-empty Tube carriages.But the simple precautions of wearing a face covering and washing your hands thoroughly when you reach your destination can help keep you and others safe.Nothing in le comes without some risk, but the steady fall in Covid cases means that, for the vast majority of us, the risk of catching the virus is getting lower every day.So people should feel confident to go out to their workplace again, and they should also feel happy and secure about grabbing a bite to eat with friends in a cafe.This could be make or break for your city centre.Unless you come to the rescue by spending some money to support these local businesses, they could go under for ever.Saving our city and town centres isn’t just about jobs and the economy.They are the heart of community le.As an example, for many elderly people, popping out to the shops is a hugely important social contact, especiallythey do not have family living nearby.If our town centres become a row of empty shops and boarded-up pubs, that is a heartbreaking loss for our whole community.It would leave all of us more isolated from our neighbours.When the pandemic hit, this country came together in an incredible united effort to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives.Now we need to show that same determination when it comes to reviving the economy, saving jobs and supporting businesses in our villages, towns and cities.That means starting up the commute again and getting back to the office.It’s not every day that the Chancellor of the Exchequer says he will knock £ off our lunch bills.But that is what will happen during August.Soyou value your local High Street and want to see it thrive in the future, then head there and eat out to help out.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

You are a clever girl, Sue.”It’s a little bit patronising, admittedly and he’d be hauled through every kangaroo court in the country for saying that out loud now.But I’ll take Jim’s innocent version of television before I take ’s joyless, humourless woke wasteland all day long, thanks very much. It’s a happier place.INCIDENTALLY, Loose Women, Janet Street- Porter: “If I was an animal I’d be a terrapin.”What’s technically known as horse-s***.MEANWHILE, on episode three of Celebrity Snoop Dogs, a pug called Colin is snfing around a weight-training room as Channel ’s Kevin McCloud builds to the big reveal.“More eye-catching, though, is that plaque behind the microphone. Could it belong to ­someone who’s good at making people laugh “It’s Russell Kane!” No, it couldn’t.HOW television works .Someone a BBC continuity announcer described as “the wonderful Maxine Peake” starred in last week’s Talking Heads, a fortnight after sharing an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory about George Floyd’s death, with The Independent.Miriam Margolyes s to the Beeb shortly, with her Almost Australian travelogue, despite telling Channel ’s Last Leg she wanted the Prime Minister to die of coronavirus.But actor Laurence Fox is unemployable and considered a public pariah, by the industry, because he told Question Time that Britain was “the most tolerant, lovely country in Europe”.One rule for one, quite another for Corbynistas.The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “Asteroid  Audrey is named after which actress ”Marina: “Kim Basinger.”Tenable, Warwick Davis: “Name the ten largest countries in South America.” Devon: “Hungary.”Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “In  -year-old Judit Polgar became the youngest ­international grandmaster of which board game ”Helena: “Monopoly.”Ben Shephard: “Mayo is the Spanish word for which month of the year ”Rick: “March.”GOOD Morning Britain, Monday, Piers: “What about this  At my local Italian ­restaurant, on Saturday, after all this showing-each- other-more-kindness talk, there were  no-shows.”Then Piers turned up. Problem solved. So what about it HAVING failed to conquer Hollywood or overthrow international capitalism Russell Brand took on a slightly more manageable project, last week.A cameo in Neighbours where he literally bumped into Toadie, eating a muffin, at the Harold Bishop cafe.“You’re Russell Brand! What are you doing here in Erinsborough ”“Well, you know,” said Brand, “Get Him To The Greek, The Trews, socialism, Ed Miliband. It all went horribly wrong.“So it was either this or a Postcode Lottery advert, with Jeff Brazier.”Actually, he said no such thing.He made a funny, self-mocking speech about the irony of mobile phones being “emblems of interconnectivity, yet we’re more atomised, adrt and lost than ever before”, then went to order a coffee.And I’ve got no hesitation in saying, I think it’s his finest ever work.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It has no place anywhere. It is often a breach of human rights. It is often illegal.So it is understandable that many of us are questioning why this is happening – and, by extension, what our role is in this.Has our desire for cheap and cheerful fashion created this sickening practice  Are we somehow to blame for insisting we will only pay as little as possible for everything Should we — as some smarmy “influencers” suggest — be boycotting anyone who sells cheap clothes The simple answer is: NoOf course, in an ideal world, we’d all be buying top quality, ethically sourced garments that last a letime.But that’s just not going to happen. Most people just can’t afford to. And we like to keep up with trends while at the same time paying the bills. There is nothing wrong with that.Our love of fashion keeps the economy going.Fashion is the UK’s largest creative industry. It provides jobs for almost as many people as the financial sector and is one of the most female-dominated industries in the world.Around , people work in the UK fashion industry and approximately  per cent of garment workers are women.Livelihoods are at stakewe decide to boycott fashion brands because of their bad practices.The answer is for fast fashion firms like Boohoo and Quiz to do the work and get their houses in order. This is on them.And big firms like Boohoo — a business worth £.billion — are not without means. They have the resources to make changes.They need to perform due diligence on who is making their clothes — they must forensically examine the whole supply chain, from contractors to sub-contractors and anyone  who has a hand in how this stuff comes to market.Decent wages must be the norm. They must be transparent and tell us, the consumer, what they know.This is not rocket science. It is already happening.The Fashion Transparency Index  ranks  of the biggest global fashion brands according to how much information they provide about their suppliers, supply chain policies and practices and social and environmental impact.Retailers are scored on their transparency across five key areas: Policy and commitments, governance, traceability, supplier assessment and remediation and spotlight issues.HM, one of the largest fashion retailers in the world, is currently top of The Fashion Transparency Index.Stung by allegations that its clothes had been made by child labour in Myanmar — with some paid as little as p an hour — it last year built a new tracking system so consumers can find out where each garment is made.Marks  Spencer also scored highly. It introduced an ethical trading programme including audits of its supply chain in the Nineties.Eleven more brands in the Fashion Index revealed details of their processing facilities — where finishing, dyeing and laundering take place — in  compared to .And ten brands disclosed their raw material suppliers in , compared with just one in .Of course this isn’t just a fast fashion problem. It is industry-wide.What customers need from all brands is transparency, as this leads to accountability and ultimately change.Soyou do want to spend your hard-earned cash on fast fashion, only shop at places where you know they are doing their bit to ensure things are more ethically sourced.AS much as I love new clothes, fast fashion has had its day.Two brands have recently been at the centre of allegations that garments are being made or packed in dire working conditions in Leicester.Boohoo has paid a heavy price for these claims, with more than a billion pounds wiped off the value of its shares.Today, it suffered another big fall after a leading investor sold out on ethical grounds.And rival Quiz was sucked into the growing storm. It has suspended a supplier after claims that a factory in Leicester offered a worker just £ an hour to make its clothes.Quiz admitted that the situation, which it is investigating, is “unacceptable”.As online retailers specialising in casualwear, these companies were riding high after lockdown boosted sales. Following these allegations, the tide is turning against them.It comes after lockdown prompted many of us to reassess our lives, with the desire to be greener high on the agenda.A recent survey showed that more women were willing to make do and mend. That can’t be a bad thing.A common reason that clothes are sent to landfill is a missing button, which is simply appalling.Before buying a new dress or jacket, I now ask myself, ‘Am I going to wear this item for years ’Fashion is a global industry worth more than £trillion a year. It will clean itself up where necessary and adapt.Boohoo and Quiz have been swt to terminate relationships with rogue suppliers. Elsewhere, there is much talk of “respons-ible” and “sustainable” fashion.Don’t be surprisedthe fast fashion pack gives itself a long overdue makeover. Hopefully it will be more than the latest fad.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The High Court today was told how Heard appeared on the Late Late Show with James Corden on December , , the night after the alleged incident.Heard is then said to have exclaimed Can you believe I just did that show with two black eyes  after the show. But Hollywood stylist Samantha McMillen today took the stand in the libel case, claiming she had not seen the actress with any visible marks on her face or body.In a witness statement to the court, she said: I saw her throughout the day, in good light, at close range, wearing no makeup.Throughout the day, I could see clearly that Amber did not have any visible marks, bruises, cuts, or injuries to her face or any other part of her body.After the show, Ms Heard said to me, ‘Can you believe I just did that show with two black eyes ’ But she did not have any black eyes, and had been visibly uninjured throughout the day and at that moment.I later learned that Ms Heard had accused Johnny Depp of violently abusing her the previous night.The High Court heard today:She said she had been confused by Heards comments about the bruises, saying: I didnt see the black eyes, but also I dont want to, you know, raise any sort of - I just wanted to go home.Ms McMillen said he later overheard Ms Heard telling a pal: “Make sure to get those pictures on to my computer” - but she didn’t know what pictures she was referring to.Sasha Wass QC, representing News Group Newspapers, then referred to a message sent by Heard in December , which read: Johnny did a number on me tonight. The barrister asked: Did Ms Heard ever say to you that Johnny did a number on her  Ms McMillen said: She never said anything about that to me.And the stylist admitted she was loyal to Depp, saying: I’m loyal because he is kind and loyal back, but not for any other reason than that.Ms McMillen was then asked about an email sent by Ms Heard to her publicist, Jodi Gottlieb, in the early hours of December  which said: Im really bruised or might have a black eye or two tomorrow … I might not be fit for tomorrow but I wont know how bad the bruise is until the morning.And she said she couldnt think of why she would have sent the emailshe didnt have the injuries.The stylist also said she didnt remember any conversation with Heards make-up artist, Melanie Inglessis, that she was going to put a really bright red lipstick on Ms Heard to try and cover the mark on her lip.Depp has claimed Ms Heard faked the injuries as part of an “insurance dossier” against him.Heard has claimed Depp attacked her in a prolonged and violent assault the night before.The assault allegedly happened on the night of December ,  at the penthouse shared by the couple.Depp allegedly threw a decanter at Heard, slapped her face and dragged her through the apartment by the hair.He was said to have pulled “large chunks of hair and scalp” out of Ms Heard’s head as he pulled her up the stairs while threatening to kill her.As Heard tried to escape the violence, Depp allegedly hit her in the back of the head and knocked her to the floor. As she staggered to her feet, it was claimed, Depp screamed: “Oh, you think you’re a f***ing tough guy ” before headbutting her in her face.He then allegedly threw her on to the bed and knelt on her back while repeatedly punching her in her head, screaming: “I f***ing hate you” over and over again.Heard suffered severe headaches and other pains for at least a week after the attack, it was claimed.Later, Depp allegedly wrote a message on the kitchen countertop in gold pen that read: “Why be a fraud  All is such bulls***.”Depp told the court: “I was not violent toward Ms Heard in any way.

We have never and will never compromise that security in pursuit of economic prosperity.MPs warned the action could lead to retaliation from China.Sources said security services were ready for any cyber attacks in response to todays decision, but stressed the UK was always ready for state sponsored cyber attacks of any kind.Mr Dowden added: This government will not be cowed by the comments of any other country and indeed this decision has been made in the national security interests of this nation.The Culture Secretary also revealed the new Telecoms Security bill would be coming in the Autumn, but refused to say exactly when.It comes after a growing revolt from Mr Johnsons own MPs over the Chinese company’s technology.Speaking in the chamber, Tory MP Anthony Mangnall called for the  date to be brought forward, and accused Huawei of using slave labour.He said: If the Government is going to be clear-eyed about China, it must also be clear-eyed about the human rights violations that are reportedly being undertaken by Huawei and their use of slave labour.It is not acceptable for a global Britain to be involved in a company that is perpetually using slave labour in their supply chain.”Iain Duncan Smith became the most senior Tory to complain that the seven-year removal is too long.He said: Lets bring it forward to five, and make sure it happens quickly.In a letter to Mr Johnson, ten Tory MPs had bashed the “unreasonable delay”. They said: “We do not believe it is possible for the UK to have both secure networks and a role for Huawei within them. “It remains the case that, under China’s national intelligence law, Huawei is obliged to co-operate with Chinese intelligence and to deny that it does so. The nature of Chinese law is such that Huawei is — to all intents and purposes — a state-owned enterprise.In the last month alone, the world has been confronted with shocking new evidence of systematic human rights abuses by the Chinese Communist Party. These include a birth suppression programme directed against Uighur Muslims by the authorities.“Knowing how lightly China takes the assurances it has given, many colleagues are even more uncomfortable about a role for Huawei in our networks.The MPs include former party leader IDS, ex-cabinet minister David Davis and Bob Seely.Mr Seely had also warned that the government would face further furythe deadline was pushed back until the end of the decade.A Whitehall official explained today that it was not as simple as just taking off a piece of equipment.They said: It is not just ripping out an aerial, you are dismantling a highly intelligent piece of equipment.The Government announced in January that Huwaei would be limited to the core of the G network and just  per cent market share of the other parts.This morning Lord Browne of Madingley stepped down early as the UK chairman of Huawei Technologies ahead of the ban.Yesterday BT chief Philip Jansen warned of possible “outages”they are ordered to remove all Huawei products which help run G and G networks over security risks.He said: “I think that’s impossible to do in under ten years.Huawei has always denied that it poses any security risk and insists that it is a private company free from Chinese state control.Ed Brewster, a spokesperson for Huawei UK, said: This disappointing decision is bad news for anyone in the UK with a mobile phone.“It threatens to move Britain into the digital slow lane, push up bills and deepen the digital ide. Instead of ‘levelling up’ the government is levelling down and we urge them to reconsider. We remain confident that the new US restrictions would not have affected the resilience or security of the products we supply to the UK.“Regrettably our future in the UK has become politicized, this is about US trade policy and not security.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He told the House of Commons: There is also evidence that face coverings increase confidence in people to shop.Face coverings can make shoppers feel even more confident about ing to the high street.They have a part to play in helping the nation recover and protecting shop workers, he added.Mr Hancock said that those shops can call the policepeople without an exemption from wearing a face covering refuse to comply.Kids under  and those with disabilities will be exempt.And he accused Labour of making the issue a party political football.Deaths among shop assistants % higher for men and % higher for women than general population and the policy will help protect those more at risk because of their jobs, Mr Hancock said. When askedthe mandatory mask rule would be extended to offices, George Eustice told BBC Radio : At the moment we take one step at a time and weve taken the view in this next step that we should make it mandatory in retail environments.When it comes to workplace environments, because people are in the same company throughout the day, there are not lots of people coming through the venue as you have in a retail environment. The risk of transmission is therefore lower. London Mayor Sadiq Khan, who has been calling for mandatory face masks for months, slammed the PM for failing to make people feel safer.He told Good Morning Britain: I wish it had been brought in today rather than next Friday. This will help all of us be safer and could prevent a second wave that could have led to a second lockdown, which none of us wants. What has been announced:But Mr Eustice said the delay in the change was to give businesses time to prepare - despite guidance over masks being issued months ago. He said: Two things have been going on - evidence and understanding has been evolving, WHO changed its guidance back in June. We then loosened the lockdown and allowed more venues to open.We need to consider the mix of measures we have in place and control the virus. Some Conservative Party members have cut up their membership in protest of the move to make masks mandatory - claiming it goes against the partys libertarian values. The hashtag #NoMasks and the word muzzles were both trending on Twitter this morning. Studies have shown wearing masks has a signicant effect on stopping people who are infected from infecting others and spreading the virus - sometimes without symptoms.And other European countries such as Italy made face masks compulsory in all indoor spaces as they allowed shops and restaurants to reopen. Mr Eustice said people wont have to wear face masks to restaurants or bars - but would have to wear them at hairdressers. The mixed messages over where to wear masks adds to the confusion which started last Friday, when Boris Johnson said he was looking at tightening up the rules to make sure that more people wear them. But only days later, Michael Gove told BBCs Andrew Marr Show on Sunday: I dont think mandatory, no, but I would encourage people to wear face masks where they are inside and mixing with others, and the ventilation isnt as good.  At the moment its only mandatory to wear a mask on public transport - like trains, planes, buses or trams.Only a handful of fines have been dished out to people for not wearing them.Police are also outraged - claiming they wont be able to shoulder the responsibility to ensure people where masks, branding the policy absurd. politan Police Federation chairman Ken Marsh told Radio : Shopkeepers need to step up to the plate and take some responsibility. They can quite easily put signs up on their doors No mask on, no entry, this is private property.The second point is it will be nigh-on impossible for enforcement because you wont have a police officer on every shop door because there isnt enough of us.If a shopkeeper calls the police because someone hasnt got a mask on, they havent got the power to detain them so that person can just walk away.Well be driving around and around London looking for people who arent wearing masks, its absolutely absurd.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I was horried and disgusted. It was clear to me that this was human faeces. I knew that the faeces could not have come from either of Mr Depps or Ms Heards two small dogs.The High Court heard today:Giving evidence by videolink, she added: I have cleaned up after those dogs many times and their faeces are much smaller.

Of course, whatever the cost becomes, it is less than the cost of the threat to our national security and is a price we must pay. We were warned repeatedly by all of our allies about involving Huawei in our communications network.In recent years, I have heard first-hand from each of our intelligence-sharing partners in the so-called “Five Eyes” network . All of these countries, our closest allies, have been deeply worried by Britain’s decision. All have warned that this country — and our relationships with our allies — would be compromisedwe allowed Huawei such access. We would have been vulnerable, they warned.Bizarrely, Theresa May ignored this advice, then Boris Johnson’s government originally went further down this terrible road.This, despite the fact that other companies — including US firms — could have provided just the same technology, without the same security risks.And, key sources tell me, all for the same price. Still the Government snubbed our allies, alarmed our friends, and stuck to their decision.Privately it was briefed out that our own security services were confident of their ability to get backdoor access to see what Huawei would be doing and to control any covert activity. But all of this seemed a ridiculously high-risk venture. And for what exactly  Fortunately, that bizarre decision got reversed yesterday.Several factors have contributed to it. The first is an obvious change in relations towards China that is going on around the world. Covid- has played a part. China — unwittingly or carelessly — gave the world a virus which has all but halted our economies.The CCP’s lies and cover-ups during this devastating period have meant that all of us have been confined to our houses for months — and not just those who have contracted the coronavirus that came from Wuhan.In the months and years ahead, all of us will be poorer because of the CCP’s lies. The state has disappeared its own scientists. It allowed travel even after it knew what it was dealing with. It lied about the nature of the virus.And other members of the Five Eyes network have suggested that the evidence points clearly to the virus having been created in a Chinese laboratory.President Trump and his Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, have rightly made an issue of this. Both have been warning for years about the instability of China as a partner. As recent events in Hong Kong should remind us, China is a one-party, totalitarian state. It rules by dictatorship and terror. Of course, it is also highly technologically skilled and financially ever more dominant.The CCP seeks to make China the world’s leading power. Washington is — rightly — determined to stop that. And this country —we value freedom and the rule of law, as we always have — should seek to stop that too.This means, among much , denying China and Chinese state companies from extending their grip in countries like ours.For years, Chinese companies have stolen information, ripped off s, and otherwise acted completely unlawfully. They have engaged in espionage and information theft on an industrial scale.Some people might look at yesterday’s decision and think it a small, technical matter. It isn’t.Not only is it a decision with far-reaching consequences for this country’s security. It is also a signal of which side this country will be on in one of the most important tussles of our day.Everywhere China seeks to extend its power is an area where freedom recedes.Yesterday was a bad day for Huawei, a good day for Britain and a great day for freedom.Q: WHAT is the new ruling on Huawei A: From the end of this year, telecoms firms will not be able to buy any new Huawei hardware, such as antennas, to put into their G networks. By the end of , all Huawei equipment must be stripped out of the UK’s G networks.Q: Why is G important A: It will be ten times faster than G and allow more complicated technology, such as driverless cars, to operate.Q: What is Huawei currently used for A: The firm is the leading provider of technology needed to operate wireless networks that provide the G signal on our mobile phones. They were going to be used for “non-core” equipment in the G network. Instead European firms Nokia or Erion are likely to provide the hardware.Q: Can I still use my Huawei mobile phone A: Yes. There is no plan to ban its handsets.Q: Will the ban affect my phone signal A: Some telecom firms have warned that stripping out all Huawei hardware too quickly could result in a temporary loss of signal in some places, but other experts say this concern has been exaggerated.Q: Does this affect full fibre broadband connections A: Not at the moment. The Government’s security advisers have only recommended “transitioning away” from Huawei when it comes to fibre networks.Q: Will I have to replace a Huawei router in my home A: The router is not part of the G infrastructure and won’t be affected.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is understandable. We’ve all spent so long in lockdown and sometimes it can just leave you feeling  freaked out.“They did not say where they are or where the third person is. We still want to find or hear from that third person.“We are pleased to hear from the other two and to know they are safe.”It comes after The Sun reported that workers on the farm went on a shopping trip to Primark and three supermarkets days before  tested positive.There are now fears infected workers at AS Green and Co could have unwittingly spread the virus after going on a shopping spree in nearby Worcester and Malvern.It was confirmed by North Herefordshire MP Bill Wiggin that staff members were taken by minibus to Worcester where they shopped in the citys Primark store.The group also shopped in the Iceland supermarket and the Romanian store in the city before being driven to a Morrisons supermarket in Malvern.Dr. Kathryn Cobain, Director for Public Health in Worcestershire said in a statement: “ There is a great deal of data gathering being undertaken by our Public Health colleagues in Herefordshire.We are working closely with them to fully understand the situation. Shoppers and staff in the stores visited by the farm workers are not at any increased risk of Covid-.Our environmental health teams have been assisting businesses to follow the correct Covid- health and safety guidance. This is to ensure shoppers can visit stores with confidence.If you are washing your hands regularly, keeping your distance and using face coverings where necessary, you protect yourself and others.”It comes after four of the vegetable pickers - allegedly including three infected with the killer bug - fled the farm, as revealed by The Sun yesterday.Two left on Saturday - one of whom was positive - and two more infected with the virus fled today.It is believed they legged it across the fields, with Herefordshire County Council confirming several workers had fled the farm - but claimed three not four workers had absconded - and insisted only one of them had tested positive for coronavirus.And now panic has set in for the disproportionate amount of elderly people who live close to the farm, home to one of the largest outbreak of its kind in the UK since the pandemic began.Of the , people living in the villages within a three-miles radius of the farm, two thirds of them are aged  or older.One, a -year-old retired man, said: “We’re terried. The scientists are now saying this virus can survive in the air for hours.“Very few people my age are going outdoors now because they don’t want to catch it. We’re all staying indoors until it’s safe again.“It’s crazy. We spent four months in lockdown and just as it ends, we’ve found ourselves going back into voluntary lockdown.”At the farm, owned by vegetable tycoons Andrew and Caroline Green, telecommunications specialists spent the day fitting boosters to improve broadband access for the locked-down workers so they can keep in contact with the outside world.According to MP Mr Wiggin, testing was conducted after one worker fell ill on July .The first case was allegedly recorded by farm owners AS Green and Co on Wednesday last week.Five more tested positively the next day and by the weekend, when the farm was locked down,  cases had tested positive. Today the figure is .Authorities previously raised concern workers made regular trips to a Morrisons store in nearby Malvern.Herefordshire Council is arranging food and essential supplies for residents on the site.A spokesperson for Iceland said: Our store colleagues in Worcester have no recollection of this group visiting the store.We are confident that the store is following all company guidelines for social distancing, hygiene and operating processes to ensure a safe environment for colleagues and customers alike.A Primark spokesperson said: Nothing is more important to us than the safety and wellbeing of our customers and employees, and we have extensive safety measures in place across all our stores, including a strict social distancing protocol, personal protection for employees and customers and increased in-store cleaning.We are keeping the situation under constant review in line with government guidance.”Morrisons has also been contacted for comment.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

People entering shops and supermarkets in England must wear a face covering from July , with police fines of up to £ for those who flout the rules. However, the new regulations only apply to customers and suppliers entering retail outlets, government sources said. Staff will be covered by existing regulations, which place the burden on employers to make sure their workplaces are safe from the deadly virus. Firms are required to do risk assessments to decide on how to keep staff and customers safe. Measures including personal protective equipment, perspex screens and additional handwashing facilities. That suggests some staff will wear masks, coverings or visors, but it will not be a blanket policy. This is similar to the existing law making face masks compulsory on Englandaposs public transport - which exempts staff carrying out their work. Other exemptions include for children under , people with certain disabilities, or companions of deaf people who need to lip-read. Health Secretary Matt Hancock today said the policy would help restore shoppersapos confidence to get back on the high street.  But he faced questions about how the policy would work. He said shop staff will be able to refuse entry to those who donapost comply - and then call police, who have the power to issue £ fines as a last resort.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock on Tuesday confirmed they will be mandatory from July . But stretched police chiefs warned imposing the law would be “nigh-on impossible”. Government insiders suggested the masks would become “part of the new normal” until Britain was through the deadly pandemic. They warned face coverings could be required until scientists developed a successful vaccine which is unlikely to be available before mid-. Hancock confirmed yesterday that masks would be worn in shops from the end of next week to help control the spread of the virus. The top Tory claimed that they will give the public “more confidence” to shop as the Government attempts to shore up the battered economy. The Mirror understands that shoppers could end up wearing masks for months to come - and that they could even be rolled out to other public areas. One Cabinet source said: “We are not doing this with a timeline in mind. This is part of the new normal. “Until we get a vaccine we are going to have to be doing a lot of these things. “We are not going to be doing this for a few weeks and then giving up. It’s part of a wider package of measures, such a social distancing.” Another Government source added: “I don’t think anybody can know how long it will be but you have to assume we’ll be wearing masks for a while.” Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth told the Mirror: “Matt Hancock couldn’t tell us how long we’ll need to be wearing face masks but they should be honest with the public and be clear that it’s likely to last for months until we find a vaccine or we are safely through the pandemic.” Experts warn face coverings should be worn in Britain until coronavirus is eradicated. Most experts believe eradication is impossible without having a working vaccine, which is not likely to be rolled out until next year at the earliest. Dr David Strain, lecturer at Exeter University and chair of the British Medical Association’s Medical Academic Staff Committee, said: “We need masks to slow the spread and make le safer for the most vulnerable to go about essential activities. “Yesterday more than  people tested positive for the virus, which the ONS figures suggest is only about a third of the true number of new cases in the UK. “The remaining two thirds of the population with the virus are the ‘silent spreaders’, people who carry and can potentially spread the virus despite having no symptoms themselves. “The mandatory use of face coverings will reduce the risk to the population at large from these iniduals.” Incidence rates need to fall to one new case per million per day before masks can be safely removed, he added. Dr Julian Tang, respiratory scientist at Leicester University, said: “Most of the world’s population is still susceptible to this virus, and we are still not sure how long any post-infection immunity will last.  “Sopeople can get used to all these precautions now, it will reduce the numbers of Covid- deaths over a longer-term.” It comes after scientists warned that the UK could face as many as , new coronavirus deaths from the disease without any further lockdowns, treatments or vaccines, with hospitals overwhelmed during winter flu season. The report, commissioned by Chief Scientic Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance, found that a “reasonable” worst case scenario could see between , and , virus-related deaths in hospitals alone, peaking in January and February. The UK’s daily death toll rose by  to ,, although the true figure is believed to be higher. Mr Hancock told MPs that face coverings in shops will give the public “more confidence” to shop as the Government attempts to shore up the battered economy. He said the policy could be rolled out “in chunks”, and while there were no immediate plans for widening out mandatory use of masks to offices, pubs and restaurants, further measures would be kept under review. Deaths among shop workers were % higher for men and % higher for women than among the general public, prompting the need for better protections in retail outlets, he said.  Mr Hancock said the move would be “largely enforced” by the public despite plans for police fines of £ for shoppers in England who fail to comply. Stores are being told to refuse entry to people who flout the rules or call the police - triggering a backlash from both retailers and top officers, who warned the move is “impossible” to enforce. Ken Marsh, chairman of the politan Police Federation, said: “It will be nigh-on impossible for enforcement because you won’t have a police officer on every shop door because there isn’t enough of us.” Senior officers were blindsided by the move, with National Police Chiefs’ Council chairman Martin Hewitt saying forces were “unaware” the announcement was coming on Monday night. Usdaw, the shopworkers union, backed the move towards mandatory face coverings but said staff must not be left to enforce the rules as they were already “dealing with more abuse than normal”. The decision to make face coverings mandatory in England’s shops, with exemptions for children under  and people with certain disabilities, also angered grassroots Tories, with some activists cutting up their membership cards and posting images on social media.

USSR-born Alexander Temerko, who is behind £. million in donations to the Conservative Party shared a £, table with Alok Sharma, Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy , at the notorious Black and White Ball fundraiser in February. As Business Secretary, Mr Sharma would normally have been responsible for giving final approval for the scheme at the time of the dinner. However, he recused himself from decisions relating to it two months later over fears of a conflict of interest. The Mirror understands they were joined at the table by Mr Temerko’s business partner Kirill Glukhovskoy. Both men are directors of Aquind, a scheme planning to run a giant power cable under the English Channel, emerging in Portsmouth and linking up the English and French power grids. There’s no suggestion of any wrongdoing on the part of Aquind Ltd, Mr Temerko or Mr Glukhovskoy.  Because the project has been designated a nationally signicant infrastructure project”, it requires final sign off from the relevant Secretary of State. Ordinarily, this would be Mr Sharma - and until the Mirror approached BEIS about this story last week, there had been no suggestion publicly that the decision would be made by anyone . As well as a £, donation to the Conservative Party in February - which is thought to be the cost of a table with a high-ranking minister at the lavish fundraisers - Aquind donated £, directly to Mr Sharma in January this year, a few weeks before he took the job as BEIS Secretary. The Mirror understands Mr Sharma agreed to step back from the decision in April , because of a potential conflict of interest. Energy minister Kwasi Kwarteng is now expected to take the final decision next year. A spokesman for Mr Sharma said: “Alok formally recused himself from the process months ago, and has not and will not have any involvement in the decision on this proposal.”  Gerald Vernon-Jackson, leader of Portsmouth council, has written to Communities secretary Robert Jenrick to demand decisions over the project be made locally. Two weeks on, Mr Vernon-Jackson has not received a reply. He told the Mirror: Government ministers have said weaposre locally not allowed to make this decision and Iaposm concerned that one of the two directors of the company has donated over £m to the Conservatives and that I think itaposs now necessary for ministers to step away from being involved in this decision. Itaposs a hugely controversial decision to bring this power line in to the second most densely populated city in the country and dig this trench all the way through the city. He added: Ministers need to be really careful that there is no impression that planning permission can be bought. It emerged last week that a third inidual behind Aquind Ltd had been granted anonymity by Companies House.  The names of persons with signicant control of such a company would normally be published under anti-corruption rules. But the Times today reported the mystery backer had applied to have their name kept secret under an exemption that applies to people who could be at risk of serious violence or intimidation should their name be published. Mr Temerko, , was head of a Russian state arms firm before moving to the UK and gaining citizenship in . He was born in Ukraine, which at the time was still part of the USSR.

The anonymous artist wore a hazmat suit and a backpack sprayer to carry out a aposdeep cleanapos on the Tube. He sprayed rats on the walls of the carriage, some of which were sneezing, wearing masks and holding hand sanitiser. A passenger can be seen watching Banksy as he sprays the interior while disguised as a TfL deep cleaner. In the video, he orders passengers to move away while creating the piece, which he called aposIf You Donapost Mask, You Donapost Getapos. At the end of the clip the words aposI get lockdownapos appear on a wall at a Tube stop, before the carriage doors close, revealing the words aposbut I get up againapos. The lines refer to Chumbawambaaposs  song Tubthumping, which plays in the background of the video. The artwork follows the Governmentaposs mixed messages over face masks. Face coverings will be made mandatory in Englandaposs shops and supermarkets from Friday  July after a Tory U-turn. Police will be expected to enforce the law - and there will be £ fines for those who refuse. It comes more than two months after the government first recommended wearing a face covering in indoor spaces to prevent passing Covid- to others. Tory MP Desmond Swayne moaned it is a monstrous imposition to make him wear a face covering when he is out shopping.He hit out despite masks being designed to protect other people, and more than , people dying with coronavirus in the UK - saying it would put him off going to the shops.  The -year-old complained he and his constituents in New Forest West were outraged and reluctant and questioned how police would enforce the law. Confirming the face mask changes in Parliament, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: Let us all do our utmost to keep this virus cornered and enjoy summer safely.

In this particular case, the work was removed some days ago due to our strict anti-graffiti policy. Weaposd like to offer Banksy the chance to do a new version of his message for our customers in a suitable location.The video begins with a laptop playing video footage showing the London Underground being deep cleaned in May. Banksy - clad in a white boiler suit, mask, goggles, blue gloves and an orange hi-viz jacket with the message stay safe printed on it - climbs on board a train posing as a TfL worker. The video shows him ushering a masked passenger to move back, before stencilling a rat using a blue face mask as a parachute.  Another rat has a blue mask over its face, while one holds a bottle of hand sanitiser. The video finishes with a message sprayed on the wall of a Tube station reading: I get lockdown with the doors of the Tube carriage closing to reveal the message But I get up again.

The measures - which also include advice to wear face coverings in all enclosed public spaces - will be in place for the next month. The authorityaposs director of public health, Dominic Harrison, said a lockdown similar to that in Leicester is a real possibility after the infection rate rose to  cases per , from . in just seven days. The authority is third on the list of highest weekly rates, behind Leicester, which has a rate of . cases per , and is subject to a local lockdown, and nearby Pendle, with a rate of .. Mr Harrison said,rates were continuing to rise in a few weeks, the council would consider reimposing some lockdown restrictions. The five measures are: A limit of two people from the same household allowed to visit another household.  At the moment national guidance allows two families to meet indoors as long as they keep to social distancing guidance. The council are asking residents to limit the numbers of people meeting indoors to people who live in the house plus only two members from a second household at any one time. Wearing cloth face coverings in all enclosed public spaces.  All residents will be strongly recommended to wear a cloth face coveringin all enclosed public spaces. This means in all shops, workplaces, libraries, museums, health centres, hair and beauty salons etc. Greeting and embracing.  Rather than give handshakes or a hug, the council are asking people to only bump elbows with anyone outside of their immediate family. Support for small shops.  The council are stepping up our Public Protection advice and support to small shops across the borough to ensure that measures such as wearing face coverings, social distancing, good hygiene practice and increased ventilation are being followed to help reduce the risk of virus spread in these businesses. Testing.  The council are doing more targeted testing this week, with the arrival of a mobile testing unit at Witton Park Academy in addition to the testing facility at Royal Blackburn Hospital. You don’t need to have symptoms to be tested – this will help us with case finding, identying people who have no symptoms but who carry the virus.  Targeted testing is taking place in the borough, with a mobile testing unit at Witton Park Academy as well as a facility at Royal Blackburn Hospital, and residents have been told they do not need to have symptoms to be tested. Mr Harrison said: These steps will help and we are appealing to everyone in Blackburn with Darwen to follow them to protect themselves and their loved ones. If we donapost, a local lockdown, like in Leicester, becomes a very real possibility. The council is working with the NHS and the wider community on this, itaposs up to us all to help each other stick to the advice thataposs been given. We can only avoid further lockdown measureswe work together.  In the next week to  days, we will see a rise in the number of cases in the borough due to the increased targeted testing we are doing in communities most at risk, and because we have opened a Pillar  testing site next to the hospital last week. In another two weeks,the rates are continuing to rise, we will have to consider reversing some of the national lockdown lting measures locally one by one until we see a reversal in the current rising trend. Itaposs up to everyone to make sure we donapost have to do that. Seventy new cases of coronavirus were recorded in the local authority in the seven days to July , up from  in the previous seven days. Council leader Mohammed Khan said: I can reassure all local residents that the council is working with dferent agencies and organisations across the borough to help get the message out to everyone that le cannot go back to normal just yet, and we must all make sacrices to avoid a local lockdown.

As of next Friday anyone going to a corner shop, high street giant or supermarket, will have to cover up – or risk a £ fine. After weeks of mixed messages from the Government, many are confused by the move. So we’ve asked a  of experts the key questions... Q Why is wearing a mask important  A Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, says: “We know much more about this virus. “We have learned it can spread by speaking or singing, not just a cough or sneeze. It is really important to stop the virus escaping from people’s noses and mouths.” Q Is it true masks don’t protect wearers from infection  A They safeguard other people, not the wearer. Prof McKee says: “We want to stop droplets drying in air and forming an aerosol. “Once they form an aerosol, anything short of PPE will not stop it being inhaled.” Q Which type should I choose  A Several coverings are available, from medical-grade respirators to disposable masks and scarf-type ones with filters. Public health consultant Maggi Morris says: “The highest-grade masks are quite expensive and most are disposable. “Lower-grade masks are also disposable and you’ll get through a few a day, while cloth coverings need to be regularly washed. “If you buy a mask with a filter, keep changing the filter.” Q Are homemade face masks effective  A Ms Morris says: “In a Covid ward the answer would be no. But [it] will help protect others.”  Q How should the mask fit around my face  A Prof John Ashton, former regional head of Public Health for the North West, says: “It should fit snug over your nose and mouth.” Q Should I change my mask during the day  A Change ityou’ve sneezed or coughed into it, says Ms Morris. “Wash your hands or sanitise before putting another one on.” Q Is wearing a scarf just as good  A It’s better than nothing, but Ms Morris warns: “It won’t fit as well. Make sure it’s wrapped tightly around your head so its fits closely around the lower bridge of your nose and snugly around your chin.” Q How clean should my hands be before touching my mask  A Wash them thoroughly “before you put masks on and when you take them off”, Ms Morris says. Q How often should you wash it  And how should you wash it  A Wash after every use at a minimum temperature of  degrees, says Prof Ashton.  Q How do you prevent your glasses from steaming up  A Submerge your specs in soapy water and let them air dry, creating an anti-fog layer on the lenses, says Jeremy Howard, of campaign group MasksAll. Or: “Play with where your glasses sit.” Q Is there anyone who shouldn’t be wearing one  A Kids under  and those with some disabilities. The list of exemptions has not yet been published, but the rules for face coverings on public transport offer exceptions on medical grounds. Q Can your household share clean masks  A Dr McKee says they should be treated like handkerchiefs – better to have your own than share. Q Should I send my child to school in a mask  A Face coverings are not recommended for children under five, according to Dr McKee. need for lockdowns.

This figure has now rocketed to eight hours and  minutes in recent months. But despite their efforts, the study commissioned by Independent Network powered by VEKA, found they are still five years and five months away from getting their homes aposjust rightapos. It also emerged  per cent have a aposvisionapos of how they want their house to look - including the furnishings theyaposll buy, what the d cor will be and even how the windows will look. A spokeswoman for Independent Network, powered by VEKA, said: The research shows just how much of a priority our homes are at this moment in time. Weaposve always been a house proud nation but clearly this love for our homes has increased dramatically in a relatively short period of time. With us spending more time at home perhaps the nation is finally getting time to get their homes up to the standard they would like. The study also revealed that three quarters of homeowners would describe themselves as house proud, with  per cent adding that their homes are more important to them now than ever before.  As a result  per cent felt more motivated to improve their homes at this particular moment in time. This is not only reflected in the time spent working on their dwellings - itaposs also reflected in the money spent. Homeowners have gone from spending an average of £-a-month on improving their homes prior to the lockdown to £-a-month now. And there is no sign this drive to finish off their homes will slow anytime soon with  per cent still having jobs they want to get done this year. Among them are painting walls and ceilings, giving the garden a revamp and getting the living room done.  It also emerged that  per cent admitted they are a perfectionist when it comes to their homes - and wonapost stop until their house is aposspot onapos. Although,  per cent donapost think their residences will ever be truly finished. Despite this  per cent are aposcontentapos with their homes as they are. In fact, those polled even have favourite parts of their homes, with a fth claiming to be most proud of their bathroom. The living room is the area of the home they are most proud of, followed by the kitchen and the garden. Four in  admitted they are so proud of their homes they aposcanapost waitapos to invite people over as restrictions are reduced - so they can give them a grand tour of all the improvements theyaposve made.  The Independent Network powered by VEKA study, carried out through OnePoll, also explored the typical le cycle of dferent areas of the home. On average, master bedrooms get redecorated every five-and-a-half years, bathrooms every six years and three months, while windows tend to get replaced every eight years. The garden gets a revamp after five years, the kitchen after six years and four months, and the living room after five years and four months.

National Property Auctions managing director, Mandi Cooper said: This is a rare opportunity for a developer to pick up an A-listed building and restore it into its former glory. The Courier reports the grand building was designed by architect William Leiper.  He is perhaps most well known for the Templeton carpet factory in Glasgow, also known as the Doge’s Palace. There was something of a local scandal in  when developers removed stained glass windows, marble fireplaces and hand-painted mahogany ceiling , the paper reports. Lead was also previously stripped from the roofs.  Local councillor Derek Wann told the Courier: “If it sells it would be great to see such a beautully designed building brought back to le. “After campaigning for so long to get this building on the market and to now see this being brought to auction is a huge relief to all of us in Arbroath. “I would urge whoever purchases this to get in touch with the planners at Angus Council to discuss any potential planning applications.” "},{"url":null,"title":"luxury houseboat sauna jet ski","story":"NewsLuxury houseboat with sauna, jet ski dock and floating stove on sale for £.mThe s steel barge has been converted into a sprawling home complete with five bedrooms, a large dining area and a sauna, providing the most luxurious of environments - but on a riverShareCommentsByMilo Boyd:,  JUL NewsOne of the most luxurious homes for sale right now in the UK is a houseboat on sale for £.m \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"News, views and top stories .

One of the girls managed to contact Northern Ireland Fire  Rescue Service which attended and rescued them from the barn. Detective Sergeant Hollie McCartan said: “Thankfully there were no reports of any serious injuries and only minor damage was caused to the barn.

Another was described as wearing a green and white coloured top, with a third described as wearing a grey tracksuit with the hood covering his face. “It is extremely fortunate that we are not dealing with more tragic circumstances following this incident. This was a terrying ordeal for the girls trapped inside andthey had not managed to contact the authorities, the consequences could have been devastating.

Through the end of July and into August many parts of UK are likely to see periods of drier and settled weather, most especially in the south, it continues. These settled periods, however, will be interspersed with spells of wet weather, with winds becoming stronger at times. Weather charts show temperatures in the mid to high s in the south starting on Friday and running through until at least Monday. The Met Office is predicting scorching temperatures between  and C on Saturday - a welcome relief after days of dreary cloud and rain.Forecasts suggest Kent and Suffolk could be in for the winning combination of the highest temperatures and clearest skies this weekend. But before that, the UK can expect plenty of cloud and rain - though some warm temperatures and mugginess thanks to humidity. BBC meteorologist Tomasz Schafernaker described the week as cloudy, cloudy, cloudy, then Friday and Saturday turning a little bit warmer and brighter - with sunny skies expected to remain until at least Monday.

Proposing now what the PM earlier rejected has a whf of the airport quarantine fiasco. The high death rates for retail staff – between % and % above the national average – suggestsface coverings work, they should have been introduced long ago. The Government’s failure to publish detailed evidence or the reasons they waited, dents public confidence in the Prime Minister. It won’t be the £ fines that sees people comply. It will be the urge to do the right thing. The public will yet again show a common sense that’s too often lacking in our dithering, vacillating, error-making, blame-shting PM. Power failure It is of huge concern that two Russian tycoons behind a controversial £.billion energy scheme could pay to share a table with a Cabinet Minister whose department must rule on their venture. Business Secretary Alok Sharma should not let himself be put in potentially compromising positions and have to leave rulings to a junior. Our revelation today, weeks after the property development scandal involving Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick, paints a worrying picture of how meetings with top Tory politicians are effectively sold to the wealthy. The Tories must end these cash-for-access fundraisers. They poison our democracy.

Speaking about aposlawmakers, leaders and executivesapos, Meghan said: They donapost listen until they have to because the status quo is easy to excuse and itaposs hard to break. But it will pull tightest right before snapping.I say to you keep challenging, keep pushing, make them a little uncomfortable. Itaposs only in that discomfort that we actually create the decisions to reimagine our standards, our policies and our leadership, to move towards real representation and meaningful influence over the structures of decision-making and power. She also spoke of the need to aposdrown out the noiseapos of negative voices, even when it aposmakes others feel uneasyapos. The Duchess said: There will always be negative voices and sometimes those voices can appear to be outsized, and sometimes they can appear to be painfully loud. You can and will use your own voices to drown out the noise. Because thataposs what it is - just noise.  But your voices are those of truth. And hope. And your voices can and should be much louder. She also said people need to aposworkapos for apostrue equalityapos every day - and not just believe in it.The -year-old, who was wearing a blue dress and a £, Cartier ct yellow-gold bracelet, added: We have to speak up for ourselves and we have to speak out for others who struggle to be heard. She also praised the youngsters who have been actively pushing for equality, including those who took part in the Black Lives Matter protests.Meghan said: Girl Up members are organising Black Lives Matter protests around the world, you are creating films to encourage your peers to become activist leaders, you are reforming the criminal justice system.  You are telling your school boards we need more mental health resources for all ages, you are leading coalitions to end gun violence. You are standing up and demanding to be heard, yes, but youaposre also demanding to own the conversation. The Duchess added that she, her husband Prince Harry and their son Archie will be cheering young women on in their fight for equality. More than , youngsters tuned in online to hear Meghanaposs speech. She is one of many high profile women taking part in the Girl Up campaign, including Michelle Obama, Hillary Clinton and Priyanka Chopra.

A super effort so far!The postponement of the Ryder Cup until next year is just adding insult to injury now for this sports writer’s summer plans.First the Euros are pushed back until  and now this  I might have to actually get a le.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

He is now facing a jail term after pleading guilty to the offences at Dundee Sherf Court.It was revealed Kerr was discharged from the RAF in November last year after the case came to light.Over four days in June , Kerr had made contact with a woman in Arbroath claiming he was working for a film company and asked her to carry out the sickening abuse on children.Fiscal depute Eilidh Robertson said: “Information had come to light he had met the complainer through Facebook and posed as a film stuntman. He said this was to be used as a stunt for a film.“The accused incited her to sit on two babies infor payment. She sat on them and uploaded several videos. The accused gave her detailed instructions on how to do this and asked her to send the videos, adding that she would be paid commission for the clips.”Kerr sent the woman a video of how he wanted the acts to be carried out. The woman uploaded seven videos which lasted between four and  seconds long.The footage showed the children were initially “laughing and giggling” but became extremely distressed and tried to escape after the woman applied more of her weight.During the conversations on Messenger, Kerr said: “If you do the scene a couple of times, we can give you advice.“If you make it a couple of times you could make it into a montage which would make you more money. Get a good holiday from it haha.”A medical examination found no actual harm was caused to the children but concluded they would have been in dangerthey had continued any longer.Kerr also attempted to incite another woman to carry out similar actions on a child in Elgin in .He again posed as a stuntman and said he would pay £ for her to “squash” a child. An arrangement was made to meet at Elgin Railway Station but this never took place.Kerr’s IP address was traced to his room in Cyprus following the intelligence. He told military officers after the discovery of indecent images: “I am guilty of the offences. I have done it since my mother died.”Devices both at his room and at his home in Dunoon, Argyllshire, found a total of  images and  videos of children being abused. Some of these included adults crushing or sitting on children.Kerr pleaded guilty to taking or permitting to be taken indecent images of children between November   and July   at RAF Lossiemouth, John Street in Dunoon and RA Akrotiri, Cyprus and where.On ious occasions between April -  in Elgin, Kerr incited another woman into assaulting a child by sitting and standing on them. He also admitted a third charge of inciting a woman in Arbroath to assault two children by sitting and standing on their bodies between June - .The court heard Kerr made “full admissions” to police who interviewed him. Sentence was deferred until September by Sherf Alastair Carmichael who placed him on the sex offender’s register. Kerr’s bail order was allowed to continue.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

It’s been a great shame they haven’t been able to celebrate that.“The club will find some way of they get their day with that.“In terms of recruitment and brining players in, I’ll give the players here the opportunity.“I’ll take my time with that. Assurances is a strong word but certainly Dundee United as a club would have the ability to go out and do that,I can bring players that would make Dundee United a better team.“They’d have the ability to go into the market and bring players in that could make the team better.“If the need is there for me to go and do that, and the opportunity to bring players in from other places I believe is a good fit for the culture of the club and making the team better, then absolutely we would have the ability to do that.“The owner has told me he’d back me as has Tony Asghar and I’m happy with that.”As for how United’s embroilment in Hearts and Partick Thistle’s legal case against the SPFL affects his ability to spend, Mellon says that is for those higher up at Tannadice to say.An SFA arbitration  will hear the Jags and Jambos’ petition this week with league champions United, Raith Rovers and Cove Rangers mounting their own defences in the wake of the initial SPFL resolution and Court of Session action.“I think that’s a question for other people,” he said of the impact United’s legal costs on his playing budget.“I’ve, obviously, been brought here to try to improve a football team.“I’m here try to build relationships with fans and connect everybody, to make players understand the sacrices you need to make to improve and the other stuff will be taken care of by specialists.“They’ll get on with that, that’s what they’re here to do and paid to do, that’s not my remit.“I’ll do what I’m here to do which is digest training, see what I think our players need to do I order to keep moving them forward and then get out on the grass to put on sessions that will challenge them.“Once I see the improvements that need to be made, I’ll be strong with them and keep the standards really high.“I need to keep them fit and motivated and away we go. I’ll do that every day.“That’s just the way I work and operate as a manager. It’s stood me in good stead and I won’t change that.”Mellon’s track record in developing players is impressive with Leicester star Jamie Vardy one of his students at Fleetwood Town and Manchester City ace John Stones another at Barnsley.However, the Paisley-born coach was keen to point out another in Rangers defender Connor Goldson, whom Mellon had at Shrewsbury.He hopes to repeat those kind of successes at United.He added: “I had Connor Goldson. We developed him into a fantastic centre-back and sold him to Brighton for millions.“You take your time with them and see what they need to get better at. It was the same with Vardy, Stones and these kind of guys.“You look at it and know the qualities that’s needed for them to be a top player.“You recognise it and because I’ve been through it before and been successful with it before because the proof is there with the boys playing at unbelievable levels, I’m able to bring that to this group of players.“I know the techniques that are needed to show them. The training sessions or talking to them about things in a way they can grasp and understand to make them top players as well.“I really enjoy doing that and I’m so proud of all the boys who have turned out top players.”CALUM WOODGER: New Dundee United boss Micky Mellon is making all the right noises\" title\"#CALUM WOODGER: New Dundee United boss Micky Mellon is making all the right noises# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp calum-woodger-new-dundee-united-micky-mellon-making-right-noises embed # secretZZoTJol\" data-secret\"ZZoTJol\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

The player is set toto training with team-mates this week.Aberdeen’s pre-season preparations ramped up at the weekend with the bounce game draw with Ross County.That friendly marked the first appearance of winger Jonny Hayes, who signed a two-year deal following his exit from Celtic.The deal to land the -year-old was only made possible because the Republic of Ireland international offered to defer his wages for a year.Aberdeen chairman Dave Cormack has illustrated the financial plight of the club, confirming projected losses of £m due to the Covid- pandemic.Due to that financial hit, McInnes is currently not in a position to add to the squad.Cormack is this week expected to unveil the club’s plan to navigate through the pandemic.The imminent Premiershipand hope of a phasedof fans at least offers light at the end of the tunnel.McInnes is mindful of just how long his squad have been away.He said: “From that Hibs gameto the start of the season against Rangers, it will be the best part of five months.“That is a long time, probably the longest any squad has had that gap from competitive football.

Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"midweek joy for golfer david","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsDavid Ronald took the honours in the first midweek stableford at Tarbert Golf Club, with a fantastic score of  points.He was on target to break  for the first time but finished with a double bogey for a , still a great score.

The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through. They pass multiple residential entrances with limited sight lines with no care for risk. The offensive noise seems to come from two actions modying motorbike exhausts and extreme acceleration in legal bikes.If a car made a similar noise, spewed out the same polluting omissions, or did the same ridiculous speeds they would be pulled over by the police, but bikers appear above the law.As technology reduces the noise pollution of cars, planes and other forms of transport, it seems motorbikes are exempt. Bikers claim #loud pipes save lives# but is safety really the motivation for deliberately creating excessive noise Noise counts as a statutory nuisance it either unreasaonably and substantially interferes with the user or enjoyment of a home or other premises or is likely to injure health.The problem on A is known to all the statutory agencies, but nothing is done.If this is a national problem, what action needs to be taken Concerned Loch Fyne-side resident Sir,I am not qualied to judge economic competence, but considering the party he represents, I think that Councillor Redman might find it advisable to be wary of the phrase #colossal mismanagement# .For my part, I would consider a degree of incompetence to be preferable to the great damage caused over the last decade to  per cent of the UK’s people, as well as to its institutions and its reputation by the cruel, self-serving, xenophobic, elitist, dishonestregime currently in Westminster.Name supplied, LochgilpheadSir,Our charity#s support for blind and partially sighted people affected by the coronavirus lockdown has received a £, boost from the Scottish Government#s Wellbeing Fund.With this extra funding we will be able to support an additional  people and respond to the increased demand for more in-depth, one-to-one emotional support.The practical and psychological effects of losing your sight can have a signicant impact on people’s well-being, and this current situation has exacerbated the anxiety and isolation felt by many.Access to essential services such as food and medicines is more dficult as is social distancing, vital information on staying safe isn#t always in accessible formats, and many of our older members aren#t always confident about using new technology to stay in touch with others.Everyone accessing RNIB#s confidential counselling service will receive eight weekly sessions with an accredited counsellor, delivered via telephone and online, with each session normally lasting an hour.The funding will enable us to reduce the waiting list for emergency mental health sessions and also let existing clients access additional sessions.The RNIB helpline is available on   .James Adams, RNIB Scotland directorSir,Every pub across Scotland should be allowed to stock and sell beer from local independent brewers, to help them recover post-lockdown.CAMRA, the Campaign for Real Ale has launched the #Cheers for Choice# campaign.The campaign wants these arrangements to be relaxed, and MSPs are also being urged to support the Tied Pubs Bill being put forward in the Scottish Parliament by Labour MSP Neil Bibby.

Perhaps for the first time in their lives they have heard the bark of deer or spotted something in nature that is totally new to them.

But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased.

Irsquom also ready to accept some fundamental political realities.Letrsquos face it, wersquore all just guinea pigs now, part of a radical public health experiment the likes of which has never been attempted before. This experiment is reaching its most dficult phase yet, the bit where the Government has to somehow let people start doing normal things ndash like going back to work and spending money to keep the economy going ndash while simultaneously reminding us that we wersquore not out of the woods yet. They have to encourage people to go out, while keeping them scared.Many ndash including me ndash have criticised politicians for their missteps and mixed messages over the last few months. But I also recognise a number of basic truths that itrsquos better to get onersquos head around sooner rather than later, regardless of party politics.The first is that until coronavirus has been completely eradicated around the world, risk is going to play a part in our lives for the foreseeable future. The second is closely related: the state cannot tell us exactly how to manage this risk in every single circumstance. We may get health advice and government guidance, but ultimately we have to navigate this new, more precarious world on our own.How we do this, and, crucially, how we feel about doing it, depends on many dferent things, of course, not least our age and underlying health, our financial situation and, to a signicant extent, our personality.I know there are some who believe that through lting lockdown restrictions politicians in Westminster and Holyrood are very deliberately handing over responsibility ndash and thus blame ndash to the public for what comes next. And there may be some truth to this. But come on, letrsquos get real.Accusations of ldquomaking it up as they go along are thrown around asthis was an insult rather than simply a fact describing the predicament governments everywhere find themselves in. How could it be otherwise given the extraordinary events of the last six months  And whatrsquos the alternative to us being public health guinea pigs  Staying at home forever Community levels of the virus in Scotland are now low and falling. Our hospitals lie empty. We have a test and trace system in place to ndash hopefully ndash crack down on infections. Meanwhile, wellbeing continues to suffer under the restrictions and hundreds of thousands of jobs hang in the balance. All of these things mean we can and should lt the lockdown. And lting restrictions means the vast majority of folkmust decide for themselves what level of risk they are comfortable contending with, taking into consideration how it might affect their family and community as well as their own personal circumstances.We can help ourselves along the way. Firstly by staying up to date ndash through trusted, legitimate scientic and public information sources ndash about how the virus is transmitted and the best ways to stay safe.We can also resist the temptation to judge others for their decisions. Frankly, Irsquom sick of the army of armchair virologists spouting their culture war vitriol on social media. On one side you have those who seem to relish the lockdown, the class swots who shout too loudly about how they follow every part of the guidanceand seem to revel in the idea of a second wave. On the other side, you have the virus deniers. Both groups peddle fear and misinformation, whether that is their intention or not.At the end of the day none of us, not even the scientists, know whether and when there will be another wave of the virus. Uncertainty permeates through every part of our lives now, and we must find ways to live with and even embrace thiswe are to make it through the tough months ahead.

After all, the current crop of EVs are quite large Jaguars I-Pace is huge, for instance, while Audis e-Tron is a dominating force out on the road. Then there is the myriad of crossovers like the Hyundai Kona Electric and the Kia Soul Electric, which are reasonably large too.But the Volkswagen e-Up! is dferent. Its quite small - as is the standard Up! - and it doesnt look all too out-there either. VW has given the e-Up! bigger batteries to improve that all-important range - but can this little car battle it out in a segment dominated by leviathans WHATS NEW If you were to judge whats new by the exterior of the e-Up!, youd probably say not a lot. It doesnt look particularly dferent from the car it replaces, nor does it appear all too dissimilar to the standard combustion-engined car. No, the bulk of the changes here have been made under the skin.As we mentioned earlier, Volkswagen has boosted the battery count in the e-Up!, helping to extend its range and bolster its appeal. The firm has also added the ability to fast-charge the car - a feature more often seen in premium alternatives - which should help to drive down the time youll be waiting at the plug.WHATS UNDER THE BONNET Underneath the e-Up! sits an electric motor linked to a .kWh battery. Power is sent to the front wheels through a single-speed gearbox, and in total it pushes out .bhp but, more importantly, a healthy Nm of torque - but well get to the effect that has shortly.Sprinting from -mph takes the Up! . seconds and all-in itll do mph. Volkswagen claims that youll be able to do  miles between charges, while the ability to use combined charging system tech means that the car can be taken from zero to % charge in just an hour via a kW DC charger. Use a standard domestic wallbox and that falls to a respectable four hours, while via a three-pin youll be looking at around  hours for a full charge.WHATS IT LIKE TO DRIVE The little Up! is already an absolute hoot to drive, so youd hope that some of that sense of fun had been transplanted across to the electric version. And, despite weighing in at ,kg - well over the regular cars kg - it is. That sense of fun remains, with the zippy acceleration you only get from an EVs instant torque really adding to the whole experience. The steering is well-judged and nicely weighted while the ride is good too, with only the largest of potholes tending to unsettle it.Around town, its nimble and makes slotting into gaps in traffic a breeze and even at higher speeds on the motorway, its unflustered. Surprisingly for an EV, acceleration from mph to mph isnt bad at all - many electric cars tend to start getting a touch lethargic at this point.HOW DOES IT LOOK We already liked the understated styling of the standard Up!, so its fair to say that we appreciate the undercover looks of this electric version too. Only slim LED running lights up front help to denote it as something dferent to the norm, while the charging port is integrated into the place youd usually find the filler cap. All very normal indeed.The compact proportions lend the Up! to town driving, while the short overhangs and relatively slim wheel arches make it a doddle to park. In terms of electric vehicle design, it certainly rests on the conservative end of things, but were sure that this will appeal to many.WHATS IT LIKE INSIDE Again, much like the exterior, the cabin of the e-Up! is business as usual. Theres no main infotainment screen - just a cradle for your smartphone - so the forward part of the interior feels pleasantly uncluttered. The steering wheel has a good amount of adjustment, while the seats are well-padded and comfortable. Theres good forward visibility too - though on brighter days the windscreen does tend to reflect a large vent located at the back of the dashboard, which can prove quite distracting.Our five-door model granted easy access to the rear of the car too, and those who are sat in the back that wont struggle for legroom - though of course, the cars size does have its limitations. Very tall passengers will likely find headroom a hard-to-find aspect of the Up!WHATS THE SPEC LIKE Our test car came in at pound, after the governments plug-in car grant, which doesnt seem like bad value at all given the kit on offer. Cruise control, parking sensors at both front and rear and a rearview camera are all thrown in as standard, while a dinky five-inch colour touchscreen system - essentially a small strip screen - houses Bluetooth connectivity and DAB radio.Volkswagen also - importantly - includes two charging cables, one amp unit for use at wallboxes and charge points and another amp cable for charging at the mains.VERDICTThe plucky e-Up! has hit the nail on the head. No, it cant deliver the headline ranges boasted by larger EVs, but with around  miles per charge it can offer a genuinely useable range. Short trips to town and even longer journeys will unlikely trouble the bottom end of the range, while that ability to fast charge means thatyou do need to plug in, you wont be waiting all that long.Most importantly, however, the e-Up! is fun, and thats certainly an aspect which many EVs have missed from the process of driving.FACTS AT A GLANCEModel: Volkswagen e-Up!Price as tested: pound, Engine: Electric motor with batteriesPower: .bhpTorque: NmMax speed: mph-mph: . secondsMPG: N AEmissions:  g km CORange:  miles"},{"url":null,"title":"letters-fond-memories-maestro","story":"Johnny knew how to work both a stage and an audience.

Why have so many native Gaelic speakers chosen not to pass on their first language to their children  One answer is they decided the language was a hindrance, rather than a asset for their childrens future employment prospects, as they perceived it had been for them. Until this mindset is changed, the decline in numbers speaking the language will continue.The solution is increased use of the Gaelic, as a transactional language, spoken in shops, churches, public service buildings and the Scottish Parliament. This is the only way the value of Gaelic will be increased amongst its native speakers. This process could be started immediately by the SNP Government and its Gaelic speaking MSPs Kate Forbes and Alisdair Allan using the language in their workplace of Holyrood, frequently. The remaining native Gaelic speakers need to urgently validate Gaelic by using it in their workplaces. I believe this is the only way to save Gaelic as a living language.Iain Campbell, Dollar.I READ Alistair Grants article in support of retaining the use of the Gaelic language hoping to understand the need for its retention and was left feeling that he simply shot himself in the foot.He mentions the research which prophesies the danger of the day-to-day use of Gaelic dying out by the end of the decade and the fact that English is more usually spoken in families where both parents are Gaelic speakers.Now retired, I can count on one hand the Gaelic speakers I have met in my letime and like many others was rather surprised when our place names and department buildings were given Gaelic sub-titles.

Willie Ross, of the Oxford Bar in Edinburgh, was in a class of his own when it came to abrasiveness. Photos show him presiding over his fiefdom, with a face like a hanging judge and a fag in his mouth. Described as instilling ldquosomething close to a sense of terror in customers, he apparently wouldnrsquot serve the English or women. Food was also verboten. Legend has it that when one hapless customer, a QC, askedhe could see the menu, Ross took him by the arm and led him out into the street. Pointing up at the pubrsquos signboard, he said, ldquoWhere does it say f***ing restaurant .No fan of the Edinburgh Festival and its luvvies, he once put up a sign saying, ldquoClosed due to Festival. When I first visited, however, the Oxford Bar was under new management, and far more inviting. By this time Ian Rankin had placed it on the tourist map as Inspector Rebusrsquos local. The countless sightseers who troop into this literary landmark would have got a taste of an altogether grimmer Scotland had Ross still been in charge.The real-ale pub where I used to live was the ideal establishment. The owner had a wicked sense of humour, and tolerated peculiarities on both sides of the bar. On St Patrickrsquos Day hersquod offer a two-for-three deal on all drinks. Other than crisps and peanuts, food was not available, no matter how hard we pleaded. He did, however, allow taxi drivers to bring in their slow cooker after a morning sht, and ladle out chilli con carne while they played cards. In the early evenings, one bloke would bring in a cheese board, and invite everyone to pile in. A mountaineering bicyclist often arrived smelling of woodsmoke and handed out tinfoil parcels of delicious trout, cured in his garden shed. Another old-timer used to produce leeks from his allotment, which he passed beneath the bar in paper bags, like smugglersrsquo contraband. When one night I was cornered by a man who could bore for an hour without drawing breath, the landlord paraded around the crowded room, waving a white flag to summon a rescue party.In an era where the customer comes first, the days of martinets like Ross or the lady of the loch are numbered.

What Balon would have thought about this development would likely be unprintable.Over the years Irsquove spent more hours in pubs than I care to remember, but while the occasional off-taking quip is amusing, serious rudeness makes me head where. Willie Ross, of the Oxford Bar in Edinburgh, was in a class of his own when it came to abrasiveness. Photos show him presiding over his fiefdom, with a face like a hanging judge and a fag in his mouth. Described as instilling ldquosomething close to a sense of terror in customers, he apparently wouldnrsquot serve the English or women. Food was also verboten. Legend has it that when one hapless customer, a QC, askedhe could see the menu, Ross took him by the arm and led him out into the street. Pointing up at the pubrsquos signboard, he said, ldquoWhere does it say f***ing restaurant .No fan of the Edinburgh Festival and its luvvies, he once put up a sign saying, ldquoClosed due to Festival. When I first visited, however, the Oxford Bar was under new management, and far more inviting. By this time Ian Rankin had placed it on the tourist map as Inspector Rebusrsquos local. The countless sightseers who troop into this literary landmark would have got a taste of an altogether grimmer Scotland had Ross still been in charge.The real-ale pub where I used to live was the ideal establishment. The owner had a wicked sense of humour, and tolerated peculiarities on both sides of the bar. On St Patrickrsquos Day hersquod offer a two-for-three deal on all drinks. Other than crisps and peanuts, food was not available, no matter how hard we pleaded. He did, however, allow taxi drivers to bring in their slow cooker after a morning sht, and ladle out chilli con carne while they played cards. In the early evenings, one bloke would bring in a cheese board, and invite everyone to pile in. A mountaineering bicyclist often arrived smelling of woodsmoke and handed out tinfoil parcels of delicious trout, cured in his garden shed. Another old-timer used to produce leeks from his allotment, which he passed beneath the bar in paper bags, like smugglersrsquo contraband. When one night I was cornered by a man who could bore for an hour without drawing breath, the landlord paraded around the crowded room, waving a white flag to summon a rescue party.In an era where the customer comes first, the days of martinets like Ross or the lady of the loch are numbered. I canrsquot say Irsquom altogether sorry. Yet although a good bartenderrsquos manner is part of what draws people back, they canrsquot be bland or dull. Itrsquos a demanding job, and a touch of authority and steel is essential. People capable of handling humanity at its most outspoken, vocal and occasionally insufferable, are rarely naturersquos sweet sherry. I like to think of those with the saltiest personalities as an acquired flavour, like a peaty Islay malt. Ideally, a publican sits midway between the two: a New Zealand sauvignon, perhaps, or dry GT.Itrsquos a job I certainly couldnrsquot handle, especially in a busy city centre. My husband recalls that our wedding ceremony in a Glasgow registrarrsquos office took less time than ordering a drink in the Horseshoe bar. I remember joining him there one evening, when two women arrived and asked for two white wines. ldquoSmall, medium or large  asked the impeccably polite bartender. ldquoBottles, they replied.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Were all living under restrictions none of us relish at the moment, but that doesnt change the fact that Scotland is an open, welcoming country and I think the vast majority of people would want us always to be so and never want to see a message sent from the UK Government that contradicts that in any way.\"Ms Sturgeon added: \"In my view, it is essential that care home workers are included in any scheme for post-Brexit work visas.\"The Scottish Government will continue to make strong representations on that point to the UK Government.\"Ms Sturgeon argued \"excluding social care workers from the ability to apply for a health and care visa to come and work here is sending the wrong message and is sending message that we dont hugely appreciate the work of those staff\".The First Minister added: \"Donald Macaskill did say it was a slap in the face, that was his terminology, but I dont think he is wrong that that is the message it risks sending.\"And I would hope the UK Government, who I am sure would not want to send that message, I hope they will reflect on the risk they are running there.\""},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11492613.jpg?type=article-full","title":"zero-waste-scotland-launches-campaign-urging-people-bin-litter-take-home","story":"The publicly-funded organisation has launched a new campaign: Scotland is Stunning ndash Letrsquos Keep It That Way, which aims to inspire people getting out and about to enjoy the great outdoors without leaving litter, reminding them they should either bin litter or take it home.The campaign, which highlights the beauty of our lochs and mountains, city parks and country woodlands, is backed by the Scottish Government and Keep Scotland Beautul.As lockdown eases, Scotlandrsquos tourism industry is set to reopen more widely from Wednesday th July.Local businesses and the tourism industry in general across Scotland are counting on an increase in trade to support them through what are dficult economic times. Scotlandrsquos unspoilt scenery plays a vital role in encouraging people to enjoy our country and support businesses, but this can only happenareas of beauty remain in their original pristine state.The partners behind the campaign jointly condemn scenes of abandoned campsites, burned out trees and human waste, as well as litter, as being hugely damaging to Scotlandrsquos reputationIain Gulland, Chief executive of Zero Waste ScotlandIain Gulland, Zero Waste Scotland chief executive, said:ldquoPeople are understandably keen to enjoy everything Scotland has to offer as the summer holidays stretch out in front of us. With tourism re-opening in Scotland and many areas ndash from hills and lochs in rural Scotland, to city parks ndash expecting an increase in visitors, we want to remind people to bin their litter or take it home. ldquoThis opportunity to get outdoors is great news. If you are camping, exercising, having a barbecue or just enjoying the scenery, have fun, but remember to bin what you donrsquot need or take it with you. Go home with happy memories and leave the place litter free so others can do the same. We know Scotland is stunning, letrsquos keep it that way!The Scotland is Stunning ndash Letrsquos Keep It That Way campaign will be rolled out across social media channels from today , for five weeks across Scotland. Partners and community groups are encouraged to download the free campaign toolkit, which includes digital tools and posters and are available for anyone who wants to get the message to daytrippers and staycationers to bin litter or take it home.As well as being an eyesore, dropping litter is a criminal offence. Discarded waste can also be a danger to young children and animals and it is estimated that % of marine litter washing up on our beaches started out on land.Perth-based Willowgate Activity Centre takes visitors on adventure days out to enjoy activities such as kayaking, paddle boarding and open water swimming. The company runs regular community litter picks and nature education programmes, and recently reopened after being closed for  weeks due to coronavirus.Emily Hamilton-Peach with litter collected from the River TayEmily Hamilton-Peach, assistant manager at Willowgate, said:ldquoWe regularly see litter that has floated down the River Tay from people leaving it in the park and this volume has recently increased.

How tactically to achieve that is the decision to be made by the movement.There is logic in the case for the SNP not standing on the List, becausethe votes pile up but the seats do not come due to the constituency victories. Is it sensible to waste those votes, when a tactical move, letting another group stand in place of the SNP, would see them produce pro-independence MSPs  With her party hat on, the first reaction of the SNP leader has been to say no. But I would suggest that she and others who have spoken should think again. The SNP has been successful in creating an independence movement which has many activists and voters who do not align themselves with its social and economic policies. Their views cannot be dismissed in favour of a narrow party interest. I would urge the SNP leader to think again on the role this new Alliance for Independence group can play towards the necessary mandate.As for the new Alliance for Independence, internally it will require goodwill among the political groups it seeks to weld into a single List in each region from which there will be a chance of election. Placement on the List, determining that chance, will be important to each dferent component of the coalition, and I hope that dficulty, and it will be a dficulty, can be managed. The tragedy will beMs Sturgeon does not realise that those who form the Alliance have as much right to contribute to strategy and tactics as she. The sensible thing now would be to talk to them.Jim Sillars, Edinburgh EH.THROUGHOUT this pandemic a group of contributors to your Letters Pages have routinely found fault with the actions of our First Minister in dealing with the Covid- virus. Nicola Sturgeon has been accused of going too slowly she has been accused of going too quickly. She has been accused of simply copying actions taken by Downing Street and she has been accused of taking Scotland on a dferent path from that being pursued in England. She is damnedshe does and she is damnedshe does not. Things though must be pretty desperate for her criticsour First Minister is now attacked for her choice of personal protection. The letter by Dr Edwardssuggesting that for Nicola Sturgeon to wear a tartan face covering is somehow politicising the pandemic is frankly risible. He claims that she aspires to be some sort of \"super heroine\" on a mission to \"save Scotland\". What nonsense.There are two problems for Dr Edwards and his fellow-critics. Firstly he should read the Daily Update figures printed each day on Page  of The Herald. Here he will see the dramatic fall in the number of infections recorded in Scotland over the past weeks added to that the fact that at the time of writing, for the last five days there have been no deaths attributable to the virus. If he casts his eye further down to look at the UK figures. then he will see quite a dferent story. Frankly I find it depressing that the undoubted success achieved thus far by the Scottish Government working with our NHS and care workers in suppressing the virus is never acknowledged by critics such as Dr Edwards.The other problem for such critics is the fact that the steady, thoughtful, progress being charted through this pandemic by the Scottish Government, and so clearly articulated by Nicola Sturgeon, has won the support of the vast majority of Scots.There are more than enough examples of the failings of the UK Government to keep your correspondents busy just now. Your report in the same issue that since January of this year some , children have been admitted to English hospitals suffering from the effects of malnutrition is truly shocking. This scandal has now been followed by details of the new immigration policy for the post-Brexit UK . This will hit hard key Scottish industries such as hospitality, tourism and agriculture. Furthermore, it is a shameful way to treat the large numbers of our migrant care workers on whom we have come to depend, several of whom have lost their lives during this crisis.Eric Melvin, Edinburgh EH.I HAVE taken to summarising Guy Stenhouses articles, to save me reading them in future, and perhaps saving him from writing them.His summary of governmental responses to Covid  is: Scottish Government bad, Westminster Government good.He is right that patients were sent from hospital to residential care without Covid testing Business, July , but no one was discharged with symptoms.It was not known at the time that asymptomatic patients would spread the disease so effectively. The lack of a crystal ball was present throughout the UK and patients were discharged from hospitals in England in the same circumstances. Strange that Mr Stenhouse is not also asking for Matt Hancocks head on a plate.Its also unfortunate that Boris Johnsons announcement of compulsory face masks in shops came too late for his article. Otherwise, he could have pointed out that Nicola Sturgeon was again following the Westminster line, and that Boris had preceded her by at least minus  days.Sam Craig, Glasgow G.THE letter from your correspondent L MacGregormust be an attempt to break the world record for the number of exaggerations, deliberate distortions, misrepresentation and downright lies that can be fitted into a single missive. In a way we should perhaps thank her for her summing up of the tissue of mendacity upon which the case for Scottish independence so heavily relies.These range from the insistence on best-case scenariosto utter fantasyvia financial irresponsibilityto that good old favourite the Independence Time Machine , throwing in for good measure the wilful misrepresentation of the devolved fisheries border of  as an oil field border. The rest of the claims in the letter are also rubbish of the same order.The SNP has recently been advised by a tame academic professor of marketing to abandon facts and tell stories instead ndash a lesson learned from Donald Trump and Aaron Banks and his successful Brexit campaign . Its followers are obviously quick learners.Peter A Russell, Glasgow G.AFTER the human misery and predictable economic failure of a partitioned East Germany, West Germany paid heavily for the reunication, investing billions into the East. If Scotland ever becomes independent and when it inevitably failsit can expect no such support from England because of the toxic anti-English rhetoric that is the default position of the economic theory-free zone of the nationalists. Broke and desperate, our future will for sure be as a recipient of ldquoaid from Moscow or Beijing. Can I suggest that even Boris Johnson is preferable to Putin or Xi Jinping John Dunlop, Ayr.IN response to Janice MacKay , Scotland was a country long before most of the present countries of Europe and for some centuries before the United was cobbled together from the ious territories stolen from the inhabitants. Scotland is an inidual country just as England is, and the fact that it is shackled to England by an unfair Treaty of Union does not negate its existence as a nation. When devolution was eventually prised out of Westminster, some small elements of government were restored to Scotland in the hope that this gesture would prevent the natives becoming any more restless. It did not work.Peter Dryburgh, Edinburgh EH.WE are currently bombarded in the media by the views of experts. My Chambers dictionary defines an expert as one who is skilled in any art or science.In his letter today , Douglas Cowe rightly places the word \"experts\" in inverted commas.After listing the supposed benefits of Scottish independence, L McGregor recommends that I read some of the work of true experts, whatever that means, like Dr Tim Rideout. Dr Rideout speaks, of course, in favour of an independent Scotland. Some \"experts\" lean to the political left, some to the right, some to unionism and some to Scottish nationalism.One can iniably find an \"expert\" who happens to suit ones own political leanings.Experts as defined by Chambers are, after all, human.David Miller, Milngavie.THE figures quoted by your columnist Kirsty Hughesto the effect that  per cent of Scottish voters ndash versus % in England ndash would wish to rejoin the EU seems to show that there has been little change in the disposition of overall electoral views regarding Brexit.However, it must lay to rest one belief held by some Remainers: that the narrow margin of victory for Leave in the referendum was due to the larger dferential turnout of elderly voters.Just over four years have passed since the referendum. Plenty of opportunity for members of this cohort to die off, especially since the elderly have been disproportionately affected by Covid-.Perhaps the desire to leave the EU is more widely dfused than previously thought.Christopher W Ide, WaterfootRead more: Former SNP MSP Dave Thompson to quit party to form new party, Alliance for Independence"},{"url":null,"title":"empty-offices-mandatory-masks","story":"The Daily MailRichard Littlejohn believes the lting of lockdown has not been lsquothe great liberation we were all hoping for.rsquoldquoSome of Britainrsquos biggest firms are refusing totheir offices to full capacity, he said. ldquoCompanies in the financial sector, including Barclays and Deloitte, will continue to let up to  per cent of their staff work from home.He said just a tenth of the , Goldman Sachs employees had ed to the office.ldquoThe City of London, the nationrsquos economic powerhouse, may not revert to normal until the New Year, at the earliest.

It is hoped it will increase Kirkwall town centre footfall, while ensuring the safety of the public.Over  BIDs and councils across the UK are taking part in the MonsterHero Safari project, which has been sponsored by Wild in Art, with the aim of raising over £k for NHS Charities Together.Kelly Kirkness, Coordinator at Kirkwall BID said “I really love the Monster Hero Safari concept and I’m delighted we were chosen to participate. Our usual annual hunts are enjoyed by so many families and this contactless version is the perfect solution to keep everyone safe while still enjoying the town during the summer holidays.”Coordinating the national project is Martin Blackwell, former CEO of ATCM and the Charity Retail Association who said: “When I heard about the concept it just resonated with me and I knew I had to support it. I loved the idea of heroes the idea of a “safari on the high street”!

There will of course be some initial changes including managing visitor numbers at certain sites, as well as restricting access to specic locations, but we can assure visitors of a warm welcome as always.“We want to ask our visitors to help create a safe environment by behaving responsibly and following our guidance at properties, and we will be providing further information on our website for visitors to help them prepare for their visit.”HES has also published policy and guidance for the reopening of the properties in its care.The standards have been developed from a wide range of sector and industry advice, guidance and best practice, and set the benchmark for the safe reopening of sites and resumption of operational activities.

In order to allay concerns regarding public safety, VisitScotland, alongside the national tourism bodies of England, Northern Ireland and Wales, announced a new UK-wide industry standard and consumer mark to provide confidence for visitors, communities and tourism businesses alike, as the sector works towards reopening.Since its launch, last month, over , businesses have signed up to the ‘We’re Good to Go’ scheme. A new visitor charter was also created by the national tourism organisation aimed at encouraging safe and responsible travel around the country. Businesses are currently updating their listings on visitscotland with opening information to make it easier for visitors to plan ahead.Malcolm Roughead, VisitScotland chief executive said: “Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover.#The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen. It’s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.“July  marks a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this ‘new normal’, so it’s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.“We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone — visitors, residents and those working within the industry. Recovery will require our collective efforts and we must act as one to ensure the best possible outcomes for the whole of the visitor economy.“For more information on travelling in Scotland visit visitscotlandcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

After monitoring for some time to assess the condition of the animal, and to ascertain whether it was entangled or not, medics were happy that the animal was free-swimming and not caught on anything, however it is in poor condition, for which the prognosis is not good. Unfortunately, as the tide as dropped the animal stranded in shallow water. Medics say that they have remained on scene throughout the day, to monitor its breathing rate from the safety of the shore, and to ensure it is not disturbed “whilst nature takes its course.”They added that unfortunately, with a whale of this size, humane euthanasia to prevent further suffering is not an option, and with it being in very poor health and malnourished it would be highly unlikely to survive at sea. Whilst this whale is not fully grown, it is likely to weigh in excess of  tonnes, which means whilst it is stranded out of the water it is crushing itself under its own bodyweight which will cause internal damage too. Unfortunately refloating a whale of this size once it has stranded is also impossible due to its size and weight. Adult fin whales can reach in excess of  metres inand weigh up to  tonnes.The medics added: “Whilst medics are on the scene monitoring the whale, the landowner has requested that no one  attends and we would ask that everyone please respects his wishes. The local Coastguard team have also been in attendance too.”An update will follow.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It will see the installation of a new  kilovoltcable which follows the existing route from Murkle Bay, near Thurso, to Rackwick Bay in Hoy. The cable is expected to arrive by Wednesday next week, July .SSEN has said the installation of the new cable will allow for the removal of some sections of existing overhead line on Hoy, to be replaced with underground cable. Work is expected to be completed by November, following an extension of the programme to avoid construction during bird breeding season on the island.Mark Rough, director of customer operations, with SSEN, said: “We’re committed to ensuring a safe, secure and reliable supply of electricity to our customers and this critical investment project is an essential part of that commitment.“We’d like to thank all stakeholders for their feedback on our proposals during our open-door events last year. Following consultation, we’ve scheduled installation to minimise disruption on local marine le, with the works also planned to avoid the main breeding seasons for key bird populations.“I’d like to reassure our customers that our teams and contracting partners continue to adhere to social distancing measures and Government guidance to protect the safety of the local community as we carry out this signicant programme of works.”The Pentland Firth East cable was identied for replacement after routine inspections found it was coming to the end of its operational le. In July , SSEN successfully completed repairs to the cable in Rackwick Bay following a cable fault. While customer power supplies were not impacted by this fault, a long-term solution was required to maintain a safe, secure and reliable power supply to homes and businesses in Orkney.For more information on the Pentland Firth East cable replacement project, click here.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

But he soldiered on to complete his first nine holes in an estimable  shots.Goodness only knows what happened at half time but he required only  shots for the second nine, a gross score of  and a nett  which was to be the joint lowest nett score recorded during the whole weekend.Great stuff there and with a higher handicap than all those around him and very much in contention he has nothing to lose in the second and final round.Best wishes Ross-great play!Of course that#s only one round gone but with one still to play the likeliest contenders to depose those already occupying the qualying positions could be Chris Mackinnon, Murdo Gordon, John Finlayson, Robert Macaskill or even Dan Macdonald.Chris was  , Murdo#s halves were  , John#s loops were  , Robert was   and finally young Dan was  .All these guys have a chance depending on how the leaders perform next time out but an honourable mention for John Finlayson who, like Ally Young in the RNLI Shield last time out compiled a fine score in the worst of the conditions.Sunday dawned cold, wet and very windy and both he and his companion for the day wondered at the outset whether they would be able to complete their round as the greens were already holding water.Two birdies in the final three holes of the first nine must have inspired John to dig in and that is exactly what he did to retain his chance of qualication.Although the competition is played off scratch the four players with the best two-round handicap scores will compete for the consolation #handicap# championship.A meritorious performance here to consider for inclusion might well come from Hamish Philp whose nett  off a  handicap was a terric performance in his renaissance as a golfer.Obviously off that highish handicap his numbers won#t compare too favourably with the #lower# men but two loops of  and  in the steady Saturday morning rain should give him a tremendous boost of confidence for both round two and the rest of this fledgling season Sunday morning#s weather conditions meant the scheduled ladies’ competition was abandoned without a ball being hit.However, a couple of days later a lovely sunny and warm Tuesday welcomed a small group for another round in the Glamaig Stableford competition and yet again Sandi Beatson was declared to be the clear winner.That#s four successive victories and this time the margin was six points over her nearest pursuants Sandra Dew and Shona Jackson.With respect the scoring wasn#t great but was readily acceptable within the confines of the competitors and that#s plenty good enough.The first midweek competition of this much-delayed men#s season was played for the Strath Cup.This trophy is usually decided on a season-long, best three from four scores basis but the club mandarins have to cut and paste a structure in this necessarily compressed playing season to keep the members and competitors happy so it was all or nothing in one single day.And what a day it turned out to be with warm sunshine and just a whisper of a breeze for the thirteen hours of competition.The fly in the ointment though was John-the-Greens# concept of what constitutes a #challenging# hole position on his well-nourished, nicely manicured putting surfaces.Rumour has it that he#s #a bit of a player# but as he#s yet to strike a single ball in anger the jury remains quite positively indecisive on that one.However, on the assumption that he does actually play the #great game# his mischievous positioning of pins-when he doesn#t have to try to access them-is causing some consternation and rabble#s babble.Irrespective of the pin positions however, Batman and Robin were at it again as playing companions for yet another highly successful day.Archie Macaskill and John Maclean reprised their excellent performances from round one of the Club Championship last weekend to finish first and second respectively.Off the tee in the second group of the day and having overtaken the trio of old boys in front they were the first players to log their scores and their totals were to remain nonpareil all day long despite a mighty challenge from the large group of competitors.Archie won the trophy and took the honours with  points, his two nines being  and .Going out-of-bounds with his tee shot on the fourth hole was to cost him an  but he immediately secured a birdie  on the very next hole to get him up and running again.Celebrating his th birthday on the course that very day the youngster went on to finish strongly with two more birdies in the final three holes of his round-great stuff and very well done.John Maclean is playing more golf than for many a year as the pandemic has meant that his tourism-related business is closed and is likely to remain so for the time being.But that has allowed him to play more golf, work on his game and slowly but surely his handicap is coming down. shots were required for the first half and  for the second was good enough for  points and also included three birdies so the dynamic duo obviously gel very well on the golf course.Eased out of second place by virtue of the better inward half Lou Gordon nevertheless ed a highly creditable score

And in addition to Mel Gibson#s epic offering, Gary said that there are plans to host another two films in August as well as a spooktacular screening in October.#Because the event was so popular, we have organised another two on nd and rd of August as well.#After that, we have plans to screen movies on Halloween # we#ll probably show a family-type film such as Ghostbusters # because it will be darker earlier # and then we#ll be able to show a classic horror film at midnight, which will be really cool!#: #As a big film fan I’ve been known to travel hundreds of miles to see a particular film, so the opportunity to see a classic like Back to the Future at a drive-in cinema on Skye was an unmissable cultural event. #This is a film which as a nine-year-old I saw five times in the cinema and have lost count how many times I’ve seen it since. #This event proved just how vital, uplting, and unique the cinema experience can be, and one which we will all remember for years to come. #I can’t wait until the next time!#The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until th July .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3210341.jpg--.jpg?1593777277000\n","title":"buick pupils efforts earn school an eco flag honour","story":"Buick Memorial Primary School in Cullybackey has been awarded a prestigious Eco-Schools Green Flag by the environmental charity Keep Northern Ireland Beautul. The Eco-Schools Programme is the world’s largest Environmental Education programme and aims to make environmental awareness and action an intrinsic part of the le and ethos of a school. Its participatory approach and combination of learning and action makes it an ideal way for schools to begin improving the environments of schools and their local communities. Eco-Schools work through a simple seven-step process resulting in the programme becoming central to the schools ethos. Schools can choose from ten eco-topics ranging from litter and waste to energy, bioersity and transport to name a few. Eco-Schools work towards achieving awards - bronze, silver and the prestigious Green Flag.The internationally recognised Green Flag is this highest award given to Eco-Schools and symbolises excellence in the field of environmental activity. Over the past two years, pupils of Buick Memorial have been working hard on many initiatives in order to address their chosen topics of Waste, Litter and Bioersity. Together with Eco Coordinators Mrs Carleton and Miss Stirling, they have produced policies on printing, recycling and litter for staff and pupils within the school to follow. Their continued commitment to regular Cash for Clobber collections enabled the school to purchase a number of new bins for the playground. Thanks to Catherine Hunter, Mid and East Antrim Education Officer, the children were able to give each class a bin for food waste, allowing the Eco Club to produce compost for their many planting activities. A highlight of the Eco-School endeavours is the annual litter-pick with Cullybackey Community Partnership and thanks must be given in particular to Margaret Murphy who is always keen to help the children in any way she can. The school is extremely grateful to Cranswick Country Foods for providing a superb wooden structure for the ‘plastic bottle greenhouse’ project and to Barry Tapster, Mid and East Antrim Recycling Officer, for his guidance. This year has been exceptionally busy, with the introduction of a termly ‘Walking Week’ which the pupils and parents have strongly supported. The Eco Club have spent a lot of time tending to the school pond area building mini-beast and frog hotels, making bird feeders and planting flowers for pollinators amongst many other tasks. None of these opportunities would have run as smoothly were it not for the unwavering input from Mr Fleckand the dedication of Ms Harkin . The positive attitude and increased awareness of environmental issues is evident within the school from Nursery through to P and this Green Flag is a welcome acknowledgement of the children’s efforts.The International Eco-Schools Programme is operated in Northern Ireland by Keep Northern Ireland Beautul and is a free to enter programme.

It shows that the overwhelming majority of Catholic schools teach a more modern unit, which covers - and majors on the civil rights campaign and the Troubles.But just under half of state schools teach the - period instead, which features the Second World War.The survey was carried out by two Year  classes in Stoke-on-Trent and Lancaster during lockdown. Read MoreMichael Davies:Opinion Why NI syllabus needs to be rewritten so pupils can learn both #sides# of the story It was conducted under the auspices of the Parallel Histories charity. Its founder Michael Davies revealed tothat a definitive bias along denominational lines was found.Four out of  state schools, for which data was available, taught the earlier - unit, compared with just one in  Catholic schools.Mr Wilson said he believed this was because those teachers viewed their audience as less homogenous than in Catholic schools. Maybe they are more fearful of offending pupils in this era of oversensitive snowflake students, or in some instances snowflake parents, said the DUP#s Westminster education spokesperson.Mr Wilson, a former teacher, added: Also, there seems to be this middle-class Protestant guilt complex among many history teachers who seem to be unwilling to challenge some of the nonsense which is portrayed in history text books. I can remember parents raging about some of the content of textbooks when I was teaching and I used to protest to the history department, without any success.Mr Wilson said it was ironic that Catholic schools have been far more willing to take teaching material produced by the Orange Order. State schools and voluntary schools seem to think that it might demonstrate some kind of religious or political bias. SDLP West Tyrone MLA Daniel McCrossan said: It#s concerning that there#s such a clear correlation between the religious background of a school and the period of our recent history that they choose to teach. There#s a real risk thatyoung people don#t engage with the parts of our history that may be uncomfortable or challenging for them, that we#ll double down on ision for another generation.Every GCSE history student here should have an equal opportunity to explore our struggle for civil rights as well as learning about the contribution that people from Northern Ireland made in the fight against fascism. Learning more about each other, experiencing everyone#s history, can only ever be a good thing and we need to be encouraging it as early as possible.Alliance MLA Kellie Armstrong said: For far too long those invested in ision have enabled and prolerated segregation through education. Constant reflection on how CCMS #saved# Catholic education, or the DUP#s belief kids all should be brought into the state-controlled system, hides the fact our education system is failing to meet the needs of children.She said that the CCEA curriculum enabled teachers to pick modules and parts of coursework they recognise and with which they were comfortable. It#s easier to teach one side of the narrativethat#s the only narrative you have known, she said.By maintaining separate teacher training colleges and the exemption from Fair Employment in schools, we are allowing a Troubles narrative to permeate our teaching body.

This can include a piece of paper towel or silk.If you make a pocket in the middle of the mask the paper towel slip can be changed every time it is washed.let embedUrl  https:belfasttelegraph.bbvms p twocol_article c .jstry .textContentembedUrl +  dart_gs_channels +  catchconst el  documentel.async  trueel.src  embedUrldocument.getElementByIdChildHow do I fit my mask properly Have it tightly fitting in order to block droplets coming from the mouth.It also needs to fit around the chin and cheeks.

Photo by Peter MorrisonMark BainTwitterEmailJuly   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailFour months ago, the future looked bleak for Co Fermanagh beauty therapist Jeanette Guy.Having already been forced to pull the shutters down on her Flawless Beauty salon in Irvinestown, and with her other role at the spa in Lough Erne Golf Resort on hold due to Covid-, the prospect of losing the business she had spent eight years building up was very real.In the end the answer to her worries was closer to home than she thought and rather than sit back and let her salon dreams disappear she embarked on some new business-building of her own.Just a few weeks later she#s taken working from home to a whole new level and completed her own fully equipped day-spa and beauty salon in her back garden.The beauty industry has been hit really hard by coronavirus, said Jeanette, who will be welcoming the first clients to her newly constructed business base this morning.I actually had to close down the salon a couple of weeks earlier than others as my severe asthma put me in the high risk category. I had to shield, so I just couldn#t work.For a while at the start it was very dficult to see a way back, she said.I bought a hot tub to cheer myself up at the start of all this as I knew I#d be spending a lot of time at home, but by Easter time, when there looked to be little prospect of getting back to the salon in the near future, I started to think about ways to try to keep the business going before it was too late.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseJeanette Guy from Irvinestown turned a space in her garden into a beauty salon day spa.The log cabin was built fully equipped for all beauty treatments and a hot tub which is complimentary for clients.Photo by Peter Morrison FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappJeanette Guy from Irvinestown turned a space in her garden into a beauty salon day spa.The log cabin was built fully equipped for all beauty treatments and a hot tub which is complimentary for clients.Photo by Peter MorrisonI started to think that maybe working from home was going to be the future for me.My kids, Sasha and Corey, were out in the garden, helping to tidy things up and paint fences. The space was there so I thought why not give it a go  It just seemed too good an idea not to try, said Jeanette.Jeanette#s boyfriend, Kieran Fee, by day a plumber based in Dublin, stepped in and despite neither of them having any real building experience, they took the plunge and set about creating a home-designed, purpose built log cabin around the hot tub.To be honest, we had no idea how it would turn out. Neither of us have done anything like this before, but we worked hard, roped in the kids to help and a couple of Kieran#s friends.Jeanette is just putting the finishing touches to her new spa, which also houses her own beauty salon, ready for the first clients to arrive.It#s exciting but I#m nervous too as you never know what people will think until you let them come in, she said.I#m lucky that I had built up a good number of loyal customers over the years and hopefully they will see the effort I#ve put in to keep the business going and continue to support me.We had no professional help, no contractors and learned as we went along. We started off with a base of  wooden pallets and just went from there, learning all the time, coming up with new ideas along the way.It#s a complete DIY job but I#m delighted with the way it#s turned out. I got exactly what I wanted.I#m always tempted now just to go in there and lock the door to have the place to myself, but as it#s separate from the house I can close the door on the business at night and walk away, eventhat is hard to do!Jeanette is again ready to offer the full range of day spa and beauty treatments, but admitted she#s still nervous about getting the business up and running again.At the start of this I didn#t knowit would survive, she said. Like so many more in the beauty industry the work just stopped overnight with no idea of when we would be able to get back to working again earning money again.I was terried in this first few weeks. I#m terried again but for a dferent reason. We#ve put a lot of hard work into this project and getting it ready to operate. Now the scary bit is seeingit takes off.But I think a lot more beauty salons will be looking at the option of operating from home in the future. It will be a struggle for all of them to survive after what has been a terribly scary time.Find out more about Jeanette#s Flawless Beauty at www.facebook Flawlessbeautybynetty   Belfast   Most ReadTwelfth : Hundreds ignored social distancing, but Orange Order insists #vast majority# complied Malachi O#DohertyOpinionSo, Gerry Adams waits  years to tell us he doesn#t believe in consent principle and no one even noticesPSNI investigates Belfast band’s parade restrictions breachCoronavirus Northern Ireland: No further Covid- deaths and two new cases reportedFace masks QA: How to stop glasses steaming up, and can you use the same one twice ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Photo by Kelvin Boyes  Press E FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp Lisa SmythTwitterJuly   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailCovid- claimed more lives in east Belfast than in any other part of Northern Ireland during the first spike of the deadly virus, it can be revealed.Official figures have provided a comprehensive breakdown of the Covid- death rates, according to each victim#s usual postcode up to the end of May.They have shown that the deaths of  residents in parts of east Belfast - including some of the most affluent parts of the city, such as Stormont and Ballyhackamore - were registered by May . A further  deaths of people living in Castlereagh, Clarawood, Gilnahirk and Knock had been registered by the same date.All parts of Belfast were badly affected by the virus, according to the figures released by the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency .There were  Covid- deaths registered in north Belfast, which takes in the likes of Crumlin Road, Ardoyne and New Lodge. A further  deaths were registered for people with postcodes in the area including the Shankill Road and Ballygomartin.There were  deaths attributed to the virus in south Belfast, although the figures show that Saintfield Road, Four Winds, Carryduff, Knockbreda and Newtownbreda were worse affected than the Malone Road, Ormeau and Lisburn Road areas.The figures do not state where the person died or where they contracted the virus.However, a number of care homes known to have been at the centre of deadly outbreaks have postcodes matching areas where the NISRA figures show there were a large number of deaths.They have been released as latest Department of Health statistics reveal the death of a hospital patient in Belfast was reported on Friday. No further deaths have been reported. One patient with Covid- is receiving treatment in an intensive care unit.Alliance Party MLA Paula Bradshaw, a member of the Stormont health committee, welcomed the publication of the statistics but called for a full analysis of the data. In particular, Ms Bradshaw said random Covid- testing should be carried out in areas that have experienced high death rates.What we see here is clear evidence of a bias towards urban areas and, in particular, towards locations with care homes, she said.There appears also to be something of a disconnect between where people have died and where people have come forward to be tested. Three issues arise. Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappThe first question is why this information is not more readily available by postcode, including currently with reference to contact tracing. As increasingly, people have to manage risk themselves, they need to be fully informed.The second issue is to ensure that people come forward for testing. We are not using our full testing capacity, indeed there were well under , iniduals tested in the last  hours, so I would urge anyone with symptoms to make the call immediately and get tested.The third point is that, given our testing capacity is not being fully utilised, surely we should now have wider surveillance testing  Should areas like BT now have random testing among the entire population, including antibody testing and perhaps compared with other postcode areas, to see what the prevalence of the virus is or has been This information would be vital to improving our understanding of the virus to ensure we can respond more effectively to any future outbreaks.The Department of Health has been contacted for comment.

Erecting a statue at Windsor Park in recognition of his achievements would be a matter, in the first instance, for the Irish Football Association to consider.I would be happy to lend my support to any campaign that recognises achievements. Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseSupport: Caral Ni Chuilin FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappSupport: Caral Ni ChuilinI would be delighted to extend an invitation to Pat to attend the department#s annual Celebration of Sport event, which recognises sporting achievement while also promoting opportunities for participation and inclusion in sport among our young people.Mr Newton said fans backing the campaign should be encouraged by the minister#s support.Pat#s record as a world-class goalkeeper,  caps for his country, stands favourable comparison with renowned goalkeepers across the world, he said.His  years playing at international level is a record others can only stand back and admire. A statue erected at Windsor Park would, I believe, find favour with the vast majority of Northern Ireland supporters and football fans in general. It#s for those supporters who respect the achievements of Pat Jennings and for the IFA to take the matter forward. Lelong fan Doug Nashfrom Aldershot is leading the campaign and said he was delighted by the latest development.He also revealed that the response from the IFA had been encouraging so far, with more talks expected as business continues toto normal in the coming months.Mr Nash added that the proposed bronze statue would likely be ft tall, and that he was also calling for a knighthood for the big Newry man.I have spoken to one member of the IFA who is really keen on the idea and said he couldn#t see why it couldn#t happen, he said.I have about , followers on Twitter and not one person has a bad thing to say about the campaign or Pat.In my opinion he#s not only one of the best goalkeepers ever, but he does so much behind the scenes that people don#t know about.I#m sure Pat will live to be , but I would love for him to be there when it#s unveiled.Mr Nash said he will now wait to hear more from the IFA before starting any fundraising activities.He has since spoken to sculptor Andrew Edwards, who created the statue of England World Cup-winning goalkeeper Gordon Banks outside Stoke City#s stadium.His work is amazing and he said he would be honoured to help create a statue of Pat. He said he#s willing to create a miniature version of the statue I could use at any presentations.Interestingly enough, he said as well that statues are made one-fth bigger than real le because bronze appears smaller.Obviously Pat is ft tall, so the statue would end up being ft tall.

A PSNI spokesperson told the Belfastthat police are aware of a potentially unnotied parade in the Kilcoole Park area on Saturday.A number of those participating have been identied and we will seek to identy others, the spokesperson said. Enquiries are ongoing and any potential offences will be reported to the PPS for their consideration.A spokesperson for the Parades Commission said that it had received information that the parade took place on Saturday evening and that it was now a matter for the PSNI. The commission spokesperson explained that they had determined on July  that the parade could go ahead with a route restriction prohibiting the parade from entering any part of Kilcoole Park and Kilcoole Gardens. The commission determined that the parade may instead process a section of the Ballysillan Road, the spokesperson said.  “This decision reflected the community relations impacts of this parade in this area.The spokesperson said that the commission informed the PSNI in writing on Friday evening that it could not accept a sensitive parade notication at close of business.The parade was therefore un-notied to the commission. Un-notied parades are a matter for the PSNI, the spokesperson said.“Given the unique circumstances of this year’s Twelfth due to Covid-, the commission acknowledges the high level of responsibility demonstrated by the overwhelming number of parade organisers.”Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseDUP councillor Dale Pankhurst  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappDUP councillor Dale Pankhurst Councillor Pankhurst said that he did not believe the parade broke any rules.He said that he understood a new application had been submitted after the commission waived the  day noticaiton ruling given the Covid- pandemic and the large number of late submissions due to the changing situation around the coronavirus regulations.The law allows for this as I understand it. Notication was given to both the PSNI and the Parades Commission. As this was a revised application and no determination issued on it, no law was broken and everyone had an enjoyable evening, the DUP councillor said. Councillor Pankhurst said despite the concerns of the Parades Commission the event passed off without incident. Their initial decision had the prospect to undo the many years of good work community workers have put in to building up relations in this part of north Belfast, he added.Despite their claims that community relations would be #damaged#, the exact opposite occurred. Everything passed off peacefully, just like I and parade organisers said it would.

Deputy Lord Mayor Paul McCusker said the building of a bonfire at a peace line had heightened tensions leading to disorder in the New Lodge North Queen Street area.There were reports that a father and teenage son were set upon at a nearby shopping centre by young people running from the New Lodge area. Police said the man sustained a head wound requiring hospital treatment.SDLP man Mr McCusker said it was not reflective of the good people of those that live in the New Lodge.He called for parents# support to bring the disturbances to an end, saying children as young as  were involved.ExpandExpandExpandExpandExpandExpandExpandExpandExpandExpandExpandExpandExpandPreviousNextTwelfth : Londonderry parade [Photo]\" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseMembers of the East Bank Protestant Boys Flute Band make their way through Irish Street in Londonderry on Monday as they marked the Twelfth of July.

Parish priest Fr Eamon Graham was delighted to see the community coming together. “Weve just come to end of a very extraordinary week in our parish and community,” he said. “Ive certainly been overwhelmed - I think we all have - by the level of generosity, but I think something even more important was that so many aspects of our community pulled together. googletag.cmd.push “You know, we enjoyed it, enjoyed it very much.

Erin’s Own GAA’s underage footballers and hurlers ran km each, while their senior counterparts ran a collective km. googletag.cmd.push Termoneeny Hill Walking Club had originally pledged to walk a collective km, but upped their target to ,km during the course of their challenge. Termoneeny Cycling Club members each cycled km, while the Erin’s Own camogie players each clocked up at least km. -year-old Harry Boyle’s remarkable contribution saw him cycling around all the townlands in the parish, while Fr Graham and his parochial team got involved by running in their Lavey gear. The challenge was not just limited to Lavey, though, and their diaspora throughout the world got involved via social media, sharing photos of them completing their contribution. The club have raised almost pound, to date and donations can still be made via the Lavey Parish Just Giving page.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I have had several queries from dferent sources about why we can’t just go back to normal appointments. I have prepared a short pieceyou wished to publish in your respective papers. Due to COVID- GP practices have had to adapt like everyone . Despite the wishes of staff and patients that we go back to normal services which includes letting people book their own appointments, it just isn’t possible. googletag.cmd.push We have a duty to all patients as well as our staff. Before any attendance at the practice you will be contacted to make sure you do not have COVID- symptoms. This will be similar for any appointments. We must also remind people not to attend any public placeyou are ill as you should be isolating and getting tested. All services like immunisations, and advice regarding any condition can still be accessed. Practices have become very efficient and even our practice staff are triaging calls to help the smooth and speedy delivery of services. We also have new team members, like physios, social workers, pharmacists and mental health workers. It is vital that you are connected to the correct team member to sort out your problem. googletag.cmd.push The reception staff may ask details regarding the problem to help this process. Practices are still asking people to attend the surgery for tests or examination and to avoid unnecessary trips or exposure we are also using things like video consults. Despite the talk about the ending of lockdown, COVID- is not ending. It is still there and will spread unless we continue to take precautions. This means we cannot have waiting rooms full of patients and allow someone to land in with symptoms and possibly infect a whole waiting room. If you attend the surgery you will be asked to wear a mask. It remains good practice to wash your hands regularly and wear a maskout. Despite the end of lock down, high risk patients remain high risk, and while the government restrictions do not apply, personallyI had been shielding I would continue to limit my contact with crowds during to the risk of infection. We do not have a vaccine yet, and according to figures we are nowhere near herd immunity levels, so any thoughts that COVID- is over are premature. This explains why GPs cannot go back to how things were pre-COVID and may not be able to for some time.We thank the public for their support in this.“ Dr Paul Molloy Western LMC Secretary.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In April of this year Debenhams announced that administrators had been appointed to protect the business. It aimed to open as many stores as possible once Coronavirus restrictions were lted. However, the company said that it would liquidate all  stores in the Republic of Ireland and they were not expected to reopen. More than , Debenhams workers in Ireland were notied that they’d lost their jobs. The Taoiseach Micheaacutel Martin said the company has treated its Irish workers in a very shabby way in depriving them of redundancy entitlements and he believes the law must be re-examined. googletag.cmd.push The Foyleside store reopened once permitted to do so by the government. Today, the Derry News asked Debenhams the long-term future of the store in Derry has been secured at this stage and whether it expects any jobs to be lost due to the COVID- crisis. In response a spokesperson simply said there have been no updates since the store reopened. At the weekend, Debenhams workers from as far afield as Cork protested outside the Debenhams store on Foyle Street in Derry to make consumers aware of what they described as their employer’s despicable actions. However, Mandate Trade Union says the company didn’t set aside finances to pay the workers their agreed redundancy package, having transferred valuable assets to the UK parent company. googletag.cmd.push Valerie Conlon who worked in the Debenhams store on Patrick Street in Cork for  years said: “We are not going to let this company just walk away and not pay. We’ve given decades of service and helped make huge profits for Debenhams so for them to just abandon their responsibilities is a disgrace.” She added: “We will be making everyone aware of how Debenhams treats its workers, andthat means traveling six hours to Derry, so be it. If they can do this to us and get away with it, how do we know it won’t be the workers in Derry next ” John Douglas, Mandate General Secretary said: “I have to commend these workers for standing up and fighting back against their despicable treatment. They’ve travelled to Belfast, they’ve protested outside the Dail, they’ve stood on picket lines all across the country and they’re not going to back down. “These workers have a combined service of over , years. They deserve a satisfactory resolution to this dispute and the company knows what it needs to do. Pay the workers the redundancy they are owed. If they don’t, Mandate Trade Union will continue to support the workers as they campaign for justice.” Niall McCarroll of Derry Trades Union Councilrecalled Clery’s Department store in Dublin closing in  leaving nearly  workers out in the cold, with no redundancy package. Fast forward to  and another  workers face the same situation as Debenhams retail Ireland closing  stores. Retail workers will face growing uncertainty over jobs as we attempt to come out the other end of COVID-. DTUC encourages all retail workers in the city to get organised, join a trade union and begin to strengthen the resistance against the self interests of big business. The demand to strengthen workers rights through more effect legal frameworks must also be met. In the meantime it is imperative everyone stands with the Debenhams workers, in their fight for a decent redundancy package and to be treated with respect and dignity.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Now, at the age of , the well-known Derry man has finally done it. Over the last couple of years, Paddy has been writing his memoirs and, from next week, the Derry News will be publishing extracts of his ,-word story. It is a fascinating story which takes in many aspects of his le, from growing up during World War  to running a business in Derrys city centre throughout the Troubles for  years. However, his working le is only part of Paddys story. After retiring, he embraced a love of learning and graduated with a degree in Irish History and Politics from the University of Ulster at the age of . googletag.cmd.push He admits that he was like a grandfather figure to his young fellow students. He continues to enjoy reading and learning about a host of subjects, particularly history. He is a man who likes to keep busy. “I did not want to retire and spend all day sitting in a chair zapping at the TV,” he said. As a result, the last couple of years have been spent working on his memoirs. Paddy was born in  at  Lone Moor Road, the fourth of eight children born to James and Mary McCaul. Paddy admitted that it had been emotional in writing about his parents. googletag.cmd.push “It was only when I was older that I appreciated how good and hardworking people they were,” he said. “My father would have worked all he could to provide for his family and my mother did everything to make sure that her children were fed and looked after. “I have such admiration for my parents but they were people of their time and thats how things were then.” After leaving school, Paddy worked as a clerk in the Great Northern Railway and the City Surveyors Department in Derry. He started employement as a salesman with electrical appliance company Electrolux in . Through relationships built up in this job, he opened his own shop, McCaul Appliances at John Street in . Within a few years, John Street and the rest of the city centre was targeted regularly as part of the IRA bombing campaign. Paddys shop did not escape. In his memoirs, he recalls on one occasion being held at gunpoint as a bomb was planted in the store. He recalls: “My main focus was not on what was obviously some sort of device but on the shaking hand which held the rather ancient-looking hand gun.” McCauls Appliances relocated for a time to the Waterside, before finding a new base at Quayside Shopping Centre where the store remained until Paddy retired in . However, as already stated, Paddy was not keen on taking things easy during retirement. “I always like to keep active and did not want to end up doing nothing when I retired,” he said. He signed up for a Diploma in Foundation Studies for mature students at the University of Ulsters Magee campus in . He is in no doubt about the impact this had. “That course changed my le,” said Paddy. “I had always been interested in reading since I was a young boy and had enjoyed my time at school. “However, coming from a working class family, the focus was always on getting out of school and finding work so you could start contributing to the family. “So it was great to get the chance to indulge my interest in learning at that later stage of my le.” Paddy said he gained a new lease of le mixing with his young student colleagues and is a big advocate of the importance of education. Despite being in his th year, the Derry man keeps himself active with daily walks along the citys quayside. In his long and eventful le, he has seen many changes, some good, some not so good, in his home town. It is a place he is very proud of and very proud to come from. Whilst acknowledging that he would have been well known in Derry, especially through his involvement in business for many years, Paddy describes himself as just an ordinary Derry man. He says he hopes people enjoy reading the story of his le. He insists it is just the story of an ordinary man. Often, those are the best type of stories.

This sweet and gentle dog was stray for quite some time and covered over  miles on his travels, carrying on even after he was hit by a car. Thankfully, he was brought to Friends of Rescue who gave him a full MOT before nursing him back to health in foster care. Now Miles is looking for a home to call his own, with a very secure garden. We were tracking Miles for over a week and there were sightings of him all over the place, said Friends of Rescue founder, Suzanna Flemming. googletag.cmd.push He was on the run and losing weight quite rapidly. He was hit by a car and still kept running. Thankfully he had no broken bones and was just a little stf and sore, but he had a lot of scarring on his body new and old. After a well deserved bubble bath he was wormed and flead and we got him into foster care and got him fattened up a little bit and neutered, chipped and vaccinated. Miles is a special dog and will need a special home. He is doing his very best in foster but he is still a very nervous man and he will need time, reassurance and most of all patience, said Ms Flemming. googletag.cmd.push Miles would benefit from another dog or dogs in the household but no young children, and this is purely down to his nervousness. And hell obviously need an extra secure garden so that he doesn’t ‘try a Miles’ again He will make an amazing family member. He is sweet, gentle and forgiving. Friends of Rescue had to close its doors due to lockdown but since lockdown has eased it has  dogs and  cats in its care. We have been very busy since the travel restrictions eased, whether this is down to people going back to work, we dont know, said Ms Flemming. The charity started as a rehoming blog around two and half years ago but one dog turned into five and it became a rehoming charity. Friends of Rescue now has six or seven foster families who look after rescued animals while they are treated at the vets and assessed for what type of family would suit them. If you would like to offer Miles a loving home or find out more about the charity you can visit the Friends of Rescue Facebook page.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Speaking to the County Derry Post, as part of the in-depth look at Ulster hurling, both referred to the competition being at its peak during the nineties when Down and Derry were challenging for titles. McCann, who expressed that Antrim would not have any aspirations of being part of the talked about Team Ulster concept, said the Saffrons would be mad keen for aof the Ulster senior hurling championship. The Creggan man is one of two or three to have ever played in the Ulster championship, but feels there would need to be a reward and spoke of how the automatic entry to the All-Ireland semi-finals now being a thing of the past. googletag.cmd.push “Id say we would be mad keen to get it back,” McCann said. “If there was some sort of reward for winning the Ulster championship, you would get a better buy-in from all the teams and when they removed that, it was a road to nowhere.” Down manager Sheehan had a dferent opinion on the need for qualication into the Liam McCarthy Cup to make the Ulster championshipviable. It would be a massive incentive, but felt that Derry and Down would not be at the level of Leinster or Munster and the Joe McDonagh Cup would be their level. googletag.cmd.push McCann felt that the new tiered championship has been really good for Antrim. Last years Joe McDonagh Cup threw up competitive games and their clash with Offaly was among the best games he has seen, but not enough were able to witness it.  Antrim senior hurling captain Conor McCann “It is a shame they are never on TV, the GAA never listen and never do anything about it. They show the odd game and I have no doubt the Christy Ring is the exact same. If the promotion was better, it would definitely help,” McCann stated. Sheehan said he would love to see aof the Ulster championship and its absence reflected poorly on the province. While he accepts Antrim would general win it, he points to Derry winning the last U final and beating Down in the final. “The reality is, an Ulster championship medal means something to people andAntrim felt they didnt want to partake in it, Derry, Down Armagh and the other teams would have an interest in playing in it...but clearly you want Antrim in it,” Sheehan said. The Newry Shamrocks man looked towards Derry or Down being in Division A next season and Antrims chance to be in Division , should they beat Kerry. “That a good for Ulster hurling. It is indicative of the fact there are good hurlers in the province and there are guys in the province who are passionate about it,” he added. Sheehan also mentioned the topic of dual counties trying to attract players to the hurling . “It is very hard to do that, when those lads can get provincial recognition playing in a provincial championship and get on the TV. Their chances of getting some kind of coverage is increased, yet we dont even have our own championship at any level – senior, minor or U. “I make no bones about this, I think the Ulster Council are reneging on their responsibilities by failing to have an Ulsterchampionship,” Sheehan adds. He also indicated how Derry and Down would love to get a crack at an Ulster title. References were made to the crowds at Slaughtneils recent games with Dunloy and Ballyhale. “We are being denied the opportunity to have a show-piece for Ulster hurling and I just think that is wrong. It is the very minimum the Ulster Council should be doing,” the Down boss pleaded. So when do you play it  “Fixtures is something you can always work your way around,” said Sheehan, who was the GPAs representative on the National Fixtures Committee setup by President John Horan last year. “Ideally, you would like to see it played in the summer. I dont know why, with the right kind of work, at the very least the first step could be taken where they could look to morph the McGurk Cup into the Ulster championship. “If we are playing in a pre-season competition, there is no reason why that cant be built up on. Either make it an Ulster championship or mirror it and give people summer hurling.” He doesnt buy into the scenario of clubs clashing with county in the summer. Sheehans solution is train with the county once a week. Give them back to their clubs but still play in the Ulster championship. “Nobody pays the players wages so no manager, club or county, should have exclusive rights to players,” Sheehan stressed. “Players want to be playing matches and managers shouldnt be stopping them from doing that.” Conor McCann agreed on a summer slot for the Ulster hurling championship, but it demanded more respect. “It should be having more of a stature, other things should be moving out of the way for it,” he stated. “We shouldnt be talking about squeezing the Ulster hurling championship in. You dont hear people talking about squeezing the Munster championship into the fixtures, do you ”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Laois man and former Dublin U boss said it would be elitist and wouldnt do anything to improve hurling in the Ulster counties. “To be quite frank, no I am not in favour of it,” McEvoy told the County Derry Post, pointing to the rising tide in Ulster hurling. “Donegal are on top of Division A with Armagh. Derry and Down are on top of Division B. Antrim are on top of A.” McEvoy did admit that it was a Dublin Colleges amalgamation hurling team that started the ball rolling in Dublin. googletag.cmd.push “Youve got to start at the grass-roots,” McEvoy stated. “There is a massive amount of grass-roots work happening in Ulster.” He mentions the Celtic Challenge success for Derry, Antrim and Down. More can be done to promote hurling in Ulster, he feels, in terms of promoting national leagues from Division A down. McEvoy wants all league finals to be played in Croke Park and given the same recognition as football. “Theminor finals are in Croke Park, from the same traditional counties . “I am of the view that there should be a festival of hurling on All-Ireland weekend. The Joe McDonagh, Christy Ring, Nicky Rackard are played on a Saturday and on the Sunday, there is the All-Ireland . googletag.cmd.push “I personally think wedevelop the game we have, we have a good product and it will only benefit from what we are trying to do in the likes of Ulster.” A combined team may work at  or  years of age, but an Ulster senior team isnt a solution, the Derry manager added. “Where would it fit in the calendar  I think it is elitist. Is that going to improve hurling in Derry, or Donegal or Down  I dont think so.” McEvoy is in his second season as Derry boss and hasnt played in the Conor McGurk Cup or the Ulster championship in that time. He feels the players would want the championship back. “I can see the benefit of having an Ulster championship, as opposed to having a consolidated team from all the dferent counties, which is not going to benefit hurling in the dferent counties,” he said. “A provincial championship is a provincial championship. I think there could be a window for it before the Christy Ring,” he added. Despite the poor weather in January and the players tied up in the Club All-Ireland, McEvoy also would see a benefit to it being played in pre-season. “I think that has merit, because it would give you more competitive games. In pre-season, you are looking for challenge matches and surely by having a provincial championship would give you that.”   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

There will be no official Orange Order parades after the organisation announced their cancellation earlier this year. Grand Secretary of the Orange Order, Mervyn Gibson, urged people to stay at home, while the Order have launched a ‘Twelfth at Home’ campaign to urge people to celebrate safely. “This year the Twelfth is about everyone’s health. You have to understand why we cancelled the parades. Parades attract large crowds,” he said. “Bandsmen will simply be going into a village or an estate or a street and playing some music. googletag.cmd.push “We would be saying to everyone to stay at your door, stay in your garden, listen to them and enjoy, butyou see a band, please don’t follow them.” The Parades Commission list for July  includes parades in Maghera, Moneymore, Limavady, Garvagh, Articlave, Tobermore and Magherafelt. Two separate bands will parade in Coleraine, Castledawson and Macosquin, but none will take place simultaneously. Numbers of participants have been capped at , with ten of the thirteen bands applying for the maximum amount, while all but one list the number of planned supporters as . The exception is in Magherafelt, where the Ballymoughan Purple Guards Flute Band have specied an ‘unknown’ number of supporters will be attending the parade. googletag.cmd.push Maghera Sons of William Flute Band said no members of their local Orange Lodge would be parading with the band. “No members of MSOW LOL will be on parade with the band,” they said in a post on their Facebook page. “Social distancing protocol will be followed, and we ask members of the public not to gather around the area of the Orange Hall. “The route is the longest we can do, taking in the majority of the town. We encourage you to stay in your gardens and enjoy the time with your family as the band passes by.” The Ulster Bands Forum, an online  for marching bands, have issued a plea for supporters to protect themselves and the bands. “Bands are going to a lot of effort for you, please afford them the same respect and support,” they said. “Dont follow the band, they will make every effort to come to you. Do not travel outside your local area to see bands. “If you need to use a car to see your local band, stay inside and park safely. Observe social distancing measures at all times. Dont invite all and sundry to your garden. “Lets hold our heads high after this and be able to say we respected and observed our culture whilst staying within the law,” the statement concluded. Mid Ulster District Councillor Paul McLean said the bands have made it clear that everyone should obey safety guidelines. The DUP group on Mid Ulster Council believe bands that have organised such events are clear that they wish everyone to abide by the social distancing regulations and guidelines, he said. They will bring the Twelfth to the community who they ask remain in their homes and gardens and not to participate in the parade.I welcome the bands’ commitment to celebrate proudly and safely and I would ask everyone to do as they have asked. Abiding by the regulations and guidelines ensures our friends, our familIes and our neighbours are protected and demonstrates the ongoing commitment to our NHS.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Dara McNicholl, from Moneyneena, wowed the judges with a stirring rendition of Whitney Houston’s ‘I Have Nothing’. The Moneyneena native made his singing bow in a school play, but his modesty meant his teacher had to ring and let his parents know. “I’ve only really been singing properly for about three years,” he told viewers in the run-up to his performance. ”I just used to hum, but secretly I’d go out into the car and sing along to the radio. Getting on the stage and looking at the amount of people staring at you is much dferent to being in the car. googletag.cmd.push ”Hopefully I have what it takes to make one of the coaches turn around.”  Dara’s parents, Donna and Chris watch on proudly from the wings. In the end, proud parents Donna and Chris watched from the wings with host Emma Willis as all four judges stood up and took notice. Will. I. Am and Danny Jones spun in their seats immediately and it didn’t take long for Paloma Faith and Pixie Lott to follow suit. “You didn’t miss a note, it was crystal-clear. I was blown away by your voice and it gave me goosebumps,” said Paloma Faith afterwards. “I’m actually lost for words, because I feel like I’m in the presence of something really special. I don’t think you realise how good you are,” added Danny Jones. googletag.cmd.push Producer Will.I.Am told Dara he hoped to bring out the best in his abilities, while Pixie Lott said she like the idea of instilling confidence in him as the show progressed. In the end, the St Colm’s Ballinascreen U hurler opted for Team Paloma to take him forward in the competition.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Magnicent Seven Crew is a project made up of singers and musicians from Derry, Dungiven and Sligo. They recently joined forces to help Foyle Foodbank with their role of providing food for those who are experiencing food poverty. The entertainment industry has been hit hard as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. With pubs closed, many singers and musicians lost their main source of income overnight. However, many local entertainment figures have been involved in fundraising initiatives during the lockdown. The Magnicent Seven Crew project was coordinated by local musician Leo Fitzpatrick who through his vision, enthusiasm, talent and commitment managed to achieve their target of pound, for the local foodbank. googletag.cmd.push The project saw up to  entertainers perform from home and encourage donations from those who tuned in nightly to see them. The Magnicent Seven Crew project went live on Facebook on Friday, May , and within eight weeks had achieved its target. Speaking on behalf of the Board Of Directors and volunteers at the Foyle Foodbank, Damien McAdams praised everyone involved in the recent fundraiser. “Night after night the entertainers give freely of their time and talent to produce a series of excellent performances,” he said. “Some of the performers it should be noted have lost their main source of income as a result of this pandemic and some are dealing with their own dficult health issues yet they have been determined in their willingness to help those most in need. googletag.cmd.push “The generosity of the Derry public and further afield has been amazing. “Its important to point out that all of the performers performed free of charge and all donations went to the Foyle Foodbank.” Mr McAdams added: “We would like to take this opportunity to thank all those singers, musicians and Leo Fitzpatrick for their magnicent achievement. “We also wish to acknowledge the great generosity of all those who donated in any way to the Foyle Foodbank.” The Foyle Foodbank says it has seen a sharp increase in demand for help during the lockdown period.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Forbes, from Ardboe, is one of eight new additions to the clubs Academy on a a full-time scholarship deal. “This group of players are at a pivotal moment in their footballing development as they transfer from being schoolboy players into a full-time football programme. As of July, they are full-time employees of the Club and they’ll be getting paid to play the sport they love, commentedAcademy Manager, Ricky Martin. “This will also provide them with an opportunity where they can spend more contact time with the Academy, as they will now be undertaking daily training and educational programmes. googletag.cmd.push “I would like to take this opportunity to thank the players’ parents for their dedicated support in their sons development at the Academy, which has meant several trips every week for them to training and matches. Now, they are able to see their sons become more independent and have more responsibility for their development, as they become full-time players.” Forbes was refereed to as a tough-tackling centre-half on the Hammers website after his recent arrival at the club. He came in on trial and got on really well with the lads. I think he could have a big future at the club hopefully he can attack pre-season training and show everyone what he’s all about. googletag.cmd.push Michael follows in the footsteps of fellow St Pius pupil Aaron Donnelly who signed for Nottingham Forest. They played on the same school GAA team and Forbes was on the side that qualied for this seasons MacLarnon Cup final. RELATED- St Pius and St Patricks may get to play in showpiece finals.

Like many others, the  year-old Derry driver has had to wait later than planned to get his season underway with events being rescheduled due to the Covid- pandemic. Rally di Roma Capitale in Italy will now open the series next week. Having shaken the establishment on his R debut at this level on Rally Hungary last year where he took a podium finish, Devine is determined to show that that resultwasn’t a once off. “We’re really looking forward to this event”, said Devine. “Obviously it’s been quite a wait to get out competitivelyagain so little things like getting a test in the car last week and unveiling the livery all add to the build up morethan usual. The car looks great and I’m extremely thankful to all our partners. googletag.cmd.push We showed inHungary last year some of what we are capable of but this will be a very dferent challenge with a very strong entry. With a curtailed championship too it means more than ever we’ll have to on it from the word go.” Devine’s involvement with the Motorsport Ireland Rally Academy and Hyundai’s Junior Driverprograms has kept him busy over the last number of months as the start of the season was delayed. “Being involved in those initiatives has been a great help at keeping focused over the last while andwill hopefully stand to me when we cross the start line”, Callum said. “At this level it can be thosesmall things that make the dference. Hyundai have also carried out a lot of development on the iR too and that will be great, not just for me, but for the competitiveness of the championship.” googletag.cmd.push Callum as usual, will be partnered by Brian Hoy and the Hyundai will be run by Irish rally preparation firm, PCRS. The all Irish team will also be entered officially under the Motorsport Ireland Rally Academy banner making them eligible to score points in the ERC Teams Championship too. However,it’s another championship that Callum is eyeing up. “The ERC Junior Championship is undoubtedlyour focus this season because of the prize fund on offer, there aren’t many prizes like that in rallying.” Rally di Roma Capitale will begin on Friday, July  with pre-event practice and shakedown before the event properly gets underway on Saturday which will see Callum and Brian tackle six stages before a further nine stages on Sunday conclude the event. The competitive mileage of the event will come in at just under km which and the event is operating a very strict Covid- policy, with restrictions on spectators as well as all registered personnel.

which inform drivers about their speed are to be erected in Downpatrick, Newcastle, Killyleagh and Castlewellan by the districtrsquos Policing and Community Safety Partnership.The signs are to be erected at the Strangford Road in Downpatrick, Newcastlersquos South Promenade, Castlewellanrsquos Dublin Road and the Shrigley Road in Killyleagh.A total of seven signs will be erected shortly across the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area as part of the major clampdown on speeders.The move has been welcomed by a number of local councillors including Dermot Curran, Willie Clarke, Billy Walker, Gareth Sharvin and John Trainor who say that the new signs have the potential to save lives by encouraging drivers to slow down in what are heavily populated areas.Cllr Curran said that drivers regularly ignored the mph zone along a large stretch of the Strangford Road.ldquoThis area is densely populated and there are always people walking at this part of the town. A number of accidents at this location have been blamed on speeding, with residents highlighting their concerns about the issue for some considerable time, he continued.ldquoThere is a clear and obvious need for the authorities to get to grips with the speeding problem and the PCSP deserves praise for this initiative. Unfortunately, many drivers think a large part of the Strangford Road is governed by a mph limit which is not case. Residents I have spoken to about the problem say the speed of some vehicles is frightening to say the least.Cllr Curran said that were many housing developments accessed via the Strangford Road which carries a high volume of pedestrian traffic.He added: ldquoWhile welcoming the speed indicator sign, I believe there is a need to move the mph limit back beyond the former Down Council headquarters. Speeders need to slow down before someone is killed.Cllr Sharvin believes one of the real benefits of the announcement is that it has ldquokick-started and energised a conversation among the public about other hot spots for speeding.He added: ldquoI recognise that these signs are an expensive investment but, ultimately, the success of them will be measured in how the public respond to them. If we can begin to see speeds lowered across the district and lives potentially saved, the scheme will have been a success.Cllr Trainor said he hopes the new signs will raise further awareness in driversrsquo minds on the need to reduce their speed along these stretches of road.He added: ldquoWe know that the Strangford Road is a hotspot for speeding traffic and the dangers associated with this. If the new signs reduce speed and help save lives they will be worthwhile, but but road safety is everyonersquos concern.Cllr Clarke said he is ldquodelighted that one of the new signs will be placed at Newcastlersquos South Promenade which carries a huge volume of traffic.He said news of the speed indicator sign will be welcomed be residents who live at this part of the resort and the many pedestrians who walk in the area will be encouraged by the initiative.ldquoI hope that the sign will go some way towards tackling the issue of speeding at this busy part of Newcastle, he said.ldquoThis is a welcome move and something that Sinn Feacutein has been lobbying for over many years to protect residents who live at this part of the resort. The speed sign will also hopefully make South Promenade safer for pedestrians.Cllr Clarke said the PCSP is committed to improving road safety across the district and will continue to work with local communities and local police to make this happen.The Mournes councillor also welcomed the provision of a speed sign at the Dublin Road in Castlewellan which is a main link to a number of towns and villages and carries a high volume of traffic.Welcoming the presence of a new speed sign at the Shrigley Road in Killyleagh, Cllr Walker said that he hopes drivers get the message and slow down.ldquoMany people walk along this particular road and it is vital that everything is done to keep them safe. I hope that thew new sign will act as a deterrent and drivers will ease off the accelerator, he continued.He added: ldquoThe PCSP deserves credit for listening to the concerns of elected representatives and the wider public on the speeding issue. The message must go out that speeders are placing their lives and those of other road users in danger.

Even though she see the world in black and white, her eye for fine lines and designs is by no means hindered.DUNDRUM mdash Details of Dundrumrsquos millennium festival, which takes place from Saturday, August , to Saturday, August , were fine tuned last night in the final summer meeting of the village committee.Organisers of the event have urged local people to volunteer their help throughout the week to ensure that as many events go ahead as possible.Medieval banquets, childrenrsquos fun days, pigeon racing and a iety of competitions look likely to keep residents and visitors entertained throughout the week.But the committeersquos secretary, Elaine Armstrong, has warned that other events, like the glamorous granny competition, may not be given the go-aheadthere are not enough volunteers on the day.BALLYDUGAN mdash History has turned full circle for a forgotten piece of local architecture which will reopen its doors this month, this time as a place of leisure rather than labour.Over two centuries since the huge wheel at Ballydugan Mill began turning, the gates will open on one of Northern Irelandrsquos most innovative projects.The seven floor pound, complex includes a restaurant, cafe, hotel, banquet hall and historical exhibition, all set within the arearsquos most impressive countryside.It is the brainchild of Noel Killen, a local contractor renowned for his love of traditional Irish buildings, who bought the deserted giant  years ago with the dream of restoring it to its former majesty.According to Noel, the old mill will become just the second venue in Northern Ireland to host traditional medieval banquets in which will be a wholly unique setting.PORTAFERRY mdash A local Assembly member has expressed his disgust after a stretch of shoreline in Portaferry was polluted with oil last week.Alliance member Kieran McCarthy was speaking following the oil leak which occurred on a stretch of foreshore between the Saltpans and Cook Street last Thursday evening.ldquoStrangford Lough is our most precious asset, indeed, it is regarded as Northern Irelandrsquos special area and everything must be done to ensure that the lough and its environs are protected,rsquorsquo he said.ldquoIt would appear that the oil leakage may have come from the land side of the Lough and found its way on to the foreshore via a large surface water pipe.rsquorsquoGOLF mdash Seamus Agnew motored to victory in Clement Milliganrsquos Captainrsquos Day at Ardglass Golf Club on Saturday.The  handicapper shot the round of his le for  points to pip Stephen McDowell, last yearrsquos winner, on a better back nine..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th July 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Heritage railway hopes for £40%2C000 funding  ","story":"THE Downpatrick and Co Down Railway has launched an urgent appeal to raise pound, amid warnings that it could remain closed for the rest of the year.Officials at the award-winning heritage railway mdash which has been hit hard by coronavirus restrictions mdash say the cash is needed to help it get back on track and hope people will weigh in with support for the new fighting fund.A recent bid for financial support from the Department of Communitiesrsquo Covid- Charities Fund to cover costs racked up to maintain the business which has been mothballed due to lockdown restrictions failed.Railway officials said the bid lodged for financial support was submitted on a Friday and rejected the following Monday, much to their disappointment.And while Stormont finance minister Conor Murphy last week announced details of a poundm fund for business start-ups and tourist attraction investment, the local railway, which enjoyed a record number of visitors last year, fears that none of the cash will trickle down to help it.Railway officials say that the arts and heritage sector has been badly hit by the global pandemic and fears that unlike some other attractions, it may not be able to open for business in a few weeksrsquo time.Heritage railway chairman, Robert Gardiner, has written an open letter highlighting the organisationrsquos plight and its ldquoreluctant need to ask for help in the current financial climate. He said coronavirus restrictions have had a ldquodevastating impact on the railwayrsquos operations and its restoration work and needs financial help.Mr Gardiner also said the railway is likely to remain closed for the remainder of the year due to the restrictions around Covid- and the specic challenges the organisation faces with its trains, infrastructure and operations.ldquoWith no income for the rest of the year, we will face major challenges keeping the railway maintained and ensuring our vital work on our carriages, locomotives, track and stations can continue, he explained.ldquoOur final attempts at securing Covid- support funding from Stormont have failed, so now we reluctantly must turn to our members and supporters to ask for help. We need to raise at least pound, this year just to keep the railway in a good condition and make some progress with essential projects.Mr Gardiner said he could not see now to resume train operations this year in a way that will be safe and, at the same time, not compound the organisationrsquos financial situation by operating trains at a loss.Mr Gardiner said the railway supported the governmentrsquos call for a total lockdown of activities in the fight against Covid-.Even so, he said the lockdown had a ldquomassive hit hit on the railwayrsquos finances, leaving it struggling to keep ready to reopen when it is safe to do so.ldquoWe have just under pound, of bills to pay this year in essential, unavoidable costs alone, to keep the business in mothballs, Mr Gardiner revealed.ldquoWe have been paying these through our savings which were built up over the past few years but were meant for long-awaited essential maintenance, critical repair and restoration work to safeguard the railwayrsquos long term future.ldquoWe have watched as heritage railways across the UK and Ireland launched fundraising campaigns but, at a time when people were worried about basics such as paying their bills, buying groceries and had worries about their jobs and the health of their families, we felt that it just wasnrsquot right to ask for money for a steam railway, so we tried many other avenues of funding.ldquoOur final hope for funding from Stormont was an application for pound, to the Covid- Charities Fund to cover the day-to-day essential costs we have already accrued to date, but we learnt within days of the application being made that it had been rejected.ldquoThis was our last chance with the government schemes as we did not qualy for funding under either the pound, or pound, business support schemes, designed specically for the tourism and hospitality industry as our rateable value was pound, over the pound, threshold. We were also not eligible for the Micro Business Hardship Fund, the Sports and Clubs or voluntary and community sector hardship funds.The chairman continued: ldquoIn short, we have been rejected for support every time because we were too small, too large, or missing a financial threshold by only a few pounds.ldquoSometimes we miss out because we have a small cash reserve for those vital projects, a reserve which is also made up of legacy donations from benefactors who have passed away and wished their donations to go to landmark projects rather than pay day-to-day bills.Mr Gardiner said the heritage railwayrsquos only public funding was what he described as a ldquomodest grant from Newry, Mourne and Down Council and that a question mark hung over this yearrsquos funding.He added: ldquoWe must thank those MLAs, councillors and public representatives who have lobbied and argued our case, even mentioning us in correspondence with NI Executive ministers as an example of an organisation that appears to have fallen through the cracks.ldquoMany of us within the Downpatrick and Co Down Railway feel deep disappointment and frustration, as it feels like every door we try to open is either locked or closed on us. It also feels like, as a business, we are being penalised for good financial governance.Anyone interested in making a financial donation is asked to visit the heritage railwayrsquos website..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th July 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Hopes for restoration of Shrigley clock for its 150th anniversary  ","story":"DETAILS of fresh efforts to restore a historic clock which was once the centrepiece of village le in Shrigley have been unveiled.The iconic Martin Memorial clock, which had its bell and interior mechanism removed over three decades ago and placed in storage, celebrates its th anniversary next year.To mark the occasion, Rowallane councillor Terry Andrews is hoping that Newry, Mourne and Down Council and the Housing Executive will join forces to help put the tick back in the famous clock.He says it is sad to see the historic landmark falling into disrepair and hopes efforts to restore it will be successful to preserve it for generations to come.Designed in  by Timothy Hevey, the clock is constructed of brown stone in three layers, with the base surrounded by iron railings. Originally, there was an elaborate lamp at each corner and also a drinking fountain.While there have been ious meetings over many years to discuss the restoration of the clock, nothing ever happened, something Cllr Andrews hopes that he can help put right.He says while money is tight for many organisations which had to deal with the coronavirus pandemic, he hopes the local council and housing officials will commit to helping restore the famous clock to provide a reminder to current generations of Shrigleyrsquos industrial past.The village was founded by the Martin family, who came from Pott Shrigley in Cheshire in  and who owned the spinning factory in the village.It was powered by water from the nearby Clea Lough and while the mill has long gone mdash it is reported to have employed  people at one time mdash the clock tower erected by the people of Shrigley in  in honour of the Martin family remains.Cllr Andrews believes that residents in Shrigley, Killyleagh and further afield would like to see the clock restored to its former glory and hopes he can secure agreement in principle for this to happen.ldquoWe canrsquot allow the clock to deteriorate further, he declared. ldquoIt is an integral part of Shrigleyrsquos history and it must be preserved.ldquoIn the past it was suggested that a community garden could be developed alongside the clock and perhaps that is something worth pursuing.ldquoI think it is incumbent upon those who can help restore the clock to step forward and perhaps the restoration project is something that the Department for Communities could also lend its support to, given the clockrsquos historic link with the former mill located nearby.Cllr Andrews said that identying funds to finance any restoration work was vital in moving forward, also highlighting the need for an agreed plan to maintain the clock.ldquoThe Martin Memorial clock is at the heart of Shrigleyrsquos history and culture and it must not be lost. It must be preserved and those who can help achieve this must come forward, he continued.ldquoGiven its history, a restored clock could become an attraction for visitors and people researching the arearsquos past.ldquoI hope that I can help harness interest and willingness in number of agencies to weigh in behind a successful regeneration project in the heart of Shrigley. Such a project will have the support of everyone..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th July 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Kevin making waves in music scene with debut album  ","story":"FIVE years after taking up playing the guitar for the first time at the age of , local man Kevin Young is releasing his first album.Better known as the former owner of Saints Cafe in Saintfield, Kevin has found a new way in le through his music and career in working to help people deal with unresolved emotional trauma.His debut album, Lonely Demon, has already been hailed by BBC Radio Ulster presenter Ralph McLean as a ldquogreat collection of heartfelt, emotional and honest songs.Ralph has played several of Kevinrsquos tracks already ahead of the albumrsquos release on his Local Voices show.Kevin was one of the local performers who took part in the virtual Rock Down concert recently which raised pound, for the mental health charity Downpatrick PIPS.He is fast making a name for himself on the local music scene and already has amassed some devoted fans.Like many artists trying to get funding off the ground for a new creative project, Kevin opened up a crowdfunding appeal on Kickstarter. He raised more than pound, in just six days from funders, some of the subscribers coming from as far away as Australia.Kevin says that part of his journey into music is really about understanding what would give him joy in le.He explained: ldquoI now work as a professional practitioner of compassionate inquiry after selling up the cafe. Thatrsquos really about helping people improve their emotional wellbeing and to deal with any trauma-based issues they might have.ldquoWhen I was running the cafe, I would also do business consultancy and advise people on business aspects of opening a cafe. The more I did it, the more I realised that there was a lot of emotional problems that some people had which were holding them back and thatrsquos where they really needed some help. I began to study this type of psychotherapeutic approach developed by Dr Gabor Mateacute and realised that I wanted to do more. Tapping into his innate ability to connect with people and understand them also reawakened long-held creativity in Kevin and a desire to express himself.ldquoI often tell people that itrsquos never too late to do what you really want to do and change your le, he said. ldquoIrsquove always been into music but never got involved but I decided to learn how to play guitar when I turned  as I thought thatI donrsquot do it now, I never will. I also felt that I needed to practice what I preached.Over the years, Kevin has slowly emerged as a songwriter and has written some deeply personal lyrics to his alternative folk sounding album.ldquoThe songs are about issues such as addiction, darkness, depression, loss, lost love and death. The album is quite dark in them but Irsquove been told that people really relate to the music and words and find it uplting.One of Kevinrsquos earlier tracks released was Painted Son, which was well received.His first single off Lonely Demon, called I Love Only You mdash one of the rare love songs on the album mdash was written with his we Sharon in mind, who has lent her voice on backing vocals on all the tracks.The single is now available on the music , Bandcamp.Kevin has worked with music producer, Michael Mormecha of Tree Son Studios in Hillsborough, to record the album.Kickstarter funders will receive the album in a few weeksrsquo time ahead of its general release..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th July 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Martina guides pilgrims around St Patrick’s Way  ","story":"SEVEN people with a spiritual sense of adventure arrived in Downpatrick to walk the Saint Patrick Centrersquos new initiative, St Patrickrsquos Way mdash a pilgrimage route linking the seven sites in Downpatrick associated with the patron saint.Seven is said to be Godrsquos perfect number. ldquoItrsquos a good start, I thought, as I welcomed these brave souls. ldquoGuinea pilgrims, I called them light-heartedly. It turned out it was a good deion!Our motto for the walk, lsquoBe Amazed!rsquo, was inspired by Patrickrsquos Confession in which he recounts his journey to Ireland as a fth century slave before being freed spiritually and physically by God. To be honest I was amazed all seven wanted to do the whole Downpatrick Camino in one day as, for many people, I would recommend two half days. It is not for the faint-hearted!Welcoming everyone, I pointed out the finish time was between pm and pm and the Dean of Down, the Very Rev Henry Hull, kindly turned up to bless us on our way, leading us in the pilgrim prayer, which is found in the new pilgrim passport.ldquoI arise today through Godrsquos strength to pilot me, Godrsquos might to uphold mehellipThe newly produced Pilgrim Passport was to stamped at each point along the way: Saint Patrick Centre, Inch Abbey, Saul Church, Slieve Patrick, Struell Wells, St Patrickrsquos Memorial Church, Downpatrick and St Patrickrsquos Grave.ldquoA wing and a prayer, was how one pilgrim put it.Our journey would usually begin at the Saint Patrick Centrersquos IMAX film which explores the story of Patrick but due to lockdown restrictions we skipped this part and, instead, there was a quick photo-call with the new high viz jackets, sponsored by Phoenix Gas.It was an eclectic group: the aptly-named Hillary who had climbed Tanzaniarsquos Kilimanjaro and another, a journalist, who planned to write about the Way a mother and son with strong links to Downpatrick a married couple, Jim and Marion, from Belfast, who were around retirement age and had walked the Camino de Santiago in Spain and finally their friend, Colette, a casual walker blessed with great faith, a sharp wit and, I recall, a fancy gadget that calculated distance.We set out, climbing St Patrickrsquos Staircase and were headed towards Down Museum when a pilgrim asked me about the building behind us.That panicky feeling from school days when my teacher asked an unexpected question began to rise. My credibility as a guide was at stake. Thankfully I had looked up the school out of curiosity the night before. ldquoOh yes, that school was built about  years ago by the Southwell familyhellipIt seemed to get easier after that as we walked towards the Mound of Down to hear about John de Courcy before marching through the fields towards Inch. We would have to take the Belfast Road, as my dream of having a bridge, or a boat, to cross the Quoile was still a dream.At least the grass was freshly cut and the weather was dry. The Lord was good to us.During the tour at Inch Abbey we met a local man, Roger, who kindly pointed out some little known facts and features including the early ldquospa hot-tub where the monkrsquos infirmary had once stood on the banks of the Quoile.After a break, we set off for the banks of the Quoile River and Saul Hill, the group happily chatting to one another after a lockdown of three and a half months. The Quoile is a gentle part of the walk and as the river flowed, ducklings were paddling behind their mother, like pilgrims on the Way.The Mearne Road was a bit more challenging as the way got steeper but we knew Patrick himself had made this climb on his route to founding the first church on the island. Before long we could see the round tower and had made it in good time, around :pm. A trinity was there to greet us mdash the Centre Director Dr Tim Campbell, pilgrim guide Elaine Kelly and the Dean of Down, who recounted the history of Saul Church.When we arrived at The Barn at Saul, just yards away, we were all ready for the pilgrim welcome, the pilgrim washroom and the pilgrim lunch mdash soup and sandwiches, tea and coffee with carefully observed social distancing.They were a happy bunch as I bade them farewell and offered a lt back to anyone who wanted it. But all agreed they wanted to continue with Elaine to Slieve Patrick and then on to Struell Wells via the Lecale path, what I had dubbed the Way of Tranquility until I fell flat on my face in the mud, going over a stile the week before.Hours later, back at the centre, we waited for the pilgrims to . Around pm a message came through that the mother and son had to leave for an appointment and one of the walkers had hit her wall just before the ancient ones at Struell Wells. I put the kettle on and was relieved to see Colette, the walker from Ballymurphy, coming towards the centre, half an hour later.She was exhausted but in good humour as she regaled us with her observations, including the need for a toilet at Struell Wells. ldquoPilgrimrsquos Pain, she declared, and jokedthat she had less suffering during the Troubles in Ballymurphy.Slumped in her chair with her tea at the St Patrickrsquos Centre, having completed % of the walk, she insisted that the Way was way more than  miles . She referred to a fancy gadget ndash which actually turned out to be accurate. Our five-mile estimate for the morning was closer to six miles and the afternoon closer to ten. So a sweet  miles altogether. What would the other pilgrims say when they got back Like an expectant mother and father, Dr Tim Campbell and I waited. I was looking at my watch and nervously flicking at the kettle switch until we caught the reflection of the high-vis jackets in one of the shop windows. Teas were hurried made as the pilgrims, led by Elaine, looking like Rocky Balboa, triumphantly made their way towards the centre.ldquoIt was an amazing experience, declared the journalist who later said he had the energy to walk his love and woke up feeling refreshed. He loved it! Hillaryrsquos boots which had mounted Kilimanjaro started to fall apart on Slieve Patrick but she was rejoicing.The husband and we team from Belfast  ldquoAstounding, exclaimed Marion, joyfully, exhausted but glad to have made it. ldquoYou just need to tell people itrsquos longer, said her husband, Jim.The next dayrsquos pilgrimage, with a few adjustments, had everyone back at .pm.And Elaine and I received some lovely messages including one from Colette, graciously thanking us. ldquoWalking with you on St Patrickrsquos Way. It was an experience I wouldnrsquot have missed.We have  fully booked for July . Thank God! I was afraid I would have to move to Bangor to promote Columbanus.Martina Purdy, a former BBC correspondent and Adoration Sister, is now a pilgrim guide and public relations consultant for the St Patrick Centre..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th July 2020 Murlough.jpg","title":"Ruairi signs deal with The Ports  ","story":"CASTLEWELLAN striker Ruairi Croskery has signed for newly promoted Dankse Bank Premiership side Portadown.The  year-old has signed a two year contract at Shamrock Park ahead of the - season.Croskery spent four years at Manchester United and featured in the same Un- squad as current first team stars Marcus Rashford and Scott McTominay.After his spell at Old Trafford he ed back to Northern Ireland to sign for Linfield.

risk to their staff and to the customers who visit their stores.ldquoOur focus continues to be on the health risks of the outbreak, but we can now begin to cautiously focus much more squarely on the wider economic and societal impact the virus is having.ldquoWe have provided a huge amount of support to businesses and jobs as they hibernated during the pandemic ndash now we start to take these

These include:Communication of health information, and how effective it isCultural issues relating to the suitability of health and social services for BAME communitiesIncome and employment insecurity, which is experienced disproportionately by BAME communitiesPoor quality of ethnicity data, which is preventing accurate analysisHousing overcrowding and environmentThe financial burden created by migration statusThe role of structural and systemic racism and disadvantage.The report is by the BAME Covid- expert advisory group, set up by First Minister Mark Drakeford to look at the reasons why people from BAME communities were more likely to be adversely affected by coronavirus.:One of its two sub-groups was tasked with examining the socio-economic factors, chaired by Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna, professor of management and organization at Cardf Business School, Cardf University.\"Therersquos an overall theme running through our research for this report. It centres on long-standing racism and disadvantage, and the lack of BAME representation within decision-making processes,\" said Professor Ogbonna, who is also a trustee and vice-chair of Race Council Wales.ldquoThe coronavirus pandemic is, in some respects, revealing the consequences of a lack of action on race equality.ldquoMany of the issues wersquove highlighted have been identied and discussed previously, but they havenrsquot been addressed in any systematic and sustained way.Analysis of Covid- related deaths across England and Wales by ethnicity showed that people from a black ethnic background are at a greater risk of death involving COVID- than all other ethnic groups.The Office for National Statistics study showe that the risk for black males has been more than three times higher than white males, and nearly two-and-a-half times higher for black females than white.Adjusting for socio-economic factors and geographical location partly explains the increased risk, but there remains twice the risk for black males and around one-and-a-half times for black females. Signicant dferences also remain for Bangladeshi, Pakistani and Indian men. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

would not have the buffer we have now.\"Itrsquos fortuitous that at that time I resisted, because I didnrsquot want to be in a position where we would not have finances available to respond to an emergency.\"I didnrsquot know that the coronavirus was going to hit us, but clearly it is having an effect.\"Wersquore not collecting business rates because wersquove given lots of businesses a

an impact on us in terms of the ability to collect rents and council tax.\"Exactly what that impact will be is unclear.ldquoDespite that, we are continuing to run services, as far as possible and we have seen a massive increase in areas such as recycling and waste.The other area of increased spending is in social services, which normally spends around  per cent of our budget.\"That is going to go up dramatically because people are getting frailer and succumbing to covid- and we are also supporting people in care homes and providing PPE for our staff and the care homes.Overall the virus is

I would like to thank and acknowledge the hard work of the organisers of many of today’s events and those within local communities who contributed to this largely successful day.“I would also like to thank my officers and staff who have worked tirelessly and will continue to do so throughout the night to keep our communities safe.“I would ask everyone, particularly those with influence, to continue to work with us to ensure that the rest of this holiday period can be enjoyed in peace and safety.”Roger Gardiner, Orange grand secretary for Co Armagh, welcomed the PSNI acknowledgement of the efforts made to keep within the guidelines.“We did not expect anything dferent,” he said. “The only real events held by the Orange on Monday were really just a few members laying wreaths at war memorials across the Province. In Co Armagh we held a small outdoor event with less than  members who were all socially distanced.”The Co Armagh event took place at the Museum of Orange Heritage, Sloan’s House, Loughgall, on Monday afternoon.TUV leader Jim Allister also praised the handling of the Twelfth.“Many eyes were on the unionist community on Monday, ready to grasp any real or perceived breach of the regulations,” he said.“The reality is that they were left scrabbling around desperate to find something to complain about as the vast, vast majority heeded the Orange advice to have a Twelfth at home and celebrate responsibly.“The institution has provided tremendous leadership on this and I am delighted that the unionist community has responded so well. “Cancelling what is unquestionably one of the largest cultural events in Europe and foregoing generations of tradition was a big sacrice which deserves much wider recognition than it has received to date and stands in stark contrast to the actions of others in recent days. “While Stormont can no longer even give press conferences about the pandemic because the joint head of government blatantly broke her own guidance to honour a terrorist, there is no need for any Orange leaders to go into hiding.

We need to remain vigilant and continue to play our part in controlling the virus to protect ourselves and others. “As restrictions on our movement are eased, the safety of passengers and staff remains my priority.The evidence suggests that you can reduce the risk of spreading the virus by wearing a face covering. That is why, with the support of my Executive colleagues and the unions, I am announcing that face coverings will be mandatory on public transport, from Friday July th. “The requirement will apply to passengers and also staff in public areas who are not protected by a screen. However, there will be exemptions for those who are not able to wear a face covering for specic health and medical reasons.” A face covering is a covering of any type which covers a person’s nose and mouth it does not have to be a surgical face mask. While face coverings can offer protection to others, they are not a substitute for other protective measures and it is important that people continue to follow social distancing and wash or sanitise hands regularly. Minister Mallon continued: “We are asking you to take personal responsibility and do the right thing to protect the health and well-being of others. The fact of the matter is you can spread the virus to other more vulnerable people without even knowing you have it. By wearing a face covering you are showing your support and consideration for other passengers and staff. “It is important to be aware that wearing face coverings will not be suitable for all members of the public and we need to be sensitive to this and know that reasons for not wearing a face covering may not always be visible. “Advice will be available on nidirect and social media channels. Translink staffwill begin preparing commuters for the requirement to wear face coverings. “It is also important that you do not get a  sense of security about the level of protection a face covering offers. They are not a substitute for social distancing or good hand hygiene. While I know many will find it challenging in the coming days and weeks to keep up compliance with the rules, I want to applaud the public for their leadership. The public have done the heavy lting and kept us all safe. You have been the leaders in Northern Ireland fighting Covid- and I am asking you to keep it up and we will beat this together. “By acting together and thinking of each other we can reduce the risk of transmission.”  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_cefdcdfcafabffbbe   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_eafbedacfdbcefb   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/258/172/true/GN4_DAT_3132859.jpg--.jpg?1589969356000\\","title":"castlederg security alert ends ","story":"A security alert at Millbrook Gardens in Castlederg has ended, and a suspicious object which was examined at the scene, declared a hoax.
